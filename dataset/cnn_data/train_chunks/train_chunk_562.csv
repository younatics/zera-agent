Kaela Humphries, 29, who lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is a former competitive swimmer who signed to New York modelling agency Ford+ after hanging up her goggles. Kaela, who was a bridesmaid at Kim and NBA star Kris' wedding in August 2011, has spoken previously about how she had to give her diet a complete overhaul in order to lose the 40lbs she gained after quitting swimming.

At the time she told People magazine: 'You are sort of used to living and eating a certain way, and then you are like, ""Oh my God, I can't eat ten meals a day and 10,000 calories anymore.

It should have been more of a priority earlier. But it's hard when you have a full-time job in the real world and it's not your job to be in shape. She said she didn't know there was such a thing as plus-size modelling, until a photographer saw her picture and told her she has 'pretty eyes', so she decided to give it a go.

Temporarily, at least. But if you're really serious about your partner and don't think 12 flowers is enough to demonstrate your love, then one extreme gifting company might just have the answer. Luxury website veryfirstto.com is offering one dedicated romantic the opportunity to fill their beloved's garden with a sweet-smelling blanket of some 1.2 million rose petals, for the coronary-inducing cost of £70,000. Roses are red: Your beloved could wake up to a garden blanketed with rose petals this 14 February - if you find a spare £70,000 knocking about behind the sofa . Your sweetheart would wake up on 14 February surrounded by a sea of rosy petals, as the company will scatter the flowery bulk in both front and back gardens, with a surface area of up to 600 sq ft. The daring endeavour will be executed surreptitiously with the help of floral company Petals and Roses, whose Production Director Philip Davies said: 'This is the most ambitious and romantic project we have ever undertaken. She must be a very special woman.' Marcel Knobil, brand expert and founder of veryfirstto.com, says: 'We are thrilled to help ensure that an exceptionally lucky woman wakes up to a dream vision. 'Veryfirstto.com is dedicated to enabling individuals to be the first to have newly launching luxury products and experiences, you don't get much more luxurious than this'. Petal carpet: What could be more romantic than a garden scattered with 1.2 million rose petals? A garden scattered with 1.2 million chocolates? Mmm... The cost of the big petal-drop will be adjusted according to garden size. Our advice is to think ahead and furnish your loved-one with a rake, should you choose to invest in the experience. And perhaps offer to lead the clean-up come 17 February. After all, there is precious little less romantic than 1.2 million decomposing rose petals rotting away in one's garden just as the weather begins to warm up. Other romantic gift ideas featured on the site are the opportunity to propose to your partner via a 30-second television commercial to be screened on national TV on Valentine's Day (£135,000), a Dolce & Gabbana diamond print tie (£120) and exclusive seats on the private Lynx II space shuttle (approximately £67,000 and available to Gold Members only).

Barbie's bodily dimensions might suggest she seldom eats, but that doesn't mean her fans don't get peckish once in a while. And now the 54-year-old doll's most ardent admirers have somewhere really special to sate their rumbling tummies: Taiwan's newly opened Barbie Cafe. The hot-pink diner licensed by Mattel - the US toy-maker who created Barbie, Ken and all their plastic pals - has opened its garish doors in Taipei, the capital city of Taiwan and the place where Barbies were originally manufactured until production was relocated to China in the 1960s for financial reasons. Scroll down for video . Fancy a bite? A waitress holds up a menu during the opening ceremony of a Barbie-themed restaurant in Taipei . The 600sq metre cafe - which sells . Barbie-themed food and drink including macaroons, iced biscuits, sundaes . and cakes - is located in the shopping district of Taipei. Its interior is heaped with hot-pink sofas, . neon pink tables shaped like stilleto heels, chairs decorated with fuzzy . pink tutus and red corsets and illustrations of Barbie herself in a number of different outfits. Staff wear bright pink Barbie logo . T-shirts, pink tutus, Barbie armbands and sparkly tiaras. Mattel's aim is for the dolly-themed eatery to boost the Barbie label as a fashion brand. Similar versions of the waitresses' uniforms are available on the Mattel website, and lines even include tutus for toddlers. Think pink: Staff at the restaurant wear bright pink Barbie T-shirts, Barbie sticker armbands and stick-on face gems . Sticky and sweet: A Barbie-themed cake, left, and a plate of garish macaroons and Barbie dessert buns, right . Iggy Yip, a senior manager at Mattel's Greater China division, said: 'We picked Taiwan because theme restaurants are very popular and successful here. 'We are very confident that the Barbie Cafe can promote our brand image.' It is hoped the café will attract Barbie fans from China, Hong Kong and Japan. Taiwan used to manufacture the Barbie dolls until the 1980s, when Mattel moved its production lines to China. Hot pink palace: Illustrations of Barbie deck the walls at the cafe, and the dining chairs are all made to look like ballerinas with red corsets and pink tutus . Ballet Barbie: Chairs in the Barbie restaurant have red corset backs and fuzzy pink tutus . Local office worker Jessica Ho, who has a five-year-old daughter, approved of the new diner. She said: 'My child and I both love Barbie and this lovely and cute place is like a dream come true for us. I will take her here to celebrate her next birthday.' But Rhiannon Williams, editor of feminist website The Vagenda Magazine, told the Telegraph: 'I cannot imagine anything less pleasant and more nausea-inducing than a Barbie themed restaurant. 'Not only because I prefer low-impact environments and none of the major food groups are pink for a reason, but also because Barbie is an outdated model of stereotypical femininity and needs to die a death.' Mattel launched a Barbie concept store and eatery in China in 2009 when it celebrated the doll's 50th birthday, but it was closed down after two years after failing to get off the ground.

Preparing to fight the Taliban together is not, perhaps, the most conventional start to married life. But then Corporal Benham Cook, 26, and his Lance Corporal wife Sara, 23, from Blurton, Staffordshire, met through the Territorial Army's 123 Ammunition Squadron in Stoke-on-Trent three years ago. So they always knew it was a possibility. Though perhaps even they didn't think their deployment to Afghanistan would come so soon - one year after getting married. Happy anniversary! Sara and Benham think they are luckier than most soldiers who have to leave their civilian partners at home . In sickness and in health: Sara and Benham Cook, from Blurton, Staffordshire, will spend the first half of 2013 on the Helmand Province front line with a group of 25 soldiers from the 159 Supply Regiment . The couple, who married on 28 January last year, are celebrating their first wedding anniversary together by starting . military training ahead of being sent to . Afghanistan for a six-month tour of Helmand Province in March. So instead of settling into their . second year of married life with gravy boats and plans for babies, the . Cooks will spend the first half of 2013 fighting the Taliban with a . group of 25 soldiers from the 159 Supply Regiment - who are helping . regular troops in an effort to drive out insurgents. They are currently training for their upcoming mission which will involve supplying ammunition and equipment to front line troops. And despite being posted to Camp Bastion together, Benham and Sara are likely to be given separate duties, meaning the will only see each other at evening meals. Sara, who graduated from Keele University in 2011, joined the Army on the advice of her brother Nathan, who is also a Lance Corporal and served in Afghanistan. The Cookies: The couple, who married on 28 January last year, have been nicknamed 'The Cookies' by their TA colleagues . Happily ever after: Sara and Benham Cook on their wedding day in January 2012, just one year before they began training in preparation for being deployed together to Afghanistan . Married life: Rather than spending their first anniversary having a romantic meal, Sara and Benham Cook will be training for an upcoming six-month tour of Helmand Province . Sara, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'I'm really excited, as well as a little nervous. This is what we train for and, as a soldier, I think it's something you have to experience. 'Although being in the TA means we don't see each other as much as we like, I actually think it has brought us closer together - it's a passion for both of us. 'My family are very supportive, but a bit worried, so it's comforting to them that my husband will be out there to look out for me. 'We are luckier than most in that we will be together during our training but if we are separated out there, it could be difficult, especially if one of us goes outside the wire. 'That said though, at least we will know what the other one is thinking and I imagine it will be easier than waiting at home.' Happy days: Lieutenant Colonel Colin Francis, who selected the couple for the tour, said 'they are both excellent soldiers' and 'make a brilliant team' Husband Benham, who is in his eighth year with the TA and served in Iraq in 2007, added: 'I joined because I saw the red sign for the TA Centre while driving through the streets and wondered what it was all about. 'This is my second major deployment and I can't wait, to be honest. This is what I joined the Army for. 'I can't wait to get out there. Being in a relationship with someone in the Army has obvious difficulties, but when you're both in the Army, it brings an entirely new set of problems. 'It would almost be easier for me if Sara was at home so I would know she was safe, especially if one of us has to go outside the wire. 'Having said that, at least I know I'm close enough to get to get to her if something bad should happen and we’ll see each other for short periods of time. 'We do have a bit of banter, but we're like a big family and everyone has been very supportive.' The couple have been nicknamed The Cookies by their TA colleagues. Lieutenant Colonel Colin Francis, who selected the couple for the tour, said: 'I've watched them get to know each other over the years. 'They make a brilliant team. They are both excellent soldiers and will serve us well in Afghanistan.'

Eye on the prize: This greyhound's steely gaze is fixed firmly on the hare which is giving him a right old run around . This hare gave these greyhounds a right old run around at a coursing event in Ireland. The muzzled dogs were more than happy to give chase, but as these pictures show, the quick-wits and lightning reflexes of the hare appeared to keep him away from danger. The dogs have a determined look in their eyes as they chase the hare down, but he appears to be just too speedy for them. In one picture the dog's steely gaze is fixed firmly on the hare, who is trying his best to stay at least one step ahead of the pursuing canine. Elsewhere the dogs appear to have caught up with the hare, but he still seems to escape their clutches unscathed. The action came from the first day of the JP McManus Irish Cup coursing event at County Limerick Coursing Club on Friday. The annual meeting sees greyhounds course hares, with an 80,000 Euro first prize at stake, on Limerick Racecourse, at Greenmount, Patrickswell. Hare coursing has been illegal throughout the UK since 2005, but continues in other countries as a regulated and judged competitive sport, particularly in Ireland and Spain. Coursing is a long-established technique for hunting which grew in Europe during the 19th century. It has experienced a decline in more recent years, in part due to the rise of greyhound racing and betting. Controversy has developed around the sport in recent decades, with some opposers viewing it as a cruel bloodsport.

This is the 'mummy's boy' deemed too fat to be a suicide bomber who wanted to kill thousands of people in a UK terror attack worse than 7/7. 'Big' Irfan Naseer, 31, is facing life imprisonment after being convicted of planning the biggest terrorist atrocity the UK has faced in generations. The 23-stone chemist, who plotted to plant eight rucksack nail bombs in crowded places around the country and was the ringleader of a gang who wanted to turn Britain into 'a war zone'. Scroll down for video . Mummy's boy: Pictured when he was younger, Irfan Naseer was branded a class joker - but years later plotted evil attacks on the UK . But behind his fanaticism, his own mother called him a 'mummy's boy' and his school friends branded him a 'joker' and 'idiot' as he tried to entertain them in the playground by rapping. Nicknamed 'Chubbs' at school, one ex-classmate,told The Daily Mirror: 'He used to write his own rap music and perform it to us. It had us in stitches. He was the class idiot.' Another former friend told the Daily Mirror: 'In about 2008 or 2009 he cut all ties with his old school friends. Irfan Naseer, nicknamed 'Chubbs' began plotting bombing attacks across the UK . 'Never in a million years did we think he could be responsible for such an evil plan.' He was one of the 'four lions' gang and it was bulky frame that helped him to work on his bomb-making skills while at training camps in Pakistan. He was too overweight to go on physical training exercises, and admitted he was mixing chemicals rather than 'running up and down the mountains with weapons'. Naseer gained an A at A Level chemistry, and honed his skills during a four year pharmaceuticals course at Aston University in Birmingham, coming out with a 2:2 degree in 2003. He barely worked afterwards and spent his time showing his fellow terrorists how to make a bomb out of sports injury treatments. His fascination for science first began during experiments at school while studying for GCSE chemistry classes, when the teacher showed him how to distil chemicals with a Bunsen burner. 'When I was doing my GCSEs, one of the teachers did an experiment where he had a Bunsen burner and he threw a chemical on to the fire', he told the court. 'It caused a massive flame which blackened the roof, and that kind of got me into it.' After a raid on the group's headquarters in Birmingham, Naseer had chemistry textbooks left over from his university days on his book shelves in his bedroom, mixed in with a Jihadi flag and terrorist handbooks. Ashik Ali and Irfan Khalid were found guilty of planning a string of bombings that prosecutors said could have been deadlier than the July 7 attacks in London . He had also searched repeatedly online for bomb making tips and details of how to concoct homemade explosives. Among his Internet search history was a website containing the Anarchist's Cookbook. Big Irfan admitted in court he had spent eight-and-a-half years memorising the Koran, from the age of 19. He wanted to treat himself to a quad bike in the run up to his martyrdom and was overheard telling his fellow plotters: 'It's good fun, yeah, but I wouldn't do it on the road - that's not befitting, bro. Irfan Khalid and Irfan Naseer (right) were 'central figures' in a terrorist bomb plot they planned to inflict across the UK . The trio funded the plot by pretending to be Muslim Aid charity street collectors . It was Naseer's bulky frame that helped him to work on his bomb-making skills while at training camps in Pakistan . Charity funded terror: The men posed as fundraisers for a Muslim charity (left) then used the cash to pay for bomb devices such as this alarm clock (right) 'A guy with a beard and that sitting on top of that doesn't look good.' Irfan Naseer, 31, Irfan Khalid, 27, and Ashik Ali, 27, all from Birmingham, were convicted on Thursday of plotting the 'spectacular campaign' designed to claim as many lives as the 2005 London Underground bombs that killed 52 innocent people . The trio, who met at school and called themselves the Four Lions after the black comedy film by Chris Morris, even funded the plot by pretending to be Muslim Aid charity street collectors. Police received no intelligence from the Muslim community in Birmingham about the terror cell, even after relatives of four of the gang discovered they had travelled to Pakistan. The only time police were contacted about any of them was over an allegation of aggressive fundraising, concerning their charity street collections. The lack of information raises questions over Prevent, the Home Office’s strategy to combat violent extremism, which has police community engagement at its core. Detective Inspector Adam Gough, senior investigating officer in the West Midlands Counter-Terrorism Unit, said the extended families of Ishaaq Hussain, Shahid Khan, Khobaib Hussain and Naweed Ali ‘became aware’ the men had gone to a terror training camp when Khan called home. Although the families immediately pressured them into returning, none contacted police. Police and security services were aware the four were travelling, and they had been recorded talking about getting their families into paradise through their martyrdom. But officers decided against stopping them at that time to preserve the surveillance operation. According to detectives, none of the men received any terror training as they left the camps after a day. Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale said that while the ‘ideal’ scenario would have been for the relatives to inform police of what had happened, the families had ‘tried to do their best to bring them back and stop them from getting into harm’.","Irfan Naseer's own mother called him a 'mummy's boy'

The divorced father-of-one savagely . beat and strangled the 23-year-old on a beach on the holiday island of . Gran Canaria after finding text messages from an ex-boyfriend on her . phone, the court heard. Throttled: Sarah Shields (right) was beaten and strangled by her jealous boyfriend Christopher Chittock (left) on holidays before he flew back to Britain alone . The 38-year-old then dumped her naked body in the sea, which was found floating in the water the following morning. Chittock had denied murder and . claimed that Ms Shields had left him for another British holidaymaker . called Jason before she died. His fit of jealousy on July 6 2010 . began after he discovered messages exchanged between Ms Shields and . ex-boyfriend William Newham, the jury heard. Calling her a 'w****', he punched her . repeatedly in the bedroom of the holiday apartment where they were . staying in the popular resort of Mogan. He then dragged her in the dark to a . deserted beach, punched her to the ground, banged her head against a . rock and strangled her to death.

On trial: Chris Chittock, 38, denied murdering Sarah Shields but was arrested just days after he flew back after killing her . In a desperate attempt to cover up his crime, he kept his girlfriend's phone and sent texts to her family pretending to be her.

He said: ‘I was sat about a metre away . from him in the restaurant at the apartments and clearly saw nail . scratches on the left side of his face by his chin and another mark on . his eye. ‘It looked to me as if he had been a fight. It was the day after the body that turned out to be Sarah's was found. ‘I'd seen the body floating in the sea near our apartment the previous morning after being woken up by my girlfriend. Denial: Accused Chris Chittock was shown evidence by the court clerk during the trial . ‘It was moving from right to left in . the water. At first I thought I saw the legs moving but then realized it . was just the waves.’ A European Arrest Warrant was issued and he was arrested three days after . returning alone to their home at the end of their . two-week holiday. Chittock denied murder and claimed he . last saw Sarah, a Katie Price fan who dreamed of becoming a lingerie . model, when she left him for a mystery man called Jason she met on . holiday the week before she was found dead. Her ex-boyfriend William Newham told . the jury of four men and five women trying Chittock at Las Palmas . Provincial Court he had exchanged intimate text messages with Sarah . after they split in 2007. She sent him one message from Gran .

Mr Newham said a message he received . from Sarah's phone the day after she was found dead when Chittock was . allegedly sending her friends and family fake texts, read: ‘Leave me . alone, I'm happy now, I've moved on.’ Fighting back tears, he told the court: ‘I thought the way the text message was worded was odd. ‘The grammar and spelling didn't seem like the normal message Sarah would send. ‘I subsequently took a call from .

Tragic: Former catholic school head boy Edward Thornber was found hanged on September 15, 2011, after being caught smoking cannabis in Cornwall . The former head boy of a Catholic High School killed himself after he was summoned to court for possessing cannabis worth 50p, an inquest heard. Teenage lacrosse star killed boy Edward Thornber was found hanged on September 15, 2011, after being caught smoking the drug in Cornwall. Two days earlier, the 17-year-old from Didsbury, Greater Manchester, had received an order to appear in court - but a law firm acting on behalf of his family say the teenager should have only been given a warning. A student at Loreto College in Hulme, Edward had been head boy at The Barlow RC High School in Didsbury and was hoping to coach lacrosse in America before going to university. However, he had been caught smoking cannabis with a friend earlier that summer while on holiday in Newquay. It was the second time he had been caught with the drug. At the town's police station, he agreed to accept a 'final warning', which he believed would not result in him having a criminal record - or jeopardise his chances of pursuing a lacrosse career in the US. However, his family's solicitor at law firm Pannone LLP says Devon and Cornwall Police made a series of errors following his arrest. Among them included the details of Edward's case being put in a blue file instead of a pink youth file - resulting in the matter being processed wrongly and a court summons issued. Star pupil: The 17-year-old  was a student at Loreto College in Hulme . was hoping to coach lacrosse in America before going to university . A spokesman for Pannone said: 'All in all there were at least seven opportunities to spot and rectify the error that were missed. 'An internal report by the force has recommended a number of significant changes to procedures.' The tragic student was found with cannabis worth just 50p (file picture) It is thought on the day Edward died, he . first went to Manchester city centre before heading to Didsbury park, . where he hanged himself. His body was discovered by a jogger. According to reports, a note to his parents, the summons notice and the court notice were found near his body. Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows, who recorded a verdict of suicide at Edward's inquest on Friday, did not link the police errors directly with the youngster's death. However, he acknowledged that Devon and Cornwall Police had since introduced procedural changes as a direct result of Edward's case. Mr Meadows has also since written a letter to the Home Office alerting them to the potential dangers in issuing youth summons. Edward's parents, Ann and Adrian Thornber, say they have been devastated by their loss, but were grateful their son's inquest looked in to the reasons why errors occurred in the handling of his case. Mrs Thornber, who told the hearing neither she nor her husband knew about their son's summons, said: 'We want to ensure the failings in procedure that we believe ultimately led to our son's death do not happen again and lead to another tragedy.'","Edward Thornber, found hanged in a park in September last year .

Lazio are facing the prospect of playing a home Europa League tie behind closed doors after UEFA charged their supporters with offences of a racist nature for the fourth time this season. European football's governing body confirmed today they have charged the Rome club for the 'racist behaviour' of their fans during last Thursday's 2-0 win over Borussia Monchengladbach as well as the 'throwing of missiles and or fireworks' and 'insufficient organisation'. Lazio fans were found guilty of similar racist offences in the home and away ties against Tottenham and the game with Maribor. Punishment: Lazio could be forced to play their next Europa League game behind closed doors . Following the game in Slovenia, UEFA suspended a sanction of playing a Europa League tie behind closed doors for a probationary period of two years. That could now be imposed when UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body meet tomorrow and could mean the Stadio Olimpico is empty when Lazio host Stuttgart on March 14 in the second leg of their last-16 tie. Monchengladbach also face a charge after their fans lit fireworks in the stadium as Lazio advanced 5-3 on aggregate following a 3-3 draw in the first leg. The build-up to the match was overshadowed by trouble with 8,000 German fans having descended on Rome. Three Monchengladbach fans were stabbed in confrontations although none of the injuries were serious. Trouble: Lazio fans have been charged with 'racist behaviour' for the fourth time this season (THIS A A FILE PHOTO - there is no suggestion that fans in this picture are responsible) Lazio president Claudio Lotito was dismayed by the latest outbreak of violence although he felt it was unfair to blame the club. He told Sky Sport Italia: 'I would urge the media not to label the protagonists of all these incidents as 'Lazio fans'. Rome is a metropolis and as such is inhabited also by bad people. 'For example, there is no suggestion so far that those behind these incidents were part of Lazio's organised fan groups. 'Nobody is trying to justify this behaviour, but I say this because I am in constant contact with the police and want to understand if these people really are linked with Lazio. 'In my view they should do a quick trial and send them to prison for some time, so they don't have the chance to do it again.'","Italian club now face prospect of behind closed door Europa League match .

Her father rose to fame capturing his idyllic village upbringing in the best-selling novel Cider With Rosie. But for Laurie Lee’s daughter, Jessy, life growing up with the celebrated author was a very different story. Miss Lee has revealed that she was driven to seek therapy as a result of her father’s ‘controlling’ behaviour. Overwhelmed: Jessy Lee, daughter of author Laurie Lee, pictured at her family home in the Slad Valley, said she struggled with a controlling father . The 49-year-old said she struggled to cope with the writer’s extreme mood swings and admitted she is only now coming to terms with her upbringing, almost 16 years after her father’s death. She has claimed that as an only child she was often forced to mediate between her parents if they quarrelled and said the strain of frequently moving between Gloucestershire and London left her ‘unable to make sense of my background’. She said: ‘It was very difficult being his daughter and he did suffer with his epilepsy. His moods could be extreme and, of course, he liked a drink or two so I never knew how he was going to be from one minute to the next. ‘When you’re younger, you tend to think, “What have I done to provoke this?”’ Controlling: Poet and novelist Laurie Lee was 'extreme' in his mood swings, his daughter has revealed . Miss Lee became a psychotherapist in . 1998 – a year after her father died at the age of 82 – and said she was . inspired by the help she was given in overcoming her own problems. ‘I’m sure that’s true of most people who train as therapists,’ she told Cotswold Life magazine. Cider With Rosie evokes a long-lost, rural England that was on the cusp of being overwhelmed by the modern age. Published in 1959, it is Laurie Lee’s best-loved work and immortalised his childhood in Slad, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, after the First World War. Rosie was, years later, revealed to be his cousin Rosalind Buckland. At the age of 16, Lee joined a firm of chartered accountants, but did not enjoy the work. In 1934 he walked to London, playing his violin to make money.

Parts of Britain could feel as cold as  -11C(12F) with much of the UK chillier than St Petersburg. An area of high pressure, the so-called ‘Beast from the East’, has sucked in freezing air from Siberia which will cause the thermometer to plunge as low as -6(21F) and even -7C in some areas, the Met Office has forecast. Horses were wrapped up against the cold in the Peak District with snow still lying in their field . The 50mph winds forecast for some parts could make it feel as low as -11. That will make Britain colder than cities close to the Arctic Circle. Light snowfalls are also possible across much of the east and south while this could spread across the west towards Wales tomorrow. Met Office spokesman Charlie Powell said temperatures in parts of Scotland were expected to fall as low as -7C overnight. He added that the ‘majority of the UK’ could expect to see the temperatures drop as low as -2C(28F) to -3C(27F) during the same period, rendering Britain colder than St Petersburg, Oslo, in Norway, and Stockholm, in Sweden, which are all -2C. Forecasters are predicting much of the UK will be colder than St Petersburg, pictured The Catherine Palace . The cold weather is expected to last until next week, when the Met Office say temperatures will return to the February daytime average of around 6C(43F). Mr Powell said: ‘Today and Saturday we can expect to see daytime temperatures of around 1-4C (34-39F) across much of Britain. ‘Overnight, because of the light winds and clear skies, the majority of the UK will drop to around -2C or -3C. ‘However, in parts of Central and Northern Scotland we could see temperatures drop as low as -6C or -7C overnight.’ Commuters may be battling through snow again on Friday after showers earlier this month, such as this flurry at Crystal Palace station on February 11 . ‘Conditions are going to be dry and mostly clear over the weekend.’ When asked about how the wind-chill factor could impact on how cold it feels, Mr Powell added: ‘It’s a very subjective thing. It depends on the person experiencing it, but even a wind speed as low as 20-25mph could make it feel 3-4C colder outside.’ Mr Powell said high pressure has dragged cold air from notoriously cold countries like Siberia into the UK. However, he warned that mild conditions were not on the way in the near future. Asked about the forecast for early next week, he added: ‘It will be a bit less cold, we should see temperatures of around 5,6, or 7C during the day. ‘However, overnight it’s still going to be around freezing. There’s certainly nothing mild on the cards.’","Parts of Britain will be feel -11C and colder than St Petersburg, in Russia .

President Barack Obama said Friday that about 100 American troops have been deployed to the African nation of Niger. Two U.S. defense officials said the troops would be setting up a base for unarmed drones to conduct surveillance. Obama announced the deployment in a letter to Congress, saying that the forces 'will provide support for intelligence collection and will also facilitate intelligence sharing with French forces conducting operations in Mali, and with other partners in the region.' New mission: President Obama announced that the U.S. will build a new base for drones (pictured) in Niger, Africa, to increase surveillance in the volatile region . The move marks a deepening of U.S. efforts to stem the spread of Al Qaeda and its affiliates in the volatile region. It also underscores Obama's desire to fight extremism without involving large numbers of U.S. ground forces. The drone base will allow the U.S. to give France more intelligence on the militants its forces have been fighting in Mali, which neighbors Niger. Over time, it could extend the reach not only of American intelligence-gathering but also U.S. special operations missions to strengthen Niger's own security forces. One of the two U.S. defense officials who discussed the development confirmed the American troops would fly drones and other surveillance platforms from Niger military airstrips, tracking militant and refugee movement inside Mali and around the border. The U.S. will share that intelligence with Niger's military, the official said. Conflict: French soldiers crouch behind a wall during fighting with Islamists in Mali on February 21, 2013. President Obama said intelligence from drone operations in neighboring Niger would be shared with French forces . Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the project. The drones at the Niger base will be unarmed and used for surveillance, not airstrikes. Still, the development of a base in Niger raises the possibility that it could eventually be used for launching strikes. Obama said in his letter to Congress that the U.S. forces have been deployed with the consent of Niger's government. The forces were also deployed with weapons 'for their own force protection and security,' the president said. Last month, the U.S. and Niger signed a status-of-forces-agreement spelling out legal protections and obligations of American forces that might operate in Niger in the future. Volatile: Hundreds of Chadian soldiers joined French search-and-destroy operations hunting Islamist jihadists. The U.S. hopes to stem the spread of Al Qaeda in the region . Africa is increasingly a focus of U.S. counterterrorism efforts, even as Al Qaeda remains a threat in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. Last month's terrorist attack on a natural gas complex in Algeria, in which at least 37 hostages and 29 militants were killed, illustrated the threat posed by extremists who have asserted power propelled by long-simmering ethnic tensions in Mali and the revolution in Libya. A number of Al Qaeda-linked Islamic extremist groups operate in Mali and elsewhere in the Sahara, including a group known as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, which originated in Algeria and is active in northern Mali. Last month, French forces intervened to stop the extremists' move toward Mali's capital, and Washington has grown more involved by providing a variety of military support to French troops. France has said it will eventually pull out of its Mali operation so that African forces can help stabilize the West African country.","100 American soldiers deployed to Niger to set up new drone operations .

Andrea Green bled to death after a routine back operation she may not actually have needed . A fit and healthy woman bled to death after having routine surgery for a back pain. Andrea Green, 42, died just 14 hours after the operation at Barnsley District General Hospital. Her death came after staff in the hospital's orthopaedic department warned managers about grave risks to patients 'extreme pressure and stress' in the department. An inquest was halted and Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries asked police to investigate following the emergence of the letter outlining staff concerns. Ms Green had started suffering from back pain in August 2009. The pain was so bad that she was . bedridden for two weeks despite being prescribed with painkillers by her . GP on numerous occasions. She was referred to the orthopaedic clinic at Barnsley Hospital but by . the time her appointment came round, her pain had subsided. The clinic diagnosed her as suffering from a prolapsed (herniated) disc. Unbeknown to Ms Green, this condition quite often resolves itself . over time without the need for further treatment. Despite this, the . hospital listed her for surgery and she was advised that the pain . could return if the operation was not carried out. Because she did not want . the pain to return, she agreed to the procedure, which took place in March 2010. When her sister Janette Allatt visited her in hospital later that evening, she found her very pale and complaining of stomach pain. Nurses discovered she had very low blood pressure and because she was in pain, administered medication to relieve it. At 2am the following morning, Ms Green's father received a telephone call . from the hospital informing them that she was seriously ill. To their horror, by the time her family arrived at the hospital, she had died. Mrs Allatt, 56, said: 'I just remember being in total and absolute shock. I never expected anything like this to happen. We have so many questions about . what happened to Andrea and believe if it wasn’t for the surgery, she . would still be here today.' A report from the post mortem examination listed the cause of death as retroperitoneal haemorrhage (internal bleeding). Staff at Barnsley District General Hospital had warned managers about grave risks to patients due to 'extreme pressure and stress' in the orthopaedic department . The report suggests that the wrong disc . was operated on and that the internal bleed was created during the . operation. Her family later lodged a claim for medical negligence which has now been settled out of court for a six-figure sum. Andrew Harrison, head of medical negligence at Raley's solicitors, which represented the family, said serious internal bleeding after the operation should have been spotted and treated by doctors. He said: 'They could have saved her for up to 30 minutes before she died. They had got all the information if someone cared to look.' The hospital was warned of 'extreme pressure and stress' in the orthopaedic department a letter just weeks before Andrea died in March, 2010. A letter was sent to former chief executive Sharon Taylor and referred to a meeting between her and medical director Dr Jugnu Mahajan in which the orthopaedic team warned of danger to patients. The letter stated 'it was only a matter of time before the situation led to significant patient morbidity and mortality'. The doctor who performed the operation on Andrea is still working at the hospital under supervision. A spokesman for Barnsley District General Hospital said: 'We are extremely sorry for the loss suffered by Andrea's family. We treat the safety of our patients as an utmost priority. 'After Andrea's death we began a full internal investigation and also sought the views of external experts. 'We have fully implemented all of the changes recommended by those investigations. 'The letter and its contents are a matter for consideration at the inquest and it would therefore be inappropriate for us to comment further.'","Andrea Green died hours after the operation at Barnsley District Hospital .

Justice: Laure Hatfield, 50, was sentenced to three to six years in prison for causing a high-speed crash in 2010 that resulted in the death of her three grandchildren . A Pennsylvania grandmother has been ordered to spend three to six years in prison for a high-speed crash that killed her three young grandchildren in 2010. Before Laurie Hatfield, 50, was sentenced to jail Wednesday, her son and the father of the three young victims, Luke Stump, made a tearful plea to the judge to keep his ailing mother out of jail during the emotional hearing. ‘First . off, I want to say, mom, I love you. I know the kids loved you. ... I . forgive you,' Stump said, adding that her incarceration is not . going to bring him closure. The deaths of his children has changed his life dramatically for the worse, he said. 'Nothing makes me happy,' he went on. 'And you know going to jail isn't going to change that.' Stump appealed to the judge, asking him not to lock his mother away. 'I'm not saying that what she did wasn't wrong...What I'm saying is what closure would I get putting her in prison?' Stump said. Hatfield had sought house arrest after pleading no contest to vehicular homicide in the crash that happened after state police say she sped away from another collision at about 100 mph with her three grandchildren in the vehicle. Investigators say five-year-old Luke Stump Jr. and two-year-old twins Megyn and Troy Stump weren’t properly restrained when Hatfield’s speeding station wagon plunged down an embankment near Harrisburg in April 2010. Plea: Hatfield's son and the father of the three dead kids, Luke Stump (pictured), tearfully begged the judge not to lock his mother up . Angels: Luke Stump Jr., aged five, center, and his two-year-old twin siblings, Megyn Diane Stump and Troy Matthew Stump, were pronounced dead at the scene of the April 2010 crash . Horrific crash: Police said the three kids were not properly restrained when Hatfield's speeding station wagon went down an embankment . When given a chance to speak during . her sentencing on Wednesday, Hatfield was so overcome with emotion that . her words were mostly incomprehensible. 'I never, ever wanted this to happen and I wish to God it was me [who died],' Hatfield said through loud sobs. The Patriot-News of Harrisburg reports that the courtroom descended into chaos when Hatfield's relatives realized that she was headed to jail. The . outcry prompted deputies to remove Hatfield’s out-of-control family from the courtroom when Judge Bernard Coates Jr. announced the sentence. Some of the outraged family members, which included eight of Hatfield's 10 children who turned out to support her, shouted and hurled insults as they made their exit and continued raging in the hallway. Prosecutor . Fran Chardo later said that three of Hatfield's relatives were charged . with disorderly conduct over the courtroom outburst. Fatal mistake: Hatfield said she thought the children were properly restrained inside the station wagon before the accident . The case that ended on Wednesday with Hatfield's sentencing started in April 2010 when she drove her station wagon at 105mph through a guardrail and down and embankment off Route 22/322 in Middle Paxton Township. The 50-year-old woman pleaded no contest in July to three counts of vehicular homicide along with a slew of other charges, including child endangerment and reckless endangerment. Hatfield' attorney said that mother of 10, who is battling cancer, thought the children were properly buckled up in the car before the crash. Family tragedy: Hatfield, left, said in court before her sentencing that she had wished that it was her who died rather than her three young grandchildren, right . The lawyer, Paul Kovatch, added that his client is filled with remorse for what had happened and spends her days crying for her dead grandchildren. The prosecution did not request a specific sentence for Hatfield. Judge Coates said he decided on the punishment with the three children in mind. ‘My last thoughts come to those kids,’ he said. ‘I shudder to imagine the horrific last minutes of their lives.’","Laure Hatfield, 50, was sentenced to three to six years in prison for the 2010 crash .

Martha Atwater, 48, had just bought cookies from a cafe in Brooklyn Heights when a black Honda Ridgeline careered onto the sidewalk. Witnesses have described emotionally distressing scenes as the woman spoke final words to her family using her cell phone. The truck was driven by a 53-year-old man who remained at the scene. Reports say he may have lost consciousness and control of the vehicle due suffering a 'medical problem', possibly related to diabetes. Authorities are not suspecting criminal behavior. Tragic: Martha Atwater, pictured here (left) having fun with a fake mustache in a picture taken from her Facebook page, died when a pickup truck jumped the curb and pinned her against a wall . Shock: Atwater was hit by the truck just after buying cookies in a Brooklyn Heights cafe . The incident happened on Clinton Street and Atlantic Avenue around 5.40 pm on Friday. Atwater was barely conscious when paramedics arrived at the scene and she was taken to Long Island College Hospital. She was pronounced dead at the hospital and identified by husband Thomas Wallack. Wallack returned to the family home last night but according to The New York Post was 'too distraught to speak.' Amille Harris, an eyewitness, told ABC that a UPS worker got Atwater's phone and was able to call her family. Harris added that it was distressing to watch her last words to her family. 'She was just mumbling and whining. There was nothing she could do it was sad,' Harris said. Distressing: Atwater was pinned against a wall by the out-of-control truck . The sad incident happened on Atlantic Avenue and Clinton Street in Brooklyn Heights . 'She was pinned under the car. There was no blood, nothing she could do. Her leg was caught under the tire. It was gory,' Harris recalled. Atwater bought five horseshoe-shaped cookies from the Bagel Cafe before being struck by the truck. The cafe manager Alauddin Shipun told The New York Post: 'She just came in to buy cookies. She looked happy, she was smiling.' 'She walked out. I heard a big bang and she was gone. Someone was trying . to lift her head up and asking her, ""Are you OK? Are you OK?""' Shipun . added. Atwater graduated from Princeton University and won an Emmy award in 2009 for her work on PBS children's show WordWorld.

Musician Bob Dylan claims America will never be able to rid the shame of being ‘founded on the back of slaves’. The outspoken singer said the stigma of slavery has ruined America and he doubts the country will ever recover from it. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, he continued that the people of America are ‘at each other's throats just because they are of a different color’. Outspoken: Musician Bob Dylan claims America will never get over its past of slavery . Divided country: Dylan argues that America would be much further ahead if the end to slavery had come peacefully instead of sparking a civil war. Pictured is a battle between north and south in the battle of Spotsylvania, Virginia, in May 1864 . Hard labour: Slaves working in the sweet potato fields in the Hopkinson plantation in South Carolina in 1862 . A look back: A map depicts the slave and non-slaveholding states at the outbreak of the Civil War, along with the dates when each non-slaveholding state legally ended slavery . He added that ‘it will hold any nation back’ and black people know that some whites ‘didn't want to give up slavery’. Dylan, 71, said: ‘If slavery had been given up in a more peaceful way, America would be far ahead today.’ Slavery was finally abolished in America in 1865 after years of conflict between the north and the south over the law. Controversial: Singer Bob Dylan made the comments in an interview with Rolling Stone . Slave labour existed in America from an early colonial period and it was not until after the American Revolution, from 1775 to 1783, that all northern states in the country abolished slavery. But the slave trade increased in the south after the expansion of the cotton industry in 1800 and southern businessman were determined to hold on to their cheap labour. The international import or export of slaves became illegal under U.S. law in 1807 but by the 1850s the South was vigorously defending slavery. In 1861 eleven slave states broke away to form the Confederate States of America, leading to the American Civil War, which ended in 1865 and the slaves were freed. Great moves have been made towards equality since then but many agree there is still a long way to go. When asked if President Barack Obama was helping to shift a change, Dylan says: ‘I don't have any opinion on that. You have to change your heart if you want to change.’ President Obama - the most powerful man in America - is himself believed to be descended from slaves. Genealogists even claim that DNA analysis and marriage and property records suggest that Obama is the 11th great-grandchild of John Punch, the first black slave living in colonial Virginia nearly four centuries ago. While it was known that Obama's mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, had European ancestors, researchers discovered she also had at least this one African American forebear. John Punch's story stretches back to the mid-1600s; he was working as a servant when he escaped Virginia for Maryland in 1640. Political leader: President Barack Obama, the most powerful man in America, is believed to have descended from slaves . Before the slave trade: Obama's ancestor John Punch was condemned to a life of slavery in 1640 for escaping a home where he worked as a servant. The sentence made him America's first slave (file picture) Postbellum period: Photos taken in rural Alabama in the 1890s - thirty years after slavery's end .

The sentence, which came years before Virginia set laws condoning slavery, has led historians to regard him as America's first legally sanctioned slave. Many of America’s public figures can trace their ancestry back to the period – with as many being descended from slavers and those on the side of the southern Confederacy as those descended from slaves.

German doctor Daniel Ubani caused the death of patient David Gray in Cambridgeshire in 2008 after he administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine. A new test is being introduced to make sure foreign doctors have a good grasp of English . Foreign doctors who want to work in the NHS will have to prove they speak good English before treating patients. New checks have been announced by the Government after a string of cases in which overseas doctors were blamed for poor care. The worst proved fatal, after a German doctor gave a lethal overdose to a pensioner on his first shift. He had earlier been refused work due to his sub-standard English. Doctors coming to Britain from outside Europe already face strict  language tests. But at present, GPs and hospital doctors from countries in the European Union can work here without any national checks on their competence or language skills. From April, new bodies of  GPs called clinical commissioning groups will have a legal duty to ensure that a doctor’s English is up to scratch before they are employed. Practitioners will have to prove that they have a ‘necessary level’ of English before treating patients in GPs’ surgeries or hospitals, the Department of Health has said. The General Medical Council has been pushing for tougher testing in the wake of the death of David Gray in Cambridgeshire in 2008. The 70-year-old was killed when Dr Daniel Ubani gave him 20 times the legal dose of morphine. Health minister Dr Daniel Poulter says the stricter language tests for doctors will protect patients . The German doctor – on his first . out-of-hours shift – had not had to prove his competence or ability with . English before being employed by the Cambridgeshire NHS trust. Dr Ubani . said he was confused by differences between drugs used here and in . Germany. He had previously been denied NHS work in Leeds because of his poor English. Ministers plan to hand the GMC powers to stop doctors being given UK licences if  their communication skills are  a problem. The Government will also introduce a . national list which all GPs must be on to stop those rejected in one . area from working elsewhere. Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said the . measures were to protect patients who ‘should be able to understand and . be understood by their doctor’. He said: ‘These new checks will ensure all doctors who want to work in the NHS speak proficient English. ‘There are lots of excellent doctors from around the world in the NHS – this is simply about protecting patients.’ Niall Dickson, chief executive of the . GMC, said the move will ‘strengthen patient safety’. He added: ‘Patients . must be confident their doctor has the right communications skills. ‘If doctors cannot speak  English to a safe standard  then the GMC must be able to protect patients.’ Katherine Murphy of the Patients . Association said the changes are ‘welcome, and long overdue’. She added: . ‘Lessons from the past serve to highlight the tragic consequences of . poor language skills.’ Dean Royles of the NHS Employers . organisation said that foreign doctors had made an ‘invaluable . contribution’ but safety needed to be the ‘top priority’.","General Medical Council will refuse licences for doctors with poor English .

Convicted: Former school teacher Aaron Ledean, is facing imprisonment after being found guilty at Teesside Crown Court of repeated sexual assaults on an underage boy . A former school teacher is facing jail after carrying out repeated sexual assaults on an underage boy. A jury unanimously convicted Aaron Ledean of three indecent assaults on the teenage boy in the 1990s. The ex-science teacher already had convictions for downloading almost 4,000 child abuse images. Jurors heard how the victim of the . assaults - who cannot be named for legal reasons, now an adult - felt . 'euphoria' as he developed a strong crush on the affable, well-liked and . openly gay Ledean. He said it was a difficult time in his life as they flirted with one another. They . went to bars in their 'first date' in Middlesbrough and engaged in . sexual activity in a visit to the cinema and two pre-arranged visits to . Ledean’s home. The boy was 'devastated' when Ledean later broke things off. Years later, the boy confronted . Ledean and said it was inappropriate for him to be in a position of . responsibility towards children. Ledean . became a teacher at a Teesside school for several years. The . complainant said the events preyed on his mind over the years and he . grew to believe what had happened was wrong. He . underwent counselling and reported matters to police in 2010. Ledean . said none of the alleged sexual activity or flirtation took place. He said he felt affection but not sexual attraction for the boy and insisted they were just mates. He said he deeply regretted rejecting the boy, after the teenager unexpectedly turned up at his home with a bunch of roses. Ledean, 40, had denied the three charges of indecent assault in a trial at Teesside Crown Court. Facing jail: A jury unanimously convicted Aaron Ledean, pictured, of three indecent assaults on a teenage boy in the 1990s . But prosecutor Shaun Dodds alleged that Ledean showed he had a sexual interest in young boys. Judge . John Walford said the alleged sexual activity was consensual, but it . constituted indecent assault because of the boy’s age at the time. Jurors were told of Ledean’s previous convictions. He was given a suspended prison sentence after he admitted 16 charges of making and one of possessing indecent photographs of children in 2008. He had 3,925 images of children on a laptop and discs. Ledean said he was addicted to pornography at the time of downloading the pictures in 2005 to 2007, but there was 'a world of difference' between thinking and doing things. He told the court he’d been through therapy and counselling and was not attracted to children. Judge Walford told Ledean, of Crook, County Durham, that prison was inevitable, remanding him in custody until March 18.","Aaron Ledean engaged in .

The BBC's top female executive has claimed that she told former Director-General Mark Thompson about the sexual abuse accusations surrounding disgraced TV star Jimmy Savile nine months before he left. Former director of news Helen Boaden's testimony contradicts his claim that he knew nothing of the nature of the Newsnight allegation until after he left the role to become chief executive of the New York Times. The Sunday Times reports that Boaden informed Mr Thompson about the scandal  in December 2011, citing a source familiar with the situation. Lawyers representing Helen Boaden, former director of BBC News, have claimed she told former Director-General Mark Thompson about the Savile claims in 2011. Mr Thompson says he did not know the nature of the allegations until after he left in September . Mr Thompson has repeatedly stated he never heard any allegations about the former DJ in eight years at the helm of the broadcaster. But Boaden's new evidence puts doubt on that claim. The BBC released transcripts and other evidence from interviews by Nick Pollard, who carried out a review into the aborted Newsnight investigation at the centre of the scandal, which support his claim. It immediately attracted criticism because it was covered in censor’s ink, despite the corporation's promise to be open and transparent about the material. The paper, quoting a source familiar with the situation, said Boaden's lawyer had made submitted points on her behalf to Pollard as he prepared to publish his conclusions. Mr Thompson says he was informed about the existence of the Newsnight investigation in December 2011 but claims he did not know what the investigation was about . A BBC spokesperson said: 'The BBC has accepted Nick Pollard's report and its findings. We have now published all of the background material for his report. We have nothing further to add.' At the height of the Savile crisis . Miss Boaden, 56, temporarily ‘stepped aside’ from her £340,000 a year . role, and it was later revealed she had at one point offered to resign. Earlier this month the BBC announced she  is to become director of radio. Tony Hall, the incoming Director General . of the BBC, has admitted he is ‘shocked’ by the level of infighting . within the Corporation which has been exposed by the fallout from the . Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal. Lord Hall, who is due to take up the Director-General post in April, reportedly told friends that the scandal has laid bare a culture of blame-shifting and management infighting where no-one is willing to take responsibility for their decisions. He is to make reform of the Corporation’s top-heavy management structures a ‘priority’ and has hinted that changes will be made to the BBC’s beleaguered Newsnight programme, which has been under fire ever since it dropped an expose into Savile’s sex crimes in 2011. One source said: ‘Tony has been shocked by recent revelations which show a lack of teamwork at the top of the BBC and an unwillingness by some people to take responsibility for their own decisions. 'He feels that those two things are glaringly obvious from recent events and he will be looking at those issues once in post.' Bad news: The release of the evidence gathered during the BBC's inquiry into why Newsnight dropped its original Jimmy Savile investigation has attracted criticism as much of it was censored .

An Australian airline worker returned to his car following six weeks abroad only to discover a nest on the rear windscreen wiper . . .with a brooding bird sitting on eggs. Trevor Maltby, arrived at Cairns International Airport following a trip to Papua New Guinea. He went to the staff car park to pick up his vehicle and found a female Peaceful Dove perilously perched on the back of his Audi Hatchback - incubating her eggs. The female Peaceful Dove was found nesting her eggs on the back windscreen wipers of Mr Maltby's car . Maltby said in an interview with Yahoo: . 'At first I thought it was just trying to ""blend in,"" then I noticed it . looked like it was trying to make a nest. 'As I got closer it appeared it . was not about to fly away. My colleague put his hand right up to it's . face, and that's when it raised its wings and exposed those eggs.' After spending an hour on the phone with wildlife experts, Trevor took up the offer from a colleague of a ride home and offered to leave, both, his car and the the nest alone for the few weeks it was hoped it would take for the eggs to hatch. The eggs were moved but the mother could not be found. Experts say that she is likely to produce more eggs very soon . He added: 'The next day I got a call . from the airport to say that the wildlife officials had come and removed . the nest as its location was deemed to be far from ideal, and that I . could come and collect my car. 'The eggs have been taken to an . incubator and the mother was unable to be caught and taken with them, . though they figured she would probably lay again in the very near . future.' The nesting mother used Christmas ribbon to create her nest on a traffic light . Just last month baffled motorists in Leicester found a bird incubating eggs on an amber traffic light. The bird, which was either a mistle or song thrush, had even used some Christmas wrapping to make its nest. The light may seem an unusual place to nest, but its warmth provides heat for the eggs . Photographer Jason Senior, 40, from Leicester said: 'There were a lot of people standing around looking at this bird, I suppose it thought it had the green light to start nesting so early. 'If you look closely you can see ribbon from what might be Christmas wrapping in with the twigs in the nest . 'I was there for about half an hour and the bird seemed pretty happy and oblivious to all the commotion around it.' Gemma Hogg from thr RSPB said: 'Birds make their nests in all sorts of unusual places, and this isn't the first traffic light nest we've seen - in the past we've had birds nesting in, bins, hanging baskets and even an ash tray outside a pub.'It may seem odd to us, but it's actually quite common. They see a safe, secure and cosy spot to lay eggs and raise chicks and don't care what it looks like or what the neighbours might think.

Beaming into the camera, this is the 13-year-old girl who died after plunging 20ft from a ski lift in the Italian Alps. Poonam Bhattal, of Slough, Berkshire, struck her head on a concrete pylon when she slipped from a chairlift while on a school trip to the small resort of Claviere, near the border with France. The teenager survived the fall but died on Friday morning after suffering a suspected cardiac arrest on the way to hospital. Teenager: Poonam Bhattal was thought to have been having a ski lesson with pupils from the Guru Nanak Sikh Academy when she fell on to the piste in the resort of Claviere . Angelic: Schoolgirl Poonam Bhattal, 13, from Slough, Berks., plunged to her death from a ski lift in the Alps on a half-term school trip to Claviere, Italy . Workers at the Miramonti ski lodge, . where the party of 30 from Guru Nanak Sikh Academy in Hayes, Middlesex, was staying, . paid tribute over the weekend to a young girl who was ‘always happy, . always smiling’ . ‘We saw her leave the hotel just like all the other mornings, happy and smiling with her friends,’ one staff member said. 'It’s terrible. Nothing like this has ever happened before here.’ Tragedy had struck on the first lift of the day, moments after the teenager had put on her skis. According to newly-emerged details, . the schoolgirl slid from the chair after accidentally sitting in the . wrong seat of the four-man chairlift. Investigators told the La Stampa . newspaper: ‘She didn’t end up sitting in her assigned seat, perhaps as a . joke or because she lost her balance. In any case she ended up sitting . in the arms of a school friend. Grieving: Pupils from Poonam's school have expressed their devastation at her tragic death on social networking sites . ‘Because of this the safety bar didnt go all the way down, so at the first tremour of the lift, she slid and fell’. The schoolgirl’s injuries were . compounded by the fact that she fell not onto fresh snow but onto a . stream in which there lay several rocks, it has now emerged. The teenager was riding on the lift . with three other children, unaccompanied by any adults, one skier who . arrived on the scene immediately afterwards claimed. The French skier, a teacher on a . different school trip, said: ’There were no adults on the chair, just . four youngsters altogether. I believe the children were messing around, jostling each other. ‘They hadn’t managed to put the barrier down properly. The lift operator heard shouting. He . went to stop the lift - maybe three to four seconds passed. But it was too late. She had already fallen. Accident: The schoolgirl came off the ski-lift in the Italian resort of Claviere, which is in the Alps . ‘Unfortunately its a horrible tragic accident. No one is to blame.’ An investigation has been launched into the safety of the lift, and a postmortem will take place early in the week. Over the weekend the girl’s family . flew out to Italy to meet teachers and fellow pupils who were due to . leave the resort last night. Pupils at the academy were today remembering their school friend by bringing memories and . pictures of Poonam into class. Over the weekend they took to social . media sites to remember her. One said: ‘School’s going to be so dead on . Monday. We’ve lost a sister. ’ Another wrote: ‘We’ve lost a best friend and drama queen.

Tax probe: David Beckham started his first practice session with Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday amid a media frenzy . France's tax authorities are probing the multi-million pounds deal which brought David Beckham to Paris St Germain – less than a month after his arrival. It comes as the 37-year-old former England football captain finally prepares to make his debut against Marseille today. Jean-Claude Blanc, managing director of the richest club in the world, admitted that a 'formal discussion' was already taking place with France's 'fiscal administration'. This is despite the fact that Beckham . only signed for PSG at the end of January, and has barely spent a night . in Paris since then. He has . strictly limited his contract to five months, kept his family based in . London, and – most crucially of all – said that he will pay his nominal . salary to charity. All of . this enables both Beckham and PSG to concentrate on making millions from . the player's image rights and other commercial activities, while paying . far smaller taxes abroad. Mr . Blanc said that 'we have already received a lot of requests' for . Beckham's salary, and that 'we want to cause as little disappointment as . possible.' He also admitted . that PSG wanted to keep government charges to a minimum, claiming that . 'the largest possible amount' would go to a children's charity. It . was all part of a 'formal discussion that has started with the fiscal . authorities', said Mr Blanc, who made his comments about Beckham as he . discussed PSG's marketing strategy last week. It is almost unheard of for the French . treasury to start discussing tax obligations with a foreign national so . soon after his arrival. 'Beckham: . PSG talk to the Inland Revenue,' was the headline in Saturday's . Parisien newspaper, and others have already expressed anger at what is . going on. France's Socialist . government is introducing a top income tax rate of 75 per cent for . multi-millionaires, and many believe Beckham should pay it if he is . playing his football in Paris. French . conservative MP Gerald Darmanin mocked Beckham's 'charity' salary, . saying: 'He will be paid less than my parliamentary assistant!' Be . serious!' Mr Darmanin added: 'I'd rather receive 50 per cent of a lot than 75 per cent of nothing!' PSG, and not Beckham, will eventually pay the £700,000 estimated 'wages' direct to a selected charity.

This means Beckham will not become liable for a 1.5 per cent tax on his worldwide income and estimated wealth of £200million – a possible bill of at least £3million. Both PSG and Beckham are already promoting club shirts, with an adult top featuring the player's name and number costing almost £100. Beckham and his family were given an escort of 20 policemen and 12 plain clothes security men when they finally arrived in Paris last week, with the player taking up residence in £14,500-a-night hotel suite close to the British Embassy. Wife Victoria and their three sons and daughter all spent a week in the 3,475 sq ft Imperial Suite at the Bristol Hotel. Yet Victoria and the children were all pictured returning to London on Friday – meaning they will not be in Paris if Beckham makes an appearance for his new team against arch rivals Marseille in the French capital tonight. PSG is ultimately bank-rolled by oil rich Qatar, which is due to host the World Cup finals in 2022. A spokesman for the French Treasury said 'we cannot discuss individual cases', but confirmed that all 'high-worth' individuals working in France would be 'scrutinised'. A spokesman for Beckham said: 'David has given any income he would have earned from PSG to charity.

The world's longest running soap is planning a 'future-proof' set at its new studio at MediaCity in Salford Quays, paving the way for 3D technology to be used in special episodes. The show, which was first broadcast in black and white in 1960, already films in high definition. The move could add an extra touch of drama to scenes such as this one with Jennie McAlpine as Fiz, Chris Foundain as Tommy and Natalie Gumede as Kirsty . From black and white to 3D? Arthur Leslie and Doris Speed as Jack Walker and Annie Walker pictured behind the bar at the Rovers in 1962 . But according to the Sunday Express, future episodes could make use of 3D technology - and pilot tests are believed to have started two years ago. It is believed to be the first move of its kind among television soaps. The soap is expected to move to the 7.7 acre site at MediaCity by 2014. Filming is to continue at its Quay Street studio until the move, with the Rovers Return to be refurbished after viewers see it go up in flames next month. An ITV spokesman said there were 'no plans' yet to film Coronation Street in 3D but that the Street's new studio would be prepared for such technological developments. The spokesman added that there is no set date for the move to MediaCity. Earlier this month the BBC announced Doctor Who will be filmed in 3D to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 3D.

Justice: Paula Barnes, 45, who fled Britain after killing a primary school teacher in a road crash. She has has finally been brought to justice, police said . The wife of a drugs 'Mr Big' who fled Britain after killing a primary school teacher in a road crash has finally been brought to justice, police said. Paula Barnes, 45, of of Baydon, Wiltshire, fled to Holland more than two years ago after being charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Her husband, David, is serving a 12-year jail term for smuggling £25million of cannabis into the UK from Holland in lorry loads of flowers. The couple led a lavish lifestyle funded by Mr Barnes’s smuggling operation of importing thousands of kilos of cannabis. Mrs Barnes was arrested in Holland earlier this month and extradited to the UK where today she admitted killing Diane Wright. Mrs Wright was killed in a collision in Foxhill, Baydon, near Swindon in September 2010. The mother-of-two, from Royal Wootton Bassett, worked as a teacher at St Nicholas School in Baydon. Mrs Barnes, who police describe as a 'callous and manipulative woman', was charged with causing death by driving and bailed to appear at court the following April but failed to show. She was at large until detectives tracked her down to Holland. Today at Swindon Crown Court she pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and failing to surrender. Mrs Barnes has been remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on January 18. Inspector Steve Cox, head of roads policing for Wiltshire Police, said: 'Paula Barnes has tried to evade justice by fleeing to Holland where she hoped to remain undetected. 'The fact she was caught, arrested, extradited and has now pleaded guilty to the charge of causing death by dangerous driving is testament to the hard work and dedication of my team. Criminal: Her husband, David Barnes, is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for importing cannabis worth £25m into the UK . He added: 'Barnes has proved to be a callous and manipulative woman who thought she was above the law. 'This has been a very long and complex operation which has been led by officers in the serious collision investigation team at Wiltshire Police. 'We hope that today, Dianne’s family can somehow feel that justice has been finally served and at last begin to put this ordeal behind them.'

In an emotional goodbye to 100,000 supporters, the Pope revealed that he is stepping aside because God told him to. In a voice raw with emotion, Benedict XVI told tens of thousands of pilgrims in St Peter's Square that he was resigning because God had called on him to devote himself to prayer. He said God had told him 'to climb the mountain'. Pilgrims filled the piazza to witness a historical moment and thank the Pope for his eight year Pontificate at the Angelus Prayer, his penultimate public appearance as the Pontiff. Scroll down for video . Message: Pope Benedict XVI delivers his final Angelus prayer, telling a crowd of 100,000 that he will lead a life of prayer because God told him to. He is stepping down because he no longer has the strength the role requires . Despite recently looking tired and frail, today he spoke in a clear, strong voice, repeatedly thanking the faithful for their closeness and affection as they interrupted him, again and again, with applause and cheers. Police estimated some 100,000 people turned out. Benedict insisted he was 'not abandoning the church.' Instead, speaking in Italian, he said he'll serve the church with the same dedication he has until now, but will do so 'in a way more suitable to my age and my strength'. He also said he would continue to serve through meditation and prayer after his historic abdication. He completed the last Angelus of his . tenure by saying he will always be close to the Church and its people. A . child in the crowd held up a sign on a yellow placard, written in . Italian, 'You are not alone, I'm with you'. Other admirers held . signs simply saying 'Thank you'. Faith: The Pope told the crowd that he was not abandoning the Roman Catholic Church . Today was the Pope's second-to-last public appearance. He will appear once more on Wednesay before he steps down . Heavy rain had been forecast for Rome, and some drizzle dampened the square earlier in the morning, but when Benedict appeared, to the peal of church bells as the clock struck noon, blue sky crept through the clouds. 'We thank God for the sun he has given us,' the Pope said. The 85-year-old will spend his last years in seclusion in a cloistered monastery within the confines of Vatican City. The Pope officially steps down on Thursday. He resigned two weeks ago, saying he no longer has the mental or physical strength to lead the world's 1.2billion Catholics. It is the first time a Pope has stepped down in 600 years. A youngster holds a banner reading: 'You are not alone, I am with you' during the Pope's appearance .

A supporter (right) holds a banner reading 'Dear Pope, we will miss you' Vatican-watchers have speculated that his declining health is a key factor. It has subsequently emerged that the Pope had had a secret heart operation to replace a pace-maker three months ago. The Pontiff also suffered a head wound during an official visit to Mexico last year, which was said to have shaken him. Senior church figure Vincenzo Paglia, the Bishop of Terni, has claimed the Pope's memory had deteriorated and that he suffered from occasional spells of lack of consciousness. Tending the flock: Pope Benedict XVI delivers his blessing to the huge crowd . The Pope has recently appeared frail, but spoke clearly and strongly today . Other theories have placed Benedict at the centre of a plot by a rebel faction of cardinals unhappy with his handling of the sexual abuse crisis. The Vatican earlier this week rubbished Italian media reports alleging the pope's resignation was linked to a secret dossier claiming there is a 'gay network' inside the clergy. Italian newspapers have been rife with unsourced reports claiming the secret dossier from three cardinals reveals an underground network . of senior clergy who have organised gay homosexual parties and faced . blackmail. La Repubblica newspaper claimed the explosive allegations were made in a report into the . so-called 'Vatileaks' scandal which was presented to the Pontiff on or . around December 17. But the . Vatican accused Italian media of spreading 'false and damaging' reports in an attempt to influence cardinals who will meet . in a secret conclave next month to elect a new pope. A date has not been set to hold a vote to elect Benedict XVI's replacement . The Pope has just one more public appearance, at his weekly audience on Wednesday. No date has yet been set for the start of the conclave of cardinals, who will vote in secret to elect Benedict's successor. One Italian in the crowd seemed to be doing a little campaigning, hoisting a sign which mentioned the name of two Italian cardinals considered by observers to be potential contenders in the selection of the next pontiff. The cardinals in the conclave will have to decide whether it's time to look outside of Europe for a pope. Meanwhile Britain's most senior Catholic . clergyman, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, has been reported to the Vatican for . alleged inappropriate behaviour, it emerged last night. Three . priests and one former priest have sent statements to the papal nuncio, . Antonio Mennini, alleging impropriety dating back to 1980.

A Maine man charged with disorderly conduct for his loud whistling in downtown Portland has reached a deal with the city - he can whistle, but he can't linger in one spot. Robert Smith, 32, of Westbrook, has been cited by police twice in the past year after businesses complained. He pleaded guilty last summer and reached a deal with the city in which he can keep whistling as long as he's moving. Smith told The Portland Press Herald his whistling – audible a block away – is protected free speech and usually brings smiles. City officials disputed the free speech argument. Scroll down for video . Nuisance? Robert Smith the Whistler has found himself in trouble with the law for his persistent and loud tours of Portland, Maine. But he's now allowed to continue as long as he keeps moving . According to the Portland Press Herald, Smith's noisy rounds have divided opinions in the city. The man says he works in construction during the summer, but on days off he heads downtown and stays wandering, and whistling, between 9 am and 5 pm. 'The Whistler' is a cult figure in the city and Smith appears in blogs, videos and local media. But his unusual habit has got him on the wrong side of the law. Over the past year he has been summonsed, arrested and taken to court for disorderly conduct. Trish McAllister, a Portland prosecutor who deals with quality of life issues, told the Herald; 'It just got to the point last summer where the complaints just mounted. He's so loud.' Portland Downtown District is trying to eradicate bad behavior in the downtown area, and loud whistling qualifies as an offense. McAllister said: 'The judge and I viewed this as a behavioral issue. (The Whistler) was aggressive. He would follow people who gave him a wrong look.' 'Just like if somebody plays an instrument in front of your business or has the radio on constantly, it's irritating,' PDD Executive Director Janis Beitzer said. Determined: Smith told police: 'You can arrest me a thousand times, and the day I walk out of this jail, I'll be whistling out the door' After a business complained, Smith received a summons for disorderly conduct in May 2012 and he was arrested and jailed in July. On August 22, he pleaded guilty to the charge and according to court documents agreed 'to curb disorderly behavior (loud whistling) in the future.' The plea agreement includes one important caveat - he is banned from standing still and whistling. As long as Smith remains on the move, authorities have agreed not to stop him. According to the Herald, Smith said he told police: 'You can arrest me a thousand times, and the day I walk out of this jail, I'll be whistling out the door.' The Whistler will not be deterred from his habit, claiming his musical habit came from above: 'God is showing me what I'm doing is OK. He shows me every day with laughter.' Smith says that he likes to make Portland residents happy. 'I'm not out here to be the best whistler in the world. I'm just trying to make people smile,' he said. Civil service: Smith says that he likes to make Portland residents happy. 'I'm not out here to be the best whistler in the world. I'm just trying to make people smile' 'I'm doing it because of the reward it gives me,' The Whistler said. 'My goal is if someday I can walk down the streets of Portland and I can see 20 or 30 people whistling along, doing the same thing I'm doing, well then I will be a happy camper. I'll know I did something right.' He tried to argue with police that that the First Amendment protects his constitutional rights to free whistling. 'All I'm doing is expressing myself freely,' explained to the Herald. 'People who express themselves freely should be held in the highest regard, not the lowest regard.' The Whistler does have some support in the community too. He has been featured as an eight-inch model in an artist's window display, as he is a downtown fixture. And Dr Lisa Belisle, a Portland physician, blogged in 2011 that while she does find Smith 'annoying' he is also a 'placeholder. 'He prompts me to remember that not all hear the same music I hear; or respond the same way,' Belisle added.","Robert Smith was charged with disorderly conduct and jailed for loudly whistling around downtown Portland, Maine .

Jailed: Rohan Pershad QC was today jailed for three and a half years for failing to pay £600,000 in VAT . A high-flying barrister who specialises in fraud cases has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison for failing to pay £600,000 in VAT. Rohan Pershad, 45, who had been working as a Queen’s Counsel, a member of the legal profession’s elite, at London’s 39 Essex Street Chambers, enjoyed a gold-plated pay package. But Blackfriars Crown Court heard how Pershad stopped paying tax in 1999. He was found guilty of cheating the public revenue to pocket the cash over a 12-year period after trying to claim that he was 'extremely poor at paperwork'. The court heard that most barristers are self-employed and legally required to pay their own VAT. Pershad, whose income rose from £85,000 in 2001 to £346,000 by 2008, was charging VAT on his fees but failed to pass a penny on to HM Revenue & Customs between June 1999 and September 2011. The money helped to buy a £1.1million home in Virginia Water, Surrey, and a £490,000 home in Somerset. In sentencing, Judge Aidan Marron QC told Pershad: 'You have brought disgrace on yourself and have aggravated that position by fighting this case and lying in front of a jury. 'It saddens me that I have to deal with you.' Describing Pershad as having been 'a person of substance to date', the judge added: 'It is sad that you, a successful and otherwise compassionate man, should have sunk to these particular levels.' Pershad, who specialised in financial disputes, professional negligence and insurance cases, had been guilty of a 'persistent' fraud, the judge said. Convicted: Pershad, a barrister, stopped paying his own VAT in 1999 - shortly before he moved to the Thirty Nine Essex Street chambers - and then fell off the tax register, meaning he 'disappeared off the VAT radar' Hearing: Pershad was found guilty of cheating the public revenue at London's Blackfriars Crown Court after the jury was asked to give a majority verdict following more than nine hours of deliberations . During his nine-day trial, jurors heard that most barristers were self-employed and were legally required to pay their own VAT. Pershad stopped doing so in 1999, shortly before he moved to the Thirty Nine Essex Street chambers. He then fell off the tax register, . meaning he 'disappeared off the VAT radar' and was classed as a 'missing . trader' but he continued to work, the court heard. The prosecution said he knew what his legal responsibilities were. Denial: Pershad denied the charge against him, claiming he believed Thirty Nine Essex Street paid his VAT . The judge said: 'It is clear to me and was clear . during the trial that you decided to capitalise on that situation and in . the ensuing 12 years you cheated the revenue of £600,000. 'You willingly and knowingly engaged in persistent and consistent dishonesty.' Pershad was called to the bar in 1991 and was made QC in 2011. . Pershad, a father of four children . aged from 13 to 21 years, is now a 'broken man' who has brought shame on . his family, according to Mukul Chawla QC defending. Before this case he had been considered 'a man of previous exemplary good character', Mr Chawla noted. He said: 'He will never live down the . very public humiliation caused by his actions to him but perhaps more . pertinently caused to his family. 'Mr Pershad is a broken man. He is . never going to be able to work again in the sphere he had previously . worked. He is going to have to suffer the shame of going to prison and . the consequences of that to his family.' Mr Chawla suggested that Pershad was . not motivated by finances and was not living the high life with . expensive cars. His houses had large mortgages, he told the court. He also suggested that 'in the latter . period' of the fraud Pershad was 'suffering from a depressive illness . exacerbated by the breakdown of his marriage'.","Rohan Pershad QC pocketed more than £600,000 over a 12-year period .

But Courtney's mother Sarah, 29, who was having a driving lesson at the time, said: 'I am so proud of my daughter - I can't believe she kept her cool so well. 'In fact she reacted better than I probably would have. 'She's got a really good, level head on her shoulders usually anyway, but to come home and see that she'd rescued her brother and sisters was amazing. 'I don't care about my possessions - they can be replaced. I'm just so glad that she managed to get them out of there safely.' The children were being looked after by Ms Ratcliffe's mother, also called Sarah, 62, and father Derek, 64, while she was having her lesson. The couple were clearing out a shed in the back garden when the second-hand TV, bought two months earlier, burst into flames in Lureice's bedroom. Courtney picked up Summer Poppy from her cot and led her siblings outside after the house's smoke alarm went off. The children's cousin Declan, 14, who was also in the garden, ran to neighbours who called 999. Courtney said: 'The fire alarm was going off, my brother went to see why and he came running down the stairs and said there was a fire. 'I took my little sisters out the back and brought them around the front to a neighbour's house. It was just instinctive.' The children's grandparents were . treated by medics after . trying to tackle the fire themselves. Ms . Ratcliffe said: 'I was out on a driving lesson at the time and not long . into it [the instructor] received a a lot of phone calls on his mobile. 'I pulled over so he could take it and he said I had to get home quick because my home was on fire. 'I . thought it was probably just a little toaster fire in the kitchen but . he drove me back home and when I got back I saw the state of it, I . realised just how serious it was. The fire ripped through the terraced house in Newton Heath, Manchester, gutting the first floor and attic . Courtney was praised by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue for her quick-thinking actions . The fire started when a second-hand television, bought only two months earlier, burst into flames moments after Lucreice Ratcliffe had finished playing a video game . Courtney picked up one-year-old Summer Poppy from her cot and guided her younger siblings away from the fire . 'I was frantic thinking about my kids and whether they were safe, and as we pulled up there was Courtney holding Summer Poppy and the rest of them standing with her. 'Seeing the damage to the house was heartbreaking - I can't believe a TV did so much damage. 'Pretty much everything has been destroyed - including their school uniforms. 'We're in temporary accommodation now but I don't know how long it will be before we can move back in there - the place was gutted. 'I'm heartbroken, particularly about the things that can't be replaced like pictures of the kids when they were babies. 'I'm devastated and I've lost everything but I'm just so proud of what Courtney did, she was brilliant. 'She got her sisters and just got out of there.' Neighbours have rallied round to make sure the family has everything they need, including a pram and baby clothes, and are looking after their remaining possessions after they were burgled after the fire. Because the blaze had taken hold of the entire first floor and attic, fire crews had to use a thermal imaging camera and cutting away equipment to ensure it was entirely out. Councillor David Acton, Chairman of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority, said: 'What Courtney did is absolutely amazing. 'It is terrible that the family have lost so much in this fire but, thanks to their sister's calm response, they all got out safely and still have each other. 'It's frightening to think what could've happened if there hadn't been a working smoke alarm and if Courtney had not reacted in the way she did. 'Firefighters can help you with safety in the home by talking about escape plans and fitting smoke alarms when they come out to do a Home Safety Check. 'If you haven't had one, please let Sarah's story prompt you to do so.'","Courtney Ratcliffe, 12, led her younger brother and three sisters to safety .

"By . Sam Adams . UPDATED: . 09:30 EST, 11 January 2013 . Death: A federal appeals court will decide whether photographs of the body of former al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden should be made public . Gruesome images of Osama Bin Laden's body following his death at the hands of US Navy Seals could be made public if a court rules in favour of their release. The autopsy and burial photos of the former al-Qaeda leader have been classified since he was shot dead during the dramatic May 2011 raid on his compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. A lower court has already upheld the . government's argument that the photos should remain secret in the . interest of national security, according to Westwingreports.com. But a federal appeals court is now considering whether the 52 pictures should be released following a lawsuit filed by the conservative-leaning legal watchdog, Judicial Watch. The group says it is not seeking any information about equipment or techniques used in the raid. President Barack Obama said the photos' release could provoke violence against US citizens. During an appearance on the '60 Minutes' show on CBS he said it was important to ensure that 'very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence or as a propaganda tool.' After bin Laden was killed the Obama administration said his body was buried at sea off the USS Carl Vinson - in accordance with Islamic tradition. The raid itself was completed shortly after 1 am local time when bin Laden was shot once in the chest and once in the head by a U.S Navy Seal who announced 'For God and country Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo', because Geronimo was the code-name given to the al-Qaeda leader. President Obama himself said in the White House Situation Room watching events unfold, 'We got him.' On TV: Bin Laden is shown watching himself on television in this video frame grab released by the U.S. Pentagon May 7, 2011, six days after his death .

Unwanted: Pesky pythons released into the wild by misanthropic pet owners are ravaging south Florida's ecosystem by apparently eating everything in sight . Release the hounds! Florida officials plan to host an ole'-fashioned snake hunt - intended to root out the state's population of ravenous Burmese pythons, which is ravaging the Everglades by eating everything in sight. The great 'Python challenge' of 2013 is open any wrangler with the $25 contest fee, the 30 minutes necessary to complete an online course, and the stomach to tromp through a reedy landscape in search of carnivorous snakes that can grow to as big as 18 feet in length. 'Whichever method they use, hunters have an ethical obligation to dispatch the snake as humanely as possible,' Carli Segelson, a spokeswoman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, told FoxNews.com. Nearly 400 hardy souls have already enlisted in the unorthodox, month-long competition, which begins Jan. 12.  Its rules mandate that hunters leave the captured pythons at official drop-off sites within 24 hours of their being caught. 'We are also using the Challenge to gauge the effectiveness of using an incentive-based model as one tool to address a challenging invasive species management problem,' Segelson reoportedly said. Lengthy carnivore: Some pythons grow to up to 18 feet in length. They kill by squeezing prey - and then swallowing them whole . Big money: Florida officials are offering a $1,500 prize for the lucky party that bags the largest python . Burmese pythons are not thought to be dangerous to humans, although larger specimens can conceivably overwhelm an adult . But not everyone thinks such a bizarre solution to Florida's pesky python problem is in the state, the snakes', or the hunters' best interests. 'Despite what has been portrayed in popular reality television shows, the Burmese pythons in the Everglades can be extremely dangerous when provoked,' Melissa Coakley, a spokeswoman for the Florida-based Suncoast Herpetological Society, told FoxNews.com. 'It takes a great deal of hands-on practice before one is able to master the art of catching and safely handling large constrictors. There is also the danger of hunters unwittingly killing native snakes while in the Everglades.' We'll take that: A company that makes alligator-skin clothing and furniture is reportedly looking to grab the largest snakes captured during the hunt . Coakley added the contest, complete with a $1,500 cash prize for the largest wrangled constrictor, might convince some clever participants to merely purchase a python out-of-state on the cheap - and then submit it as one captured in the Everglades. However, the FWC reportedly said it will put an unspecified number of game wardens on the ground in the Everglades region to ensure hunters are following the rules, as well as, staying safe. 'Despite what has been portrayed in . popular reality television shows, the Burmese pythons in the Everglades . can be extremely dangerous when provoked' FoxNews.com reports that Burmese pythons are generally not dangerous to humans because the snakes are often afraid of their greater height. Still, the website reports that snakes are capable of killing a child and some experts say the larger pythons could even overpower - and kill - an adult in certain circumstances. The Burmese python kills by squeezing its prey, then swallowing it. Hungry snakes: The pythons have reportedly ravaged south Florida's ecosystem by gobbling up deer, bobcats and raccoons . All American Gator, which harvests wild alligators for use in clothing, accessories and furniture, reportedly has said it will buy larger pythons captured during the hunt. 'Aside from the obvious goal of reducing the Burmese python population in the Everglades,' Segelson reportedly said, 'we also hope to educate the public about Burmese pythons in Florida and how people can help limit the impact of this and other invasive species in Florida.' Florida's python problem apparently stems from a few misanthropes who once harbored the snakes as pets - but then released them into the wild. The snakes typically feed on the Everglades' indigenous populations of raccoons, deer and bobcats. For its part, FoxNews.com reports there could be as many as tens of thousands of the snakes residing in the Everglades.","Nearly 400 people already paid $25 entrance fee for contest .

Billionaire financier Nat Rothschild has lost his battle to regain control of beleaguered coal mining firm Bumi. In a high-stakes meeting, the scion of the banking dynasty failed to get shareholders to support his plan to oust the company’s management and install himself as a director. He was defeated in the showdown despite bringing along a high-profile supporter in the form of his mother, Lady Rothschild. The humbling result marks the end of the latest chapter in an acrimonious saga that pitted him against a branch of his own family. Bumi’s board was advised by NM Rothschild, the family bank from which Nat’s father Lord Rothschild split three decades ago. But the family connection was of little help to Mr Rothschild, who City sources said had ‘tarnished’ his reputation in the financial investment community. He convinced investors to plough £707million into his venture, which bought Indonesian mines to sell coal to rapidly-industrialising Far East countries. The value of the FTSE-listed company has plunged by £1.4billion since July 2011, leaving those investors fuming. David Buik, of traders Cantor Index, said: ‘His ability to attract money into other emerging ideas is going to prove very difficult.’ But Mr Rothschild insisted he would not be deterred from launching more multi-million pound investment schemes, saying: ‘You must not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.’ Hopeful: Mr Rothschild is seen arriving at a Bumi shareholder meeting in London . The Bumi soap opera saw Mr Rothschild locked in a fierce war with the company’s board and powerful Indonesian political dynasty the Bakrie family, with whom he founded the company. During the shareholder meeting, held at the Honourable Artillery Company in London, burly security guards patrolled the entrances and exits, wearing black trench coats and whispering into walkie-talkies. But barring an accusation from Mr Rothschild that Bumi boss Nick von Schirnding ‘couldn’t operate a tobacco kiosk, let alone  a coal mine’, the event was generally peaceful. Mr Rothschild made 22 proposals but was outvoted on all but three. The proposal that secured the least support of all was his suggestion that he join the company’s board.","Nat Rothschild failed in his bid to oust company management .

The founder of clothing giant Boden was shocked when his dog discovered human remains during a walk in the park. Johnnie Boden, whose label is a favourite with middle-class parents and celebrities such as Michelle Obama and Angelina Jolie, made the grisly find after his terrier, Sprout, bounded into undergrowth while the pair were out for a stroll near Wormwood Scrubs jail, West London. When the dog failed to reappear after several minutes, the 51-year-old Old  Etonian scrambled through the thick scrub at Wormwood Scrubs Park in Acton, where he discovered a human skull, a pair of boots, and clothes. Grim find: Johnnie Boden's dog Sprout discovered human remains during a walk in a park near Wormwood Scrubs prison . Police immediately cordoned off the area and are awaiting the results of DNA tests to establish the identity of the body. Mr Boden, who set up the clothing firm more than 20 years ago and counts David Cameron and Nick Clegg as clients, said: ‘Sprout shot off and disappeared into the undergrowth.  I thought there must have been a fox or a badger nearby and I stood by the scrub calling for Sproutie, but she wouldn’t come out. 'When she failed to emerge, I had to plunge into the heath and scramble through it in search of her. ‘I was like Harrison Ford – my arms were cut to pieces. I made my way through this almost impenetrable scrub and then I saw a single deserted boot. It was a Timberland walking boot, of quite recent vintage. 'I was like Harrison Ford': Mr Boden found a human skull, as well as an anorak and a pair of boots after scrambling through the heath in search of his dog . Shock: The Old Etonian scrambled through undergrowth in the shadow of the prison after Sprout failed to reappear . ‘In the next split-second I looked . down and saw an anorak, a pair of high-tech  performance trousers and a . skull with hair still on it. ‘It . was odd because there was no flesh but the clothing appeared to be . quite new.

Tycoon: Mr Boden counts Michelle Obama and David Cameron as clients . ‘My . main reaction was one of sadness, that someone had died there. What an . end. I called the police and they came in great numbers. Helicopters . were buzzing round and round, and officers on the ground  cordoned off . the scene.’ Mr Boden, whose firm sells £250 million of clothes a year, added: ‘I was rather late for a meeting at Boden but I was able to excuse myself by saying, “I’m terribly sorry I’m late, but my dog found a dead body near Wormwood Scrubs.” I have to say I regard it as one of my best lines. ‘When I went back a few days later the area was still cordoned off. I do hope  the police find out who it is and are able to get in touch with the family.’ Locals said the spot where the remains were found on January 30 was popular with homeless people. Several empty cans of Polish lager were found at the scene, as well as supermarket pallets that appeared to have been used for makeshift seating. Retail worker Emily Salmon, 45, who lives next to the park and walks her dog there, said: ‘I saw a white police tent at  the spot and there were lots of officers in the area. It’s scary to think a body has been found right next to where we live. ‘I’ve often seen homeless people who sit there and drink, and it’s a place I would not walk my dog late at night.’ A spokesman for Scotland Yard confirmed human remains had been found at the park on January 30 and said officers were awaiting the results of DNA tests to establish the identity of the victim.

"By . Michael Berkeley . PUBLISHED: . 17:02 EST, 23 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:25 EST, 23 February 2013 . Horrified: Composer and Radio 3 presenter Michael Berkeley says finding out a handful of music teachers had abused their position of trust with students was a 'bitter blow' For those of us who have been fighting hard to sustain funding for music education (and to keep it on the school syllabus) it came as a particularly bitter blow to find that a handful of teachers had regularly abused their position of trust with young and vulnerable students. Some of the stories that have emerged are horrific and reveal systematic and serial sexual abuse that has tarnished, even wrecked, young lives. The schools and colleges at the centre of recent scandals have in fact produced players of exceptional talent - and still do - so let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water. You rarely work with an orchestra or ensemble these days without seeing players trained at Chethams, The Purcell School or the Royal Northern College of Music and it must be said that the majority of the staff are dedicated and gifted teachers. For them, however, it is essential that these institutions now give parents and students the confidence that not only their musical disciplines are in good order but also the conduct of all of their staff. That is why a group of distinguished musicians and the Children’s Commissioner, Tim Loughton, have demanded that there be a full inquiry into how the abuse at Chethams was able to happen. When a gifted and leading pianist like Paul Lewis says that teacher/pupil abuse was widespread in his day at Chethams but that no one was prepared to risk their prospects by speaking out it becomes obvious that the pernicious culture of ‘cover up rather than face up’ exists not only in institutions like the NHS but also in music education. I am reliably informed that, as with Savile, more widespread abuse will soon come to light. The gravity of the problem and its repercussions was all too vividly demonstrated in the tragic case of Frances Andrade, a Chetham pupil who, following her testimony and cross-examination in the trial of music teacher, Michael Brewer, committed suicide. It is essential to grasp how, in music tuition in particular, opportunities for errant teachers arise. Tragic: The gravity of the problem and its repercussions was all too vividly demonstrated in the case of Frances Andrade who committed suicide following her testimony and cross-examination in the trial of music teacher Michael Brewer . Let us imagine a young girl (though it could easily be a boy) whose life revolves around making music, who practises for many hours a day to such an extent that music is her entire life. At its centre is the charismatic teacher who can do all the things she aspires to, who can show her  that the angle of her bowing arm needs adjusting, who plays duets with her and in so doing gets into an intimate exchange of ideas and nuance. He explains that to make music she must listen to his every phrase and answer it with a corresponding one of her own. Very soon the language is verging on the sensuous and flirtatious in much the same way that young dancers cannot but practice the physical intimacy of their craft. The fact that music transcends words is part of its magic – nothing speaks more powerfully than the music itself. Indeed, on Private Passions, the . programme I present every Sunday on Radio 3, well-known people talk . about the music that is important to them and, whether they are . discussing Bach, Tchaikovsky or Wagner, are frequently reduced to tears . and often use the word ‘orgasmic’ because this wonderful art form takes . us so deeply inside ourselves. Probe:  Children's Commissioner Tim Loughton, left, has demanded that there be a full inquiry into the abuse at prestigious Chethams, while pianist Paul Lewis, right, says that it was widespread while he was there . If we can lay bare our soul in simply listening to music, imagine the emotions involved in actually playing it. Our young violinist, then, still hardly formed as a person, is confronting profound feelings in the presence of a teacher who has begun to take on a guru-like importance in her life. These are precisely the conditions that have been described by some of the victims. When the teacher oversteps the boundaries,  “Imagine you are playing this naked” was one such remark, begins to touch the pupil in a way that is clearly moving into the realms of the improper and suggests meeting for a drink, the girl is confused. This is her teacher, after all, the person she trusts and admires. Probe: The prestigious Chethams School of Music in Manchester, where Francis Andrade was abused by teacher Michael Brewer . That is when guilt begins to kick in – . ‘it must somehow be my fault and while part of me dislikes it part of . me is excited by it therefore I must be complicit.’ The stage is now . horribly set. The recent . case of the abused girls in Rochdale is worth recalling because even . without the heady mix of making music these kids, who were met at the . school gates by their groomers, somehow felt that they should repay in . kind the goodies, the cigarettes,  the alcohol that had been lavished on . them and made them feel that they were living a more sophisticated life . than their largely impoverished 14 years had previously seen. ‘We just thought it was the price we had to pay,’ one of them said when describing how she was abused, indeed raped, by not just one but a whole group of now convicted men. Guilty: Former musical director of Chetham's School Michael Brewer and his ex-wife Hilary Kay Brewer, right, sexually assaulted former student Francis Andrade . As with the adolescent and gyrating girls who streamed into the Top of the Pops studio fuelled by a rush of intoxicating music and a glimpse of their pop heroes plus celebrities like Jimmy Savile, the promise of being grown up, of mixing with the famous, opens children to predatory adults. It need not be like this: I worked as a young treble with my Godfather, Benjamin Britten, and though he clearly felt more at ease with children, boys in particular, and though much of his work is obsessed with the theme of the corruption of innocence he never showed anything but completely acceptable  affection towards me and my colleagues. However, we were in such awe of him and his gifts, I can well imagine the confusion we would have felt had he sought to take advantage of our hero worship. Guilt is the predominant psychological driving force that makes life an ongoing misery for young victims of abuse. It’s almost as though the abuser . transfers his or her guilt to the victim because in most of these cases . there seems little remorse when people like Michael Brewer are brought . to justice. Curiously, . these are similar to the emotions described by survivors of the . holocaust. It is not simply the guilt of surviving where so many others . did not but that victims of violence and abuse feel permanently tainted, . soiled by the darkness that they have been exposed to. One . of the reasons that the Royal Northern College of Music has been . brought into the fray is that despite the then distinguished Head of . Piano Studies, Martin Roscoe, warning the Principal that the person he . was considering appointing as Head of Strings, Malcolm Layfield, had a . bad reputation as a result of his behaviour when teaching at Chethams, . the RNCM still saw fit to go ahead with the appointment.

Maestro: A computer has created a remix of of the second movement of Beethoven's 7th Symphony which is to be played in public for the first time tonight . It's enough to make Beethoven roll over in his grave. A computer programme that composes music by monitoring a person's emotional response to sounds, is to have one of its musical creations performed by a full chamber orchestra at a prestigious music festival tonight. Using its artificial intelligence, the silicon songsmith has produced a remix of the second movement of Beethoven's 7th Symphony, which will be performed by the The Ten Tors Orchestra at the Peninsula Arts Contemporary Music Festival in Plymouth. Researchers played the German . composer's seminal piece to three test subjects as they underwent MRI . scans while the programme monitored their brains for emotional . indicators. Then using a programmed knowledge of music, it generated a new piece designed to create a similar emotional response. The project, which has been compared . to IBM's Deep Blue chess computer, is being led by Dr Eduardo Miranda, a . professor at Plymouth University's Interdisciplinary Centre for . Computer Music Research (ICCMR), and Dr Slawomir Nasuto, a professor in . the Cybernetics Research Group at the University of Reading. Dr Miranda told the Independent: 'We all know music affects mood but we don't really know how. 'We want to see if we can find musical . melodies or rhythms which elicit specific moods. Which kind of musical . features in composition elicit physical signatures in brain patterns? Our project is to build a new system for musical composition.' The three volunteers - a ballerina, a . Gulf War veteran and Dr Miranda himself - were chosen in an attempt to . obtain a broad cross-section of brain types. The computer programme monitors people's emotional response to music as they are being subjected to an MRI scan. The composition is to be performed by a chamber orchestra at a prestigious music festival tonight . While the ballerina's created mostly rhythmic deviations from the original piece, Dr Miranda's produced mostly harmonic deviations - possibly due to the fact he is also a composer. He added: 'With the classical ballerina there was a lot of activation around the motor cortex because she listens to music based on the kind of movement she can make. 'I deconstructed the 2nd Movement and reassembled and modified the rhythms and melodies based on information from the brain scans.' Dr Miranda believes the programme has potential theraputic applications and could be used too treat depression without resorting to drugs. It could also be used in the entertainment industry and in advertising by inducing a desired emotion when presented alongside a particular product or service.","Piece was created by monitoring volunteers as they underwent MRI scans .

The family of an air-stewardess killed in 9/11 have hit out at the makers of Oscar-nominated Zero Dark Thirty for using her voice without their permission. The opening of the hit film, directed by Kathryn Bigelow and starring nominated actress Jessica Chastain, features the voice of Betty Ann Ong recorded on a call just before her American Airlines flight hit the north tower of the World Trade Center. The terrified stewardess called into her company's operations center to tell them the plane had been hijacked. Scroll down for video . Complaint: The brother of stewardess Betty Ann Ong, left, has spoken of his anger that her voice, recorded moments before her plane hit the World Trade Center, right, was used in the opening of Zero Dark Thirty . Controversy: Five time Academy Award nominated Zero Dark Thirty has found itself in controversy since its release. A 9/11 victim's family are the latest to speak against the film . The family of the 45-year-old Massachusetts flight attendant said they want a public apology from the film-makers at tomorrow's ceremony and a donation to a charity set up in her name, according to the New York Times. They also want the film's distributors Sony Pictures Entertainment to state on their website and on the film that the Ong family does not condone torture. Betty's brother Harry Ong told the newspaper: 'I thought it was just outrageous, and totally poor judgment, and an abuse of the voices.' The five-time Academy Award nominated film is based on the hunt to find Osama Bin Laden and his ultimate shooting in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2 2011. With the tagline: 'The story of history's greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man' it follows the work of determined agent Maya, based on a real CIA operative who masterminded the US's discovery of the Al Qaeda chief. The film has faced plenty of criticism since its opening - not least through its depiction of water-boarding and other torture in the CIA's attempt to find Bin Laden.

The family reportedly wrote with their complaints to the film's writer and producer, Mark Boal, on February 15. Mr Boal, who won a Writer's Guild Award for Best Original Screenplay, would only email a one line response to the newspaper. 'As the 9/11 commission justly proclaimed, Betty Ong is without a doubt one of our national heroes,' it read. Sony Pictures claims both Mr Boal and the film's director have been in close contact with victims families - many of whom have been invited to private screenings. 'Zero Dark Thirty, is in some small way, a tribute to those forever affected by the attacks,' it said.

Adam Lanza, the young man who grow up to kill 27 people, including 20 school children and his own mother, is seen for the first time as a four-year-old boy in a family video. In home video obtained exclusively by the Hartford Courant and PBS’ Frontline, a young Lanza is seen in 1996 at a police demonstration with the Scouts. The young Lanza wanders through the woods as his mother, Nancy, tells him off camera to bark like a dog, imitating the dog barks around him. A family friend also revealed that there was ‘a weirdness about him,’ saying that Lanza hated to be touched, whether it was a pat on the back or a high five from a classmate. Scroll down for video . A joint report from the Hartford Courant and PBS' Frontline have uncovered a home video of Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza when he was four (file photo) Josh Kovner, left, and Alaine Griffin, center, from the Hartford Courant, spoke to TODAY's Savannah Guthrie on their investigation into Lanza's life . The Frontline program, ‘Raising Adam Lanza,’ airs tonight on PBS at 10pm EST, and will offer interviews with the family and friends of the Lanzas and attempt to explain the beginnings of how the 20-year-old could go and commit one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history. Nancy once told close family friend Marvin LaFontaine not to touch Adam, as he displayed deep discomfort from human contact. ‘There was a weirdness about him,’ he told Frontline, saying that his handicap was putting a large stress on his mother. ‘She didn’t know what to do.’ He was also diagnosed with sensory integration disorder, a condition that makes it hard to respond and react to sensory stimulation. The condition is not widely known, and experts are divided over the condition. When he reached school age, Lanza had trouble fitting in, and as a result, his mother shuffled him from one special needs program to another, taking him in and out of various schools. Lanza, center, pictured in an undated yearbook photo . The special Frontline episode will also examine the complicated life of the shooter's mother, Nancy Lanza, who was his first victim on December 14 . It is thought that Nancy was planning a move from their house in Newtown, pictured, for Washington state to find a place for Adam to go to college . ‘We wanted to learn about Nancy Lanza,’ the Hartford Courant’s Alaine Griffin told the TODAY show. ‘She had done a number of things to get Adam in the right place. She actually was trying to do the right thing by Adam, whether or not that was the right thing.’ She explained that Nancy Lanza’s place in the shooting is embattled – while she was shot in the head at close range on December 14, she was not included in the memorials for the 20 students and six Sandy Hook staffers killed on that day in Newtown. Ms Griffin added that many think of Nancy as an extreme survivalist who let her son’s issues mutate until she could not control him – and suffered fatal consequences. Others sympathize with a mother who tried to give her son the help he needed but could not give him the care his condition required. A new report also claims that Lanza, 20, targeted Sandy Hook Elementary School because he believed it was the best place for him to shoot as many people as possible to rival the 77 lives claimed by Norwegian extremest Anders Behring Breivik in 2011. A new report suggests that Lanza, who killed 27 people, meant to top the number of murders committed by Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik, right, in 2011 . Lanza targeted two first grade classrooms at Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 20 students as well as six teachers and administrators on December 14 . Breivik also targeted young people in his 2011 mass shooting in Norway, killing 69 at a youth summer camp organized by the Labor Party and eight more in a car bombing . CBS News quotes two anonymous officials with inside knowledge of the police investigation as saying Sandy Hook offered the 'easiest target' and the 'largest cluster of people' for him to attack. The Connecticut State Police dismissed the CBS report as 'pure speculation' and said the assertions about Breivik are not true. Lanza left no note explaining his motives and smashed his hard drive before for the shooting, leaving few clues about why he killed his mother Nancy Lanza in her bed and then shot his way through the school. Police believe Lanza may have been playing out a scenario in one of his favorite video games and was obsessed with achieving a higher 'score' than Breivik by killing even more people, according to CBS. Both Lanza and Breivik apparently shared a love of the Call of Duty - the realistic combat shooting game and used it as 'training' for the deadly massacres. Detectives found thousands of dollars worth of video games in a den with darkened windows where Lanza spent hours playing. Both killers also used American-made .223-caliber assault rifles. Breivik armed himself with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle. Lanza used a Bushmaster AR-15. The murders of 20 first graders and six teachers shocked the nation and horrified the quiet community of Newtown . Breivik seen walking with a gun in hand among bodies on Utoeya island in 2011; Police believe Lanza may have been obsessed with achieving a higher 'score' than Breivik by killing even more people, according to CBS . Breivik, 32 at the time, shocked the world in July 2011 . when he planted a car bomb in downtown Oslo, Norway, and then attacked a . summer camp run by the country's Labor Party. Eight people died in the bomb blast and 204 were injured. Breivik shot dead 67 people and wounded 33 more. He was later taken alive by police and said he carried out the attacks to combat socialism and the immigration of Muslims to Norway. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, though his prison term can be extended every five years, meaning it is highly unlikely Breivik will ever be released. Unlike Breivik, Lanza would not be taken alive. He reportedly fired several rounds at police cars as they arrived on the scene, and then shot himself in the head. He was found dead by police who swept through the school building . Along with the video games, Lanza also learned how to fire guns during numerous sessions with his . mother at a shooting range, where the two 'bonded, the Hartford Courant . reported on Sunday. Her landscaper, Dan Holmes, told the paper: 'She said she took her kids target shooting, that they bonded over that.' Nancy was seen as a dedicated . mother to Adam, who had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and a . sensory integration disorder - an aversion to bright lights and loud . noises. She had enrolled and pulled Adam into . numerous schools over the years after growing unsatisfied with the . education he was receiving.

Fourth row: Grace McDonnell, James Mattioli, Avielle Richman, Rachel Davino, Anne Marie Murphy. Fifth row: Lauren Rousseau, Mary Sherlach, Victoria Soto, Dawn Hochsprung, Nancy Lanza . She was planning a move to Washington state with the hopes of getting her son back into a college program. But Lanza also received an education on weapons from his mother, who took him target shooting at a gun range for years. Richard . Novia, a security chief in the Newtown School system who moderated the . tech club - of which Adam had been a member - said he disagreed with . Nancy Lanza's recreation with her son. He told the Courant: 'It's a serious mistake, first of all.

A mother  has told of her agony when she discovered police kept her baby’s brain for 13 years. Hannah Cheevers’s son Rhys died of a heart defect two days after he was born in 1998 and his family gave consent for a post-mortem examination. They were not told that police had kept his brain at Southampton General  Hospital until two officers recently knocked on her door to inform her. Hannah Cheevers said two officers knocked on her door 'totally out of the blue' to admit that her son's brain had been held at Southampton General Hospital for 13 years . Baby Rhys died when he was just two days old and his family gave consent for a post-mortem examination to take place - but they 'assumed he had been buried in tact' Her son is one of 89 children whose . body parts were kept by police, according to an Association of Chief . Police Officers (ACPO) audit. Last year, the research showed police forces across the country held almost 500 body parts dating back about 50 years. The storage of child body parts echoes . the scandal at Liverpool’s Alder Hey Hospital, where organs from nearly . 3,000 youngsters were ‘harvested’ and kept without consent in the early . 1990s. Miss Cheevers, 35, said: ‘We had his . funeral, we got on with our lives as you have to and 13 years later we . have a knock on the door from the Dorset police to inform us that his . brain has been retained at Southampton hospital.’ She said she ‘did not know really how . to take it’ and added: ‘We assumed he had been buried intact. We had . absolutely no idea that they had kept his brain.’ Police told the mother-of-five from Wimborne, Dorset, that Rhys’s brain had been kept in storage, but could not tell her why. Police could not explain to Mrs Cheevers why her son's brain had been kept in storage at Southampton General for so long . She said: ‘They told us tissue from Rhys had been retained. I thought they meant a sliver of  tissue on a slide. ‘Then they said it was his whole . brain. I was shocked. I was never told about this and if they had asked . my permission I would have said “no”. ‘They wouldn’t tell me why it had been . kept and they said nothing had been done to it. It was dreadful. I had a . new baby in my arms and it brought it all back.’ Parents of children whose body parts were stored at Southampton General are desperate for an explanation. The hospital has said it acted only as a ‘storage facility’ for Dorset police, the Home Office or the coroner. After post-mortem examinations in criminal cases, body parts are often stored until trial dates are set. There was no criminal  element to these cases, but most of the babies did have post-mortem examinations. A hospital spokesman said: ‘There is no wrongdoing on behalf of the hospital trust.’ Miss Cheevers said her family had now . decided to donate Rhys’s brain to hospital research after being told . other options were to have it destroyed or buried with his body. She . added: ‘I didn’t want another funeral. I’ve got other children now. It’s . a difficult thing to talk about and I didn’t want to have to explain to . my young children why we had to have a funeral. ‘And I didn’t really want him dug up to have his brain put with him. ‘I just don’t like the thought of  having a child dug up after they have been buried for 13 years.’ Southampton General Hospital said that . after post-mortem examinations, the coroner or forensic officers may . ask for organs to be retained in case they are needed for further . investigation. The hospital said it holds specimens until the police or . coroner give further instructions. The cases were uncovered in an ACPO audit as a result of new, stricter laws on storing human  tissue and organs. Police forces nationwide have been ordered to draw up lists of all post-mortem samples kept  in storage.","Rhys Cheevers' brain was held at Southampton General Hospital after he died just two days old .

Harry, 28, is already due to fly out to Africa next week on a three day-visit to Lesotho with his charity, Sentebale. He will also be guest of honour at a black tie fundraising dinner in Johannesburg on the way home. New couple: Prince Harry and Girlfriend Cressida Bonas enjoying a romantic ski-ing break in Switzerland . Sources say he is considering staying on afterwards to join ‘Cressie’ and the rest of her family for the event, which is set to be the wedding of the year. His cousins, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, who are close to Sam and his sister, Holly, and are holidaying with Harry this week, are also expected to attend. The prince is said to be ‘smitten’ with the beautiful blonde, whom he began dating last summer before he was dispatched to the frontline in Afghanistan as an Apache attack helicopter pilot. Embrace: Harry is rumored to be meeting Cressida's parents at the wedding of Richard Branson's son . He reportedly bombarded her with . letters, emails and calls while he was away and the pair have rekindle . their fledging relationship on his return. Yesterday the Mail published pictures of them openly embracing on the slopes of upmarket ski resort Verbier in front of other holidaymakers and told how they had passionately kissed at a dinner to celebrate the birthday of the prince’s uncle, Prince Andrew, the night before. Sources say the couple partied until the early hours in a private booth at the Casbah nightclub afterwards, barely able to keep their hands off each other. After partying until 3.30am on Tuesday a shirtless - and apparently very drunk - Harry climbed through a small rear window in order to avoid waiting photographers spotting him with his girlfriend.‘He was off his face by the time he even arrived here,’ said a member of staff. ‘The kept him in a booth in the nightclub and pulled a curtain around it but he kept trying to escape. He even took his shirt off. ‘We had to take them [Harry and Cressida] through the window afterwards because all the paps were outside.’ Cressida is the daughter of Lady Mary Gaye Georgina Lorna Curzon, a banking heiress who was the most celebrated socialite of her day with a complicated marital history. The daughter of the 6th Earl Howe, and a godson of King Edward V11, she has been married and divorced four times and has five children with three of her husbands. Cressida was the product of her third marriage to Old Harrovian entrepreneur Jeffrey Bonas, which ended in divorce after six years in 1994. In action: Harry has been enjoying himself since he returned from duty in Afghanistan . His divorce proceedings resulted in him paying his ex-wife £1.2million. For a time after her mother's fourth . marriage to multi-millionaire financier Christopher Shaw, Cressida lived . at the National Trust-owned stately home Hinton Ampner, in Hampshire, . where Shaw held the lease.

They said ex-Conservative Party treasurer Michael Spencer, boss of international broking giant ICAP, was under active consideration to be sent to the House of Lords by the Prime Minister. In a long-awaited announcement, Mr Cameron is expected in the next few months to create up to 35 new Tory peers as part of a bid to ‘even up the odds’ with Labour in the House of Lords. Michael Spencer pictured with his partner Sarah, Marchioness of Milford Haven, is set to be made a peer . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg may be allocated 15 new  Liberal Democrat peers – with major party donor Rumi Verjee, the businessman who brought  Domino’s Pizza to the UK, expected to be among them. Last night, Mr Spencer, who was Conservative treasurer from 2006 to 2010 and has given more than £3 million to the party, was named as one of the potential Tory peers. Businessman and Liberal Democrat donor, Rumi Verjee, could also be made a peer . A senior party source said: ‘Nothing is decided yet but Michael is very likely to get a peerage in the next round. He’s a serious business figure and he worked very hard to raise money for the party.’ However, The Mail on Sunday understands the move has sparked surprise among Tories – not least  as it was confirmed only last month that ICAP is being investigated  in connection with the Libor rate-rigging scandal. The tycoon, whose partner is Sarah, Marchioness of Milford Haven, also controversially off-loaded £45 million in shares  from the firm weeks before their value plunged and later admitted using £15 million of shares as security for a loan without telling the stock market. However, Mr Spencer has previously insisted he did not act improperly over either share transaction. It is not the first time Mr Spencer, a personal friend of Mr Cameron, has been linked with a peerage. In 2010, there were repeated suggestions he would be sent to the Lords. But last night, the senior party source claimed he was unaware of any major reason that the ex-party treasurer was not ennobled. He said: ‘I know there was speculation in the past which didn’t materialise but I don’t see any reason he should not get one this time. ‘Michael has supported the  party for a very long time. He’s  a senior business person and as treasurer he worked hard to raise funds for us.’ Mr Spencer’s firm ICAP confirmed last month it was being quizzed by City watchdogs over the Libor rate-rigging affair.","Michael Spencer, boss of ICAP, and ex Tory treasurer is set to become a peer .

Many overweight people are suffering from 'fat blindness', say experts . Britons are increasingly suffering from 'fat blindness' and are failing to lose weight until they are obese, experts have warned. Only when the scales tip 13st 10lb does the average person decide that enough is enough, new figures show. And seeing unflattering photographs is the first things that stirs us into action. Statistics from Weight Watchers, . which records the start weights of all new members - primarily women, but . also some men -  reveal the average start . weight has risen steadily from just over 12 stone in 1989 to 13st 10lb today, . an increase of more than 10 per cent. In Body Mass Index (BMI) terms, the average new member's reading has increased from 29.2 to 32. This means that the average new Weight Watchers member, of whom there were more than 850,000 in the UK last year, is now already obese by the time they join. A quarter of the population has a BMI which classifies them as obese (a reading of 30 to 34.9) compared with 11 per cent ten years ago. This steady weight gain over the last 20 years, and our inability to acknowledge when we reach an unhealthy weight, supports the government's findings that obesity is rapidly becoming a primary health and economic threat for our modern society. In fact, over 90 per cent of people in a recent independent study struggled to identify an obese body. Even more alarming is that 68 per cent of obese people questioned didn't even know they were obese. Inspiration: Looking at unflattering photos can be the final straw . Alarming figures released yesterday . by the NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre show that 65 per . cent of men and 58 per cent of women now classed as overweight or obese. Zoe Hellman, Head of Public Health at Weight Watchers said: 'The inability to recognise what an overweight or obese body looks like, is a symptom of how out of touch we are with a healthy weight and shape. 'We're suffering from ""fat blindness"", which is causing people to delay seeking help until they are significantly overweight. According to Weight Watchers, members top seven triggers for losing weight are: . Unflattering photos . Poor health . Friends or family losing weight . Not wanting to be fat for a milestone birthday . Wanting to keep up with children or grandchildren . Being called names in the street . Getting married . 'Where obesity was the exception, sadly it is rapidly becoming the rule. 'It's time to buck the trend. We're here to help people make a positive change in their lives by teaching them to make smarter, better informed food choices for long term, sustainable weight loss. 'Though losing weight may be daunting, especially for those with a significant amount of weight to lose, dropping just 5-10 per cent of your body weight can significantly improve your health.' Ms Hellman added: 'It's natural to judge ourselves based on comparisons of those around us. 'So unfortunately, the more people who are overweight and obese, the more 'normal' it becomes. 'This phenomenon helps to make being overweight much more acceptable, reducing any pressure to make healthy lifestyle changes or seek support. 'It may also mean those who are overweight fail to recognise they have a problem with their weight at all.'","Average 'trigger' weight has risen more than a stone in a decade, according to Weight Watchers .

By the time she was 24 she had five children under six years old and weighed more than 16st. After a slipped disc following the birth of her youngest child, Joanna’s weight continued to rise and she was classified as obese.. Joanna, from Bangor, Northern Ireland, indulged her . sweet tooth by comfort eating and enjoying large portions.

I never thought I was eating too much. I was . constantly running around after my kids and snacking, so I didn’t . register what I was eating. 'My husband loved me when I was fat.  Every Saturday morning he went out . and bought me six pastries, which I used to eat with a cup of tea in bed. They were my downfall.

'About five . months before the surgery, the doctors told me I was obese. 'I . didn’t understand. The doctor showed me all these charts and all I could . hear was ‘you’re obese’ over and over again. It was like somebody had . broken a spell, that the thin woman I saw when I looked in the mirror, . was now a fat woman looking back.' By writing down everything she ate and drink per day, Joanna was able to see how her weight had ballooned . This was the wake up call Joanna said she needed. 'I went to the supermarket and filled the trolley full of treats and I came home and sat in front of the TV crying my eyes out, I knew it was time to do something about it,' she says. 'I knew I had to lose a couple of . stone before the operation, but I decided I may as well get down to the . weight I wanted to be. 'My GP told me to write down every single . thing I ate and drank for two weeks. That was an eye opener. He told me . my portion sizes were unbelievable.

He was always on my case about losing weight, and my . biggest regret is that he never got to see me at my best, he would have been so proud. So I did the race for him. Following the buzz of competing and finishing in just 26 minutes, Joanna was hooked on exercise. 'I pushed myself so hard, that after I ran through the finish line, I fell to my knees.

Steve Hirsch, founder and chairman of Vivid Entertainment, said the DVD distribution freeze is effective at once and will continue indefinitely. A major porn studio has stopped the distribution of a sex tape starring Mindy McCready following the singer's suicide. Steve Hirsch, founder and chairman of Vivid Entertainment, said the DVD distribution freeze is effective at once and will continue indefinitely. The tape, called the Baseball Mistress, featured McCready and her boyfriend at the time but it is not known exactly when it was shot. It was originally released by Vivid in 2010, after the singer appeared on Celebrity Rehab. In the tape, McCready discusses her . alleged affair with married baseball legend Roger Clemens, although the . singer said she never authorised the tape's release. Hirsch said it would be harder to . regulate the footage appearing online but that he planned to pull all . copies of the video from the Vivid website immediately, according to TMZ. Mindy McCready is the fifth former . contestant on 'Celebrity Rehab' who died within three years of appearing . on the television show. Since the country star was found at her cabin in Arkansas, the reality show . that she starred in has come under increased scrutiny. However, . McCready herself was possibly under scrutiny at the time of her death. Police were reportedly planning to question her about the death last month . of her boyfriend David Wilson, who was shot at the same Heber Spring, . Arkansas, home where McCready died. Tragic: Mindy McCready, 37, killed herself on the same front porch where her 'soulmate' David Wilson died on January 13 . It was revealed on Monday that McCready had been working on a suicide awareness video right before her death. Private investigator Danno Hanks told E! News the 37-year-old had asked him to work on a cover of I'll See You Yesterday which was written by Courtney Dashe, a fan of McCready's who wanted her to sing the song. Then on Saturday, the day before she was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at her Arkansas home, she sent him a frame for a video with a suicide hotline number. In the tape, McCready discusses her alleged affair with married baseball legend Roger Clemens . He said: 'She said she wanted to put . together this video to help people deal when someone had suffered a . suicide in their life and God, she was literally having me write her . suicide note. If I had known, I would have made . sure someone was there with her all the time. I thought she was talking . about sending a message about suicide for David's death but this is . unbelievable. 'She was sending me a message. I wish I had been more alert to what it . was. I just didn't think she would do this. She had two kids to live . for. I still can't fathom the whole thing.' McCready was also facing public scrutiny over the death of Wilson on January 13. Sheriff's deputies investigating the case had said the death was suspicious. They were planning to re-interview before she died, People magazine reports. McCready denied having anything to do with his death - calling David Wilson her . 'soulmate' - but police said unanswered questions remain. McCready . was allegedly in the house at the time of his death but she allegedly . did not hear the gun shot because the television was too loud. Following Wilson's death, she . attended court-ordered rehab and her two sons were put into foster care, . and they remained in the custody of the state at the time of her death.

A bullet signed by former Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle has been auctioned for $24,000, eight days after he was shot dead. Kyle, 37, who completed four tours in Iraq and wrote the best-selling book 'American Sniper', is believed to have been killed along with his friend by a fellow veteran earlier this month while at a North Texas gun range. Kyle was considered the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history. Shot dead: Former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle who was killed on a gun range in Texas . A bullet signed by Kyle was bought by Lubbock lawyer Allen Adkins after local Texas businessman Ron Betenbough offered it to him but only if Adkins could match his bid of $12,000. Adkins did exactly that, taking home the same type of bullet that was used in his 1.2mile kill of an enemy holding a rocket propelled grenade in Iraq. 'I cherish this in the sense that I'm honoured to be, even in a remote way like this, associated with a great American like that,' Adkins told American news channel KCBD. 'He was a very heroic person. He usually had one shot and if he didn't make his shot then he could be killed himself.' Chris Kyle pictured on duty. A bullet signed by the sniper sold for $24,000 . The bullet was donated for the auction by Congressman Randy Neugebauer before Kyle's death on February 2, but Adkins says that he would have paid the same amount regardless. 'I will tell you that whether he had passed away or not, I would've done the same thing. He was a hero while he was alive and I respect him just the same.' All of the money will go directly to the Heartline Women's Clinic which provides free services for women who are facing an unplanned pregnancy. Adkins said buying the bullet was honouring Kyle's legacy and that it was sad for the country to lose a hero. 'I put him on the caliber of George Washington. He was a very brave soldier, and hard times bring forth great men and that's what he was. He's a great man.' Kyle's flag-draped coffin was taken in a white hearse from his hometown of Midlothian, about 25 miles southwest of Dallas. Around 200 vehicles followed the procession. Many motorists pulled to the side of roads to watch the procession that included motorcycles, motor coaches, police cruisers and other vehicles throughout moments of light rain and even hail. In Austin, hundreds of people gathered on roads stretching nearly a mile from the cemetery. Many who came to watch the procession were combat veterans in leather jackets who parked their motorcycles three wide around the permitted area of the gravesite. Others were businessmen in suits on their lunch break from the nearby Capitol, families with strollers and at least one jogger taking a break from an afternoon run. An Iraq War veteran, Eddie Ray Routh, 25, has been charged with the killings of Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield. Iraq war veteran Eddie Ray Routh, left, is facing murder charges over the shootings of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a Texas shooting range . Routh's brother-in-law told authorities that Routh had recently been diagnosed with PTSD. Authorities say Kyle, Littlefield and Routh arrived together at the Rough Creek Lodge shooting range, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth, on the afternoon of February 2. Routh later fled in Kyle's truck. According to a search warrant, Routh told his sister and brother-in-law that the men 'were out shooting target practice and he couldn't trust them so he killed them before they could kill him.' On Monday, some 7,000 people attended a two-hour memorial service for Kyle at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington. Kyle's coffin was placed at the Dallas Cowboys' star at midfield. Crowds queued to enter the Cowboys Stadium so they could hear memories of a kind and loving family man, a practical joker and a proud veteran.

Family man: Taya Kyle holds the hands of her children while they walk behind the coffin of her husband Chris . His widow, Taya Kyle, told the crowd she was broken but that her family would 'put one foot in front of the other' to get through their grief. She said she told her two children that they will remember Kyle's silly side, Texas twang and the prayers they prayed together. The couple's children wrote heart-breaking tributes to him on the memorial program alongside pictures of their parents wedding day. 'You are the best dad ever. I never wanted you to die, I miss your heart', one of the messages simply signed by 'Baby Girl' from Kyle's daughter read. The other signed by 'Bubba' added: 'One of the best things that has happened to me is you. I love you dad. I always will.' Kyle, who also received two Silver Stars, had worked tirelessly to support his fellow comrades since leaving the Navy in 2009. The man dubbed the 'most lethal sniper in U.S. history' after killing 150 was the founder of a non-profit supporting veterans providing them with fitness equipment. He and Littlefield, who wasn't a military man, regularly took veterans to the shooting range in order to support them.","Chris Kyle was shot dead along with his friend on a North Texas gun range .

A group of workmen who panicked when a colleague fell to his death from a ladder, picked up his body, put it in their van and drove off into the country where they dumped the corpse, a coroner has heard. The builders had been working in a house in Cox Green, Maidenhead, on January 24 last year when it turned bitterly cold and decided to go to the shop to buy a bottle of vodka each. After downing the spirits at the building site, Ryszard Karpuc tried to climb down a ladder but fell, landing on his chest, breaking numerous ribs which punctured his lung. He died almost immediately. The inquest into Mr Karpuc's death heard that his colleagues then panicked, put his body in their van and drove off towards the countryside. Grizzly: Ryszard Karpuc's body was found in woodland near the village of Beaconsfield (pictured) in Buckinghamshire . However, the van became stuck, so the men took out the body and left it in nearby woodland. It was discovered four days later on Wooburn Common, near Beaconsfield, by a shooting party including Lord Burnham, the seventh Baron of Burnham and the son of . Hugh Lawson, who was general manager and deputy manager of the Daily . Telegraph in the 1970s and 80s, as well Chief Whip in the House of . Lords. Speaking at the inquest in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, Detective Sergeant Paul Quinton said: 'The weather was particularly foul and to keep warm they all decided to drink neat vodka. 'Over the course of the day the deceased and his work colleagues purchased a bottle of vodka each from a local store and shared the contents amongst themselves. 'This is believed to have resulted in high levels of intoxication.' As the men prepared to finish work for the evening Mr Karpuc came down the ladder, because the stairs had not yet been built, but fell and sustained fatal injuries to his chest. He broke a number of ribs, which punctured his lungs leading to a very sudden death. His colleagues could find no pulse and concluded that he had died - although they did not call the emergency services. 'They decided to place Mr Karpuc in a van and drive him away from the site,' said Det. Sgt. Quinton. 'It would appear that while driving down a single track road, Green Common Lane, Beaconsfield, the person driving the van tried to turn around. 'This resulted in the Mercedes Sprinter-type van being stuck between the raised banks on either side of the road, it was wedged firmly bank-to-bank. 'It's understood they decided to remove Mr Karpuc from the van and place him on the edge of a forest, so to speak. They then left the scene.' On January 28, Simon Hanbury and Lord Harry were on a shooting trip and were beating though Green Common Lane when Mr Hanbury noticed what he thought was a body. As he had his children with him, Lord Harry went to investigate further and came across Mr Karpuc. 'Lord Burnham notified the police via 999 and a number of police officers, paramedics and an air ambulance attended,' said Det. Sgt. Quinton. 'The weather was particularly foul and to keep warm they all decided to drink neat vodka' - Detective Sergeant Paul Quinton . Mr Karpuc was pronounced dead at the scene and a post mortem examination revealed that he had suffered an intrapulmonary haemorrhage in the presence of alcohol following a fall from height. A toxicology report showed he had 284mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, around three-and-a-half times the drink-drive limit of 80mg. Karen Morris, a health and safety expert who investigated the death, said that Mr Karpuc had been working with his colleagues, who were also Polish, since the end of July 2012. 'Once the death occurred, Ryszard Karpuc's colleagues appeared to panic and decided it would be best to move his body,' she said. 'They decided to take the body into the country and leave it there.' Ms Morris said that Mr Karpuc, of Seaford Road, Ealing, had fallen around two metres. She said that supervisor Michael O'Heney had been away from the site, and had not known that his workers had been drinking - or what had happened to Mr Karpuc. 'He is very shocked by this, I have no reason to believe Mr O'Heney knew there was drinking on his site, I don't think it was a regular occurrence and there is no suggestion he was condoning this behaviour,"" she said. A jury of seven women and four men recorded a verdict of accidental death. The hearing was also told that Mr Karpuc's . colleagues, who were not named, are the subject of legal proceedings . due to be heard at Reading Crown Court. They have been charged with obstructing a coroner. 'There are proceedings against several individuals, workmates of Mr Karpuc, who are charged not in relation to causing his death but in what happened subsequently to his body,' said coroner Richard Hulett. 'The offence is failing to report his death to a district coroner.' Verdict: accidental death.

Warning: A Catholic priest gives Holy Communion to a member of the congregation as a green light is lit inside St Teresa of Avila church indicating it is safe outside . During mass, a green light is activated from the top of a side door, which means there is no presence of danger on the streets outside. When the amber light is lit it indicates caution, while a red light represents danger, most often a shooting. A concrete wall has also been constructed in front of the main facade of the church for added security. The walls inside the church are adorned with posters and notices showing pictures of people who are missing or who are feared kidnapped.

A new play about Britain's first black Army officer hopes to strengthen a campaign to award him a Military Cross. Second Lieutenant Walter Tull, who grew up in an East London orphanage, was recommended for a Military Cross for heroism on the Western Front, according to letters sent to his family after he was killed in 1918. He was commended for his 'gallantry and coolness under fire' during bloody battles in the trenches of Europe.' But the soldier never received the award, fuelling speculation he had been overlooked because of rules prohibiting officers of 'non-European descent' leading white troops. Now a play about his life is about to take to the stage this month and its writer hopes it will add fuel to the campaign to award Tull - who also played for Tottenham Hotspur - a posthumous Military Cross. Tull has been written by Phil Vasili who told The Independent on Sunday: 'Walter was made an officer during a time when it was practically expedient for the Army. 'The rules were broken because it suited the Army so to do. 'However, the rejection of his Military Cross recommendation was, I feel, because he embodied a legal contradiction as an officer of non-European descent.' The campaign has been backed by Michael Morpurgo, author of War Horse, whose recent book A Medal for Leroy, draws heavily on Tull's life story. Speaking last year he said: 'We don't know why this medal was not awarded. There shouldn't have been any black officers in the British Army. 'I think the medal commendation somehow got misplaced. We just don't know. But now is the right moment to be putting this right.' Second Lt Tull was born in Folkstone, Kent, in April 1888, the son of a carpenter from Barbados who moved to England and married a local woman. By the age of 10 his parents had died and documents on the website Findmypast.co.uk show that he was living at an orphanage in Bethnal Green, East London.

Perfect girl : Fake Internet Girlfriend allows you to connect with another profile so it looks like you are 'In a Relationship' Cloud Girlfriend and Brazilian site Namaro Fake offer the same deal if you are a man and want to appear off the market. For $250 a month, you can buy the basic girlfriend package on Fake Internet Girlfriend, which includes setting up a profile on a social networking site like Facebook to publicly communicate with you and making up to two public phone calls, for example to your secretary, in any given month. The package also includes friendly texts up to 10 times a month at any given dates and times you specify. For more in-depth or specialised services like the 'gamer girl package', the company charges $350 per month. This buys you a girlfriend who becomes involved in your gaming community such as World of Warcraft, Everquest II or Evony. The gamer girl package costs slightly more than the basic girlfriend package simply because it requires more time than the basic girlfriend services and it also requires employing staff that has specific and unique knowledge of the game in question. 'In fact, you can even have your girlfriend join your guild, level up a character and even go on raids with you. 'Just let us know when you contact us exactly what you are looking for in a gamer girlfriend,' the site boasts. However the company does make it clear it is not an escort agency and it is against the terms and conditions for clients to meet up with their fake girlfriends in person. 'Our services are for appearances only,' a note of the site reads. 'We are not offering you real girlfriend services. We will act like your girlfriend all day long but please do not confuse that with an invite to anything sexual in nature.'

He said: 'I was asked to investigate and I went through several of these websites and wacky experiences. 'There a few different calibres.

Crackdown: George Osborne spoke with finance ministers from the G20 group about cracking down on firms not paying corporate tax . Public outrage over corporate tax avoidance must be used as a 'catalyst for change' in the UK and the developing world, Chancellor George Osborne said. Mr Osborne was in Moscow yesterday for a meeting of finance ministers from the G20 group of major economies which pledged to find ways to crack down on dodges by multinationals. Britain, France and Germany are spearheading a push for international agreement on measures to end practices such as 'transfer pricing' where profits are diverted to low-tax countries. It follows claims of immoral behaviour by number of high-profile firms who have paid little or no corporation tax in the UK by exploiting legal loopholes. But there have also been claims that UK firms are guilty of depriving poor countries of tax revenues as well - something the Chancellor said the UK would use its presidency of the G8 on which to push action. Writing in the Observer, he said: 'This year, we have an opportunity to turn concern over tax avoidance into a catalyst for change, creating a competitive tax system that supports businesses, but where everyone pays their fair share. 'Through our role in the G20 and our leadership of the G8, we can ensure this change benefits Britain's taxpayers and also helps meet our commitments to the poorest in our society.' Mr Osborne defended the Government's decision to protect foreign aid spending from deep public spending cuts so next year it could meet a United Nations target to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas development. Apart from saving lives and boosting education, it would be used to strengthen countries' abilities to enforce tax rules, he said. Anger: Web giant Google avoided paying $2billion in tax last year by moving around 80 per cent of its overseas profits to a company in the tax haven of Bermuda . Starbucks has more than 700 outlets in the UK generating revenues of more than £3billion but it paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in its 14 years of trading in the UK and nothing in the last three . 'Since we came into office, tax collection in Ethiopia has increased by 40 per cent. This is just one example - we are also involved in projects in Kenya, Ghana, Uganda and Tanzania. Embarrassing: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Britain's economy had flatlined over two years which wasn't good enough . 'We will champion a new agenda of transparency and accountability in developing countries. 'With the authority that comes from meeting our international commitments on aid, Britain is well placed to tackle the causes, not just the symptoms of poverty, such as corruption and lack of transparency.' Labour said House of Commons library figures showed the UK was in the G20 'relegation zone' in terms of economic growth since the Chancellor's autumn 2010 spending review. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'These are embarrassing figures for George Osborne as he attends the meeting of G20 countries this weekend. 'Britain has now flatlined for over two and a half years under this Conservative-led government.'In the global growth league table we're in the relegation zone with 17 out of 20 countries including America, France and Germany doing better than us. 'This isn't good enough. The longer our economy stagnates the worse off people will be and the more long-term damage will be done. 'We need urgent action now to kick-start our flatlining economy and help people struggling with the rising cost of living. Our jobs plan includes building thousands of affordable homes and giving tax breaks to small firms taking on extra workers.'","Chancellor met with ministers from the G20 group of major economies .

Pictures allegedly showing the new PS4 controller reveal the device will incorporate a touchscreen built into the middle of the familiar DualShock layout. Excitement over the next-generation console is building after Sony sent out invitations to an event on 'the future of the Playstation' to be held next week. A supposedly leaked image posted by games website Destructoid shows what appears to be an updated DualShock controller plugged into software development kit. Touch me: This apparently leaked image purports to show the controller for the hotly anticipated PlayStation 4, which Sony is expected to announce at an event to be held in New York City next Wednesday . The touchscreen is at the front, where the start and select buttons are found on the current generation of PlayStation controllers. The image appears to back up rumours circulating earlier this week which added L2 and R2 buttons have also been remodelled and improved. All eyes in the video games world are on Sony right now ahead of next Wednesday's event in New York City where the Japanese tech firm is expected to unveil the new PlayStation. Sony has kept its cards close to its chest regarding the expected launch, so far only officially releasing a teaser video via YouTube announcing date of the event and calling on gamers to 'be the first to know'. The video also promoted a Twitter hashtag, #Playstation2013, to which video game fans flocked to share their excitement about the forthcoming event. Asked about the purpose of the event, Masaki Tsukakoshi, a spokesman for the company said only: 'We will be talking about the PlayStation business.' Tantalising: A still from Sony's teaser video, published on YouTube on January 31, announcing the date of its event on 'the future of the Playstation' to be held in New York City next week . Console rival Microsoft is also believed to be gearing to launch its successor to the Xbox 360, though it is understood the Windows giant is likely to delay announcement of the machine until the E3 show in June. Observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for Christmas, which could mean a battle for supremacy between Microsoft and Sony as their next-generation consoles go head-to-head in the vital holiday season market. Due for an update: Microsoft is expected to announce the successor to its Xbox 360 console at June's E3, in time for a Christmas launch date . It has been more than six years since Sony launched the 70million-selling PS3, a longer gap than between it and its PS2 predecessor, adding to the anticipation that it will soon disclose its next gaming concept. The last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011, it presented a protoype of its handheld Vita console. Before that, it convened a gathering in 2005 two months after it first demonstrated the PS3 concept. A meeting in 1999 revealed designs for the PS2. Rumours surfaced last week that the new machine would be heavily focused on the cloud, which would put the Japanese firm's purchase last year of a leading cloud-based gaming company into perspective. Sony paid $380million for Gaikai in June last year. At the time Sony's chief executive, Andrew House, said: 'By combining Gaikai's resources including its technological strength and engineering talent with SCE's [Sony Computer Entertainment] extensive game platform knowledge and experience, SCE will provide users with unparalleled cloud entertainment experiences. 'SCE will deliver a world-class cloud-streaming service that allows users to instantly enjoy a broad array of content ranging from immersive core games with rich graphics to casual content anytime, anywhere on a variety of internet-connected devices.' The PlayStation Vita: The portable console, successor to the PSP, was unveiled the last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011 . As well as the touchpad controller, . the new console is expected to have an eight-core x64 AMD processor . (codenamed 'Bulldozer), 8GB of RAM, 2.2GB of video RAM, four USB ports . that use the new high-speed USB 3.0 standard, a Blu-ray drive, a hard . drive of 160GB, an Ethernet port, and both HDMI and optical outputs. Specs . for the next-generation Xbox are rumored to be comparable, with . insiders suggesting that it will also pack 8GB of RAM, HDMI connectors . and USB 3.0. However, video . gamers have been horrified by rumours that the Microsoft machine will . only work with the Kinect sensor plugged in and that it will only run . games registered to the machine - potentially blocking not only . second-hand games but also games borrowed from friends. The co-founder of Xbox has launched a scathing attack on Microsoft for 'five years of failure' - and claimed that Apple could ‘kill them’ at any given moment. Former Xbox engineer Nat Brown - who came up with the console’s name (albeit spelled xBox) - slammed Microsoft for failing to capitalise on innovations such as Kinect and making it difficult for developers to make and sell games on the device. The attack follows reports that Microsoft are likely to announce their Xbox 360 successor, codenamed Durango, at E3 in Los Angeles in June this year. Writing on his blog ilike.code, under the title ‘Stupid, Stupid xBox’, Brown said: ‘The past 5 years, and the last year in particular, have been simply painful to watch. 'Coasting on past momentum. Failing to innovate and failing to capitalize on innovations like Kinect. Touting strategic and market success when you’re just experiencing your competitor’s stumbling failure (yes, Sony, Nintendo – you are, I’m afraid, stumbling failures). 'A complete lack of tactical versus strategic understanding of the long game of the living room.’ The Playstation 4 could cost as little as £270 when it launches later this year, according to a report in a Japanese newspaper. The Asahi Shimbun reported that Sony's new gaming console will cost 40,000 Yen - which translates to about £270. However, UK gamers will have to factor in VAT, which adds a whopping 20 per cent to the price, taking the possible UK figure to around £325. Even at that price, the PS4 will be a bargain.The PS3 cost 60,000 Yen when it launched in Japan 2006. The new console is expected to be announced at a press conference in New York on February 20. If the price is as low as the rumours suggest, it could steal a march on Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console, which doesn't yet have a launch date. Microsoft's console, which could be named the Xbox 720,  could be announced at the annual E3 gaming conference, held in Los Angeles in June. Observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for Christmas, which could mean a battle for supremacy between Microsoft and Sony. The launches are important for both companies, as gamers have moved away from consoles since the Xbox 360 and the PS3 débuted. More and more people have shifted to tablets and smartphones as a gaming platform. Analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games consoles within a few years. Many are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs. Last hurrah: The Garnet Red PS3.

Time waster: Kuldip Singh QC leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court after pleaded guilty to jumping a red light . A barrister has been ordered to pay £5,000 in legal costs for 'wasting time' after he refused to pay a £60 fine for jumping a red light. Kuldip Singh QC was caught racing through a central London junction at 65mph in his 3.2litre C-Class Mercedes Benz a full 1.4 seconds after the light had turned red in November 2011. But instead of owning up and paying the fine he tried to have the charge thrown out and fought a year-long battle in the courts which cost a total of £4,769. Within 14 months the case was listed seven times and there were four court hearings. The 58-year-old claimed he was never given the option of paying an on-the-spot fine and that his speed should not have been taken into consideration when prosecuting him. At one stage he even claimed the device used to catch him was not Home Office approved and complained he did not have the right to a fair trial citing Article 6 of the Human Rights Act. But today he finally pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to comply with a traffic signal after a judge ruled there was no abuse of process by the prosecution and ‘a fair trial could undoubtedly take place.’ District Judge Quentin Purdy told Westminister Magistrates’ Court that a 'substantial amount' of court time and resources had been wasted. Five files of documents were handed over as part of Singh's defence in what should have been a ‘seemingly straightforward prosecution,' the court heard. Judge Purdy said: 'For reasons I well understand, but I fear Mr Singh does not, the lengthy and extensive paperwork overwhelmed the City of London traffic prosecution team and indeed the Crown Prosecution Service, which is simply under-resourced to deal with such paperwork.' Prosecutor Andrew Perry said he had added up the cost of proceedings which came to £4,769. He added: 'Mr Singh has wasted the court’s time from the moment this case started.' Guilty: Kuldip Singh QC spent a year fighting the case against paying the £60 fine for jumping a red light . Singh was told if he pleaded guilty today he would be sentenced only on the issue of crossing the red light. The judge sentenced him to three points on his licence, a £60 fine plus a £15 victim surcharge. He added: 'I am also ordering you to pay the full costs of the proceedings as this prosecution has been a fallacy from the start and the cost to the public purse should be reimbursed.' Singh, who qualified as a barrister in 1975 and was appointed Queen’s Counsel in 1993, asked for seven days to pay it. The QC, whose address was given in court as his chambers, Serle Court, at New Square, Camden, north London, declined to comment as he left court.","Kuldip Singh QC was caught racing through a central London junction at 65mph in his Mercedes Benz .

Instead, the $6 million production opened in seventh place this weekend bringing in a relatively dismal $5 million in the U.S. and marking one of the worst wide-release openings for many of the actors featured. Critic Peter Howell of the Toronto Star called it the ‘worst film ever’ saying it was the ‘biggest waste of talent in cinema history.’ Critic Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times said he did not ‘see a redeeming molecule’ throughout the film. Farrelly was quick to defend his work. ‘To the critics: Movie 43 is not the end of the world. It’s just a $6-million movie where we tried to do something different. Now back off,’ he wrote on Twitter. ‘To the critics: You always complain that Hollywood never gives you new stuff, and then when you get it, you flip out. Lighten up,’ he added one minute later.

The individual plots were then stitched together by an overarching story about three teenagers searching the internet for ‘Movie 43,’ the most banned film in the world.

"By . Damien Gayle and Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 05:29 EST, 20 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:44 EST, 20 February 2013 . Sony was today putting the finishing touches to what could be the most important product launch in its history. The PlayStation 4 console is set to be unveiled in New York at 11pm tonight. The struggling electronics giant hopes the next generation console will help it regain market share against Microsoft, who is yet to reveal plans for its new Xbox console - which is also expected to be on sale in time for Christmas. Touch me: This apparently leaked image purports to show the controller for the hotly anticipated PlayStation 4, which Sony is expected to announce at an event to be held in New York City next Wednesday . Although no details have been confirmed by Sony, the PS4's main features are believed to include: . The unveiling will excite millions of . computer games fans across the world, and further fuel the on-going . battle between Sony, Xbox 360 manufacturers Microsoft and Nintendo, the . makers of the Wii system. Experts say the event is critical to Sony's future. 'For Sony, they have to come out and make this PlayStation event the . definitive statement of why gamers need to adopt the PlayStation 4 or . PlayStation Orbis or whatever they end up calling it,' said Greg Miller, . PlayStation executive editor at video game site IGN.com. 'Their focus is on establishing a beachhead for the next generation . of consoles, and that's what Feb. 20 is all about,"" said P.J. McNealy, . CEO and founder of Digital World Research. 'The reality is they have been playing catch-up.' Since the first PlayStation console launched in December 1994, Sony have . sold over 310 million home consoles worldwide, and 2.9 billion games. Pictures allegedly showing the new PS4 . controller reveal the device will incorporate a touchscreen built into . the middle of the familiar DualShock layout. It has also been rumoured the console will cost £270 in an attempt to undercut rivals. Electronics giant Sony is holding an event in New York, during which it promised to reveal 'the future'. But the games manufacturer has refused to confirm widespread rumours that the latest version of the console will be launched. Leaked photographs which have emerged online appear to show a prototype controller with a touchpad alongside the classic DualShock-style controls have fuelled the speculation. The touchscreen is at the front, where the start and select buttons are found on the current generation of PlayStation controllers. The image appears to back up rumours circulating earlier this week which added L2 and R2 buttons have also been remodelled and improved. Pushing ahead of Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo Co Ltd's new Wii U could help Sony revive an electronics business hurt by a . dearth of hit gadgets, a collapse in TV sales and the convergence of . consumer interest around tablets and smartphones built by rivals Apple and Samsung. Tablets and smartphones already account for around 10 percent of the . $80 billion gaming market. Those mobile devices, analysts predict, will . within a few years be as powerful as the current slew of game-only . consoles. Sony has slashed the price of its struggling Vita handheld games console in Japan in a bid to spur sales of the device. The . maker of Playstation consoles trimmed the price of its 3G Wifi version . by 10,000 yen ($110) to 19,980 yen, with all other models also reduced, . it said in a statement. Sony . this month trimmed its forecast for handheld sales, including the Vita . and older PSP, to 7 million machines in the year ending March 31 . compared with an estimate of 16 million at the start of the business . term. Sony has kept its cards close to its . chest regarding the expected launch, so far only officially releasing a . teaser video via YouTube announcing date of the event and calling on . gamers to 'be the first to know'. The . video also promoted a Twitter hashtag, #Playstation2013, to which video . game fans flocked to share their excitement about the forthcoming . event. Asked about the . purpose of the event, Masaki Tsukakoshi, a spokesman for the company . said only: 'We will be talking about the PlayStation business.' Tantalising: A still from Sony's teaser video, published on YouTube on January 31, announcing the date of its event on 'the future of the Playstation' to be held in New York City next week . Console rival Microsoft is also believed to be gearing to launch its successor to the Xbox 360, which is codenamed Xbox Infinity, though it is understood the Windows giant is likely to delay announcement of the machine until the E3 show in June. Observers expect both systems to be on the shelves in time for Christmas, which could mean a battle for supremacy between Microsoft and Sony as their next-generation consoles go head-to-head in the vital holiday season market. Due for an update: Microsoft is expected to announce the successor to its Xbox 360 console at June's E3, in time for a Christmas launch date . It has been more than six years since Sony launched the 70million-selling PS3, a longer gap than between it and its PS2 predecessor, adding to the anticipation that it will soon disclose its next gaming concept. The last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011, it presented a protoype of its handheld Vita console. Before that, it convened a gathering in 2005 two months after it first demonstrated the PS3 concept. A meeting in 1999 revealed designs for the PS2. Rumours surfaced last week that the new machine would be heavily focused on the cloud, which would put the Japanese firm's purchase last year of a leading cloud-based gaming company into perspective. Sony paid $380million for Gaikai in June last year. At the time Sony's chief executive, Andrew House, said: 'By combining Gaikai's resources including its technological strength and engineering talent with SCE's [Sony Computer Entertainment] extensive game platform knowledge and experience, SCE will provide users with unparalleled cloud entertainment experiences. 'SCE will deliver a world-class cloud-streaming service that allows users to instantly enjoy a broad array of content ranging from immersive core games with rich graphics to casual content anytime, anywhere on a variety of internet-connected devices.' The PlayStation Vita: The portable console, successor to the PSP, was unveiled the last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011 . As well as the touchpad controller, . the new console is expected to have an eight-core x64 AMD processor . (codenamed 'Bulldozer), 8GB of RAM, 2.2GB of video RAM, four USB ports . that use the new high-speed USB 3.0 standard, a Blu-ray drive, a hard . drive of 160GB, an Ethernet port, and both HDMI and optical outputs. Specs . for the next-generation Xbox are rumored to be comparable, with . insiders suggesting that it will also pack 8GB of RAM, HDMI connectors . and USB 3.0. However, video . gamers have been horrified by rumours that the Microsoft machine will . only work with the Kinect sensor plugged in and that it will only run . games registered to the machine - potentially blocking not only . second-hand games but also games borrowed from friends. The co-founder of Xbox has launched a scathing attack on Microsoft for 'five years of failure' - and claimed that Apple could ‘kill them’ at any given moment. Former Xbox engineer Nat Brown - who came up with the console’s name (albeit spelled xBox) - slammed Microsoft for failing to capitalise on innovations such as Kinect and making it difficult for developers to make and sell games on the device. The attack follows reports that Microsoft are likely to announce their Xbox 360 successor, codenamed Durango, at E3 in Los Angeles in June this year. Writing on his blog ilike.code, under the title ‘Stupid, Stupid xBox’, Brown said: ‘The past 5 years, and the last year in particular, have been simply painful to watch. 'Coasting on past momentum. Failing to innovate and failing to capitalize on innovations like Kinect. Touting strategic and market success when you’re just experiencing your competitor’s stumbling failure (yes, Sony, Nintendo – you are, I’m afraid, stumbling failures). 'A complete lack of tactical versus strategic understanding of the long game of the living room.’ The Playstation 4 could cost as little as £270 when it launches later this year, according to a report in a Japanese newspaper. The Asahi Shimbun reported that Sony's new gaming console will cost 40,000 Yen - which translates to about £270. However, UK gamers will have to factor in VAT, which adds a whopping 20 per cent to the price, taking the possible UK figure to around £325. Even at that price, the PS4 will be a bargain.The PS3 cost 60,000 Yen when it launched in Japan 2006. The new console is expected to be announced at a press conference in New York on February 20. If the price is as low as the rumours suggest, it could steal a march on Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console, which doesn't yet have a launch date. Microsoft's console, which could be named the Xbox 720,  could be announced at the annual E3 gaming conference, held in Los Angeles in June. Observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for Christmas, which could mean a battle for supremacy between Microsoft and Sony. The launches are important for both companies, as gamers have moved away from consoles since the Xbox 360 and the PS3 débuted. More and more people have shifted to tablets and smartphones as a gaming platform. Analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games consoles within a few years. Many are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs. Last hurrah: The Garnet Red PS3.

The grave of an ancient warrior who was buried wearing golden jewellery and with a sword positioned between his legs has been discovered in Russia. Scientists were amazed at the array of artefacts found within the 2,200-year-old necropolis as it had already been raided by grave-robbers. The warrior was buried wearing chain-mail, while two swords and a pair of bronze helmets were also found. Golden grave: The warrior's grave, located near the town of Mezmay in the Caucasus, Russia, included a gold brooch, measuring a little over 2in by 2in, with a rock crystal fixed in its centre . Collection: Scientists who found the necropolis discovered more than 12 gold artefacts, as well as a number of weapons . One of the helmets was inscribed with curled sheep horns, while a 36in sword was found resting between his legs. Scientists believe the warrior, whose grave was located near the town of Mezmay in the Caucasus, was a 'chief of a people', rather than the head of a town or city. Chief: An axe belonging to the warrior, who researchers said was most likely the 'chief of a people' rather than the head of a town . Animal remains were also found in the grave, including three horses, a cow and a wild boar skull. Valentina Mordvintseva, a researcher at the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences Institute of Archaeology, said that the animals 'were particularly valuable among . barbarian peoples of the ancient world'. He told the Huffington Post: 'It was [a] sign of [the] great . importance of the buried person, which was shown by his relatives and . his tribe.' Bones of other animals and pottery also found in the grave, suggest that a feast was held to mark the warrior's death. Writing in the journal Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia, the team behind the discovery detailed the 12 gold artefacts discovered. The find included a gold brooch,  measuring 2.3 by 1.9 inches, with a rock crystal fixed in its centre. The two swords also included gold decorations, something the scientists had never come across before. A smaller 19-inch sword featured a gold plate, leading the team to note 'actual fact that these articles were used to . decorate weapons sets them apart in a category all of their own, which . has so far not been recorded anywhere else'. Grave robbers first discovered the necropolis in 2004, a year before excavations began at the site. The researchers . believe the grave was used between the third century BC and the . beginning of the second century AD, but they could not link the artefacts with any particular culture.

A post mortem has revealed he died as a result of severe head injuries . A man was today being questioned over the murder of an antiques dealer whose body was found at his countryside cottage, possibly weeks after he died. Police believe businessman Peter Battle's profession may be a significant factor in his suspected murder after a number of high value and suspicious items were stolen after his death. It is thought Mr Battle, 56, may have lain dead in the lounge of his home in Full Sutton, North Yorkshire, for weeks before his body was found last Thursday. He was last seen alive on Boxing Day. Humberside Police broke in and made the grim discovery when a friend raised the alarm after not being able to contact the antiques dealer. A post mortem has since concluded that he died as a result of severe head injuries, possibly caused by a blunt instrument. A 26-year-old man was arrested in Malton, North Yorkshire, on Monday evening in connection with the murder. Officers say they have reason to believe items such as silver cutlery, rare coins, sovereign and half-sovereign rings and a black and silver Advent laptop may have been stolen since Mr Battle died, and have launched a huge investigation with more than 100 police officers and staff. Detective Chief Inspector Alastair McFarlane said there was no sign of a break in at the rural cottage, and police believed someone had visited the property after his death. He added: 'We also have information suggesting that a person or persons may have been visiting the property in the weeks preceding the discovery of Mr Battle's body. 'Sadly, we think that Mr Battle may have died quite some time prior to our discovering the scene of the murder, and we are keen to have information about any movements at the property from around the end of December 2012 until that time. 'We have a substantial number of officers and staff working on the investigation with forensic examination of the scene continuing and other lines of enquiry being actively pursued.' Mr Battle regularly attended auction houses in Yorkshire and was a frequent trader on internet auction site eBay. But his last transactions on the site were in mid December. He was known to deal in silver and gold and particularly half-sovereign and sovereign rings, coins and cutlery. Grim: Police believe Mr Battle may have lain dead in his North Yorkshire home for weeks before his body was found last Thursday. Officers believe items such as silver cutlery, rare coins, sovereigns and a laptop may have been stolen . Mr Battle previously ran a computer repair business and was director for a marketing firm, Barton Trott Battle, based at Clifton Moor, North Yorkshire. Det Chief Insp McFarlane said police were speaking to auction houses, as well as eBay, to ascertain whether someone had been trying to sell items like those taken from Mr Battle's house. He said: 'We have a substantial number of officers and staff working on the investigation with forensic examination of the scene continuing and other lines of inquiry being actively pursued. 'This is a serious crime and we are keen to bring the killers of Peter Battle to justice.' 'If you know of anything which may assist us in our inquiries phone Humberside Police on the non-emergency number 101 quoting log number 492 of February 7, or directly to the incident room on 01377 208989.

North Korea today warned the top American commander in South Korea of 'miserable destruction' if the U.S. military presses ahead with routine joint drills with South Korea set to begin next month. Pak Rim Su, chief of North Korea's military delegation to the truce village of Panmunjom inside the Demilitarized Zone, sent the warning this morning to Gen. James Thurman, Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency said, in a rare direct message to the U.S. commander. The threat comes as the U.S. and other nations discuss how to punish North Korea for conducting an underground nuclear test on Feb. 12 in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions banning Pyongyang from nuclear and missile activity. Warning: Officials at a ceremony following a recent successful nuclear test in North Korea, which today sent a warning to the top U.S. commander in South Korea over its plans for joint drills . North Korea has characterized the nuclear test, its third since 2006, as a defensive act against U.S. aggression. Pyongyang accuses Washington of 'hostility' for leading the charge to punish North Korea for a December rocket launch that the U.S. considers a covert missile test. The U.S. and North Korea fought on opposite sides of the three-year Korean War, which ended in a truce in 1953, not a peace treaty, and left the Korean Peninsula divided by a heavily fortified border monitored by the U.S.-led U.N. Command. Washington also stations 28,500 American troops in South Korea to protect its ally against North Korean aggression. Drills: Soldiers participating in a routine drill in South Korea, which is due to press ahead with joint drills with the U.S. military . South Korea and the U.S. regularly conduct joint drills such as the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises slated to take place next month. North Korea calls the drills proof of U.S. hostility, and accuses Washington of practicing for an invasion. 'You had better bear in mind that those igniting a war are destined to meet a miserable destruction,' KCNA quoted Pak as saying in his message to Thurman. He called the drills 'reckless'. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, meanwhile, has been making a round of visits to military units guiding troops in drills and exercises since the nuclear test, KCNA said.","North Korea's Pak Rim Su sent a rare direct message to U.S. general .

Google chairman Eric Schmidt arrived in North Korea today on a private mission to examine the communist nation's economy and social media, despite concerns from Washington over the timing of the trip. Schmidt, executive chairman of one of the world's biggest Internet companies, is the highest-profile U.S. executive to visit North Korea - a country with notoriously restrictive online policies - since young leader Kim Jong Un took power a year ago. His visit has drawn criticism from the U.S. State Department because it comes only weeks after a controversial North Korean rocket launch; it has also prompted speculation about what the businessman hopes to accomplish. Scroll down for video . Landed: Executive Chairman of Google Eric Schmidt, center, arrives at Pyongyang International Airport . Travel buddies: Former New Mexico Gov Bill Richardson, left, and Schmidt arrived in Pyongyang via a commercial flight . The executive chairman of U.S.-based Google arrived in Pyongyang aboard a commercial Air China flight. Leading the delegation is former New Mexico Gov Bill Richardson, who has traveled more than a half-dozen times to North Korea over the past 20 years. Richardson called the trip a private, humanitarian mission. 'This is not a Google trip, but I'm sure he's interested in some of the economic issues there, the social media aspect. So this is why we are teamed up on this,' Richardson said without elaborating on what he meant by the 'social media aspect.' 'We'll meet with North Korean political leaders. We'll meet with North Korean economic leaders, military. We'll visit some universities. We don't control the visit. They will let us know what the schedule is when we get there,' he said.

Richardson also said the delegation plans to inquire about a Korean-American U.S. citizen detained in North Korea. 'We're . going to try to inquire the status, see if we can see him, possibly lay . the groundwork for him coming home,' Richardson said. 'I heard from his . son who lives in Washington state, who asked me to bring him back. I . doubt we can do it on this trip.' The four-day trip, which is taking place just weeks after North Korea fired a satellite into space using a long-range rocket, has drawn criticism from U.S. officials. Washington condemned the December 12 launch, which it considers a test of ballistic missile technology, as a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions barring Pyongyang from developing its nuclear and missile programs. The Security Council is deliberating whether to take further action. 'We don't think the timing of the visit is helpful, and they are well aware of our views,' U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters last week. The trip was planned well before North Korea announced its plans to send a satellite into space, two people with knowledge of the delegation's plans told The Associated Press. AP first reported the group's plans last Thursday. New leader: Schmidt is the first major western business executive to visit North Korea since Kim Jong Un took control . Schmidt, a staunch proponent of Internet connectivity and openness, is expected to make a donation during the visit, members of the delegation told AP. They spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to divulge details of the delegation's plans to the media. The visit is the first by a Google executive to North Korea and comes just days after Kim, who took power following the December 17, 2011, death of his father, Kim Jong Il, laid out a series of policy goals for North Korea in a lengthy New Year's speech. He cited expanding science and technology as a means to improving the country's economy as a key goal for 2013. Computer and cellphone use is gaining ground in North Korea's larger cities. Moving forward? The nation's new leader has said he wants to make the country more open to the innovation of the Internet . However, most North Koreans only have access to a domestic Intranet system, not the World Wide Web. For North Koreans, Internet use is still strictly regulated and allowed only with approval. Schmidt, who oversaw Google's expansion into a global giant, speaks frequently about the importance of providing people around the world with Internet access and technology. Google now has offices in more than 40 countries, including all three of North Korea's neighbors: Russia, South Korea and China, another country criticized for systematic Internet censorship. Accompanying Schmidt is Jared Cohen, a former U.S. State Department policy and planning adviser who heads Google's New York-based think tank. The two collaborated on a book about the Internet's role in shaping society called 'The New Digital Age,' which comes out in April.","Google boss traveled with former New Mexico Gov Bill Richardson .

Father-of-one Lee Jameson's body was found partially beneath his quad bike in the middle of a field in County Durham . A farmer may have been killed by hungry cattle he was trying to feed, an inquest has heard. Father-of-one Lee Jameson’s body was found partially beneath his quad bike in the middle of a field on Westgate Fell, near Daddry Shield, in Weardale, County Durham. Accident investigators believe that cattle had charged at the quarter-tonne bike that was carrying bales of hay, causing it to topple and trap Mr Jameson underneath it while it was still running. The 32-year-old farm worker had been missing for several hours when he was found around 4.30pm under the Kawasaki vehicle, on September 21 2011. The quad bike was discovered upright by Mr Jameson’s employer, James Nattrass, who went to look for him when he had not heard from the worker for several hours. Mr Nattrass said: 'The bike was upright with the engine still running. Mr Jameson was half underneath the bike. 'I realised he was dead straight away. 'On the day of the accident he came to see me about 10.30am and then he took two hay bales to feed the cattle in the field. 'He’d have got off the bike so he could throw the straw about the field for the cows. 'I tried to ring him during the day and got no response and I found him about 4pm. I found the bike upright with the engine running. 'I can only come up with two possible explanations as to what happened. 'It’s possible something happened to him when he got off the bike and he crawled under it to get away from the cows. 'He may have being knocked unconscious and the cows then pushed the bike over him as they tried to get the straw.' He added that the cattle 'were not aggressive per se.' He said: 'They are a big bunch and a potential danger if they knocked you over.' Mourning: Pictured is the farmer's funeral. Accident investigators believe that cattle had charged at the quarter-tonne bike that was carrying bales of hay intended to feed them, causing it to topple and trap him underneath . Goodbye: The farmer, whose funeral cortage is pictured, leaves a young family. A second theory is that he crawled under the bike to get away from the cows . PC Michael Baxter, of the police’s collision investigation unit, said: 'It seems likely that Mr Jameson went to the front of the vehicle for whatever reason. 'He tried to get out of the cows’ way and it’s more than likely the cows pushed the bike forward.' Health and Safety Executive inspector Jonathan Wills, who led an investigation into the death, agreed it seemed possible that the cows may have pushed the bike forward killing Mr Jameson. The Health and Safety Executive has issued a prohibition notice on the Nattrass farm for failing to ensure its quad bike riders wore protective head gear. The jury at the inquest held in Crook, County Durham, by coroner Andrew Tweddle, returned a verdict of accidental death. Mr Jameson leaves behind a partner, Diane Thomson and their two-year-old son, George, as well as parents Janet and John.","Father-of-one Lee Jameson’s body was .

Peter Lowe, 68, has been branded 'every parent's nightmare' after trying to grab the baby girl from her mother's arms during an attempted abduction. Lowe punched the terrified woman and repeatedly tried to wrest the baby from her grasp, a Grimsby Crown Court heard. On June 27 at Grimsby town centre bus station, the 20-year-old mother was leaning forward to put her 11-month-old daughter in a pushchair when Lowe delivered a hard punch to the side of her stomach. She was four months pregnant at the time. The court heard she lost her balance and lost her grip on the baby, causing the child to fall through her arms. Lowe, from Cleethorpes, then grasped at the baby's arm but the mother refused to let go and was able to keep a hold of her. He then grappled with the woman, grabbing her arm and squeezing it. Struggling to free the baby, Lowe - who suffers with mental health problems - again punched the mother in the stomach, causing her to panic that she might lose her unborn baby. The woman, whose name was not said in court, fell to her knees and Lowe grabbed at the baby's foot and hand, trying to pull the child from her mother's grip. Chloe Fairley, prosecuting, said: 'Her daughter was screaming and crying out.' A man who was passing by and witnessed the attack unfold started shouting at Lowe, who quickly ran away. He was later arrested after his description was sent out by police.

Lowe, from Cleethorpes, grasped at the baby's arm but the mother refused to let go and was able to keep a hold of her . Andrew Bailey, mitigating, said it was a 'nasty' incident and Lowe's behaviour was 'every parent's nightmare.' It was a spur-of-the-moment offence and Lowe claimed he would 'probably just have held' the baby. 'He presents a risk and that needs to be reduced,' said Mr Bailey. Jailing Lowe for two years, Judge David Tremberg said: 'It's every parent's nightmare to have a stranger try to abduct their child, particularly in a case like this when it was a young woman who was on her own and 17 weeks' pregnant, and against whom you used some violence. 'Let this be a lesson to you and let this be the last time you ever appear before a criminal court.' Lowe had been in custody for seven-and-a-half months. Court heard that he had shown remorse and suffered from mental health difficulties, including schizophrenia. Lowe had worked as a street cleaner, but had to leave that job because of taunts and abuse from children.","Peter Lowe hit the woman's stomach while she was four months pregnant .

Tod the fox had been allowed the run of the Eager Beaver in Beverley, East Yorkshire, after landlord Phil Walker and his daughter Georgina took him in when he was just two weeks old and hand-reared him. But following this week's attack on five-week-old Denny Dolan, which left the baby in intensive care after he was mauled by an urban fox, and a complaint from a regular, Mr Walker has removed Tod from the public bar. Tod the fox had been allowed the run of the bar at the Eager Beaver in Beverley, East Yorkshire, after landlord Phil Walker and his daughter Georgina took him in when he was just two weeks old . Despite his friendship with Jack Russell Eva, Tod has now been banned from the bar . The 56-year-old, who said he could not release Tod into the wild because he has an injured leg, said the wild creature is now so tame he sleeps on his bed. He said: 'It's a shame because he has been no problem and most customers really like him. He had become a bit of an attraction. 'However I received a complaint from a regular so have had to keep him upstairs where we live. 'When the weather is good we keep him in a pen in the beer garden with our Jack Russell Eva.' 'He is completely house trained and sleeps on my bed at night. 'There will be an unfair backlash on foxes following the attack in London. Foxes are really shy and timid so the attack sounds unusual.' Mr Walker said Tod cannot be released into the wild because he has an injured leg. He claims the wild creature is now so tame he sleeps on his bed . Nineteen year old Georgina Walker walks the fox on a lead around Beverley with his Jack Russell pal . 'However, as a precaution I have had to bar Tod from the pub.' His 19-year-old daughter who walks the fox on a lead around Beverley said: 'We had two abandoned foxes brought to us by a friend when they were just two weeks old. 'We bottle fed them, but one of them became too dominant so we had to let him go. 'But Todd has a bad leg and he needed that extra bit of care. It's a shame he is no longer allowed in the bar but I can understand people's fears.' The attack on Denny Dolan happened on February 6, and has sparked a heated debate on whether more should be done to cull urban foxes. His terrified mother Hayley Cawley found her living room ‘covered in blood’ and the fox mauling her son during the attack in their home in Bromley, Kent.

Mother-of-three Miss Cawley, 28, wrestled with the fox and fought it off, but her son was left soaked in blood and had gashes to his face and a black eye where the fox hit him against the door frame. Denny had to have his finger reattached in surgery and needed stitches to his cheek, as well as treatment for injuries to his face and head. His mother was said to be ‘shaking’ and ‘traumatised’ yesterday and keeping a vigil by her baby’s bedside at the Evelina Children’s Hospital in central London with her 28-year-old partner Paul Dolan. Mr Dolan’s sister Lorraine Murphy, 42, said her brother had told her what had happened and she had ‘feared the worst’ after the baby was taken to hospital.

A family has been reunited with their two missing cocker spaniels after actress and model Liz Hurley lent her support to their Twitter appeal. Matt and Laura Goodwin feared their beloved pets Ben and Muddles had been taken by dog-nappers after they vanished from their farm. The couple of St Breward, Cornwall, were terrified the 20-month-old brother and sister had been stolen to order amid a recent surge in thefts of black spaniels. Oliie Goodwin, 6, and his sister Tilly, 3, have been reunited with their two missing cocker spaniels after actress and model Liz Hurley boosted with their Twitter appeal . Cocker spaniels have become a popular choice for families looking for dogs, after the Duchess of Cambridge was seen with her pet dog Lupo. Mr Goodwin launched a social media campaign to find them and his search got an unexpected boost when celebrity spaniel owner Hurley saw the appeal on Twitter and urged her 376,000 followers to help. And just six days after their disappearance the puppies were spotted huddling for warmth on the roadside six miles from their home. Passing motorists recognised them from Liz Hurley's web appeal and reunited the starving pets with their ecstatic owners. Ms Hurley has several dogs, including Mia, a spaniel. Mrs Goodwin, 36, an accountant, said she felt 'honoured' that the pet lover urged her huge Twitter following to help find the family's missing puppies. She said: 'Our children have poured two months of pure love into those two dogs and the thought of them losing their best friends drove us on. 'Frankly, I was prepared to shamelessly exploit any connections we could find. I trawled for celebrities with spaniels and up came Liz Hurley. Spaniel owner Hurley saw the appeal on Twitter and urged her 376,000 followers to help. Just six days after their disappearance the puppies were spotted huddling for warmth on the roadside six miles from their home . Passing motorists recognised them from Liz Hurley's web appeal and reunited the starving pets with their ecstatic owners . 'She doesn't do a lot of retweeting, but as soon as Matt messaged her and gave her a link to the website, she could see that this was a genuine, heartfelt campaign. 'We were really honoured and grateful that she retweeted our message.' The couple had told their children 'white lies' while they searched for the animals, who ran off during a storm on January 28. After an initial search of the area and an advert in the local paper failed to find the two pets, Matt began spreading the news on Facebook and Twitter. The search soon went viral when Hurley, 47 - owner of a black spaniel named Mia - saw Mr Goodwin's appeal. She tweeted: '2 lost Spaniels missing since 28th around stbreward cornwall, please help us find them.' Their search was also bolstered by dozens of local volunteers - including the police and the Army. Mr Goodwin said: 'Camelford police kindly started the ball rolling by posting a message on their Facebook site. Twitter then allowed us the opportunity to speak directly with more people. 'We set the dogs up with a website to give more pictures and keep everyone up to date with any news. Mrs Goodwin, 36, an accountant, said she felt 'honoured' that pet lover Liz urged her huge Twitter following to help find the family's missing puppies because the children had poured 'two months of love into them' 'In the meantime we were searching and visiting places that we thought the dogs could have been and contacting local post offices, schools, pubs, shops and businesses. 'We spoke to anyone we saw, especially dog walkers. We saw the Army training and they agreed to keep an eye out and Bodmin Airfield and their pilots were also looking. 'There is big business in working dogs being stolen. We knew the dogs had run off, as time went on without news there was always the concern they might have been picked up and sold on quickly. 'Our biggest fear was that we would never know what had happened. It was really heart-warming, everybody got involved and people cared enough to share. 'A kind couple had hold of them by the side of the road then another car pulled up. The second couple exchanged all their details and proved their address and ensured our dogs got back to us.' The dogs have been checked over by vets and are now back home following the ordeal. Mrs Goodwin added: 'The dogs had lost two kilos, the were very weak and vulnerable. Hadthese people not stopped this story might have had a very different ending. 'The vet has given them a clean bill of health and they are back at home now, totally whacked from their ordeal but making a slow recovery. The children are just thrilled to have them back.' Pauline Reed, of Kevelek Gundogs in nearby St Austell, Cornwall, said the couple's fears about dog-nappers were well founded. She said: 'They are being stolen for money but also for breeding and even as bait for dog fighting. There are very well-organised gangs out there.'","Matt and Laura Goodwin feared their beloved pets Ben and Muddles had been stolen .

It is feared frail widow Irene Sawyer, 94, and only daughter Kathleen, 64 - who were both . pronounced dead at the scene - could have died after breathing in fumes . as they struggled to stay warm. The pair were discovered by police after neighbours noticed bottles of milk building up on the doorstep and raised the alarm. Police said they are currently treating the deaths as unexplained, and forensic experts are now combing the house in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Widow Irene Sawyer, 94 (left), and only daughter Kathleen, 64 (right), were found dead at their home in Kings Heath, Birmingham. It is feared they could have died after breathing in fumes . as they struggled to stay warm . Officers and fire crews forced entry to the terraced home in Balaclava Road just before 7pm on Monday to find the pair in the living room. Neighbours say they had taken to . sleeping downstairs in front of the gas fire -  believed to be the only source of . heating in the house - in a bid to keep warm. An inquiry is now underway to try and establish the circumstances surrounding their deaths, and to determine when either of the pair were last seen alive. But family say wheelchair bound Mrs Sawyer, who was cared for by her unmarried daughter, was warned about a possible problem with the fire before Christmas. Irene Sawyer's sister-in-law Hilda Goodwin, 84, said: 'We went round in December and my daughter's boyfriend said ""I think you should get your gas fire looked at"". 'The flames were burning white and not blue like normal so he told her to get it sorted. 'She said there was a routine service due in February so she would get it fixed then. 'The service was booked in a few days’ time. My advice to people who think there's a problem with their fire is don't let it happen to you, get it checked and don't put it off.' Police said they are currently treating the deaths as unexplained, and forensic experts are now combing the house. Wheelchair bound Mrs Sawyer, who was cared for by her unmarried daughter, was warned about a possible problem with the fire before Christmas . Mrs Goodwin added that Irene - known as 'Reanie' to her family - had been experiencing declining health over the last 12 months. She said: 'Irene's legs had gone so she slept downstairs in the living room and Kathleen would usually go up to bed after making sure her mum was warm and had enough blankets. 'We don't know for certain what happened but they were probably overcome by the fumes and died together. 'Kathleen doted on her mum completely, she never went out apart from to get groceries. Kathleen lived in that house all her life - 64 years. 'She only had one job her whole life, working for social security and she went about as high as she could go in that job. 'It's strange that they died as they lived - together.' Mrs Goodwin said she and husband Gordon, 89, Irene's brother, were 'shocked' by the deaths. Neighbour Janet Wheatley, 69, said that her daughter raised the alarm after they hadn't seen the pair for four days. She said: 'They kept themselves to themselves mostly, Irene had been very ill so she mostly stayed in the house. 'You'd sometimes see Kath push her out in a wheelchair but only to go to the park or something like that. We started to get worried after my husband noticed milk bottles hadn't been collected. 'I went around there three times yesterday, I was banging away on the window, lifting the letterbox up, calling Kath's name, thinking they'd answer but they didn't. 'In the day the curtains were open but I couldn't see through the net inside. Later on I went round when it had got darker and could see that the fire was on. 'I tapped on the window at about half past five and there was still no answer. My daughter came round and called the police at about half past six. 'She explained how worried we were and they came round at about 7.30.

Neighbours say the pair had taken to sleeping downstairs in front of the gas fire - the only source of heating in the house - in a bid to keep warm . 'By 8pm there were police cars and fire engines and ambulances outside. A couple of plain clothes police came to visit at 10.30 last night and told us there were suspicious circumstances. 'They asked if we had seen anything suspicious around the corner but we hadn't. I was shocked when I found out, we all were. 'They were nice people, Kath was a very caring girl, a lovely person really. I used to see her leaving for work and she'd just be walking up the street looking back and waving goodbye to her mum.'I think she retired a few years ago to look after her mum full time.' Mrs Wheatley believed that the pair had been sleeping downstairs in the living room with the gas fire on to escape the recent cold weather. She added: 'They have been sleeping downstairs in the living room. 'Their house didn't have central heating, most of them don't around here so people sleep downstairs with the gas fire on.

Naomi Button, 39, has not seen Elsa since she was abducted by her father during a holiday over a year ago. Her estranged Egyptian husband Tamer Salama, 35, is in prison in Britain for refusing to say where he has hidden the little girl. Scroll down for video . My precious girl: Naomi Button with her daughter Elsa, whom she has not seen in over a year . Appeal: Naomi Button is desperate to see her daughter Elsa who was abducted in Egypt in 2011 . Split: Elsa was taken by her father, Tamer Salama, after the breakdown of his marriage to Ms Button . Miss Button, a banking consultant, suspects she is living in Egypt with members of Salama’s family. High Court judges allowed her to speak . about the case for the first time yesterday to appeal for information . on her daughter’s whereabouts. ‘I can’t describe what life been like . since she was taken,’ Miss Button said. ‘The worst times are when I wake . up in the middle of the night. I worry that she’s crying for me, I . wonder that she thinks I just left her. I don’t know what she’s been . told. I don’t know if she thinks I don’t want her and I just left her in . Egypt. ‘The one thing I knew when I got on . that plane [home from Egypt] without her is no matter what it took, no . matter how long it took, I would find Elsa and she would find her life . as it was. She found it very difficult being away from me for any length . of time. I know that she wants to be back home with mummy and I hope . that they do the right thing.’ Desperate: Ms Button has travelled to Egypt several times to try and find her daughter with no success . Elsa disappeared on December 27, 2011, . after her parents, who had separated, took her on holiday to Sharm . el-Sheikh to visit Salama’s family. Salama sneaked her out of their . apartment and texted Miss Button to demand she sign a contract giving up . all parental responsibilities. Miss Button went to the British . Embassy and the local police for help but was forced to return to the UK . to get legal advice. Meanwhile, Salama also returned to England, where . he had been training in Southampton to be a teacher. He was detained by police and in . January last year was jailed for contempt of court as he refused to . reveal where he is hiding his daughter. Last week, his continued silence . saw him sentenced to a further 12 months in prison. Miss Button has been back to Egypt . four times to look for Elsa, who will celebrate her sixth birthday next . Saturday. She has kept her daughter’s bedroom as she left it, with her . unopened Christmas presents still by the fireplace. Mummy's girl: Elsa is apparently devoted to her mother, who has not seen or heard from her for a year . Stuck: Elsa has been left in Egypt with relatives but without either her father or her mother . ‘To snatch Elsa away from me was the . cruellest thing anyone could do,’ she said. ‘For me, the difficulty is . the emptiness of the house... waking up in the morning and expecting to . hear her.’ Miss Button, a consultant at Yorkshire . Building Society, met Salama when he was working at an international . school in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2005. The couple married in Egypt in 2006 . and moved to England in 2007 following Elsa’s birth. They separated in 2009 but continued . to live together in the family home in Leeds for Elsa’s sake until . Salama began a teacher training degree in August 2010. Distraught: Ms Button has spoken of her distress at living in an empty house without her daughter . Empty: Elsa's Christmas presents are still sitting unwrapped in her bedroom in Leeds . Miss Button agreed in 2011 to go on holiday with him to Egypt so Elsa could see her grandparents. While they were there, she asked him . to consider a divorce and admitted she had struck up a relationship with . an ex-boyfriend. Furious, Salama tried to make her give up Elsa by . accusing her of adultery – a criminal offence in Egypt. Miss Button has been prevented from . talking about the case until now because Elsa was made a ward of court, . meaning her identity could not be revealed. Kate Banerjee of Jones Myers LLP, the . lawyers acting for Miss Button, said: ‘Elsa is without the love and care . of either a mother or father in a country where she doesn’t speak the . language or understand the culture. We appeal to anyone who knows Elsa’s . whereabouts to just pick up the phone and help us return this little . girl to her mother.’","Naomi Button has not seen daughter Elsa since she was abducted by ex Tamer Salama over Christmas 2011 .

Barry Bell (pictured) stabbed business partner Gary Brown while on the way to a bank meeting. He was today sentenced to 12 years in prison . A man stabbed his new business partner six times as they drove to the bank because he feared the manager would reveal debts he had hidden from him. Car dealer Gary Brown had to be brought back to life by doctors after his financial advisor Barry Bell plunged a knife into his neck and chest in a horrific car park attack. The pair had been travelling in one car and on their way to a pre-arranged meeting with their bank manager, a judge heard today. But Bell owed his 53-year-old victim £40,000 pounds and he was worried the bank . would reveal he was also heavily in debt to other people after a £15,000 . pound repayment cheque bounced, the court heard. The business partners had been . travelling to a meeting with their bank manager in Bedford, . Bedfordshire, when Bell pulled over, and began a brutal assault which . left the father-of-three fighting for survival. After Bell was sentenced to 12 years for the brutal attack on his business partner at Luton Crown Court today, Mr Brown attacked the 'appalling' justice system after the attacker was told he could walk out of prison in just six years. Speaking outside court, the motor trader, of Buntingford, Hertfordshire, said: 'Twelve years is not 12 years - he'll be out in six years able to start his life again, but I'll be worse off. 'This has been hanging over me and my family for months and put a lot of stress and strain on us. I'm not able to work and I've lost all my money. 'The fact a man has come so close to killing me will be walking the streets in six years' time is disturbing. It's appalling.' The attack on May 17 last year was only stopped when a brave member of the public 'saved Mr Brown's life"" by opening the car door and shouting for help. Mr Brown said: 'What sort of person can be friendly and talking to you one minute and climbing all over you with a knife the next minute? 'He's a danger to society and I am fearful about the future. I keep telling myself I'm lucky to be alive but what life will I have now? Bell owed Mr Brown (pictured today) £40,000 pounds and he was worried the bank would reveal he was also heavily in debt to other people after a £15,000 pound repayment cheque bounced, Luton Crown Court heard . 'I've got a child at university and two more in school and I can't work. How am I going to provide for them?' Bell, of Lindisfarne Priory, Bedford, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to endanger life after a jury acquitted him of the more serious charge of attempted murder. The financial advisor, who had no previous convictions, stood expressionless in the dock wearing a black suit, blue shirt and burgundy tie as Judge Richard Foster jailed him for 12 years. 'You will serve up to half of what I'm about to pass,' the judge said. 'It's quite clear from the evidence that you pre-planned and premeditated this attack. Mr Brown - pictured left and right with his family outside court today - attacked the 'appalling' justice system after the attacker was told he could walk out of prison in just six years . 'You took that knife from the garage where you had been that morning; you were trying to find a quiet place in a car park in order to carry out this attack. 'This was a sustained and repeated assault on the victim. 'You are very fortunate that he did not die. Had he died, you would be facing sentencing for murder today.' Praising the Good Samaritan who stopped the attack, Judge Foster said: 'So many people these days, given what must have been a horrific sight, would have passed by and not got involved. He did get involved. 'By that intervention, he might have saved someone's life.'","Car dealer Gary Brown was brought .

Snatched: Two men walked into mother Donna Cooper's house in Lemington, Newcastle, and grabbed her 21-month-old little boy Vinnie . Knife-wielding raiders have stormed a mother's home and tried to snatch her toddler. The two men walked into mother Donna Cooper's house in Lemington, Newcastle, and grabbed her 21-month-old little boy Vinnie. With hoods covering their faces and armed with a large knife, the pair confronted Ms Cooper's boyfriend Paul Alexander, before one of them scooped the toddler up and ran upstairs with him. The men fled after Mr Alexander chased them and Ms Cooper found Vinnie left unscathed in her bed upstairs. But the 33-year-old mother of four is now terrified to let her son out of her sight in fear he could be taken from her. Ms Cooper said: 'There aren't any words to describe how I feel. 'I just keep thinking about these strangers putting their hands on my son and I feel sick. They could have done anything to him. 'Whoever it was thought it was OK to come in here with a knife and pick up my son. I was just so relieved he wasn't harmed.' The men entered while Ms Cooper was taking her other three children to school on Tuesday morning. Mr Alexander and Vinnie were downstairs in the house when the men walked in through the unlocked front door around 9.15am. Mr Alexander said: 'They were wearing hi-visibility jackets and had hoods covering their faces. I thought they were workmen at first, but then I saw one of them was carrying a large kitchen knife. 'Then one of them said, 'Take the bairn (child) out of the room'. Realising the raiders planned to take Vinnie, Mr Alexander ran into the kitchen to arm himself with a knife, but as he did so one of the men ran upstairs with the toddler before later fleeing through the front door. Shock: The knife-wielding pair confronted Donna Cooper's boyfriend at her home in Lemington . Unsure whether Vinnie was still with the men, Mr Alexander chased them, calling the police as he went. He said: 'I had no shoes on or anything. I just ran out in my bare feet with my phone and a knife. I didn't know what to do, it was so unexpected. 'I'm totally on edge... I'm constantly looking over my shoulder' Donna Cooper, mother . 'The whole thing was completely surreal. You hear about things like this, but you don't think it's going to happen to you.' He then watched as two men got into a red van and drove away at speed, before he returned to the house. To his relief, Vinnie was still upstairs, tucked up in his mother's bed. Northumbria Police are appealing for information about the raid and particularly want to talk to anyone who saw a red flat-bed truck in the area. Det Sgt Michelle Robson said: 'While no one was injured and nothing stolen, this has obviously left the man and the child distressed. 'We're making extensive inquiries into this incident and would urge any witnesses to contact police.' Ms Cooper added: 'I'm totally on edge now and will be until they are caught. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder. These men must have known our routine and known what time I'd be out.'","Men walked into Donna Cooper's house in Lemington, Newcastle, and grabbed her 21-month-old boy Vinnie .

Ernst & Young, announced today as administrator to the Leeds-based group, said the 121 shops would continue to trade while a buyer for the business is sought. Republic started as a men’s denim retailer in 1986 under the Best Jeans brand in Leeds.

Having started with 528 stores at the time of its appointment, Deloitte will continue to look for buyers for the stores not currently up for closure. Joint administrator Lee Manning said: 'We have continued to review the performance of individual stores since our appointment a month ago and have concluded that further closures are necessary in order to restructure the company for sale. 'We are in discussions with a number of parties interested in purchasing all or parts of the business and will update on progress in due course.' The 164 stores identified today employ an average of five members of staff and will close over the coming weeks. Deloitte said: 'Staff in the stores affected by the closures will be facing redundancy. A dedicated employee helpline is in place and the company is running an employee assistance programme to help those staff facing redundancy find other jobs.' Customers will be notified in advance of the closure so that they can return their outstanding rental items beforehand. He added: 'We will continue to trade .

A baby's parents were told she had ‘nicked’ her finger at nursery – only for her father to discover when he arrived that it had been chopped in half. Staff at the private £900-a-month crèche allegedly failed to realise Sophie Dedek had lost her fingertip until someone spotted it on the floor while they were cleaning. Her father Pavel, 37, turned up to find nine-month-old Sophie with a blood-soaked towel wrapped around her hand and the severed 1cm of her finger in a cup of ice. Pain: Nine-month-old Sophie Dedek lost part of her finger at a nursery in Gosforth, Newcastle. Her parents Jana and Pavel are devastated and demanding compensation for their daughter . Scene: The manager at Kids 1st Day Nursery called 999, but was advised an ambulance would not be necessary by the operator . Hospital: Mr Dedek drove Sophie to A&E where surgeons spent two-and-a-half hours trying to reattach the fingertip . Horrified that no ambulance was on its way, he drove her to A&E himself while a nursery nurse held her arm in the air to stop the bleeding. Surgeons spent two-and-a-half hours trying to reattach the fingertip, which had been cut at the second joint, but the task was fruitless. Now Mr Dedek, a manager at an estate agent, and his wife Jana, 31, are demanding compensation for Sophie as she will be maimed for life. He said: ‘When I spoke to them on the phone, they said she had just nicked her finger. I thought I would just be picking her up and putting a plaster on it. I arrived to find Sophie’s hand wrapped in a towel, and next to her a cup with the remains of her finger in it. ‘As I drove her to the hospital I started crying. It was the worst day of my life.’ The incident on January 4 came as the Government raised concerns over the number of ‘under-qualified’ people working in childcare. There is no suggestion that the nurse involved in the accident was inadequately qualified. Sophie was having her second ‘taster’ session at Kids 1st Day Nursery in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. It is thought the unnamed nurse did not notice the baby had crawled up behind her when she opened a door to put something in a bin. When she closed the door, she looked down and saw Sophie crying, with blood on the little finger of her right hand. Not realising the full extent of the injury, a fellow nurse wrapped it in a towel while another called her father to ask him to pick her up.

A young woman who was given three months to live and started completing her ‘bucket list’ has stunned doctors by making a miraculous recovery. Kayleigh Allport bravely made a list of things to do before she died when she was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer at the age of just 21. Her list of final wishes, which takes its name from the phrase, ‘kick the bucket’, included learning to drive, seeing a West End show and visiting New York - her life-long dream. Brave: Kayleigh Allport was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 21 after being given three months to live . It was only when she returned from the United States that her fortunes changed, when doctors put her on a new treatment which might prolong her life. She was warned that it would not cure her illness -but against the odds she proved the experts wrong and is now in remission. Kayleigh, now 26, has just completed a degree and now plans to marry her boyfriend Richard Glasby, 24. She said: ‘The drug has worked wonders. I was given three months to live but I’m still here now. ‘I’m so grateful and I live life to the full now. ‘Before this happened I was quite shy, but now nothing holds me back or bothers me anymore. ‘Facing up to dying has showed me how to live.’ Six years after being told she had months to live, Kayleigh Allport graduated from Teeside University with a 2:1 in psychology. Left to right mum Michelle, Kayleigh, sister Claire, and dad Eddie . Pictured from left to right dad Eddie, sister Claire, mum Michelle and Kayleigh in New York, listed as a place to visit on Kayleigh's bucket list . The problems began for Kayleigh when she had a scan for an unrelated back problem and doctors found a tumour on her kidney. The cancer was removed in an operation and she was told no further treatment was needed. But two years later, she received the devastating news that the cancer was back - this time in her liver. Doctor said described the organ as ‘a mass of tumours’ and declared it inoperable, giving her three months to live. It was then that Kayleigh, from Middlesborough, started on her bucket list - which saw her taking driving lessons and going to see her first West End show, Dirty Dancing. And after tireless fundraising by family and friends, Kayleigh, her mother Michelle, 45, father Eddie, 51, and sister Claire, 25, jetted off to New York fulfil the then 21-year-old’s final wish. After taking part in a drug trial, Kayleigh Allport has been told she is in remission and plans to marry her boyfriend Richard Glasby . The drug trial had terrible side effects, but it helped Kayleigh pass her three-month deadline . She added: ‘I just thought of the list, it was just things that I’d always wanted to do. ‘When I first found out I had three months left to live, I was in shock. ‘There were a lot of people around me and it was hard to take in. ‘I came to terms with it a couple of days later.’ On her return from America, Kayleigh was offered the chance to take part in a drug trial of Sunitinib, which was brand new to the market. The drug had terrible side effects, but it helped Kayleigh pass her three-month deadline. Determined to get on with her life, no matter how long she had left, Kayleigh passed her driving test and enrolled at Middlesbrough College before moving on to study Psychology at Teesside University, graduating with a 2:1. Kayleigh is just about to start a teaching placement and dreams of becoming a primary school teacher . And in September last year, Kayleigh was told she was in remission as the cancer had almost disappeared. She is just now about to start a teaching placement and dreams of becoming a primary school teacher. Kayleigh requires check ups every three months but has been told she is remission and will not require any further medical treatment. Kayleigh said: ‘It feels great because I didn’t think anything like this was going to happen. I’ve got my whole life ahead of me.’ The phrase ‘bucket list’ is derived from the phrase ‘kick the bucket’, a morbidly humorous way to refer to death thought to be derived from the kicking of a bucket in a hanging. The idea was popularised by John Goddard’s ‘Life List’, which featured in the book Chicken Soup for the Soul. It also featured in the film The Bucket List, in which characters played by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman meet in a cancer ward, then race around the world, packing in experiences.","Kayleigh Allport, 26, completed her bucket list of dreams which included a trip to New York .

And it may not be long before the likes of Fifty Shades Of Grey By EL James are also being recommended, as readers have been invited to submit their own suggestions. The book is one of a 27-strong list of 'mood boosting' books which will help those with depression . It is hoped those with ‘mild to . moderate’ mental health conditions will try out the idea before turning . to prescription drugs - many of which can have unpleasant side effects. Debbie Hicks, director of research at the Reading Agency, said: ‘Readers chose books which they thought had qualities that promote well-being. ‘We have funny and humorous titles and you also get books that have quite breath-taking experiences in them. ‘Reading is a really good stress-buster.

They said Bill Bryson’s 19996 book was chosen for its humour value, while the Secret Garden, published in 1910, was selected for its escapism. Cider with Rosie, published in 1959, has stood the test of time as a favourite of the nation having sold over 6 million copies worldwide.

A council has decided to remove all litter bins from residential streets with the extraordinary claim they ‘attract more rubbish’. Officials in Kensington and Chelsea claim bins encourage fly-tipping and increase - rather than decrease - the level of litter on the streets. The West London borough is home to some of the most expensive houses in the UK, with some costing many millions of pounds. From now on, passers-by will only be allowed to dispose of rubbish in busy areas, including shopping and tourist streets. Last night, residents hit out at the plans, which they say would lead to more rubbish building up outside their homes. Amanda Salvesen, 27, a PR manager from Earl’s Court, said: ‘I don’t think they have asked the local residents. They are always full, people use them. They should be adding more, not taking them away.’ But the council defended its position by saying businesses were dumping large quantities of waste in the bins. In a trial in Earl’s Court Road, council officers reported only a very slight increase in littering when bins were removed. Kathy Way, head of waste at the council, said in a report: ‘There are two schools of thought regarding litter bins; one is that litter bins are needed for the public to use, indeed that some members of the public look for litter bins in which to deposit waste, otherwise they may take it home or drop it on the street. ‘The other is that litter bins attract more rubbish, some of which can be unpaid-for commercial waste and domestic waste.’ Cadogan Place in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea where the no-bin strategy is being adopted . Oakley Street (left) and Horton Street (right) are in the affluent borough of Kensington and Chelsea . The scheme follows the council’s ‘naked . streets’ policy of taking away all road markings, signs and pedestrian . barriers from Exhibition Road. It is the first council in London to pursue an anti-bin strategy which, could be repeated elsewhere if successful. The move was prompted by the fact that its bins have been on the streets for more than 15 years and are costly to repair or replace, the Evening Standard reported. Kensington and Chelsea is home to Egerton Crescent, which was last year named the most expensive street in Britain.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:30 EST, 28 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:04 EST, 28 January 2013 . Cabinet minister Owen Paterson has revealed he has received more death threats over ordering a cull of badgers than he ever did from Irish terrorists. He vowed to take on ‘dangerous armed groups… who want to destroy what's been achieved and drag Northern Ireland back to a bloody past’ during two and a half years as Northern Ireland Secretary. But in a startling confession he claimed animal rights campaigners had issued more warnings that he will be killed in just four months as Environment Secretary. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson insisted he would not be diverted from the policy of culling badgers by threats against his life . The 56-year-old insisted his willingness to defy threats against his own life demonstrated his commitment to plough ahead with a cull of thousands of badgers in an attempt to curb the spread of tuberculosis among cattle. Weeks after being moved to head farming policy in September’s reshuffle, Mr Paterson was forced to announce two pilot badger culls in West Somerset and West Gloucestershire would be delayed until summer 2013. Up to 5,500 badgers are due to be shot in the two areas, under plans to cull at least 70 per cent of the badger population. Opponents of the policy hailed it is a minor victory and hoped to force the government to abandon it altogether. But Mr Paterson told an audience of farmers he was completely committee to the cull, even if it meant more death threats. ‘I have had more death threats since I took over at DEFRA than I did when I was Secretary for Northern Ireland,’ he said during an event with farmers in Devon. ‘But these animals die a horrible death from this disease - and it is not sensible to let any population get over-preponderous.’ Mr Paterson was Norther Ireland Secretary at a time of angry clashes between police and loyalist rioters in Belfast, which left dozens of officers injured . Photographs of Mr Paterson's home were published online, along with addresses and personal telephone numbers by animal rights activists. A website also printed the names, addresses and phone numbers of senior civil servants, board members of Natural England, which is licensing the cull, and officials at the National Farmers Union. Mr Paterson's aides said his decision to go public about the number of death threats was fueled by a desire to demonstrate to farmers his ‘commitment’ to his policy. ‘He is very serious and this cull will go ahead.’ Officials refused to give details of the number of death threats made against Mr Paterson, citing security concerns. However, there have been several high profile cases of supporters of the cull being threatened with violence. Protestors against the badger cull have held a series of rallies, but some hardline opponents have threatened ministers and farmers . Compensation to farmers whose herds are depleted by TB costs the taxpayer up to £100m a year. Famous faces including Queen . guitarist Brian May and Sir David Attenborough have voiced opposition to . the cull, and called for peaceful protest against the plan. But the campaign has been hijacked in . some areas by animal rights extremists threatening abuse, violence and . even firebombings against supporters of the cull. Farmers in pilot areas have been warned their land, buildings and homes would be targeted if they signed up to a cull. And two years ago Countryfile presenter Adam Henson said his family had been threatened after fronting reports on the spread of bovine TB. Mr Henson, a dairy farmer in Gloucestershire, said: ‘There are some very nasty extremists about. I have had some serious hate letters from them – things like: “We are going to burn your children.”’","Owen Paterson reveals scale of threats against his life after taking charge of plan to cull 5,500 badgers .

In the West Midlands night temperatures are expected to plunge to -4C, while tomorrow could see London and the South-East hit by snow. The temperatures are much colder than normal for this time of year, a weather expert said, when we should expect averages of around six to eight degrees. Billy Payne, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'It's certainly going to feel much colder today and over the weekend. Among the snowdrops: Rose Cheeseman, three, wraps up warm at Kingston Lacy House in Dorset as extreme cold returns to Britain today . 'Temperatures are expected to stay just above freezing point throughout the day, but with the wind chill factor it could feel more like than -5 degrees, or even -10 degrees where the winds are strongest. 'They could hit around 50mph in Cornwall, while the rest of Britain will see gusts of around 30mph and higher in exposed areas. 'These temperatures are very cold for this time of year. We expect cold weather in February but it is impressively cold really.' On Saturday there is an increasing . risk of snow flurries coming in from the east and spreading across the . west towards Wales leaving a dusting of snow behind. It will remain cold on Sunday with more wintery showers before temperatures start to rise on Monday. The Met Office has issued a health alert amid fears the freezing weather could ravage the health . of the elderly, young children and other vulnerable people. The Met Office said: ‘Prolonged . periods of cold weather can be dangerous, especially for the very young, . very old, or those with chronic diseases.’ ‘This weather could increase the health risks to vulnerable patients and disrupt the delivery of services.’ Joy: There were windy but spring-like conditions in Cornwall today as children enjoyed a half-term walk through a daffodils field . Nature's glory: The boys run through the fields with St Michael's Mount in the background . A .

Health spokesperson said: 'Severe cold weather can be dangerous, . especially for the very young or very old or those with chronic disease. 'You . can find advice on how to reduce your risk or that of somebody you know . on the NHS Choices website, ringing NHS Direct on 0845 46 47 or . contacting your local GP or pharmacist. 'The NHS is well prepared for the winter and we are providing an extra £330 million to the NHS and social care services to help cope with the added pressure that the winter brings.'

'Without warning': Bodybuilder Dale Burns was Tasered four times in less than a minute by police as they struggled to arrest him . A bodybuilder died after being stunned by a Taser four times in the space of a minute as police tried to arrest him. Dale Burns, 27, suffered a fatal heart attack just over an hour after officers zapped him with the electric shock gun ‘without warning’, an inquest jury heard. The taxi driver was also hit with pepper spray while officers held him down and put on handcuffs and leg restraints. The court was told the father-of-two had taken illegal stimulant drugs before eight police arrived at his rented flat in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, following a report that he had damaged a bathroom and was in an agitated state. When Mr Burns advanced towards one of the officers – PC Kevin Milby, who had an X26 Taser – he was stunned four times in just 52 seconds, the court heard. Coroner Alan Sharp said: ‘Dale’s behaviour became more agitated and aggressive. 'He started to throw articles about the room and objects out of the window. There was a risk to passers-by.’ He said after Mr Burns threw a glass out of the window he began to approach PC Milby ‘his eyes rolling to the back of his head and his fists clenched’. ‘He was fearful he would be attacked and feared for his own safety,’ said Mr Sharp. ‘The officer stated that there was simply no time to issue a warning. ‘Barbs lodged in the skin of Dale’s torso, and he received five seconds of electrical charge.’ Mr Burns fell back and knocked his head on his television cabinet, but the shock failed to stop his resistance so three seconds later the officer shocked him again. Pepper spray was then used on Mr Burns before the third shock, 23 seconds later, and then a fourth nine seconds later. Yesterday’s hearing at Kendal County Hall heard Mr Burns had taken the illegal stimulant drug MDPV before the incident, which is similar to speed. 'Gentle giant with a drug habit': Lisa Wilson (right), Mr Burns's former partner and mother of his two children, said he would take pills and inject anabolic steroids as part of his bodybuilding regime, a sport he started to become interested in when he was just 13, his mother Donna Rodden (left) told the inquest . Distressing: At Mr Burns's hearing the jury had to watch distressing CCTV footage of a wild-eyed, semi-naked and agitated Mr Burns, pictured with daughter Honour, in the police van after his arrest for criminal damage . After the shocks were administered, . he was carried downstairs and into the police van, where CCTV footage . showed him naked and struggling. He was driven to Furness General Hospital and was administered with diazepam which sedated him. However, a short while later he suffered a cardiac arrest. Mr Sharp told the jury the drugs were . ‘the primary initiating cause’ of Mr Burns’ death, but there was some . disagreement as to whether the use of the Taser and other restraint . techniques played a part. 'General dissatisfaction': Mr Burns, pictured with son Ethan and daughter Honour, began to suffer from depression from 2009 onwards, his mother said . The X26 Taser transmits up to 50,000 volts and uses compressed air to fire two electric barbs at a target at up to 21 feet. If the Taser shocks are found to be . responsible or partially responsible for Mr Burns’ death, it is thought . he would have been the first person in Britain to die in such a way. The hearing was told Mr Burns worked in railway maintenance for Network Rail, and also as a nightclub bouncer and a taxi driver. He had a daughter, Honour, now five, with his ex-girlfriend Lisa Wilson and a son, Ethan, now three, with partner Sarah Keverne. Miss Wilson agreed with the . description of Mr Burns as a ‘gentle giant with a drug habit’, adding . that he was ‘never aggressive’. His mother Donna Rodden added: ‘Dale . was a big bundle of fun. He was a big gentleman who loved everybody and . wanted to be loved back.’ He developed an interest in . bodybuilding at the age of 13 and won several medals, later taking . steroids as an adult to boost his performance. But he also suffered from depression and began taking recreational drugs including cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis. The inquest continues.","Dale Burns, 27, had taken an illegal drug on the day he died .

Some Armed Forces reservists in Afghanistan are being paid six-figure salaries by the Government, it emerged last night. Military rules state that if reservists’ pay works out less than they would earn in their civilian job, they can claim for extra cash, known as a Reservist Award. So if a reservist works in the City, for example, the gap to be made up between the military pay and their civilian salary can be substantial. Well paid: Some reservists members of the Armed Forces are being paid six-figure salaries because of rules that mean that if they earn less while serving, they can claim for extra cash (file picture) Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that this year, eight reservists called up for duty were paid more than £100,000 for their tour. One of these so-called ‘City soldiers’ was paid £135,000 – several times the pay of regular soldiers – despite only holding the rank of a junior officer. Many of those paid six-figure salaries are understood to be members of the TA unit based in the City of London, the Honourable Artillery Company. Others included members of the Royal Marine Reserve and the RAF Reserve. The Reservist Award is intended to prevent those called up losing out financially because of their service – but some ministers believe the payments cannot be justified and the pay rules are currently under review. An MoD source told The Daily Telegraph: ‘There will have to be a tightening up of the system to limit these costs. It doesn’t make sense to be mobilising junior soldiers on over £100,000 with the Government picking up the bill for their City salary.’ Several doctors and surgeons from the Army medical reserve were also paid more than £100,000 for tours in Afghanistan, with one paid £225,000. Reservist pay rules are being reviewed as the MoD attempts to almost double the number of deployable reservists to 30,000. An MoD spokesman said there was a ‘strict upper limit’ to the Reservist Award, adding: ‘A significant proportion of those in receipt of a large award will be medical experts who deliver world-class care to injured troops on the battlefield.’","Some serving reservists earn up to £225,000 .

The number of horses slaughtered in UK abattoirs has almost doubled in just four years as cash-strapped owners struggle with feed and stabling costs. As a government investigation continues into horsemeat finding its way into supermarket burgers, shocking new figures reveal the extent of horsemeat production in mainland Britain. Last year more than 9,400 horses were sent to abattoirs in the UK, up 84 per cent since 2009. New figures revealed the sharp rise in the number of horses slaughtered in the UK has almost doubled in four years, amid a growing row about horse meat found in British burgers . The RSPCA has warned of hundreds of horses being abandoned and neglected as owners struggle with feed bills . Animal welfare campaigners have warned of a ‘crisis’ in the number of pet animals, including horses, being abandoned or put down because owners can no longer afford the costs of looking after them. New figures released in Parliament reveal 9,405 horses were slaughtered in UK abattoirs in 2012, up 400 from 2011, and a rise of more than 4,300 on the 5,100 slaughtered in 2009. The RSPCA has reported a ‘massive’ 65 per cent increase in the number of animals abandoned in the last five years. Labour’s Mary Creagh, the shadow . environment secretary, said: ‘The number of horses slaughtered in the UK . has nearly doubled in the last four years. ‘We know from animal welfare charities . that people are struggling to feed their pets, including dogs and cats . and obviously horses are very, very expensive to keep and feed.' Revelations about contaminated meat in burgers has raised doubts about the security of the food chain (file picture) The sharp increase in horses sent to abattoirs was revealed by farming minister David Heath, who has faced repeated questions in parliament since it emerged Tesco value burgers contained 29.1 per cent horse DNA. Around 10million beef burgers have since been withdrawn from sale by supermarkets, and other smaller retailers in the UK, since the scandal, which centred around the Silvercrest factory, in County Monaghan, broke earlier this month. Last week Labour claimed a drug that can cause cancer in humans may have entered the food chain through horse meat slaughtered in UK abattoirs. Miss Creagh revealed she had evidence that 'several' horses slaughtered in the UK last year tested positive for the carcinogen phenylbutazone, known as bute. She added: ‘The revelation on Friday that horsemeat contaminated with Bute had been exported and eaten in France raises the question about the adequacy of the meat testing regime and our approach to dealing with this neglected part of the food chain.’","Last year 9,400 horses were slaughtered in Britain, up from 5,100 in 2009 .

"By . Sean Poulter and Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 19:03 EST, 13 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:15 EST, 14 February 2013 . British horse meat contaminated with the danger drug bute has been exported to Europe and has already been eaten or added to processed food, the Daily Mail can reveal. Details are due to be announced by ministers and the Food Standards Agency today. The horses were slaughtered at an unnamed British abattoir in the last few weeks and the resulting meat was tested for the presence of the anti-inflammatory drug bute. But the results of the tests only came back after the meat had been shipped to the Continent and eaten or added to processed food. Scroll down for video . Tests have shown the drug bute is contained in horsemeat butchered in the UK and sent to be eaten and processed into food in Europe . It is not known whether any resulting processed food came back to the UK in ready meals such as lasagne or spaghetti bolognese. The revelation came as Environment Secretary Owen Paterson signalled more raids could be carried out on British firms suspected of selling contaminated meat in the coming days. On Tuesday Food Standards Agency officials raided a Yorkshire slaughterhouse and a Welsh factory which it claimed was passing off horse meat as beef. But the bute scare points to a serious loophole in the food protection regime for consumers, which has been highlighted by Labour’s environment spokesman Mary Creagh. The FSA announced last week that it would be moving to close this loophole with a new regime for horse meat. This new system, which only came into effect days ago, is meant to ensure that no carcass is allowed to be sold for food until the bute test results have come back as negative.

The Peter Boddy slaughterhouse in Todmorden, Yorkshire, which was raided yesterday as part of the police inquiry into the sale of horsemeat being sold as beef . While the presence of bute – phenylbutazone – is a concern, the amounts that appear in horse meat would be extremely small and unlikely to cause any ill effects. It is known to be able to induce blood disorders, including aplastic anaemia, in which the bone marrow stops making enough red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Those with severe or very severe aplastic anaemia are at risk of life-threatening infections or bleeding. Bute is also known to cause cancer in rats, but there is no conclusive evidence for it to have the same effect in humans. Miss Creagh said: ‘With every passing day this scandal seems to get wider. ‘I raised the problem of bute contaminated horse meat being released into the food chain with Defra [farming] ministers last month yet up until two days ago horses were still not being tested for bute and were being released for human consumption. ‘Parliamentary answers released this week show 9,405 horses were slaughtered in the UK for human consumption abroad last year. We must make sure horse meat is not contaminated with bute.’ Workers handle meat at the Doly-Com abattoir, one of the two units implicated in the horse meat scandal. Romanian officials say the meat was properly declared and any fraud was committed elsewhere . Mr Paterson entered talks with EU ministers in Brussels to try to secure mandatory labelling of the ‘Country of Origin’ on all processed meat products, intelligence sharing between regulators, and spot checks on processors and retailers. After the meeting it was announced all member states should carry out 2,500 horse DNA tests on processed beef products and 4,000 bute tests on horse meat during March, and publish the results in mid-April. Mr Paterson has put the blame for the food fraud scandal on retailers, saying: ‘People have got to trust what they buy and the ultimate link between the quality of the products and what is marked on the label has got to be the business selling the product. ‘If people are being sold a product that says processed beef and get a product that contains a significant amount of horse meat, that is a fraud.’ FSA officials said they were looking at trails – where the meat went – from five slaughterhouses in the UK that regularly process horses. Mr Paterson said Tuesday’s raids were the result of information  passed to the Food Standards Agency after contamination was first detected in Ireland three weeks ago, and said the agency was doing ‘methodical, painstaking work … sifting through data’. Tesco withdrew its everyday value spaghetti bolognese when it emerged that it contained horsemeat. The product was prepared in Europe . ‘We saw vigorous action yesterday, and we may well see some more action over the course of the coming few days’, he said. ‘But it’s not very clever to give advance notice of what we are going to do in carrying out investigations that may lead to criminal prosecutions.’ However, he insisted processed meat on British supermarket shelves was safe to eat, and even said he would eat anything, including horse. ‘I’m relaxed about it’, he said. ‘I’m omnivorous, I’ll eat anything.’ Mr Paterson said it was ‘too early to tell’ how many people may have eaten burgers and kebabs from the firms raided yesterday, or what chemicals could be in them. A police community support officer stands guard at the gate of the Peter Boddy slaughterhouse . Last week Mr Paterson described the scandal, then only linked to horse meat sent from Poland to Ireland, and from Romanian slaughterhouses to the French food company Comigel,  as an ‘international criminal conspiracy’. Yesterday he said the premises raided in Britain were a separate issue. The FSA were ‘working through all those involved in the slaughter of horses … and that work is carrying on, they are looking through invoices and customers lists’, he said. ‘There will be further action, depending on their investigation,’ he said. He added that when the investigation was over there were likely to be ‘lessons to be learned’, for the agency. At Prime Minister’s question time, David Cameron said it was ‘appalling’ and ‘completely unacceptable’ that consumers were buying beef products that turned out to contain horse. ‘I do think that this is a serious issue. People are genuinely worried about what they are buying at the supermarket and I really think we have got to get a grip,’ he said. ‘Retailers I think do bear a real responsibility here. ‘At the end of the day, it is they who are putting products on their shelves and have got to say that they are really clear about where that meat came from, what it was, who it was supplied by.  It is up to them to check that and I think that is vitally important.’ Yesterday a Dutch meat broker, Draap Trading Ltd, was named as a middleman in the horse meat scandal. The company bought some £45,000 of horse meat from a Romanian abattoir, some of which eventually ended up in Britain. By Consumers Affairs Editor and James Tozer . Farmbox Meats Ltd business owner Dafydd Raw-Rees, pictured yesterday in Llandre near Aberystwyth, west Wales . A British factory accused of turning horses into burgers and kebabs continued to operate yesterday despite official claims it had been shut down. The discovery concerning Farmbox Meats, based near Aberystwyth, was further evidence of the shambles surrounding the handling of the scandal. On Tuesday, the Government’s Food Standards Agency announced that Farmbox Meats and a slaughterhouse in Yorkshire, which had allegedly supplied horse carcasses, had been closed. The abattoir is owned and run by Peter Boddy of Todmorden, who has a licence to shoot and slaughter unwanted or injured racehorses. The FSA issued a categorical statement, saying: ‘The FSA has suspended operations at both these plants.’ It went on to declare that it and the police had ‘detained all meat found and seized paperwork, including customer lists from the two companies’. However, yesterday morning the owner of the Farmbox factory insisted it was ‘business as usual’ and accused the FSA of being ‘untruthful’. Staff wearing hair nets were busy de- boning and cutting horse carcasses ready for export to Belgium. Outside the plant stood large blue crates of meat of unspecified origin, with no evidence of FSA officials or the police on the site. It is housed in an anonymous-looking white-walled concrete building down a narrow country lane in the Ceredigion hills. The factory is owned by local businessman Dafydd Raw-Rees, 64, a former turkey farmer who is president-elect of the local golf club. He was arrested in 2002 over an alleged offence of supplying meat from illegally slaughtered livestock but was never charged. The manager of the Farmbox plant, Colin Patterson, was tried at Swansea Crown Court and later acquitted. In a separate case, his co-defendant Carmello Gale was in 2004 jailed for six months for running an illegal abattoir near Llandysul, West Wales. Andrew Rhodes, director of operations at the FSA, said its raid on Tuesday established that ‘horse meat had been used as though it were beef in kebabs and burgers at that premises’. Farmbox Meat (pictured) was raided by police and the Foods Standards Agency . But last night Mr Raw-Rees said that while the plant did handle horse carcasses, it did not process any meat and hadn’t passed it off as beef. Denying he had been ordered to suspend production, Mr Raw-Rees said he had only begun deboning horse meat supplied from Ireland three weeks ago. ‘It is taken from here to Belgium and I get paid for doing the cutting up,’ he said. ‘I don’t do kebab meat, minced meat or beef burgers. There is absolutely no cross contamination.’ Mr Raw-Rees claimed he had only had three deliveries of cattle from the Todmorden slaughterhouse. Locals described Mr Raw-Rees as a ‘colourful character’ who had told them work at the plant – which employs 14 people – had ‘taken off’ after it started handling horse meat. Later the FSA said: ‘All meat on site was detained yesterday. This morning we confirmed in writing their licence to operate is suspended.’","The horses were slaughtered in UK and tested for phenylbutazone, or bute .

And having made their name in sharp Italian tailoring, the Daily Mail can reveal that Armani now plans to open a £100million luxury hotel in the heart of London. The fashion house is close to snapping up Admiralty Arch, the majestic gatehouse leading from Trafalgar Square to Buckingham Palace, and plans to offer rooms from December 2015. But a full designer makeover will be required as the Grade I listed arch, built in memory of Queen Victoria in 1912, is in disrepair – a warren of dusty, dilapidated offices. Admiralty Arch is close to being turned into a luxury Armani hotel in London. The arch would make one of the most stunning hotel locations in Europe . The arch provides the backdrop to some of the most historic events, such as the Queen's Diamond Jubilee (pictured) Armani’s bid has not been made public, but a well-placed source has revealed the deal is at an advanced stage. It was already known that the Government has leased the landmark to developers led by Spanish entrepreneur Rafael Serrano who was behind the glitzy Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge. Mr Serrano stressed that the 100-year-old building’s period features would be painstakingly preserved. Giorgio Armani is one of the most iconic designers alive today . Armani’s involvement follows the success of its hotels in Dubai and Milan. It is looking at sleek marble fittings for between 80 to 100 guestrooms, royal and presidential suites, with initial estimates suggesting the bedrooms will each cost £600,000 to kit out. A restaurant and bar will be open to the public. There will be shops too, selling the luxury label’s goods. It is understood Giorgio Armani himself would design every aspect of the hotel from the bespoke furnishings to the menus. A source said: ‘Armani has been looking for the ideal London base for some time, and this is the result of a long search. It is a closely guarded secret but the plans are at an advanced stage.’ The developers, a London-based consortium called Prime Investors Capital, are liaising with the  Government on the security implications, due to the arch’s position overlooking Whitehall. Buckingham Palace has been consulted. The deal depends on Westminster council granting planning permission, which will take at least six months as the proposals must be scrutinised by conservation experts. Prime Investors Capital denied they had chosen an operator for the hotel. An Armani spokesman said its involvement was ‘unfounded rumours’. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘The restoration project that will see Admiralty Arch turned into a publicly accessible landmark hotel is still in the early planning stage. ‘No decisions on the hotel operator have been made. Prime Investors Capital are consulting their in-house advisers on hotel operations.’","A source says that a deal between Armani and the government is at an 'advanced stage'

Reform: Police Minister Damian Green will announce reforms for fast-track justice in cases for driving and shoplifting offences . Criminals are waiting so long to go to court because of ‘shocking’ delays in the justice system that they commit more crimes, the Police Minister will warn today. Damian Green will announce reforms for fast-track justice in cases for driving and shoplifting offences, which are usually tried in a magistrates’ court. He said the chronic inefficiencies in the justice system – with 44 per cent of criminal cases failing to go ahead on the scheduled day – would provoke a ‘national outcry’ in any other sector such as health. Mr Green puts ‘unforgivable’ delays in the system down to a ‘blame culture’ in which police, courts and the Crown Prosecution Service failed to take responsibility. ‘Nobody involved in the system finds it shocking, because that’s just the way it is. ‘Actually, with a completely fresh pair of eyes, this is shocking, this is not acceptable. Delay cause extra crime.’ Mr Green said drug addicts caught shoplifting to fees their habit receive no treatment while awaiting trial for up to six months, and may commit further crimes. 'The faster you can get it through, the more likely you are to have gone through the system, be put on probation and these days hopefully to be put on a drug rehabilitation programme which will stop you needing to shoplift in the first place', he said. 'That's a direct link between a more efficient system and a system that actually helps cut crime.' The failings in justice justice system today reminded him of those described by Charles Dickens in his novel Bleak House, he told the Daily Telegraph. Blame: Mr Green puts 'unforgivable' delays in the system down to a 'blame culture' in which police, courts and the Crown Prosecution Service failed to take responsibility . 'The world has moved on and got indescribably faster since the mid-19th century but some parts of the criminal justice system are not keeping pace,' he said. Mr Green is expected to call for longer hours of operation for magistrates’ courts to get through a backlog of cases, as occurred during the criminal cases that followed the London riots in 2011. However campaign groups have said this is not the best way to reform inefficiencies in the system, as some delays are down to waiting for the police to investigate cases. Mr Green said a new criminal justice board would be set up to get senior judges, the police, prosecutors and the courts talking to one another. He added that getting cases to court more quickly would encourage witnesses to come forward. Javed Khan, of Victim Support, said victims would welcome moves to 'reduce needless bureaucracy and time wasting' across the system.","Damian Green will announce plans for driving and shoplifting offences .

Each nursery worker will be able to . look after four under-two-year-olds, rather than three as now. The . number of under-fives goes up from four to six. Childminders will be able to have two babies in their care rather than one, and four under-fives, not three. Officials point to figures which show that in Ireland, the Netherlands and France nursery staff can look after at least six children and in France up to 12. Every parent will get help with childcare costs in a massive extension of government funding to cut bills. Deputy PM Nick Clegg had initially suggested extra funding would be targetted at low-income families before insisting last week that he was ‘unambiguously in favour’ of giving more support to ‘the British middle classes’. But today education minister Elizabeth Truss went further and promised all working parents would benefit. Ministers are also finalising plans . for £1.5billion in tax breaks for working families with young children, . expected to be worth at least £1,000 a year to help pay for spiralling . costs of childcare. Miss Truss told the BBC: ''We want to help all families, all . families who go into work we want to help with their childcare costs, . we’re absolutely clear about that.' Details are expected to be announced in the Budget in March. She was forced to deny the funding package had been watered down. 'It hasn’t fizzled out. It is coming, . it may be slightly longer in the gestation than would be ideal, but it . is coming,' she told BBC Radio 4. But Professor Penn told BBC Radio 4:' I think that Liz Truss simply got the figures wrong about the ratios in other countries. She has left out assistants, she has left out the number of children that might be with a childminder at any one time. 'The figures she gives seem to me to be rather grotesque.' Professor Penn co-wrote a report for the government with Professor Eva Lloyd last year which warned relaxing ratios would lead to a 'deterioration' in the quality of care. Today Professor Lloyd said: 'The ratio relaxation is unlikely to reduce childcare costs, but may well drive down childcare quality.' Miss Truss insisted the choice on how many children are looked after in nurseries should be up to firms and parents. 'At the moment, many nursery and private, voluntary and independent settings do not use full ratios,' she said. 'We think teacher-led settings with full ratios and structured activities are a good thing. Ofsted will favour this too. We do not mean to stipulate how all settings should behave, but we want parents to have the choice.' Setting out her plans to raise standards, she warned childcare workers need fewer . qualifications than those working with animals. Miss Truss expressed concern . at the ‘hair or care’ stereotype of underqualified girls going into . hairdressing or childminding. In . a bid to drive up standards, the Tory education minister will insist . nursery staff must have at least a C in GCSE English and maths. The minister said: ‘Staff in this country earn about £6.60 an hour on average, only a little above the minimum wage. This speaks volumes for how much those working in the early years have hitherto been valued.’ Allowing better qualified staff to look after more children, the government hopes pay levels in the childcare sector will increase . New graduate level ‘early years teachers’ are to be specifically trained to teach young children. Miss Truss said that ‘too many people who work with young children are under-qualified’. Education minister Elizabeth Truss is expected to launch new tougher qualifications for people who want to look after pre-school children . ‘Given what we know about early years . development, it is no longer acceptable that childcare professionals are . not required to have a GCSE grade C or above in English and maths,’ she said. Highlighting the contrast with abroad, . she added: ‘In France, at least 40 per cent of staff in crèches must . hold a diploma, which demands a three-year, post-16 course. In the . Netherlands, certified childcare workers must train for two years . post-18.’ Expert Government advisers have expressed concern at ‘the hair or care stereotype’, in which . often students with ‘the poorest academic records’ are  steered towards . childcare. She quoted Helen Perkins, head of . early years and childhood studies at Solihull College, who said: ‘We . demand that students need a relevant qualification before they are able . to handle animals independently on our animal care courses. Nobody . demands the same level of qualification before you can be left alone . with a baby.’ Older pre-school children do best in . ‘teacher-led settings’ with ‘structured activities’, which will be . favoured by Ofsted, she will say. However, Labour’s shadow education . secretary Stephen Twigg said the plans threatened child safety. ‘This Government has created an . affordability crisis by cutting support and pushing up costs for . parents. Watering down quality is the wrong way to try to deal with the . problem they’ve caused,’ he said. ‘Experts are warning this could threaten child safety and won’t reduce costs. Parents will be worried.’ Chris Keates, general secretary of teaching union the NASUWT, said: 'No one doubts the importance of high-quality, affordable childcare. 'Seeking to drive down costs by packing more children into childcare settings compromises the quality of provision that is essential to the learning and development of the very youngest children.'","Education minister Elizabeth Truss unveils childcare revolution .

David Cameron today announced the Cabinet minister overseeing the 'shocking' horsemeat scandal has been summoned to return to London to get a grip on the crisis and reassure the public. After a day of confusion surrounding the whereabouts of Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, it emerged he has spent the day dealing with the scandal over the telephone from his Shropshire constituency. The Prime Minister used a press conference in Brussels to announce 'The Secretary of State for agriculture is returning to London' after the government admitted it cannot guarantee that food being served in schools and hospitals today does not contain horsemeat. Scroll down for video . Downing Street said it could neither confirm nor deny that meals sold in schools, hospitals in prison did not contain horsemeat (file picture) Mr Cameron said it was a 'very shocking story, it's completely unacceptable'. He added: 'This isn't really about food safety. It's about effective food labelling, it's about proper retail practice, and people will be very angry to find out they have been eating horse when they thought they were eating beef. 'I know there is great public concern about this issue,' he said during a press conference in Brussels. In the wake of fresh revelations that . Findus beef lasagnes contained 100 per cent horse meat since last summer, . police forces across Europe are now investigating ‘criminal acts’, Downing . Street said. This morning a spokesman for the Prime Minister told journalists Mr Paterson was working on the crisis from the department in central London. But it has now been confirmed that he was in fact in Shropshire, but has been in regular contact with officials, retailers and inspectors from the Food Standards Agency. Mr Paterson has been accused of ‘pretending this isn’t . happening’ amid growing calls for ministers to convene an emergency . cross-government summit to get a grip on the crisis. It is understood he will now chair an emergency summit with retailers, suppliers and Food Standards Agency officials tomorrow morning, amid concern in government that Mr Paterson has not been visible to reassure the public. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is coming under pressure to prove the government has a grip on the crisis . The government has stressed that the . responsibility for knowing what is in food lies with retailers, but held . out the prospect of a wide-rangng review of food standards laws to . prevent a collapse in public confidence in the security of the supply . chain. But both Number 10 . and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs refused to . say what checks were being carried out by the government on beef . products being served and sold to schoolchildren, hospital patients and . prisoners. And the . Department of Health sought to absolve itself of responsibility. A . spokesman said: 'A Department of Healths spokesman said: 'It is not a . Government issue – every hospital sources its own food, it would be a . case of speaking to every hospital. It is all locally sourced.' The GMB union said hospitals, schools and meals-on-wheels services should check they are not serving horsemeat. Brian Strutton said: 'Hospitals, schools and council care services . provide millions of meals with meat products every week to the young, . the elderly and the sick. 'With . rising public alarm over the prevalent use of horse meat in retail food . products and possible health issues, the Government must require all . public services that feed vulnerable members of society to verify that . they have not used horse meat.' Mr Heath, the Lib Dem junior farming minister, was asked to reassure parents and patients that horsemeat was not being served in schools and hospitals. But he told BBC Radio 4: 'You are asking me to give an assurance on behalf of a great number of different purchasing agencies, lots of different people who make their own decisions about what is appropriate. 'We have given advice we hope people will follow. There is no danger to health but we are very concerned about the contamination of one species to another.' He confirmed that the cases were being investigated by the police who are 'looking at whether there has been criminal behaviour in this country and abroad, we’re involving all the relevant police authorities along with the food standards agencies to make sure that if there is evidence of criminality that we identify it, and we deal with it'. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: 'Our advice is to follow the advice of the FSA and retailers about the products they have bought.' ‘[The PM] is aware of the very distasteful issues which has come to light. Distasteful though this is, there is nothing to suggest any health risk,’ she added. The scandal broke on January 16, when the Irish Food Safety Authroity revealed beefburgers contatined equine DNA, including Tesco Value beefburgers which were 29 per cent horse.More than 10million burgers were stripped from shelves, including Aldi, Teso and Asda. Last night, the Food Safety Agency (FSA) finally acted in the growing crisis and demanded a massive sweep of all beef products for the presence of horse meat. Fresh revelations: Findus confirmed last night that it has been selling packs of its frozen lasagne that contained 100 per cent horse meat . Labour’s Mary Creagh, the shadow . environment secretary, said: ‘I’m waiting for the government, the . experts, for the scientists to issue proper clear advice for consumers. ‘It’s simply not good enough for ministers to sit at their desks and pretend this isn’t happening.’ She . said ministers had ‘pooh-poohed’ her concerns about horses being . slaughtered in the UK, in abattoirs and testing positive for banned . veterinary medicine Bute. ‘It . transpired in answers to my parliamentary questions that six animals . had actually entered the human food chain – five in France and one in . the UK. And two animals have still not been traced by the FSA.’ Asked . if customers should eat beef which they have previously bought and are . keeping in their fridge or freezer, Miss Creagh replied: 'I certainly . wouldn't, but I'm waiting for the Government, the experts, the . scientists, to tell us and issue proper clear advice for consumers. Conservative . MP Anne McIntosh, chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs . select committee, echoed Miss Creagh's sentiments as she insisted that . she would no longer eat processed beef until the scandal was over. Downing Street has tried to distance itself from the horsemeat scandal, insisting it was the responsibility fo the FSA. A Number 10 spokesman added: ‘They are working with the authorities and police in this country as well as other countries. ‘At the moment we are looking at two incidents that have come to light which at the heart are acts of criminality which seem to raise an issue that happened overseas with regard to what food has been imported into Britain. ‘We want people to be reassured that what people see on the label is what they see on the package. It is legal to slaughter and sell horsemeat in the UK provided it is from an approved abattoir. ‘But no-one wants to take away from the fact that these cases are distasteful. We are very concerned about the issues that have been brought to light and that is why there are investigations ongoing.’ The Findus lasagne packs were made by a French company, Comigel, at a plant in Metz. Comigel also makes beef products for Tesco and Aldi. Both supermarket chains have now withdrawn potentially affected lines from their shelves as a precautionary measure. Today MP Tom Watson claimed to have evidence that the company was told that it had inadvertently been selling impure meat as early as last Saturday, and that the violations dated back to August last year. Mr Watson, Labour's outspoken deputy chairman, wrote on his blog today that he had obtained a letter sent by Findus to its wholesale customers warning them that their products did not conform to regulations. The letter read in part: 'Investigations have led one of our suppliers based in France to inform us in writing on 2nd February 2013 that the raw materials delivered since 1st August 2012 are likely to be non-conform and consequently the labelling on finished products is incorrect. The supplier has asked us to withdraw the raw material batches.' Findus could not be reached for comment on Mr Watson's claim. Findus had asked retailers to remove three sizes of beef lasagne packets – 320g, 360g and 500g – from shelves on Monday, citing what it called a ‘labelling issue’. But it has now emerged the products contained horse meat, which constitutes a crime under consumer labelling laws.","Downing Street refuses to confirm that meals for pupils and patients is horse-free and shifts responsibility to Food Standards Agency .

Business minister Jo Swinson was due today to announce disgruntled consumers will be able to make joint claims to avoid hefty legal fees . Plans to enable large numbers of consumers or small businesses to sue rogue firms together could lead to US-style ‘litigation culture’, the CBI claimed yesterday. The body representing industry attacked Government measures to be unveiled today allowing claimants to launch lawsuits together and share costs in ‘class actions’. Business minister Jo Swinson will announce disgruntled consumers will be able to make joint claims to avoid hefty legal fees. The plan has been welcomed by consumer watchdog Which?. Executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘This will give consumers more power against unscrupulous businesses. ‘The proposals will help to put consumers in the driving seat and act as a meaningful deterrent to dodgy or dishonest firms.’ But Katja Hall of the CBI warned it would open the door to the type of class actions seen in the US, where claimants can demand huge compensation pay-outs and cripple businesses with lawsuits. Her criticism is that the system proposed is an ‘opt out’ type, in which many people who may in theory be affected can be included in a suit without their knowledge to give a claim more power and a greater payout. She said: ‘The Government has let the litigation genie out of the bottle by adopting US-style collective actions.’ She said this ‘will fuel a litigation culture in the UK’.’ The Department for Business said similar ‘opt out’ regimes have been introduced in Norway, Canada and Australia and have not led to US-style class actions, and that strict guidelines would ensure only genuine cases go forward. Under the plans, competition laws would be changed to allow consumers to begin or join collective action. Groups will begin arbitration with a firm in the hope it will pay out without legal action. If this fails, the Competition Appeal Tribunal will have more powers to take on class actions. The CBS has warned the plans could cripple firms as they could lead to US-style 'litigation culture'","Government to announce plans to allow consumers to group together to sue .

A single mother seized her neighbor's home and rented it out on Craigslist - after the property had already been foreclosed. Nathalie Heil, 30, collected more than $13,000 in rent since mid-June last year before the property's owners realized what was happening. She was arrested Friday, facing charges of grand theft and fraud, but was released . Saturday after posting a $6,000 bond. The house, in West Palm Beach, Florida, is rightfully owned by Juan Cedano and managed by his daughter-in-law, Kelly Kefner. Ms Keefner told police she had not checked on the property in . the last eight months because the home is in . foreclosure. She said when she visited in late January, the house appeared to be inhabited. Ms Keefner returned to the home with her . husband and met April Wehle, 24, and Talia Williams, 25, who said they . had been renting the home for $1,500 a month since the summer. The women said they found the place through a Craigslist ad placed by Heil, who lives next door. The women told police they had paid a . total of $13,500 in rent by check to Heil and spent another $500 to make . various repairs on the property, according to Heil’s arrest report. Heil believed she owned the house . as the result of an archaic law in Florida which allows squatters to . take ownership if they stay in a home for seven years without permission from the owner, pay taxes and maintain the property. She said the property was abandoned . more than six years ago and she assumed she owned it immediately after . filing 'adverse possession' papers with the courts. Nathalie Heil lived next door to the West Palm Beach property in foreclosure which she rented on Craigslist . There are two types of adverse possession. Adverse possession under color of title means ownership is based on a written document in the County Public Records. The document need not be valid, provided the person claiming possession believes it s valid. The property must actually have been used or enclosed to claim possession. Without a color of title (if there are no documents) the law requires more than mere possession. The occupant must pay property taxes, maintain the property and keep possession of it for seven years without permission of the legal owner. Andre De Palma Barbosa, 23, used adverse . possession to move into an empty foreclosed 7,000-square-foot mansion in . Boca Raton in December. 'Legally, I thought it was right,' she told the Palm Beach Post. Heil told police she had gone to the county courthouse and completed paperwork giving her possession of the residence. Police said they found no record of the paperwork, and property records name Mr Cedeno as the owner. After confirming Mr Cedeno’s ownership — . the county property appraiser lists him as the owner of record dating back to . 2007 — police said they confronted Heil when she went to the home to . collect rent. 'I legally subletted my house, there’s three sides to every story,' she said, noting that Ms Wehle and Ms Williams still live there. Heil said she had received death threats since reports of the incident appeared in the media. 'I’m freaking out,' she said. 'I have a full-time job and I’m a single mom.' Realtor Laura . Pearlman, not speaking specifically about the Heil case. warned that people who rent property from . Craigslist should be cautious. 'Craigslist, that’s like a haven for scam artists,' Pearlman said. 'Don’t give money to anyone unless you know it’s going to the owner or the property management company or a realtor,' she said.","Nathalie Heil, 30, believed she owned house under Florida possession laws .

Confirmed: The Conservatives have named Maria Hutchings, who lost to Mr Huhne in 2010, as their candidate . A mother who challenged Tony Blair on live TV has been named as the Tory candidate in the battle for Chris Huhne’s seat. Maria Hutchings was last night confirmed as the Conservative challenger in the Eastleigh by-election triggered by the resignation of disgraced former Cabinet minister Huhne. She needs to over-turn a Lib Dem majority of more than 3,000, but a poll last night put the Tories three points ahead. Both David Cameron and Nick Clegg know doubts about their leadership will grow if they are defeated in the vote on February 28. Mrs Hutchings, 51, made headlines in 2005 when she ambushed Mr Blair during a live TV debate. She confronted the Labour PM on Five’s The Wright Stuff about the closure of special schools and the link between autism and the MMR jab. Clutching a photo of her autistic son John Paul, she called on him to provide more support for children with learning disabilities. The former Labour supporter yelled ‘Tony that's rubbish’ before studio workers intervened. Soon after the 2005 general election, which Labour won, she met David Cameron, who was then Tory education spokesman. The pair shared their experience of bringing up children with special needs, and she helped launch a Tory pamphlet on the subject. Mrs Hutchings became a member of Mr Cameron’s controversial A-List of high-flying Tory candidates, and was regularly included in lists of female wannabe MPs dubbed Cameron’s Cuties. In 2005 Mrs Hutchings confronted Prime Minister Tony Blair on Channel Five chat show The Wright Stuff, grilling him about the lack of care for special needs children and the reported link between autism and the MMR jab . Studio staff had to take her back to her seat after leaping from the audience to approach Mr Blair . She battled against Huhne in Eastleigh at the 2010 election, but the Lib Dems increased their majority from 568 to 3,864. Mrs Hutchings said: 'We need a local MP we can trust - someone who will support people who work hard and do the right thing. 'Although I may not be a professional politician, I'm a . straight-talking businesswoman and mother of four who lives in the local . area.' The Tories have been warned not to expect a direct boost in support from Huhne's fall from grace. Mrs Hutchings held a photograph of her son John Paul Panzavecchia as she raised questions about phasing out of special needs schools . Maria Hustings was the Tory candidate in Eastleigh in the 2010 general election, when Chris Huhne increase his majority. Chris Huhne (Liberal Democrat) 46.5% . Maria Hutchings (Conservative) 39.3% . Leo Barraclough (Labour) 9.6% . Ray Finch (UKIP) 3.6% . Tony Pewsey (English Democrats) 0.5% . Dave Stone (Independent) 0.3% . Keith Low (National Liberal Party) 0.2% . Lib Dem majority 3,864 . Today Mrs Hutchings said she would not focus on her one-time rival's downfall. 'We are running a clean campaign. I want to talk about the issues that affect the people of Eastleigh,' she said. 'I do not want to talk about Chris Huhne - that issue is in the past.' Former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft warned . his party that though it started the contest in the lead, his polling . suggested few voters were likely to 'switch out of disgust'. The survey conducted for the peer in the immediate wake of Huhne's . resignation put the Tories on 34 per cent, with Lib Dems on 31 per cent, Labour on 19 per cent . and UKIP fourth with 13 per cent. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps will start a big Tory push in the seat today, unveiling the first poster of the campaign. He has made clear the Tories will target Mr Huhne’s lies about passing his speeding points to his ex-wife. ‘For too long the people of Eastleigh have been let down by an MP who was being less than straightforward,’ he said. ‘Residents will take a dim view about having been lied to by their Lib Dem MP.’ Mrs Hutchings confirmed her selection as the Tory candidate on Twitter last night . Staking his political reputation: David Cameron . (right) receives a boost with the first poll of the campaign showing the . Tories have a 3 per cent lead over their Coalition partners after the . resignation of the constituency's disgraced MP, Chris Huhne (left) The Lib Dems are due to select their candidate at a meeting tomorrow, with the party expected to choose a local councillor. All 36 councillors in the constituency is a Lib Dem. Both parties predict the by-election contest will be brutal, because the stakes for the two leaders are so high. Mr Clegg said: 'I think the choice for the people of Eastleigh in the by-election is what kind of an MP do they want to have now. 'I hope that it will be on that basis rather than in a mood or spirit of retribution that the debate will be conducted in Eastleigh.' He sought to draw a clear distinction with his Westminster coalition partners by highlighting the Lib Dem commitment to a 1% annual 'mansion tax' on £2 million-plus properties to fund tax cuts for ""hard-pressed families"" - a proposal the Tories have consistently rejected. Labour sources are hoping for a strong showing, but privately accept they have little chances of winning despite being nine points up on their 2010 showing in the Ashcroft-commissioned poll. In a bitter twist for ED Miliband, if the Labour vote holds up by taking votes from the Lib Dems it could gift the seat to David Cameron. An opinion poll in the Eastleigh seat, carried out for former Tory fundraiser Lord Ashcroft, put the Conservatives three points ahead of the Lib Dems . Lord Ashcroft's poll showed a fall of almost 16 points in Lib Dem support since the 2010 general election, when Huhne scooped 46.5 per cent of the vote.Tories are down five points since the election and Labour and UKIP both up nine. While Tory voters were the most committed to the party and the party was most likely to attract wavering Lib Dems, Labour voters were the most open to switching and preferred the Lib Dems. And two-thirds of those taking part in the poll agreed that ""the Lib Dems do a good job locally in my area"", where the party dominates the local council with 40 out of 44 seats. 'Huhne was a popular and, by all accounts, assiduous MP, and many in Eastleigh will be sad to see him go and circumstances of his departure,"" Lord Ashcroft cautioned. 'The Tories should not expect many to switch out of disgust,' he added, predicting a 'bruising - but fascinating' contest. Senior Labour MP John Denham said: 'In this campaign the Lib Dems and the Conservatives will try to blame each other for what's gone wrong. 'Only by voting Labour can Eastleigh people reject a Conservative-Liberal Democrat Government that cuts taxes for millionaires and doesn't understand how tough life is for local people.'","Maria Hutchings was named the Conservatives' candidate as party unveils first poster .

David Cameron, pictured leaving Downing Street today, has told French President Francois Hollande he is 'keen' to offer more military help in Mali . David Cameron has sent his top security advisor to Paris to step up Britain’s military help for French forces fighting Islamist militants in Mali. In what will be seen as an escalation in the UK’s commitment to the mission, the Prime Minister told French President Francois Hollande he was ‘keen’ to send in more intelligence,  transport  and logistical support. National Security Adviser Sir Kim Darroch is in Paris today to meet his French counterparts about which extra British forces will be committed. ‘We are in discussions with France about what more we can do,’ Downing Street said. French and Malian troops are reported to be close to securing the key city of Timbuktu as rebels fled into the desert. The RAF has already provided two heavy-lift C17 transport planes and a Sentinel surveillance aircraft to assist France's operation. But Mr Cameron used a phone call to Mr Hollande last night to make clear his willingness to offer more British kit and personnel to the French intervention. ‘The Prime Minister made clear that we fully support the French government’s actions working with the Malian government, at their request, to deny terrorists a safe haven in Mali,’ the PM’s official spokesman told reporters. ‘The Prime Minister went on to explain that we are keen to provide further assistance where we can, depending on what French requirements there may be.’ Sir Kim is meeting French authorities . to discuss what further assistance Britain may be able to provide to . them. But Downing Street insisted there would be ‘no combat role’. Instead, Mr Cameron has offered additional logistics, intelligence and surveillance support. Scroll down for video . National Security Advisor Sir Kim Darroch is in Paris to discuss Britain offering extra help to French troops to defeat Islamist terror groups in Mali . On Saturday an RAF spy plane was deployed to support the French military action in Mali as forces made a significant inroad by retaking Gao airport. The highly sophisticated Sentinel aircraft joined two giant C-17 transport aircraft which have been airlifting men and tons of supplies to the country fighting Islamist militants. Carrying a crew of five, the Sentinel has played a vital role in counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan and against Colonel Gaddafi in Libya. A British Sentinel spy plane has joined two C-17 transport aircraft to help French forces in Mali . Downing Street today stressed that military operations were only part of the solution. ‘Actually in the long-term what’s very important are the political and economic legs to improving the situation on the ground and squeezing the space and the scope for grievances that the terrorists seek to exploit,’ Mr Cameron’s spokesman said. Last week the PM warned of a global 'generational struggle' against al Qaida-inspired Islamist terrorism in North Africa and said the UK should ""thicken"" links with region following this month's hostage crisis in Algeria. He said Britain will provide troops to an EU mission to train the Malian military to take on Islamist militants who have taken over the north of the country. The mission, due to deploy in February or March, is expected to include around 250 trainers and 250 force protection troops and Mr Cameron said the British contribution would number 'in the tens, not the hundreds', with aides saying it would be at the lower end of that range.","David Cameron uses call to Francois Hollande to offer more support to intervention in Mali .

Photos courtesy of Make-Up Artist magazine . Stuart Freeborn, one of the greatest make-up artists in Hollywood history, has died aged 98. The 'maestro' of film make-up created the Star Wars characters Chewbacca and Jedi master Yoda, and worked on dozens of huge hits including Superman, Alice in Wonderland, Dr Strangelove and The Omen. Largely self-taught, Freeborn resisted his insurance broker father's attempts to have him follow in his footsteps and instead went on to create make-up and prosthetics for such cinematic legends as Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers. He said in a documentary last year: 'I didn't want to spend my life in an office. I felt I was different.' He died on Tuesday in London from a combination of ailments due to his age, according to his grandaughter Michelle Freeborn. LucasFilm confirmed Freeborn had passed away, 'leaving a legacy of unforgettable contributions.' Star Wars director George Lucas said in a statement that Freeborn was 'already a makeup legend' when he started working on Star Wars. Lucas said: 'He brought with him not only decades of experience, but boundless creative energy. 'His artistry and craftsmanship will live on forever in the characters he created. His Star Wars creatures may be reinterpreted in new forms by new generations, but at their heart, they continue to be what Stuart created for the original films.' Michelle Freeborn, who lives in Wellington, New Zealand, said her grandfather was like a 'hero' to her and inspired her and her late father to get into the movie business, too. She said: 'He was a really fun and imaginative individual. He gave you the feeling that if you wanted to achieve something, you should just get on and do it, and don't ever use excuses. Genius: Stuart Freeborn at work creating Chewbacca for the first Star Wars movie . Director Irvin Kershner said Freeborn put himself into Yoda, and his inquisitive elfin features bear resemblance . Freeborn's six-decade career led him to work on many classics, including Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

His . transformation of Alec Guinness into Fagin -complete with a large . hooked nose - was criticized by some as anti-Semitic, a matter of regret . for Freeborn, who said he was partly Jewish. Freeborn later worked with Kubrick, transforming Peter Sellers into multiple characters for Doctor Strangelove before designing the apes for the 2001 Dawn of Man sequence, in which primates react to a mysterious monolith. But he will likely be best remembered for his work on Star Wars - creating characters such as the 7-foot-tall wookie Chewbacca and the slug-like Jabba the Hutt. Irvin Kershner, who directed The Empire . Strikes Back, said: 'Freeborn quite literally put himself into Yoda, as . the Jedi master's inquisitive and mischievous elfin features had more . than a passing resemblance to Freeborn himself.' Yoda's looks were also said to be partly inspired by Albert Einstein. Freeborn recalled being approached by George Lucas when he was a young man. 'He . was so genuine about it, I thought, well, young as he is, I believe in . him. He's got something. I'll do what I can for him,' Freeborn told the . BBC.

'Everybody will remember him for Star Wars, but he did so much more than that. No one should overlook the groundbreaking work he did on 2001: A Space Odyssey. That was really the forerunner of Star Wars and used a lot of the same technology.' Freeborn's wife, Kay, died in 2012. Freeborn's three sons - Roger, Ray and Graham - also died before him.

Rusroshi had fallen from the bathroom window after accidentally getting locked inside with her two-year-old sister. Rusrosha Barua was taken to Elmhurst Hospital, Queens, where she died of her injuries . Her distressed parents called the superintendent, Hazar Addyli, who got into the bathroom but found only the younger child, who simply pointed to the window. Mr Addyli told the New York Post: 'They called me and said the kids were locked in the bathroom. I went in, and there was one. 'I went downstairs in the back and found the child,' he said. 'I called 911.' One neighbor, Ira Oppenheimer, said: 'The father came running down with the wife. He didn’t have any shoes on. 'They . were both screaming as they were running toward to the ambulance. The . father was yelling, ""That’s my daughter! That’s my daughter!""' Police are trying to determine how the girls got locked in the bathroom and how long they were inside before Rusroshi fell. No criminality is suspected, they said. There were no protective bars installed around the window which Rusroshi fell from, and it is unclear whether the window was open before the girls entered the bathroom. Mr Addyli insisted all of the 32nd Street apartment’s windows had safety bars installed when the family moved in and said there had been no requests to fix or replace any of the bars. A family friend, Shaikritty Barua, 39, escorted Rusroshi's wailing father Pappu Barua, out of Elmhurst Hospital yesterday and said: 'It’s very sad. You can’t imagine, for now, they lost a child.

Harry Grenville, 87, had heard no news of his . parents, Jacob and Klara Greilsamer, and grandmother, Sara Ottenheimer, . since a message in 1944 said they were being sent . 'east' from an internment camp. He was 18 at the time and suspected this . meant they were being sent to the extermination camps in Poland. He never saw . or heard from them again. Now Mr Grenville has been sent a . poignant picture of an old suitcase which has been displayed at the . Auschwitz Museum for years. It bears the name of his father, Jacob Greilsamer, and a serial number. This picture of a suitcase belonging to Jacob Greilsamer, confirmed Harry's parents were taken to Auschwitz . Harry (pictured left) waited 69 years to find out the truth about his father, Jacob Greilsamer (pictured right) The photo was recently taken by a . Polish visitor to the museum. He researched the names on the cases and . contacted a historical society near Mr Grenville's former home town of . Ludwigsburg, near Stuttgart. The . grandfather's details was listed with the group of historians two years . ago when three brass memorial stones were unveiled outside the former . family home and they have emailed him the photo. Mr Grenville, who was evacuated to Britain in the Kindertransport refugee mission, said: 'Out of the blue a photograph has turned up of a whole lot of suitcases of victims at the Auschwitz Museum. 'They have the names of the victims painted on them in white and low and behold, there on this photograph is my father's name.

'This is the first evidence I have ever had that my mother, my father and my grandmother actually arrived at Auschwitz. 'I have carried suspicions with me for a long time and now I have this evidence I feel justified in my suspicions.' Mr Grenville's family owned a successful packaging company in Germany until it was taken over by a member of the SS in 1938. In July 1939 he and sister Hannah, who . was aged nine at the time, were sent to England and lived with a foster . family in Cornwall. Mr . Grenville, who was born Heinz Greilsamer, said: 'My parents knew there . was no possible future for any Jewish children in Germany, indeed nearly . one million Jewish children died under the Nazis. 'After my sister and I left they applied to emigrate to America but nothing happened. 'They carried on living in Stuttgart . until they were taken by the Nazis and sent to an internment camp in .

'Years later, through a historian, I came to learn that all three of them were on the same transport to Poland. 'I suspect the serial number of 960 on the case was the number of the cattle train that took them to Auschwitz.' Before the end of the war Mr Grenville had built up such a hatred of his homeland that he volunteered to join the British army. He added: 'I had a quarrel with the Germans, although I now know it was with the Nazis.' He didn't get the chance to fight in Europe and served as an interpreter at German Prisoner of War camps in England. He left the army four years later. He worked as a biology schoolteacher for 34 years and married his late wife Helen in 1950. They have three children and two grandchildren. His sister, Hannah Robinson, is now aged 83 and lives in New York. Mr Grenville, who was made a British citizen in 1947, returned to Ludwigsburg for the first time two years ago for the unveiling of the commemorative 'Stumble Stones'.

Lookalikes: Girls star Allison Williams says she regularly gets told she looks like the Duchess of Cambridge and has even starred in spoofs videos as the Royal .

It was only in August that iconic luxury department store Harrods opened the doors to its much-hyped gender-neutral toy department. The multi-million pound re-design of the 15 year-old department was the famous store's way of entering the new era with a Toy Kingdom being grouped by theme and not gender. However, Harrods is currently at the centre of a Twitter storm after one user uploaded a photo suggesting that the store hasn't completely revoked gender marketing.

Krystina Meens, a TV freelance journalist and researcher from London, posted an image on Twitter of two children's books placed next to each other in the department store. On the left, a book entitled: 'How to be gorgeous: Smart ways to look and feel fabulous' features a girl on the cover and on the right a book illustrated with a young boy says: 'How to be clever: Smart ways to get smarter'.

'It was the juxtaposition of the two books on the shelf that struck me.' Krystina uploaded a photo of the . books with the caption: 'Shocked and appalled at this in @harrods . children's reading room. Please rt to get these sexist books off the . shelf.'

Krystina, who has worked on feminist . issues in the past, immediately approached a member of the sales team who admitted . she was equally 'appalled' and put her in contact with the manager. 'The manager was embarrassed and blamed WH Smith as the books were part of their concession there. 'I didn't want to complain again but . there were more books next to them of a similar nature.

They then added: 'We would like to apologise for any offence caused and assure you all that these books will no longer be sold at #Harrods.' Krystina, who used to work at the department store, says she wasn't surprised by the public support she gained because she believes that it is an issue that strikes a nerve with many.

When she returned minutes later, she realised thieves had struck and Zorro was nowhere to be seen. 'A laptop or a TV can be replaced. Zorro is like a family member. All my kids are grown, so he’s my baby,' she told Fox News at the time. Nice to see you again: Zorro, who weighs 170lbs, vanished from owner Marcie Trogdon's home, in Jamestown, Virginia, after she popped out of her house, leaving the door on the latch . Despite a far-reaching 'missing dog . campaign' and extensive police search, he was never found and Marcie was . forced to move on with her life, even buying a new dog in a bid to fill . the void left by Zorro. Then on Wednesday night, a flea-bitten and mangy-looking stray who looked remarkably like Zorro appeared in her back yard. '[My neighbour] was like ""Do you know who’s dog this is?"" And I said, ""what dog?"" and . about that time Zorro comes running around the corner and I said ""Oh my . God! That’s Zorro"",' she told the station. 'He immediately came up to the fence and as soon as I let him in he knew he was home.' 'My baby': Marcie Trogden said Zorro appeared in her garden on Wednesday night looking mangy and over weight . Riddle: Exactly what happened to Zorro in the 16 months he was missing remains a mystery . Exactly what happened to Zorro in the 16 months he was missing remains a mystery. A trip to the vet revealed he had contracted ringworm and was overweight, but suffered no serious illness. 'My emotion was ""I'm so glad"", then ""oh my God what's wrong with his skin?""' said Dr Joe Kinarney. 'We don't know what's happened in that time, we don't know the exposure to parasite or to diseases,' the vet added. Trogdon thinks someone stole her dog and brought him back when his care became too expensive. But she says she doesn't care what happened to him. She is just glad to have her dog at home again. 'I just can't believe that my boy is back,' she said, tears of joy filling her eyes. Distraught: Despite a far-reaching 'missing dog campaign' and extensive police search, he was never found and Marcie was forced to move on with her life, even buying a new dog in a bid to fill the void left by Zorro . New friends: Zorro now has a new playmate called Bailey, also a Great Dane . His story is remarkably similar to the 1993 movie Homeward Bound: An Incredible Journey, that follows an American bulldog, a golden retriever and a Himalayan cat as they trek across America on a quest to return to their human family. The film, which is a remake of the 1963 Disney classic The Incedible Journey, starred Michael J. Fox, Don Ameche and Sally Field as the voices of Chance, Shadow and Sassy and was so popular it spawned sequel Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco. The trio encounter a string of dangers including falling into a torrid river, facing a hungry grizzly bear, surviving a chance encounter with an angry porcupine and escaping from an animal pound. After learning to overcome adversity by working together they become friends and finally return home to their owners.

A strike at Madrid’s main airport was causing half-term travel misery for British tourists yesterday. More than 400 flights have been cancelled and 70,000 passengers affected by the action which is to last five days. Workers were demonstrating at the Barajas airport over job losses at Iberia, the Spanish national airline that merged with British Airways in 2011. Engines off: More than 80 Iberia flights were cancelled on Monday as workers at the carrier began the series of strikes that is expected to cost the airline and struggling national economy millions of euros in lost business . Eerie: Taxis queue outside the airport waiting . for passengers to return to Madrid's main airport. But inside, the airport was eerily quiet as . most passengers had been rescheduled . Guard: Riot police officers stand guard at Iberia check-in desk for fear stikers may storm the lobby at Terminal 1 of Barcelona's airport . Protesters waved Spanish flags and . banners saying ‘British go home’ and ‘No to layoffs in Iberia, stop the . British colonisation’. They blame the London-based board of the combined . company – IAG – for a feared cull of 3,800 employees. Bosses are also planning to cut most salaries. Outside the terminal, police beat some strikers with truncheons and made two arrests. Ten per cent of long-haul flights and . half of domestic services will be grounded this week. Queues formed as . some staff abandoned their jobs at check-in desks. An estimated 86 per cent of . passengers have been given different flights, including those operated . by other airlines and the remainder given refunds. Iberia reported a loss of £220million in the first nine months of 2012. In 2010, 49.8million passengers used Barajas. The strike, due to last from February 18 . to February 22, will hit British travellers particularly hard as it . coincides with school holidays in Britain, Spain's biggest source of . tourists. Deserted: Police officers of the Generalitat of Catalonia or Mossos d'Esquadra stand watch in front of Iberia check-in counters during a protest by Iberia workers at Barcelona airport in Prat Llobregat . Nothing to do: Iberia employees man empty check-in counters during the protest . All alone: A lone airport worker walks between two airport 'fingers' at Barajas international airport . In . anticipation of the strike, Iberia had already canceled 415 flights . between Monday and Friday, and as many as 1,200 flights operated by . various airlines will be disrupted because of the lack of handling . services at Spanish airports. But much of the anger is aimed at Britain. British Airways merged with Iberia in 2011 to form the International Airlines Group before reporting a loss of 262 million euros (£226 million) in the first nine . months of 2012. The airline argues restructuring is . vital to return the Spanish unit to profitability while unions say the .

Policemen arrest a Spanish Airline Iberia worker: In anticipation of the strike, Iberia had already canceled 415 flights between Monday and Friday, and as many as 1,200 flights operated by various airlines will be disrupted because of the lack of handling services at Spanish airports . Staff, including baggage handlers and air stewards, are holding three five-day strikes in February and March to protest management plans to axe jobs and cut salaries at the loss-making airline. Some 10 percent of long-haul flights and half of domestic flights will be grounded this week. The labour unions kicked off the demonstrations in the morning with an 8 km-march (5 miles) around Barajas, telling reporters the airline was under threat, as was the future of the airport. Clashes: Outside the terminal police beat some strikers with truncheons. At least two protesters were arrested . Sit down: The protest began peacfully as hundreds of Iberia staff sat in protest in the airport's Terminal 4 . Solidarity: Staff, including baggage handlers and air stewards, are holding three five-day strikes in February and March to protest management plans to axe jobs and cut salaries at the loss-making airline . 'Nobody is safe from being sacked,' said Elias Gonzalez, a maintenance supervisor at the protest who has worked for Iberia for 27 years. The leaders of the European Parliament are threatening to veto the bloc's multi-annual budget because of its deep cuts. The Christian Democratic EPP, the largest group in the legislature, said the seven-year budget worth £830 billion must be revised to realistically reflect the EU's growing competences and responsibilities. Socialist leader Hannes Swoboda called the budget - which needs parliament's approval - unacceptable and said there won't be a majority for the proposed plan. The EU's 27 member states earlier this month agreed on a budget deal that foresees the first cuts in the bloc's history for the years 2014-2020. EU President Herman Van Rompuy defended the plan as shifting funds toward growth-friendly investment while recognizing the need to tighten belts currently felt across Europe. 'There was an initial deal with the company when the merger with the British was agreed, but now there is disagreement.' Although skeleton staff were on duty and the airline had rescheduled most passengers or returned them their money, some people were left stranded. 'When we come for tourism, we don't . want to be bothered by strikes,' said Robert, a French tourist who did . not want to give his last name. 'Everyone has their problems but they shouldn't bother people who bring in money. That's also business.' Queues formed as some staff abandoned check-in desks while unionists shouted in the airport. Tourism . accounts for around 11 percent of Spanish economic output and is one of . the country's few growth sectors in a prolonged recession that has . pushed the unemployment rate above 26 percent. Some 70,000 passengers will be . affected by this week's strike. About 86 percent have been given a different flights, . including those operated by other airlines, while 14 percent had asked . for refunds.

Iberia is just one of several companies in Spain, including Vodafone and bailed-out lender Bankia, to lay off workers. It is fighting an uphill battle against low-cost operators, a depressed domestic economy and competitors that are in better shape after having already gone through restructuring processes.

Tough guy: The On Deadly Ground actor teamed up with firebrand Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio to teach civilians how to guard schoolchildren with guns and martial arts . Actor Steven Seagal has launched a stinging attack on critics of his controversial scheme to train armed 'posses' to defend schools from rampaging gunmen, branding them an 'embarrassment to the human race'. The On Deadly Ground actor has come under fire in recent days after he teamed up with firebrand Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio to teach teams of civilians how to guard schoolchildren with guns and martial arts. The exercise on Saturday at a closed school site outside Phoenix saw sheriff's SWAT members act as . shooters and 25 teenagers playing the part of students during mock . scenarios involving up to three gunmen. But among critics was Arizona Democratic House Minority Leader Chad Campbell, who called the plan 'ludicrous', adding: 'He's making a mockery out of it. You're having a movie actor train people how to protect schools? 'Why don't we also have Clint . Eastwood and Chuck Norris and Bruce Willis come out and train them too . while we're at it.' But Seagal reacted angrily on Saturday, declaring: 'Anybody who has criticized me or the . sheriff for standing up to help the children, in my opinion, is an . embarrassment to the human race.' Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed 'America's Toughest Sheriff', announced the controversial plan in . the wake of December's Newtown school shooting that left 27 . people dead, including the gunman and 20 first-graders. Seagal, best known for his . roles in movies such as Above the Law and Under Siege, led training on . hand-to-hand defense tactics, among . other techniques, drawing from his expertise in martial arts, according . to a sheriff's office news release. When faced with criticism in January about the school posse plan, Arpaio . also snapped: 'Why would people complain about my posse being in front . of schools to act as prevention?' Action: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed 'America's Toughest Sheriff', announced the controversial plan in the wake of December's Newtown school shooting that left 27 people dead, including the gunman and 20 first-graders . He boldly announced the plan on the grounds of an elementary school, saying at the time he wanted the patrols publicised. 'I want everyone to know about it for the deterrence effect,' Arpaio . said, adding that no taxpayer money would be spent on the patrols and . volunteers will be supervised over the radio or telephone by actual . deputies. Campbell, who argues using untrained, armed civilians to protect . students is a bad idea and likely will only make the facilities more . dangerous, is not the only vocal critic of Arpiao's protection . plan. Randy Parraz, president of Citizens for a Better Arizona, also a . longtime Arpaio critic, said it's unfortunate the sheriff, known . nationally for his tough stance on illegal immigration, is using the . 'wake of a tragedy like Newtown' to grab headlines. 'We'd like to think he would take something like this much more . seriously,' said Parraz, who added that his group planned to be at . Saturday's event with petitions to recall Arpaio. The self-proclaimed ""America's Toughest Sheriff"" and action movie star Steven Seagal will train volunteer armed posse members to defend Phoenix-area schools against gunmen . The patrols were launched at 59 schools in January throughout . unincorporated areas and communities that pay Arpaio's agency for police . services. The sheriff announced this week he needs more members to . continue the patrols, calling for 1,000 additional citizens to step up . and volunteer. Current posse members already are used to bolster the sheriff's office . force by providing police protection at malls during the holidays, . directing traffic and transporting people to jail. Arpaio even sent one group of posse members to Hawaii to conduct an . examination into the authenticity of President Barack Obama's birth . certificate. Joselyn Wells, a mother of three children at a school in suburban . Phoenix, where Arpaio's posse has begun patrolling, said she was excited . to hear about the initiative. 'A lot of people sit around and watch these things happen, watch key . signs and no one wants to do anything about it,' she said when Arpaio . announced the plan. 'Nobody wants conflict, nobody wants to be out in . the limelight. And he doesn't care. He wants to do the right thing.' Under siege: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio announced the controversial 'posse' plan in the wake of the December Newtown, Conn., school shooting that left 27 people dead, including the gunman and 20 first-graders . Showboat: Arpaio is running for a sixth term and will challenge former Phoenix police officer Paul Penzone for Maricopa County Sheriff during the general election November 6 . Andrew Sanchez, however, a town council member in Guadalupe, said he . wanted nothing to do with posse members patrolling schools in his . community, which spends about $1.2 million annually for Maricopa County . sheriff's patrols. 'We are paying him to have certified deputies here, not to bring a . circus and not to use our town as a political platform,' Sanchez has . said. The volunteers, dressed in uniforms and driving patrol vehicles, some . authorized to carry guns after training, won't go onto school grounds . unless they spot danger, but will instead patrol around the facilities, . Arpaio said. Seagal is already a volunteer posse member in Maricopa County, and has . been deputized with sheriff's offices in New Mexico, Texas and . Louisiana, where a film crew followed the actor on ride-alongs with . Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputies for the reality TV show 'Steven . Seagal: Lawman.'

'It's a process you have to go through but when you tell the public that, they just think you're nuts,' she said. 'He is not a racist,' she added of her client. 'I'm . going to make that real clear because that's what people are suggesting. 'There's background information people don't know about, and in time it will come out.' 'I'm sorry the family is upset,' the attorney added. 'I can understand why they would be.' Mother Jessica Bennett, 33, said she . was scared to death as a ‘drunk’ fellow passenger slapped her son after . spouting off a racial slur. Shocked: Bennett said she was terrified as Hundley allegedly slapped her son causing bleeding and swelling . Suspicious: Bennett said Jonah no longer trusts strangers after being struck . Bennett was aboard the Delta flight . from Minnesota to Atlanta with her adopted son Jonah on February 8 when . the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears.' She said she was shocked to hear the man seated next to her, Hundley, demand that she 'shut that n****r baby up.' She told ABC News: 'I said, ""What did you just say?"" And he was so drunk that he fell onto my face and his mouth moved over to my ear and he said it directly into my ear.' But she couldn't have imagined what happened next, as Hundley allegedly slapped Jonah. When I looked at Jonah’s face, his eye was swollen... and it was bleeding. I was just scared to death.' Bennett, of Minneapolis, Minnesota, says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has become 'apprehensive to strangers' since. Shein, told ABC News that no one should rush to judgment in her client's case, and he will be pleading not guilty. Trauma: Mrs Bennett says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has since become 'apprehensive to strangers' Outrage: Mrs Bennett, pictured with Jonah, said that Hundley also informed her that her child was too big to be a 'lap baby' But the task of proving his innocence may be difficult as Bennett family attorney John Thompson told the network that there were numerous witnesses who saw Hundley strike Jonah - including a federal air marshal. According to The Smoking Gun, Hundley has been charged with simple assault after the incident. Hundley was charged with simple . assault in federal court in Atlanta last week. If convicted, he faces a maximum of one year in prison. The 60-year-old, who is the president of an aircraft parts manufacturer based in . Idaho, denied slapping the child or using racial language. He claims . that he did 'ask the mother to quiet the child.' Hundley was fired from his job as president of Unitech Composites and Structures, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Joe Rickey Hundley faces up to a year in prison if found guilty of simple assault . Al Haase, president and chief . executive of AGC Aerospace and Defense, Composites Group - Unitech's . parent company - said the firm was taking the matter seriously. 'In accordance with our company's . personal conduct policy, we have suspended the employee pending . investigation,' Al Haase, president and CEO of AGC, said in a statement. 'We wish to emphasize that the behavior that . has been described is contradictory to our values, embarrassing and . does not in any way reflect the patriotic character of the men and women . of diverse backgrounds who work tirelessly in our business,' Haase added. Shein believed it was unlikely Hundley would be able to successfully fight for his job back. Hundley said he was traveling to Atlanta to visit a . hospitalized relative, described his emotional state as 'distraught' and that he had one alcoholic drink on the aircraft. However, . Bennett told The Smoking Gun that she believed Hundley was intoxicated. The mother said that he 'reeked of alcohol', was 'stumbling around . wasted' and he consumed several double vodkas during the flight. Bennett says Hundley told her that Jonah was too big to be a 'lap baby.' Agent Cheney added that Bennett . received help from other passengers on the Delta flight. Todd Wooten, . who was seated 12 rows ahead, told authorities that he 'heard derogatory . language coming from the rear of the aircraft' and went to see what was . going on. 'According to Mr. Wooten,' Cheney wrote, 'he saw Joe Rickey Hundley strike' the child. Hundley pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault in a Virginia court in . 2007 after he was arrested following a quarrel with his girlfriend. He was first charged with simple assault, carrying a concealed weapon, and public intoxication. Hundley told The Smoking Gun that the weapon he was allegedly carrying was a corkscrew.

Rev Rob Morris gave his 'unreserved apology' for appearing to participate in joint worship . A Connecticut Lutheran pastor has . apologised for participating in an interfaith prayer vigil for Sandy Hook victims . because his church prohibits its clergy from worshipping with other faiths. Rev Rob Morris of Christ the King Lutheran Church  gave the benediction at a prayer vigil attended by leaders from Christian, Muslim and Jewish . faiths, as well as by . President Barack Obama and relatives of the 20 first graders who were killed. Morris requested an announcement before . the event explaining that participating clergy were not endorsing each other's . views. But in a statement posted February 1, the Missouri Synod president, the Rev Matthew . Harrison, said Morris's 'specific and commendable' steps to avoid . violating the church's constitution remained insufficient. He . said the event constituted joint worship since other clergy wore their . vestments and the vigil included prayers and religious readings. Rev Harrison wrote: 'There is sometimes a . real tension between wanting to bear witness to Christ and at the same . time avoiding situations which may give the impression that our . differences with respect to who God is, who Jesus is, how he deals with . us and how we get to heaven, really don't matter in the end. Morris does not believe he engaged in joint worship, but has apologised. In his own statement, Morris underscored the steps he took to avoid any appearance he was supporting other doctrines. US President Barack Obama spoke before Rev Rob Morris at the memorial service for the victims and relatives of the Sandy Hook shooting . 'To those who believe that I have . endorsed false teaching, I assure you that was not my intent, and I give . you my unreserved apologies,' he wrote. 'I did not believe my participation . to be an act of joint worship, but one of mercy and care to a community . shocked and grieving an unspeakably horrific event. However, I recognize . others in our church consider it to constitute joint worship and I . understand why.' 'I accept his apology,' Harrison wrote, and made what he called an earnest request that no one file a complaint against Morris under the denomination's disciplinary system. Harrison declined to comment further, but Vicki Biggs, a spokeswoman for the denomination, told Associated Press: 'We are proud of the work Pastor Morris has done in Newtown and how he has served the community in so many ways.' The denomination has been struggling for . years with this rule, which is currently under a broad review. The . church constitution requires congregants to renounce 'unionism and . syncretism of every description.' A Missouri Synod pastor, the Rev David Benke, was suspended for a time after participating in a Yankee Stadium interfaith service soon after the September 11 attacks that was held in Yankee Stadium. About two dozen pastors and a few congregations had complained about Benke's involvement.

"By . Beth Stebner and Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:17 EST, 11 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:18 EST, 12 February 2013 . The birth rate in the U.S. has reached record lows in 2011, new data shows. Information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that only 13 women per 1,000 gave birth between 2010 and 2011, the lowest its been since a peak in 1991. Teen births are also down, with only three percent of teenagers aged 15-19 giving birth between that time, or to approximately 31.3 births per 1,000 women. Falling: Teen birth rates have gone down along with the overall U.S. birth rate in part because of better sexual education and because of the sour economy . On the other end of the spectrum, the birth rate increased for women in their 30s and 40s increased by three percent in that time. The CDC’s data was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, and shows that birth rates among young women in their 20s also fell from 90 births per 1,000 women in 2010 to 85.3 births in 2011. CDC statistician Brady Hamilton, the lead author of the new report, said that the economy could be one factor for delaying having children. 'The economy has declined, and that certainly is a factor that goes into people's decisions about having a child,' he said. 'Women may say to themselves, ‘It's not a particularly good time right now… let's wait a little bit,'' he told Reuters Health. Data shows that birth rates declined drastically during the Great Depression, with women having on average one less child each in the decade that followed. And while the birth rate again climbed in the 1950s and 60s, the 1970s Energy Crisis leveled out birth rates to approximately two children per woman. The Great Recession has led to stunted career growth, financial uncertainty . Older women, however, are typically more secure in their employment, he said - and understand that they don't have as long to wait if they want to get pregnant. Hamilton and his colleagues calculated that 3.6 million more babies would have been born to women in that age group over the last two decades had the teen birth rate not been falling since a peak in 1991. Downturn: Birth rates routinely fall during periods of economic downturn, as evidenced after the Great Depression, the Energy Crisis, and now on the heels of the Great Recession . Decline: Data also shows that the number of children women are having is going down for Latina and Black women . On the other end of the spectrum, the birth rate among 35- to 39-year-olds increased by three percent over 2010 figures. In 2011, 4.7 percent of women in their late 30s and just over one percent in their early 40s had a baby, the CDC team found. Another reason for the lower birth rates could be due to better sex education for young people. 'The economy has declined, and that certainly is a factor that goes into people's decisions about having a child.' The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in their updated guide for teens that IUDs and hormonal implants should be the first line of defence over more traditional methods like condoms and birth control pills. The IUD and implants both require a visit to the doctor’s office and are much more costly than other methods. However, they are also the most effective forms of birth control available, save for abstinence. Other results from the vital statistics report showed a continued decline in babies born prematurely or small, and an unchanged rate of infant deaths. Black and Hispanic mothers continued to be more likely to have a premature baby than white women, but rates declined among all races. Infant mortality was more than twice as high among babies born to black mothers as in babies of white moms, death records showed. Hamilton said the decline in teen births, in particular, is especially 'welcome news' and reflects the efforts of programs and policies targeting that age group. 'It's definitely consistent with the trends that we've seen, and it's obviously good news overall,' said Dr Krishna Upadhya, who studies teen pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. 'I think the main thing behind this is increased contraceptive use, and better contraceptive use,' Dr Upadhya, who wasn't involved in the new research, told Reuters Health.","U.S. birth rate is lowest it's been since peak in 1991 .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:18 EST, 8 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:29 EST, 8 February 2013 . The ringleader in hair- and beard-cutting attacks on fellow Amish in Ohio has been sentenced to 15 years in prison, with 15 other family members receiving sentences of one year to seven years. ‘The victims were terrorized and traumatized,’ said U.S. District Court Judge Dan Aaron Polster in sentencing leader Sam Mullet Sr., 67, who sat without emotion during the sentencing. The judge said the defendants had violated the constitutional rights protecting religious practice that had benefited them as Amish - such as an exemption from jury service and allowing Amish children to leave school at age 14. Sam Mullet Sr has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for being the ringleader of an Amish cult which carried out hair- and beard-cutting punishments . Amish leaving court after the 16 defendants in the case were charged with a hate crime because prosecutors believe religious differences brought about the attacks . ‘Each of you has received the benefits of that First Amendment,’ Polster said. The judge said the defendants have two weeks to file an appeal of their sentence or conviction. Defense attorneys have indicated such appeals are likely. Before his sentencing, Mullet told the judge that he had been blamed for running a cult and was ready to take the punishment. Mullet, his ankles in chains and a white beard down to mid-chest, said if his community is seen as a cult, ‘Then I'm going to take the punishment for everybody.’ With relatives of victims and his family sitting on opposite sides of the public gallery, Mullet said he has lived his life trying to help others. ‘That's been my goal all my life,’ Mullet said to a hushed courtroom, with his fellow defendants and their attorneys sitting at four defense tables and filling the jury box. ‘I'm not going to be here much longer,’ said Mullet, who didn't elaborate on any health issues. Both relatives of victims and Mullet's family attended the sentencing in a Cleveland courthouse . An Amish man pretends to take a photo of the media as he leaves the U.S. Federal courthouse . Mullet and his family deny his community is a cult. The government asked for a life sentence for Mullet. The defense asked for two years or less. The 10 men and six women were convicted last year in five attacks in Amish communities in 2011. The government said the attacks were retaliation against Amish who had defied or denounced Mullet's authoritarian style. Amish believe the Bible instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards once they marry. Cutting it would be offensive to Amish. Other defendants, some in tears, also offered to take the brunt of the blame and punishment on behalf of Mullet or spouses. Addressing the judge one-by-one, the defendants said there would be no more beard-cutting attacks. Freeman Burkholder, 32, husband of a Mullet niece and father of eight children, apologized to the judge. ‘I won't do it again,’ he said. Ten men have been sentenced to between one and seven years in prison for their part in the hate crime . Wide-spread: Six women were among those convicted of hate crimes after the 2011 attacks, most face at least a year in prison . Anna Miller, 33, married to a Mullet nephew and mother of six, also apologized, turning to relatives of victims as she said, ‘I'm sorry, it won't happen again.’ Like most of the women, she was sentenced to one year. A federal prosecutor, Bridget Brennan, urged the judge to punish Mullet adequately. ‘He is a danger to this community,’ she said. ‘He is capable of controlling 15 defendants.’ Brennan repeated key testimony against Mullet and said he has remained the leader of his eastern Ohio community despite being locked up since his arrest in late 2011. The defendants were charged with a hate crime because prosecutors believe religious differences brought about the attacks. Nine of 10 men who were convicted have been locked up awaiting sentencing. The six women, who all have children, have been free on bond. Duties: Edward Mast says he will step in to raise children left without parents at the Amish community in Bergholz, Ohio . Isolation: The Amish community shuns the outside world and lives off the land in rural Ohio . In a rare interview last week in Bergholz at the sprawling Mullet farm amid rolling hills in eastern Ohio, Mullet's unmarried 19-year-old grandson, Edward Mast, discussed the family's attitude. He said they are steadfast in the belief that the attacks didn't rise to the level of a hate crime. ‘The beard, what it stands for me, what I know about it, once you're married, you just grow a beard. That's just the way the Amish is,’ Mast said. As for the victims, he added, ‘They got their beard back again, so what's the big deal about it?’ Arlene Miller, whose husband, an Amish bishop, was among the victims, thinks Mullet deserves a tough sentence and the others should get less time if they get cult deprogramming counseling. ‘It's a cult,’ said Miller, 48, of Carrollton. ‘Their minds were programmed in the wrong way by Sam Mullet, so we feel like these people are very deceived and they are actually victims of Sam Mullet.’ She said there were no winners in the ordeal. ‘There's no happy ending to this,’ she said.

Mullet's . community, like many Amish groups, grew through marriage and the . purchase of farmland to sustain extended families that work and pray . together, mostly shut off from outside influences like electricity, . autos and electronics. The five beard- and hair-cutting attacks followed years of animosity, traced in part to a nasty custody battle involving Mullet's daughter and his strict demands on religious observance. The custody dispute led to a contentious history with local law enforcement over the county's seizure of two Mullet granddaughters from their mother.

For the first time in decades, the United States is making steady gains in the number of high school students earning diplomas, putting it on pace to reach a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020, according to a new analysis released Monday. But the good news comes with a big asterisk: students with learning disabilities and limited fluency in English face long odds to finish high school, with graduation rates for those groups as low as 25 percent in some states, the analysis found. Minority students also continue to fall well behind their white peers, with about one-third of African-American students and 29 percent of Hispanic students dropping out before graduation. For the first time in decades, the United States is making steady gains in the number of high school students earning diplomas, putting it on pace to reach a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020 . The 'Building a Grad Nation' report - which was co-authored by Robert Balfanz, a leading scholar of dropout rates at Johns Hopkins University - found strong improvements in graduation rates in a diverse collection of states including Tennessee, Louisiana, Alaska, California, Texas and New York. The national graduation rate jumped from 71.7 percent in 2001 to 78.2 percent in 2010, with the pace of improvement accelerating in the past few years. 'For the first time in 40 years, we have seen significant, sustained improvement,' said John Bridgeland, a co-author of the study and the chief executive of Civic Enterprises, a public policy group in Washington, D.C. Iowa, Vermont and Wisconsin lead the nation with graduation rates close to 90 percent, according to the report, which used data from 2010 and 2011. At the bottom of the heap: Nevada and New Mexico, where barely six in 10 high school freshmen can expect to earn a diploma within four years. Idaho, Kentucky and Oklahoma didn't use the same formula for calculating rates as other states and thus were not included in the report. 'Increasing the graduation rate has to be a purposeful exercise, something you're driven to do every day,' said Terry Grier, superintendent of public schools in Houston, Texas, where the graduation rate has jumped from 64.3 percent to 78.5 percent since 2007. 'More and more, you're seeing people across the country get it.' Yet the report's authors warn that the momentum could still stall. Nearly . every state will soon be rolling out curricula tied to the Common Core . standards, which aim to bring more rigor to math and language arts . instruction. Many will require students to pass exams tied to those . higher standards to graduate, which could push lead to more failures and . higher drop-out rates, the report suggests. Minority students continue to fall well behind their white peers, with about one-third of African-American students and 29 percent of Hispanic students dropping out before graduation . The authors also warn that some states, such as Kentucky, New Mexico and Florida, plan to grade high schools in large measure by student test scores and participation in advanced courses, with the graduation rate accounting for less than 20 percent of the school's grade. That could give principals an incentive to push out failing students and focus on high-achievers, rather than helping the stragglers work toward their diplomas. Another concern: some states, such as Texas, do not count students as dropouts if they say they are leaving to be home-schooled or to transfer to a private school. The report notes that thousands of those students are significantly behind in credits and suggests that many may be dropping out without admitting it. Perhaps the biggest threat to momentum, however, is the lagging performance of disadvantaged students, the report's authors said. In Nevada, for instance, just 23 percent of students with disabilities, 29 percent of those with limited English skills and 43 percent of African-American students earned their diplomas in 2011. Even generally high-performing states such Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Connecticut have strikingly poor records with some minority students. Minnesota has the biggest gaps: The graduation rate for African-American and Hispanic students hovered around 50 percent in 2011, compared to 84 percent for white students. 'We need to look at these disparities head on,' said Brenda Cassellius, Minnesota's Education Commissioner. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, a Democrat, has proposed $640 million in new education funding, including an effort to better integrate schools in hopes of boosting performance for minority students, Cassellius said. Elsewhere, state officials plan to bring down the dropout rate by fundamentally rethinking the way school works. In Oregon, where the graduation rate was 68 percent in 2011, Chief Education Officer Rudy Crew aims to stop measuring student progress by credit hours and start focusing on how kids can demonstrate mastery of key concepts - whether or not they've sat through a full year of classes. The state's graduation rate - and the poor performance of minority students - 'is untenable, unsustainable, and frankly highly dangerous,' weakening the economy by leaving so many students unprepared for college or career, Crew said.","Study shows graduation rates are climbing for first time in decades .

"Marine General Joseph Dunford took . over Sunday as the new commander of all U.S. and . international forces in Afghanistan . By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:26 EST, 10 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:25 EST, 11 February 2013 . Marine General Joseph Dunford took over Sunday as the new and probably last commander of all U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan. The American-led NATO coalition is entering the final stretch of its participation in a war that will have lasted more than 13 years when most foreign combat troops pull out at the end of 2014. Dunford took over leadership of the International Security Assistance Force, and a smaller but separate detachment of American troops, from Marine General John Allen, who had led them for the past 19 months. New commander: Marine General Joseph Dunford took over Sunday as the new and probably last commander of all U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan . Transition of power: Dunford took over leadership of the International Security Assistance Force, and a smaller but separate detachment of American troops, from Marine General John Allen, who had led them for the past 19 months . ‘Today is not about change, it's about continuity,’ Dunford told a gathering of coalition military leaders and Afghan officials. ‘What's not changed is the growing capability of our Afghan partners, the Afghan national security forces. What's not changed is our commitment, more importantly, what's not changed is the inevitability of our success.’ He takes charge at a critical time for President Barack Obama and the military. NATO decided at its 2010 summit in Lisbon to withdraw major combat units, but to continue training and funding Afghan troops and leave a residual force to hunt down al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said ‘much work lies ahead’ for Dunford as he tries to meet those objectives while at the same time withdrawing about 100,000 foreign troops, including 66,000 from the United States. Dunford, from Boston, Massachusetts, will face serious challenges as he tries to accommodate an accelerated timetable for handing over the lead for security responsibility to Afghan forces this spring - instead of late summer as originally planned. No easy task: General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, pictured, said 'much work lies ahead' for Dunford . ‘I told him our victory here will never be marked by a parade or a point in time on a calendar when victory is declared. This insurgency will be defeated over time by the legitimate and well-trained Afghan forces that are emerging today and who are taking the field in full force this spring,’ Allen said. He added that success would be described as an ‘Afghan force defending Afghan people, and enabling an Afghan government to serve its citizens. This is victory; this is what winning looks like.’ Although the Afghan security forces are almost at their full strength of 352,000, it is unclear if they are yet ready to take on the fight by themselves. Before departing, Allen admitted that the Afghans still need much work to become an effective and self-sufficient fighting machine, but he said a vast improvement in their abilities was behind a decision to accelerate the timetable for putting them in the lead nationwide this spring when the traditional fighting season begins. Obama said last month that the Afghans would take over this spring instead of late summer - a decision that could allow the speedier withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. It is also unclear when the remaining 66,000 U.S. troops would return home, or how many American soldiers will remain after the end of 2014. Wrapping up: The American-led NATO coalition is entering the final stretch of its participation in a war that will have lasted more than 13 years when most foreign combat troops pull out at the end of 2014 . Obama may use his State of the Union address on Tuesday to announce the next steps for concluding the war and a timetable for withdrawal along with plans for a residual force post-2014. Much of that depends on the U.S. negotiating a bilateral security agreement with the government that includes the contentious issue of immunity from Afghan prosecution for any U.S. forces that would remain here after 2014. President Hamid Karzai has said he will put any such decision in the hands of a council of Afghan elders, known as a Loya Jirga. Although Dempsey said earlier in the week that the United States had plans to leave a residual force, a failure to strike a deal on immunity would torpedo any security agreement and lead to a complete pullout of U.S. forces after 2014 - as it did in post-war Iraq. It is widely believed that no NATO-member nation would allow its troops to remain after 2014 to train, or engage in counterterrorism activities, without a similar deal. The head of NATO joint command in Europe, German Gen. Hans-Lothar Domrose, said the alliance was already making plans for a post-2014 presence, plans he said that were ‘all well advanced.’ Allen, 59, of Warrenton, Virginia, was the longest serving ISAF commander so far. Nearly two dozen generals have commanded troops from the United States and ISAF since the American invasion in late 2001 - with six U.S. generals including Dunford running both commands in the past five years alone. Also attending the ceremony were U.S. Marine Corps General James N. Mattis, Commander, U.S. Central Command, and General James Amos, head of the Marine Corps. Karzai did not attend.

While he spoke, a 15-year-old boy used a chain saw to cut fence planks and a 12-year-old crisply drove nails into the planks as a 10-year-old held up the board. The youngest trudged in boots through ankle-deep mud and a creek surging with melting snow. Prison terms will make the whole operation harder to maintain, Mast said. Left behind: Amish girls look out the windows of the home of Sam Mullet Sr., in Bergholz, Ohio - he faces a life sentence for orchestrating beard-cutting attacks . Isolation: The Amish community shuns the outside world and lives off the land in rural Ohio . 'It will be a mess,' he added shaking his head under a wide-brim hat. The accused ringleader Sam Mullet broke away from the mainstream Amish in 1995, seeking stricter cultural rules and Scriptural interpretation than is the norm in the eastern Ohio community, authorities have said. He was the undisputed leader of his group, counseling relatives on religious matters, negotiating drilling rights on his land and denouncing Amish who questioned his authority. Mullet's community, like many Amish groups, grew through marriage and the purchase of farmland to sustain extended families that work and pray together, mostly shut off from outside influences like electricity, autos and electronics. Amish communities have a highly insular, modest lifestyle, are deeply religious and believe in following the Bible, which they believe instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards and stop shaving once they marry. Contact with the modern world is limited, and glimpses from the news media inside Amish communities even rarer. Fending for themselves: A pair of young Amish boys play in a sandbox in front of the home of Sam Mullet Sr. The community has been torn apart by the scandal and highly-publicized court case . Traditions: An Amish buggy is driven down the road between the farms in Bergholz where a tight-knit community live by strict religious rules . The five beard- and hair-cutting attacks followed years of animosity, traced in part to a nasty custody battle involving Mullet's daughter and his strict demands on religious observance. The custody dispute led to a contentious history with local law enforcement over the county's seizure of two Mullet granddaughters from their mother. One of Mullet's daughters-in-law and a former brother-in-law told investigators that he allowed others to beat members who disobeyed him, according to an affidavit. He punished some by making them sleep in a chicken coop for days and was sexually intimate with married women to 'cleanse them of the devil,'the two relatives said in the affidavit. Mullet's defense argued there was no proof of such sexual conduct. His community had contact with other Amish groups, often because of family ties throughout the region or when gathering at livestock auctions or to buy farming equipment. Some Amish spoke out against his authoritarian style, and the government said that led to the attacks as Mullet tried to discipline dissenters who left his community and Amish bishops who condemned him. Taking charge: Younger members of the Amish community are being forced to put children to work to keep up with the labor at farms since 16 adults have been put on trial . Marching on: The Amish community has fascinated the outside world with its shunning of electricity, cars, electronics and the media . Arlene Miller, 48, of Carrollton, whose husband, an Amish bishop, was among the victims, said she thinks Mullet deserves a tough sentence and the others should get less time if they get cult deprogramming counseling. 'It's a cult,' she said. 'Their minds were programmed in the wrong way by Sam Mullet, so we feel like these people are very deceived and they are actually victims of Sam Mullet.' She said there were no winners in the ordeal. 'There's no happy ending to this,' she said. Some Amish remain fearful of Mullet, whose family denies his community is a cult. 'I don't want Sam Mullet to be around my nieces and nephews for the threats he made and things he done. So please keep Sam in jail,' one person said in a letter to the court. The name and hometown were blocked in the court filing because of fear of retaliation. 'Please understand that we have many fears of him being released,' another writer said. Prosecutors submitted 14 letters, some warning that Mullet and his family would disturb the peace of the Amish community. One called Mullet an evil, dangerous person. On trial: Sam Mullet Senior is accused of allegedly terrorizing the Amish community which he leads including having reported sexual relations with married women to 'cleanse' them . The government asked for a life sentence for Mullet, saying he orchestrated the attacks and controlled members of his Amish settlement and frazzled nerves in quiet Amish communities in Ohio and neighboring states. His attorney asked for a sentence of 1½ to two years. The government said the cuttings were an attempt to shame members Mullet believed were straying from their beliefs. His followers were found guilty of carrying out the attacks. Mast said that women whose husbands are facing prison are anxious for them to return home, and that the children ask about their fathers. 'They're always talking about the day when Dad comes home again; what they are going to do and what they want to do,' Mast said. Scandal: A Cleveland court has heard that the breakaway religious group spent months planning hair-cutting attacks against followers of their Amish faith . Wide-spread: Six women were among those convicted of hate crimes after the 2011 attacks . Nine of ten men who were convicted have been locked up awaiting sentencing. The six women, who all have children, one with 11, have been free on bond. The defendants were charged with a hate crime because prosecutors believe religious differences brought about the attacks. Mast said the Mullet community has been steadfast in its belief that the beard- and hair-cutting attacks didn't rise to the level of a hate crime, but amounted to discipline amid a church feud that shouldn't involve civil authorities. 'The beard, what it stands for me, what I know about it, once you're married you just grow a beard, that's just the way the Amish is,' Mast said. As for the victims, he added: 'They got their beard back again, so what's the big deal about it?'","16 men and women from highly insular Amish community in Bergholz , Ohio face ten years in prison for hate crimes .

Colorado Rockies star Todd Helton has been arrested on a charge of driving under the influence as he went on a late-night run for lottery tickets, it has been reported. The first baseman was taken into custody by police at a Thornton, Colorado, gas station close to his home at about 2:30am on Wednesday. Cops had been called after another motorist spotted Helton, who was behind the wheel of his Ford F-150 that the caller claimed had struck a median before parking at the gas station. Busted: Todd Helton was arrested for DUI at a gas station close to his home on Wednesday, where he reportedly went to pick up some lottery tickets . In it to win it: Helton was reportedly clutching two lottery tickets when he was arrested for DUI early on Wednesday morning . There, police observed Helton as he staggered out of the gas station. He smelled of alcohol and was clutching the lottery tickets in his hand, according to a police report obtained by TMZ. Helton reportedly told the officers that he never hit the median, but 'made spontaneous statements about drinking two Igloo cups of red wine.' Helton's blood-alcohol content was over the legal limit but police have not released the number. He was charged with three counts of DUI, but police noted that he was 'respectful and professional throughout the entire process,' according to TMZ. In a statement released yesterday by the Rockies, Helton said: 'Last evening I exercised poor judgment and was charged with drinking and driving after driving to a gas station near my house. 'I am very sorry and embarrassed by my actions. I hold myself to a high standard and take my responsibility as a public figure very seriously. My entire career I have worked to set a positive example for my family and in our community and I fell far short of this standard.' Veteran: Helton, 39, missed most of the 2012 baseball season but is expected to return this year for his 17th Major League season . He added: 'I sincerely ask my family, the Colorado Rockies Organization, Major League Baseball and the community to accept my apology. I make no excuses and accept full responsibility for my actions. I humbly ask your forgiveness.' Nicknamed 'the Toddfather,' Helton is a career .320 hitter. The 39-year-old played only 69 games last year before undergoing hip surgery in August. He is expected to return this year for his 17th Major League season.

So when it comes to losing weight, Michael McIntyre has dispensed with the need to shop, measure and cook. Instead he has opted to have three meals delivered to his door instead at a cost of up to £60 a day. Mr McIntyre is understood to have enlisted the help of Pure Package, a bespoke diet service, to help him shift the pounds on and off for the last two years. Britain's richest comedian Michael McIntyre is understood to have enlisted the help of Pure Package, a bespoke diet service, to help him shift the pounds . It means he is estimated to have spent up to £45,000. The stand-up comedian, who has mocked himself for looking like ‘a fat Chinese man’, is placed on an average daily intake of 1,700 calories when he is on the diet – usually in the run up to gigs and other public or TV appearances. The NHS guidelines say a man’s average calorie count should be 2,500. When taking a break from his busy working schedule it is believed he allows himself to indulge which explains his famously yo-yoing weight and why he has used the service on and off. Mr McIntyre has struggled with his size over the years and tried various other ways of slimming down, including cutting out carbohydrates and laying off the booze. In 2010 he embarked upon a vigorous training regime that saw him lose two stone but he quickly put the weight back on and moaned that it ‘all goes to my face’. ‘I’m one of those people where it all goes to my face,’ he said. ‘I swallow the food and it goes down, then it comes straight back up to my cheeks. ‘I did this diet that I heard Patsy Kensit was doing. She seems to be in pretty good nick - but it didn’t work for me.’ Months later he voiced concerns about ‘looking enormous, not being able to do up my jacket’ ahead of joining the Britain’s Got Talent judging panel in 2011. He said he wanted ‘to look svelte’ for the show and it is since then that it is believed he has resorted to paying out hundreds of pounds each week to achieve his goals. Snacks on the diet include dips with crudités, American style muffins or a simple handful of pumpkin seeds . On a typical day Mr McIntyre could breakfast on pancakes with mixed fruit and vanilla yoghurt, followed by smoked venison and poached pear salad for lunch and a dinner of satay chicken with rice. Snacks include dips with crudités, American style muffins or a simple handful of pumpkin seeds. The menus change daily, which will come as a relief for some of the celebrity clients who have been signed up for as long as eight years. Others sign up for a short term plan, ahead of film premieres or awards ceremonies. Ruby Wax and Emma Forbes have used the service in the past. And London Fashion Week has brought a flurry of models and designers signing on short-term to prepare for runway shows, including Lily Cole and Erin O’Conner whose diets total around 1,200 calories per day. But owner of the Pure Package, Jennifer Irvine, insists that the aren’t ‘faddy’ diets, despite only covering a short time frame. She said: ‘It’s not a silly lemon juice plan or anything like that. A lot of the models we get coming to us are intelligent people who have long-term careers. ‘They are sensible intelligent women, like Lily Cole and Erin O’Conner so they know they need to do it properly and not go on some faddy diet. ‘It is important to make sure they don’t risk knocking their metabolism out of shape.’ Ms Irvine, who delivers meals to 7,000 well-heeled Londoners every day, has developed several plans to specialise in different areas, including detox and pregnancy. However 90 per cent of her clients are on the weight-loss programme. ‘Basically the idea of the packages is that clients don’t need to cook,’ she said. ‘They don’t need to go food shopping or to measure ingredients out. It is all done for them.’ Mr McIntyre has certainly had the last laugh at the expense of critics who labelled his giggly, bouncy persona ‘too middle class’ - by being named the most successful stand-up in the world. According to figures from ticket sales tracker Pollstar, the 36-year-old’s latest tour made him £21million. More than 600,000 fans flocked to venues around the UK and Ireland to see Showtime!, McIntyre’s 71-date 2012 tour, which included 10 gigs at the massive O2 Arena in London. His takings from live shows put him alongside the likes of the Rolling Stones, whose five-gig farewell tour netted £22million McIntyre is the only comedian in the top 50 of Pollstar’s top 100 Worldwide Tours of 2012 list, making him the global stand-up king.","McIntyre understood to have enlisted Pure Package, a bespoke diet service .

'In the book, I provide an in-depth look at our years . together during which we shared major multi-platinum success, as well as . a few creative differences.'

He also wrote about a meeting with Kelly in in which he told her that My December was 'a pop album that still needs pop hits'. But in a lengthy statement posted on Whosay, Kelly wrote: 'So I just heard Clive Davis is releasing a memoir and spreading false information about me and my music. 'First, . he says I burst into ""hysterical sobbing"" in his office when he . demanded Since You Been Gone be on my album. Not true at all. His . stories and songs are mixed up.' Overjoyed: Kelly picked up her third Grammy of her career at the music awards ceremony in LA on February 10 . Glittering: Kelly's career has gone from strength to strength since she won the first season of American Idol .

Kelly revealed that she was hurt by his accusations about her album My December and its lack of 'pop hits'- and the claims that it didn't chart to well because she co-wrote it. She also accused Davis, currently the Chief Creative Officer of Sony Music Entertainment, of actively trying to 'sabotage' the album. She said  'Well, first let me say, I've co-penned many of my ""pop hits."" Secondly, My December went platinum (It sold 20,000 less than All I Ever Wanted which followed My December.) Hardly a huge failure. 'Never Again, the ONLY single they released in the US from that record was a Top 10 hit. 'I am very proud of that and I have my fans to thank.

A teenager who was mowed down by a drink driver as a child died on the night of her 18th birthday party - after crashing her car while three times over the limit, an inquest heard. Kirsty Bowen, of Bath, Somerset, suffered a broken jaw and cheek aged nine after she was knocked down by a drunk motorist in 2004 – but she died last October behind the wheel of her Peugeot 205. During the early hours of the morning after her 18th birthday party at home, the student left her house with two friends in her car to go and see her boyfriend, but her vehicle clipped a kerb. The car was sent spinning into a parked vehicle before flipping over and landing on its roof. The two passengers were unhurt, but Kirsty suffered serious head injuries and died at the scene. A post-mortem found 235mg of alcohol per 100ml - three times the legal drink-drive limit, 80. Coroner Gail Elliman recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying: ‘Kirsty Bowen died when she lost control of her car. She was not wearing a seat belt and was significantly over the drink-driving limit.’ Kirsty, who had begun the second year of a health and social care course and wanted to be a midwife, spent the night celebrating her 18th two days after her birthday with a house party. PC Mark Steadman from Avon and Somerset Police's collision investigation team told the inquest at Flax Bourton that her driving ability would have been affected by the alcohol. Two of her friends suffered minor injuries in the 2am crash and were taken to hospital before being discharged.

Mariel Murphy, 38, was driving home after dropping her mother off at a train station when she went through a ford causing her engine to cut out. Seconds later her three-year-old VW Polo was hit by a powerful torrent of water smashing it into a bridge and trapping her and her three young children inside. Rescued: Mariel Murphy with her children Joseph, six, Gia, 18 months, and Hayden, three . The family's VW Polo trapped in water by the ford between Churchover and Harborough Magna, Warwickshire . The terrifying accident happened at 6pm on February 14 when Mrs Murphy, a photographer, was driving through the ford which crossed the River Swift near their home in Harborough Magna, Rugby, Warkwickshire. Mrs Murphy managed to dial 999 and the fire service rushed to rescue her but before they arrived the icy water filled up the car to their chins. At one terrifying moment, Mrs Murphy and her three children, Joseph, six, Hayden, three, and 18-month-old daughter Gia, could only breath by pushing themselves against the roof of the car. But the family were saved when two workmen who had got lost spotted them and managed to haul them out of hatchback's boot. Mrs Murphy said today: 'I started driving through the ford when the car cut out and then we got carried off to the right and into the bridge. 'It was a really strong current so I rang the fire brigade and thought I'd wait. But water was getting in and within minutes it had risen to my knees. The accident happened at 6pm on February 14 when Mrs Murphy was taking the family home . The family were rescued by a pair of passing workmen who waded into the freezing water and managed to open the boot before dragging the four of them out . Having only moved to Churchover with husband Kevin a week earlier, Mrs Murphy did not know the road well and struggled to see the extent of the flooding due to the pitch black . Mrs Murphy managed to dial 999 and the fire service rushed to rescue her but before they arrived the icy water filled up the car to their chins . The ford where it happened runs over the River Swift near the family's home in Harborough Magna, Rugby, Warkwickshire . In April last year a respected judge drowned in his car after a satnav directed his wife into a heavily flooded ford. Jonathan Gammon died alongside his pet dog Gabby after his Toyota Yaris was overcome by water and swept more than 100 metres downstream. His wife Priscilla Turner managed to escape and when she was helped out of the river she told her rescuer: ‘I’ve killed my husband’. An inquest heard she had been driving her husband to work when the satellite navigation system sent her into a swollen ford in Headley, Hampshire. In November, 91-year-old Margaret Hughes was found dead after flood water rushed into her home in St Asaph, North Wales. Neighbours said the grandmother remained in her home when the River Elwy burst its banks despite pleas for her to evacuate. Some 500 properties were flooded when the tiny city was left under 5ft of water. The same month another 91-year-old went missing from his home in the Woodley area of Reading. A body believed to be of Franciscus Van De Gender was later found further down the river at Wargrave, Berkshire. 'My three children were screaming in the back - the water was nearly up to their chins. I didn't panic at first and had just been trying to reassure my children, but at this point I really started to worry. 'I then looked across and saw two men in a van nearby, but the electrics had cut out and I couldn't open the windows so I started banging and waving to get their attention.' Workmen Neal Bliss and Stephen Andrews, both in their 40s, had got lost and broken down after their Sat Nav diverted them off the M1 after the motorway was closed following an accident. When they heard Mrs Murphy's desperate cries for help they waded through the rising flood water and managed to open the boot of the car which was poking out the water. Mrs Murphy added: 'They (the workmen) were just amazing, they were so brave and strong. The fire brigade said afterwards they shouldn't have done it, but I'm just glad they were there to help us. 'It's a miracle they were there and I'm hugely grateful to them. They saved myself and my three children.' The family were examined by paramedics but were given the all clear. Husband Kevin, 41, a managing director of a media planning agency, said: 'It doesn't bear thinking about what could have happened. 'If those two workmen hadn't broken down or been there Mariel and the children would have been completely submerged in the freezing water.' A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'Had the car not been a hatchback and had the two men not come to their aid so quickly, the outcome may have been very different. 'Our praise must go to the two men for acting so quickly.'","Mariel Murphy, 38, was driving home when she went through a ford .

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced a subsidy for homes and businesses which fit plug-in points for the cars. It will pay up to three-quarters of the installation costs, which range from £1,000 to £10,000.Hospitals, police and public bodies may have the full price paid. The government wants to encourage the ownership of electric cars, such as the Vauxhall Ampera (pictured) The news comes amid fears that battery-powered cars are losing their spark with drivers. Only 3,200 have sold in the last two . years – less than 1 per cent of the total market – despite green . discounts of £5,000 per car. In 2012 just 2,237 electric cars were sold and . registered for the ‘plug-in car grant’, though that is double the figure . of 1,052 in 2011 and a big increase on the 111 in 2010. Studies show the fear of losing power on the road is a top reason people do not use the vehicles. Mr McLoughlin announced the subsidy . on a visit to Sunderland, where Nissan produces its Leaf electric car. He said he wanted Britain to be a world leader in the electric car . industry. Patrick McLoughlin plans to give more incentive for installing an electric car charge point . But he rejected criticisms that . electric sales were poor because they were only of use in towns, and . insisted manufacturers would not be making them if there were not a . market for them: ‘They are fantastic cars.’ The new multi-million pound funding . package aims to kick-start home and on-street charging, as well as the . creation of new charge points for people parking plug-in vehicles at . railway stations, by offering subsidies covering up to 75 per cent of . the cost of installing the charging points. Hospitals, the police and other public bodies are set to have the full cost of the installation covered. The announcement was made at Gateshead . College’s Skills Academy for Sustainable Manufacturing and Innovation . next to Nissan’s site in Sunderland. The cash-boost follows a critical . report by MP watchdogs in September which said electric car sales are . stalling except as ‘subsidised second cars for the rich’ allowing the . affluent middle classes to run around town and appear . environmentally-friendly. The MP’s report said Government grants were . ‘subsidising second cars for affluent households’. It concluded that despite the £5,000 . per car ‘green’ subsidy, electric vehicles have lost their spark and . proved too expensive for most motorists. Past failure by ministers to . provide enough public plug-in power points also means electric car sales . had fallen flat threatening an end to the Government’s electric dreams, . said the report by the House of Commons transport Select Committee. The biggest barrier to owning an electric car is the worry that there aren't enough plug points to reach your destination . The Department for Transport said the . £37million funding for the package comes from the Government’s . £400million commitment to increase the uptake of ultra-low emission or . ‘green’ vehicles and is available until April 2015. Installing a charge-point in a home . costs about £1,000-£1,500, while rapid chargers can cost around £45,000. A charge-point capable of charging two vehicles at once in residential . streets or train stations costs around £10,000. The full package announced today . includes up to £13.5million for a 75per cent grant for homeowners who . want domestic charge-point installed at their. There is also an . £11million fund for councils in England to install on-street charging . for residents who have a plug in vehicle but do not have off-street . parking. Up to £9million is being made available to fund charge-points at railway stations. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin . said: ‘This investment underlines the Government’s commitment to making . sure that the UK is a world leader in the electric car industry. ‘Plug in vehicles can help the . consumer by offering a good driving experience and low running costs. They can help the environment by cutting pollution. And most importantly . of all, they can help the British economy by creating skilled . manufacturing jobs in a market that is bound to get bigger.’ Business Minister Michael Fallon said: . ‘Today’s announcement will make the consumer environment for plug-in . vehicles more attractive and, in turn, makes the UK a more compelling . place to invest.’ John Martin, Nissan’s senior vice . president for manufacturing, said: ‘We are delighted that the UK . Government is showing it shares our commitment to the transport of the . future.’ The Society of Motor Manufacturers and . traders welcomed the move which it said would ‘boost confidence’ in the . electric car market.","The Transport Secretary is to provide subsidies encouraging people to install an electric car charge point .

As a nanny lies in a medically-induced coma after allegedly stabbing two young children to death and slitting her own throat, questions remain over what pushed her to commit the horrendous crimes. Now friends and relatives have revealed that Yoselyn . Ortega, a beloved and religious nanny who adored the family for which . she worked, had recently appeared withdrawn, was struggling with money and may . have visited a psychologist. The speculation comes after Ortega allegedly stabbed six-year-old Lulu Krim and her two-year-old brother Leo to death in the bathtub at their parents' luxury Manhattan apartment. Mystery: Yoselyn Ortega, pictured with Lucia Krim, right, and her sister Nessie, left, had been looking older and nervous in recent weeks, neighbours said. Others suggested she had money worries . As their mother, Marina Krim, arrived home to look for the children and the nanny, who had failed to meet her and her other daughter at a dance studio, she walked into the bathroom and saw Ortega, 50, stabbing herself and bleeding from the wrists, police said. It is believed Ortega, herself a mother to a teenage son, had been working for Mrs Krim and her husband Kevin Krim, the vice president and general manager of CNBC Digital, for around a year. In that time, the children - Lulu, Leo and three-year-old Nessie - had grown fond of their nanny, who told friends she enjoyed good pay and travel perks with the family. But in her personal life, things were perhaps not so stable. Ortega had recently hinted at financial struggles to her friends and neighbours, the New York Times reported. Her friend Maria Lajara said Ortega . had asked her to . pray that a woman who 'owed her a lot of money' would pay her, after she . had given her makeup to sell, but had not returned with the cash. Neighbours added that the nanny herself would sell jewellery and makeup for . extra income. Killed: Lulu Krim, six, and her two-year-old brother Leo were found with multiple stab wounds . Loss: Lulu is pictured with her father Kevin and mother Marina - who discovered her children in the bathtub . And, in what came as a devastating blow to Ortega, she was forced out of a new apartment in the Bronx in recent weeks and moved backed into her sister's cramped home in Harlem. Ortega, whose name had never been on a lease for the apartment, was promptly kicked out when the original tenant returned, the Times reported. Others added she had not seemed herself recently, complaining that she was tired, while her niece, Katherine Garcia, . added that her aunt had been 'acting kind of nervous lately'. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, . neighbours said that Ortega would always say 'God Bless You' as she . passed - but her salutations had recently become less frequent. 'In the building, everyone was talking about how she didn’t look good,' neighbour Ruban Rivas said. Looking for answers: Reporters surround Ortega's apartment, where she lived with her sister . Home: She was living with her sister after she was forced from her own flat in the Bronx in recent weeks . Just half an hour before the murders, a . neighbour, Charlotte Steinberg, saw Ortega, Lulu and Leo in the elevator . and described the nanny as 'cold' with a 'poker face'. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly added that Ortega’s family told the police she may have visited a psychologist recently or . had been thinking about going. Despite these troubles, family and . friends are baffled as to what pushed the beloved nanny over the edge . and want to hurt the family who had so eagerly welcomed her. William Krim, the paternal grandfather of the children, told the New York Times: 'They were very good to her. We're just the most stunned people in the world - I mean, they treated this woman so well.' His wife, Karen Krim, added to the New York Daily News: 'They just bent over backwards being nice to this woman. They were always doing things that were just fabulous for her.' Ortega herself acknowledged this . amazing treatment, telling friends that she liked Mrs Krim so much she . was regularly happy to stay for extra hours to help her out. Suicide attempt: Ortega is in a coma after slicing her throat and wrists at the home on Thursday . Heartbroken: Mrs Krim, holding three-year-old Nessie, is accompanied to an ambulance after finding the bodies . 'She really loved them, the family,' her friend Maria . Lajara told the Times. 'She loved the kids, she would take them to the park, and . she said the mom was a really good person.' Lajara added that the Krims had been generous to their nanny; earlier this year Ortega gave Lajara a leather jacket that Mrs Krim had given her as a gift. And William Krim added that, when his son's family went away, they paid for Ortega's ticket to fly to the Dominican Republic to see her own family there. On one occasion, which is documented on Mrs Krim's blog, they travelled to the Dominican Republic with their nanny as she wanted them to meet her family. Saness: A woman looks at a memorial outside the apartment block where the youngsters were stabbed . Paying their respects: A woman and a child look at the messages outside the Upper West Side apartment . 'It was wonderful,' Mrs Krim wrote of the trip in February. 'And we met Josie's amazing famila! The Dominican Republic is a wonderful country!!' Yet now, just months on, the woman the Krims invited into their home and trusted with their children is lying in a hospital bed, with police officers ready to question her for murder. 'We're just having a really, really hard time here,' the children's grandmother Karen Krim added. 'It's the worst nightmare any parent could ever have.'","Yoselyn Ortega 'stabbed boy, 2, and girl, 6, before failed suicide attempt'

The only people who really knew of their existence were military experts who used them for secretive surveillance missions. But following a decade of conflict fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, drones have become an essential and controversial tool for the U.S. military. Operators - who you imagine are rather fond of computer games - sit in offices in New York and Nevada and direct the unmanned, missile-carrying planes to their next targets. Secretive: Military drones have massively increased in popularity over the past decade. But there are now very real fears that they could be used by government's domestically. This is a German Mikrokopter . Controversial: President Obama signed a new law last year which opens up the possibility of police forces in the U.S. using drones. This image shows just how small some of them could be . As well as being used for spying, they are increasingly used to kill. And with an alarming accuracy. But with their popularity booming under the liberal-leaning President Obama, there are now very real concerns about their use on a more domestic level. In February last year, Obama signed a law directing America's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to allow drones to fly in American airspace by September 2015. As reported by National Geographic, they could be used for patrolling borders for illegal immigrants, hunting for criminals and even maintaining crops. A number of police forces in the U.S. have already shown an interest in using drones, with some likely to carry face-recognition software. Lethal: Drones have been used heavily by President Obama in Afghanistan to spy on targets and kill enemy fighters. This is an MQ-9 Reaper, armed with laser guided missiles . Future: A whole new fleet of drones, such as this one pictured, are currently being designed by aviation companies as well as government and university researchers . This has already caused a storm of opposition from across the political spectrum over the effecton personal privacy. And if they become a regular fixture in the U.S, then it seems increasingly likely it is a matter of time before they are introduced into the skies of the UK. In the past decade drones have become a must-have weapon for the most advanced militaries in the world. Back in 2002, when America and the western world was looking down a barrel of conflict in some of the most dangerous and inhospitable locations on Earth, just 200 military drones were in use by the U.S. military. But, with the U.S. and UK fighting mobile enemies in a variety of locations, drones increased dramatically. The U.S. military has now deployed more than 11,000. And it is not just the U.S which is using them. More than 50 countries have drones, including China, Iran and Israel. Concerns: A number of police forces across the U.S. have already taken a keen interest in drones. This Seattle police officer shows off a drone recently, before the city's mayor banned their use by officers . Way forward: This Dragonflyer X6 helicopter was another drone owned by Seattle police before privacy concerns prevented them from being used . As well as saving money, they also save lives. Instead of sending pilots into war zones, military commanders can instead send an unmanned drone which is controlled thousands of miles away from danger. This has led some defence experts to suggest that within a generation they could replace most manned military aircraft. Talking point: Many of the images of drones used in this piece were first published in the March issue of National Geographic magazine, pictured . But it is now looking increasingly likely that drones will be deployed more domestically. A whole new fleet of drones are currently being designed by aviation companies as well as  government and university researchers. And, perhaps frighteningly, some are just the size of a hummingbird. Following the law signed by Obama, it emerged recently that American authorities are increasing the number of licenses for surveillance drones. The FAA announced earlier this month that it had issued 1,428 permits to domestic drone operators since 2007, which is far more than were previously known. The permits have been issued to police, universities, transport departments and at least seven federal agencies for devices from unarmed Predators drones to model airplanes. The FAA estimates that as many as 10,000 drones could take to the skies by 2020. But this has sparked opposition in the U.S from across the political spectrum with many concerned about the effects of drones on personal privacy and government intrusion. Lawmakers in 15 states are already looking at plans to restrict drone use in their airspace amid concerns over spying. Earlier this month the mayor of Seattle even ordered the city's police to abandon its plan to use drones after protests from residents and privacy campaigners.","Unmanned drones have become President Obama's weapon of choice in war .

Quitting smoking in middle age or beyond still has significant health benefits, new research suggests. Even lifelong smokers who gave up smoking later on in life still experienced a massive 40 per cent reduction in the risk of heart attack and stroke within just five years. The study followed nearly 9,000 German people aged between 50 and 74 years for ten years. Age is no barrier to the benefits of giving up smoking . The researchers found that even those who were well into old age were able to reverse some of the damage they had inflicted on their body. Professor Hermann Brenner and his . colleagues from the German Cancer Research Centre  were able to show that smokers were at double the risk of . developing heart disease compared to non-smokers, but that former . smokers were at almost the same low rate as people of the same . age who have never smoked. 'We also found that smokers are affected [by heart disease] at a significantly younger age than . individuals who have never smoked or have stopped smoking,' he added. The results suggest that smoking . cessation programs, which tend to concentrate on younger participants, should be expanded to help older people as well. The study has reinforced news that it is never too late to give up the habit and reap very real health benefits. A Canadian study published earlier this year demonstrated that people who give up smoking by the age of 44 can live almost as long as those who have never smoked. Stub it out: Giving up cigarettes can have almost immediate health benefits . 'Quitting smoking before age 40, and . preferably well before 40, gives back almost all of the decade of lost life from continued smoking,' study leader Professor Prabhat Jha. The researchers found that people who quit smoking between the ages of 35 and 44 gained about nine years and those who quit between ages 45-54 and 55-64 gained six and four years of life, respectively. And it isn't just poor health that can be reversed when you kick the habit - it is possible to reverse the toll smoking has had on your skin, too. 'To an extent it is possible to undo the damage smoking does to your skin,' says dermatologist Prof Nick Lowe. 'As soon as you stop smoking, your body is able to function more effectively. 'Within six weeks the skin will be visibly benefiting from increased oxygen and antioxidant levels, but you must adopt a strict skin-care regime.'","Even those who have smoked for majority of their life can significantly reduce risk of heart attack .

The most premature triplets to ever survive in the UK have defied the odds to celebrate their first birthday. Max, Lucas and Harvey Udell spent three months battling for their lives after they were born 15 weeks premature. The tiny brothers, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, weighed less than 2lb each when they arrived at 24 weeks and five days. Rachael and Ashley Udell with their three sons Max, Harvey and Lucas on their first birthday. They spent three months battling for their lives after they were born 15 weeks premature . Max (centre) is the smallest, Lucas (left) is Max's identical twin, while Harvey (right) is the biggest. They are pictured here at 11 weeks . Harvey, Lucas and Max each weighed under 2lbs - less than a bag of sugar - when they were born by emergency caesarean section . They were delivered by emergency caesarean section and whisked straight into intensive care, where they underwent 12 blood transfusions between them. But this week parents Rachael and Ashley Udell were able to celebrate the day they were scared their sons would never see - their first birthday. Little Max now weighs 12lb 13oz after being born at 1lb 4oz. His identical twin Lucas has grown from 1lb 6oz to 15lb 6oz and their brother Harvey weighs 16lb, after being born at 1lb6oz. Mrs Udell 32, said: 'I'm very proud of my little fighters. They went through so much after they were born.'I feel so lucky to have them all here. They're amazing boys. 'It was hilarious watching them fiddle with wrapping paper and scoff their cake. I was tearful a number of times. 'It's strange in a way because I felt so happy to be celebrating with them, but their birthday also brought back memories of how difficult and scary things were at first. Rachael, a former medical secretary, and gardener husband Ashley, 30, couldn't wait to have children - and started trying immediately after their wedding in May, 2010. Mrs Udell said: 'I have polycystic ovaries, so we were worried about my chances of conceiving. It took a year and a half for me to get pregnant. And we got more than we bargained for.' Little Harvey at just four days old. He now weighs 16lb, after being born at 1lb6oz . Max at four days old. He now weighs 12lb 13oz after being born at 1lb 4oz . Lucas, 21 days old. He has now grown from 1lb 6oz to 15lb 6oz . At 20 weeks, Rachael was signed off work due to pelvic pain. And less than five weeks later she was rushed to St Michael's Hospital in Bristol for an emergency C-section. She said: 'I was awake for everything. When the boys came out they looked so tiny, like little dolls.' The babies were taken immediately to be put in incubators. A number of health scares followed and all three of the boys were put on ventilators - with Max  the last to come off after two months. At one point, Max's stomach burst and he had to have an operation to repair it, while the parents waited anxiously to see if he would survive. Harvey then had septicaemia, a form of blood poisoning. Eventually, the little boys were transferred one by one to the Royal United Hospital in Bath, where they stayed until they were allowed home on February 18, still three weeks short of their March 6 due date. Rachael said: 'It was a very strange time for us. 'While the boys were in hospital, especially at first, it was almost like an out-of-body experience. We existed in our own bubble inside the hospitals. Every day it seemed there was a new emergency and we were constantly terrified and exhausted.' 'Last Christmas was the worst. Harvey and Lucas had been transferred to Bath, but Max was still in Bristol. We spent half a day with each, and wound up having pizza for dinner. We didn't buy the boys any presents - we didn't dare in case they didn't make it. 'This year will be completely different. We'll have presents and a big dinner at home before heading off to see family. It's amazing what a difference a year makes.' Before the triplets' arrival, Rachael and Ashley enjoyed nights out for dinner and seeing friends at the pub. (Left to right) Lucas, Harvey, Max at 7 months not quite filling out their England kits .

But now every day has a strict routine. Initially, Rachael was breastfeeding all three boys - for three hours at a time, with just a one hour break in between. Now, her day is a series of feeds, nappy changes, play time and chasing the boys around from 5.30am to 7pm, when she collapses on the couch with a glass of wine to watch Emmerdale. She said: 'My life completely changed with the boys. I have very little time to myself. In fact, we hardly leave the house because it's so difficult. I spend most of my time in old track suit bottoms and T-shirts with no make-up on. 'But I would never complain. I love my boys more than anything. 'I love watching them interact. Harvey, the biggest and last to be born, is the sensitive one. He looks completely different to the other two, who are identical twins. He has dark hair and brown eyes, while the other two have light hair and blue eyes. 'He's our gentle giant. The other two are more rough and tumble. Lucas is feisty and outgoing. He'll crawl over to strangers for a babble. Max is like a little dolly, bless him. 'They will kiss and cuddle each other - it's obvious they're friends.' The boys are now completely healthy, after a brief scare in April when Max had to return to hospital for five nights with a bad case of bronchiolitis. Rachael and Ashley Udelll say their boys are already the best of friends . Mrs Udell said: 'Ashley and I make it work because we're a team, but it has been tough on our relationship. 'My parents take the boys for one weekend each month, just so I have some time to sit and think. Sometimes we'll meet friends at a pub, but often we're too tired. Our marriage has had to go on the back burner to be honest. But we keep going because we know one day it will be back to normal, when the boys are older. 'Sometimes it's lonely being a mum of multiples - spending so much time at home. But I would never wish my boys away. 'They melt my heart and I'm so happy to be a mum of three.

A couple who were told four years ago there was no way they could have a child naturally have celebrated the birth of their 'miracle baby boy.' ME sufferer Helen Laurence was told that she and husband Andi would not be able to conceive because they were both beset with a range of fertility problems. But after years of trying, one round of unsuccessful IVF, and what they thought would be endless heartache, the couple from York, have welcomed 6lbs 15oz baby Murphy into their world after a surprise pregnancy. ME sufferer Helen Laurence was told that she and husband Andi would not be able to conceive because they both had fertility problems, But now they have welcomed little baby Murphy . After seven years of trying, one round of unsuccessful IVF, and years of heartbreak, the couple are delighted to have conceived naturally . About a year after they started trying for a child, Mrs Laurence, 32, developed pains in her stomach and a doctor diagnosed her with endometriosis. Endometriosis means that cells which normally line the womb are found elsewhere in the body, such as the outside of the fallopian tubes, the ovaries and the bladder, and it can cause infertility. She also suffers with ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, leaving her too tired to complete even simple tasks. After . this news, the couple were sent for fertility checks and devastatingly . found out that as well as Helen’s conditions of endometriosis and ME, Andi also had low sperm count with a low motility, or quality. Mrs Laurence, 32, said doctors had broken the devastating news to her and her husband 37,  that they were infertile on Valentine’s Day 2008. She said: 'It was an ironic day to find that out,' admitted Helen, 'and it felt like the worst day in the world.' After one unsuccessful cycle of IVF, paid for by the NHS in 2011, the couple said they finally accepted defeat, after being left with only the costly option of private treatment, which at around £4,500 they simply could not afford. Mrs Laurence said:  'Andi decided to concentrate on work so we could try and save for IVF and I bought a car I had always wanted - a Ford Puma. 'But . then I started getting symptoms. We’d had a lot of false alarms taking . pregnancy tests so when we’d been out to buy the pregnancy test I think . Andi was bracing himself for more disappointment. 'When I took the test, I just couldn’t believe it.' With Helen's conditions of endometriosis and ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, and Andi's low sperm count the couple were told their only option was IVF . The couple had given up hope of having a child after seven years of trying, when Mrs Laurence discovered she was pregnant with Murphy, now just three weeks old . Mr Laurence added: 'I was downstairs, ready with a box of tissues for tears. When . she told me the result was positive, I have never run up the stairs so . fast.' The proud parents have now welcomed 6lbs 15oz baby Murphy into their world . Mum Helen described how she realised how her dreams had come true when she arrived home with the new baby after a difficult 36 hour labour. She said: 'It hit me after we got home and he was asleep. 'I sat down on the edge of the bed and started crying, and said: ‘You’re so cute!’ 'I was crying but it was happy tears. I couldn’t believe that my body, which wouldn’t work for me, had created something so perfect.' Andi described how he too had had tears streaming down his face. 'I was chuffed to bits. We are still on cloud nine.' Helen, who was diagnosed with ME in 2007 but had suffered with the symptoms since she was a child, explained that her condition leaves her very tired and run down - which made it harder for her to conceive. 'I get very tired and ill often, so the symptoms put strain on your body so it won’t conceive.' In a strange turn of events, Helen added that when the doctor arrived to assist in the final stages of the delivery at York Hospital, she was staggered to recognise him from her time undergoing IVF treatment at Seacroft Hospital, Leeds, West Yorkshire. She revealed he was the medic who had been involved in harvesting her eggs, who it turned out had subsequently moved to York Hospital. 'He was quite taken aback,' she said. 'He had been there at the start of it all and he was there at the end.'","Despite being told in 2008 they would never have a child naturally, Helen and Andi Laurence have had a healthy baby boy .

However, if you have the advantage, they'll take cover more or try and sneak up behind you. Life-like: Characters will react realistically according to how you approach battles. Multiplayer, too, has been confirmed with Naughty Dog last year defending concerns that it would feel 'tacked on' to the single player . The enemy will also react if one of their friends is killed, showing fear and anger while warning other teammates of the situation. Ellie, too, will dynamically influence battles by throwing objects or causing distractions. It's set for release on May 7. WATCH THE LATEST GAMEPLAY VIDEO HERE: .

With stunning looks and an immersive story, it’s no surprise The Witcher games have sold millions. And thankfully The Witcher 3 is on the way, but it will be Geralt’s final outing. Wild Hunt will be powered by CD Projekt RED’s REDENGINE 3 and will be 30 times larger than the previous game, Assassins of Kings, with the promise of post launch expansion packs. One last hurrah: This will be Geralt's final outing . Unlike the last game, which was broken up . into acts, REDENGINE 3 allows the uninterrupted exploration of a vast . open world. There will also be dynamic weather systems and advanced . water physics. Fast travel will feature and main . character, Geralt, can also ride horses. Gameplay has been improved, too, . with reports that the clumsy Quick Time events that plagued its predecessor  have been dropped. Adam . Badowski, head of CD Projekt RED, said: ‘The captivating and non-linear . story of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt takes place in a rich, truly . open-world environment. 'A world which is thrilling to explore, full of . daring adventures, momentous quests, memorable characters, and unique . monsters. 'Imagine playing a dark fantasy game with . the same great non-linear story as in the previous Witcher titles, but . now told in a world you can explore freely with no artificial . boundaries.

A crippling condition means Lauren Harry dislocates her shoulders every time she sneezes.A cough, or the slightest jolt - even driving over a speed bump - can knock them out of their sockets. Lauren, 20, says her shoulders can dislocate ten times a day. She's been to A&E four times in the last week alone. Doctors believe she has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a genetic condition which means her collagen is too weak to hold her limbs in place. Lauren suffers with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a genetic condition which means her collagen is too weak to hold her limbs in place. She is pictured with an arm brace that helps protect her joints . Lauren, from Wrexham, north Wales, first experienced pains in her legs at the age of 11, but was told it was due to growing pains. But at the age of 15 she fell off her crutches while attending the Eisteddfod in Conwy, injuring her shoulder in the process. Since then her shoulders and other joints, including her knees and fingers, have regularly dislocated. Lauren, who moved to Brymbo from Connah's Quay last year, was unable to complete her AS levels because of her condition. She has been given stabilising surgery on her shoulders on five separate occasions at Wrightington Hospital, Lancashire, but the problems persist. The slightest jolt can knock Lauren's joints out of their sockets, as seen in this shoulder X-ray . Lauren, who works at a McDonald's drive thru in Chester, said: 'My shoulders dislocate around 10 times a day on each shoulder even if I cough, sneeze or go over a speed bump. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited disorders that affect the connective tissues. Most types of the genetic condition affect the production of collagen, which gives tissue strength and allows it to stretch. Collagen is found in tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, bone, blood vessels, the gut and the spine. It means joints are loose and unstable and prone to dislocating. Swelling, sprains and hyperextension are also common. Skin is soft and fragile and bruises easily. This leads to slow and poor wound healing. There is no known cure for EDS. Treatment may help to manage symptoms, such as surgery to repair muscle damage and medication for pain. Sufferers can wear joint braces, do physical therapy to strengthen joints, avoid very physical activities and wear sunscreen to reduce the risk of harm. 'The other day in work I opened the fire door and dislocated all of my fingers and I've dislocated them pushing myself up off the sofa before. 'I can't even play fight with my little sister without something dislocating. 'Because I work in Chester I'm back and to from A&E at Wrexham Maelor Hospital and the Countess of Chester all the time,' she said. 'I went into A&E last week and they relocated my shoulder but dislocated my elbow and that's never happened before. It's so easily done. 'I've had a few operations which have fixed it for a while, but not for longer than nine months with no dislocation.' Lauren has yet to be tested for . Ehlers-Danlos, but is currently seeking funding for specialist treatment . at The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore. She said: 'The more times I go to the doctors they all say it sounds like Ehlers-Danlos. 'Usually you have to stay on a waiting list for a year for blood tests, but if I go to Stanmore I can get tested straight away. 'I know they teach you coping . techniques to relocate your joints more effectively and also try and . help with the psychological side.' Despite her condition Lauren says she tries to make sure it doesn't prevent her from leading a normal life. Lauren once dislocated her fingers getting up from a sofa. Pictured right is an x-ray after one of the many times her arm bone popped out of her shoulder socket . She said: 'In work I always go in regardless of how much pain I'm in. 'People can't get a day off work because of me. They just say 'well look what Lauren has to go through'. 'They're really good with me in McDonald's, they'll get me a chair if I need to sit down. 'I can only really work on the 'drive thru' taking orders and payments because I'm anaphylactic and allergic to nuts and sesame seeds.' Lauren is supported by her mum Kath Sneade, 41, who she lives with along with her step-dad, Colin, 56, two younger sisters Jessica, 18 and Rhiannon, nine, and brother Joshua, eight. Mrs Sneade said: 'Lauren tries to live as independently as she can, but she does get really down sometimes. 'She can't go anywhere or do anything unless someone goes with her.'","Genetic condition means Lauren's collagen is too weak to support her joints .

Moneymaking potential: Twitter's new Ads API will give advertisers new tools to personalise their campaigns to its 200million active users . Twitter has launched a new automated advertising feature in a bid to help ensure paid-for promotional tweets are seen by the right users as it seeks to replicate Facebook's money-making success. In an announcement on product manager April Underwood's blog, she revealed the new system for advertisers - but stopped short of saying there would be no increase in the number of adverts. The microblogging site's new Ads API (application programming interface) will let advertisers tailor their campaigns to relevant members of Twitter's 200million active users. Facebook launched similar technology in 2010, helping the social network to boost its revenues to more than $3billion the following year. As speculation grows that Twitter will follow Facebook with a stock market float, it seems the company's executives likewise hope to unlock their sites moneymaking potential. Twitter users already sometimes see paid-for tweets among the posts from people, organisations and companies they have chosen to follow. The company said the new system will not lead to more ads appearing in users news-feeds. 'As interest in Twitter has grown, our focus has been on delivering better ads for users, not more ads,' said April Underwood. 'We believe our system is working well because users like the ads experience on Twitter. Our system rewards marketers for being good, not for being loud. 'And this approach encourages ads that are engaging, relevant and useful.' The new system has been undergoing tests since January with a set of five initial partners who have built advertising products that sync with Twitter's new API. Until now, companies have to manually manage their advertising campaigns on Twitter. The new Ads API automates that process by giving them tools to 'deliver the right message, to the right audience'. It also allows advertisers to integrate their Twitter campaigns with promotional strategies elsewhere, including on Google, Facebook and LinkedIn. Find out what's happening with people you care about ... and ones that pay: The company said the new system will not lead to more ads appearing in users news-feeds. Ms Underwood told the Financial Times there would be 'no direct impact on the user experience', merely that the service's users should see 'more relevant and better ads'. She did not rule out an increase in the number of ads shown, but insisted the company took users' experience 'really seriously'. The new system will almost certainly increase Twitter's advertising revenue, which could help increase the company's value ahead of a rumoured initial public offering planned for next year. Analysts say Facebook's equivalent system now generates roughly 60 per cent of the company's revenues.","Twitter's new Ads API will give advertisers new tools to ensure they target relevant 'tweeters' among the site's 200million users .

Tribute: 23-year-old Kingsman David Shaw was shot dead in Afghanistan and his father has backed a campaign to name streets after those killed in action . Streets across Britain should be named after fallen heroes killed in warzones across the world, campaigners have said today. MPs and families who have lost loved-ones in action say the honour would be a fitting tribute to men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice. The bereft father of a soldier killed serving in Afghanistan has also backed plans to name streets after fallen troops, and wants his son to be remembered permanently in his home town. David Shaw's son, also named David, was shot dead by insurgents on January 16 and crowds lined the streets of Barrow, Cumbria for his funeral in early February. 23-year-old Kingsman Shaw, of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's . Regiment, became the 440th British soldier to die in Afghanistan since . 2001. His father, 49, said: 'There's always that danger when you have got . somebody like David, who is known at the time, that their name could be . forgotten by future generations. 'It's a strange thing to think about having a street named after our son. 'It's not for us to decide, it's for the local council and local people, . but we would be very proud to have a street named after David. It would . be the same for anybody in the same position.' Dagenham and Barking has already implemented the idea, creating Tony . Rawson Way and Martin Kinggett Gardens in tribute to soldiers who died . in Afghanistan. Precedent: Tony Rawson was 27 when he was killed in Helmand province in August 2007 and this street in Dagenham was named after him after a campaign by his mother Ann Williams (pictured with his former colleagues) Campaign: The case of Private Tony Rawson (left) is an example of what Labour's Jim Murphy (right) would like to see happen to street names across the UK . Barrow and Furness MP John Woodcock said naming a street after Kingsman Shaw would be a fitting tribute. He said: 'Most of us would rather live in a world where our service personnel were occupied in carrying out peace-time duties. 'But as long as events dictate that our men and women will be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice, it is entirely proper for communities to pay tribute in this way. 'No one who recently attended the Barrow funeral of Kgn Dave Shaw would have any doubts about the willingness of Barrovians to name a street after this brave soldier whose life, full of promise, was cut short by a bullet in Afghanistan.' Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy has called for councils to embrace naming streets after war heroes, saying they could provide a 'lasting personal memorial' to those who give their lives for Britain. He said: 'This is a way for local people to show their solidarity and . sympathy. A lasting personal memorial would demonstrate the value we . place on individuals who have served but been lost in the defence of our . country.' The local Government Association said councils have the powers to adopt the policy. Chairman Sir Merrick Cockell said: 'Local councils have a long and lasting relationship with our Armed Forces and their families with many already signed up to the Government’s community covenant and offering them support in housing, training and education. 'Re-naming streets is just one of the many ways that councils can choose to honour the brave servicemen and women who have given their lives serving our country.'","David Shaw died in Afghanistan last month and his father has backed idea .

She accompanied the photo with the caption: ‘One month old - Macallister and me heading to YaBoo, the children's Halloween party at @Yahoo.’ Ms Mayer gave birth to a son on September 30, just over a week before her due date. In an appropriate move for a woman who has made her name in technology, Mayer's husband Zachary Bogue announced the birth via Twitter the following day, writing: 'Baby boy Bogue born last night. Mom (@marissamayer) and baby are doing great- we couldn't be more excited!' Yahoo! released a statement hours later saying that Mayer is working from home this week but she may reappear in the office in person after only a week of maternity leave. 'She will be working remotely and is planning to return to the office as soon as possible (likely in 1-2 weeks),' a Yahoo spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement. The self-described geek prompted much debate about how pregnancies affect women in the workplace as she was hired to lead the struggling tech firm in July when she was seven-months pregnant. 'My maternity leave will be a few weeks long and I'll work throughout it,' the expectant mom told Fortune at the time. The self-described geek, right, prompted much debate about how pregnancies affect women in the workplace as she was hired to lead the struggling tech firm in July when she was seven-months pregnant . Yahoo executives were aware that she was with child when they interviewed her, and she said that their decision to go ahead with her hiring 'showed their evolved thinking'. Just days after her hiring, Mayer tweeted a picture of a layette set filled with Yahoo! themed baby gear that the company's communications team sent her. Whether or not she will choose to dress her little boy in the yellow-and-purple outfits that are clear ads for the company is another guess entirely. As she proclaimed that her newborn would not slow her down, her pregnancy didn't either and she attended the San Francisco Symphony Opening Gala several weeks ago. She posted a photo of herself in black-tie gown on her Twitter, thanking the designer who tailored the runway look to her ever-growing  baby bump. 'My friend and brilliant designer Erdem made me a maternity gown for the opening of the SF Symphony tonight,' she tweeted before the gala. SEC filings show that the new mother is only be granted 20 days of vacation each year, but that does not include her maternity leave which started today. Mayer, who made her name as the 20th employee at Google, is already worth a rumored $300million. Her new salary at Yahoo! is said to be $1million a year and is expected to make more than $71million over the next five years due to stock options and bonuses.","Yahoo!

A heavily pregnant woman was captured on CCTV moments before she was brutally kicked to death in the street. Eystna Blunnie is pictured walking in Harlow, Essex, in the early hours of June 27 last year just minutes before she suffered horrific head and facial injuries. It is alleged that she was lured to her death by ex-fiance Tony McLernon who said 'I've got a surprise for you' before savagely killing her and her unborn baby. Tragic: CCTV footage shows heavily pregnant Eystna Blunnie moments before her death in June last year. Tony McLernon, her ex boyfriend, is on trial for her murder . Brutal: The body of pregnant Eystna Blunnie, pictured, was found dying on the side of a road in Harlow . On trial: Tony McLernon is accused of killing Eystna Blunnie and her unborn child in Harlow last year . Mr McLernon convinced Miss Blunnie to . meet him in a street in Harlow, Essex, two days before she was due to . give birth by telling her in a text message 'Got a surprise for you, . hope you like it', Chelmsford Crown Court heard. But . when the heavily pregnant 20-year-old met him in the early hours of . June 27 last year, unemployed McLernon, fuelled by alcohol and cannabis, . forced her to the ground where he repeatedly kicked and stamped on her, . prosecutor Andrew Jackson said. McLernon was also shown in CCTV footage heading from the opposite direction with his dog. 'It was an act of brutal, sustained and wholly unprovoked violence,' Mr Jackson added. 'He knew he was not only killing her but their unborn child as well.' Residents living near the scene of the . alleged attack in the town's Howard Way, minutes from Ms Blunnie's . home, heard her 'horrific' screams and the impact of the blows. Ms Blunnie, who was due to give birth within days, was later found with severe head and facial injuries and died in hospital. After the alleged killings, McLernon hid in nearby woodlands and sent a text message to his father saying 'I'm scared'. He later spoke to his father on the phone and told him 'I think I've killed Eystna', the court heard. Investigation: Police outside the home of Tony McLernon last year . Distraught: People lay flowers on the side of a main road in Harlow near to where Eystna Blunnie and her unborn baby were brutally beaten to death . Grief: Two friends console each other beside tributes to the college student who was due to give birth . McLernon, 24, from North Grove, . Harlow, denies murdering Ms Blunnie and a charge of child destruction by . wilfully causing the death of an unborn child. A series of text messages, sent by McLernon to friends and family, were read to the court. In one, sent on June 23, he wrote: 'I f****** swear bro, I'm going to knife Eystna soon, she's proper ruining my relationship.' Tragic: More friends of Eystna Blunnie, lay floral tributes at the scene. They have also written messages of condolence on Facebook . In other messages sent to his cousin, he claimed that Ms Blunnie had been contacting his new partner. 'I'm sure I'm going prison Monday, my ex is proper trying to ruin my relationship with my new girl,' he added. Earlier he had sent a message to Ms Blunnie telling her she 'would not last or make it through her pregnancy'. The couple had been together since April 2011 and got engaged three months later. In October, Ms Blunnie told McLernon . she was pregnant with his child but they broke up the following year . after Ms Blunnie, a catering student and barmaid, made complaints to . police that he had been abusing her. Mr Jackson told jurors: 'It was a . relationship marked by controlling, bullying and violent behaviour on . the part of this defendant towards Eystna. Shocking: A mourner reads some of the touching messages left at the spot where Miss Blunnie was found . 'Within a month of the relationship . beginning, family members saw Eystna with bruising to her arm and within . that bruising they saw the outline of knuckles.' On one occasion, police were called to find Ms Blunnie with visible bruising. She told officers the couple had argued all night with McLernon saying: 'The child is not mine. I could do better than you.' Late on the night of June 26, McLernon and Ms Blunnie had exchanged text messages. She had initially been reluctant to . meet him but he convinced her with 'self-pitying messages designed to . gain sympathy from Eystna a make her go to him', Mr Jackson said. McLernon had a history of abusive relationships, the court heard. One woman reported him grabbing her by the throat in bed and attacking her in front of passers-by in a park. Another called police after he painted the words 'whore and bitch' on walls near her home then threatened her on her doorstep. Pathologist Nat Cary found the child had been a healthy girl who would otherwise have been born 'quite normally'. A post-mortem examination showed Ms Blunnie, who was found in a pool of blood, suffered a severe brain injury as the result of repeated blows. She suffered more than 50 separate injuries, with the heaviest bruising found on her face.Bits of her hair, matted with blood, were found around her body. The baby died from 'starvation of vital oxygen' as a result of the attack. McLernon, wearing a dark suit and tie, appeared to hang his head as Ms Blunnie's father Kevin gave evidence. Describing her, Mr Blunnie said: 'She was happy. She was looking forward to having her first child. 'She was a family girl and she tried her best at everything she did.' He said he had initially been disappointed when he learnt his daughter was pregnant. But as she 'got her life back together', the family looked forward to Ms Blunnie's June 29 due date and she seemed happy. The case continues.

Tarantula kebabs, fried crickets and mealworm burgers... it sounds like a stomach-churning I’m A Celebrity bushtucker trial, or perhaps one of celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal’s more outlandish recipes. In fact, bugs and grubs could become a staple of our daily diet in the not-too-distant future, according to nutrition experts. Food writer Stefan Gates has spent the past few  months in far-flung destinations where insects are eaten every day and as delicacies. His journey will feature in a BBC documentary, Can Eating Insects Save The World? – to be broadcast next month – and he says that such outlandish fare will become the norm in Britain before long. The Dutch – perhaps in response to a United Nations warning that meat will rocket in price due to booming populations – have already invested six-figure sums into researching ways of getting caterpillars and locusts into mainstream foods. Here are some reasons why, and how, it  could soon happen here... A HEALTHY OPTION . ‘The cost of beef and lamb is going up and up – finding enough land to farm animals and meet demand is getting more and more difficult,’ says Gates, 45, who is also a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. ‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals. ‘Added to this, insect-rearing requires less space and generates less pollution than livestock.’ Patrick Durst, senior forestry officer at the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, has been carrying out studies into the worldwide use of insects as a food source. He says: ‘Western society tends to think of insects as being dirty but the nutritional benefits are many – crickets are rich in iron, zinc and calcium, for instance. ‘In Asia, people go into supermarkets to buy packets of crickets, silk worms or water bugs from the freezer section. They are foods of choice. Even though many insects are fried and sold as snack food to drink with beer, they are much healthier than a packet of crisps.’ Healthy grub: Crickets are a great source of calcium - but it may take a while before they're available at McDonald's or Sainsbury's . JUST ADD SOY SAUCE . Durst admits that persuading Europe to . start eating bugs will be an uphill struggle, but says: . ‘Look at the . way sushi has been accepted on to menus and even as a takeaway snack. That would have been unheard of 20 years ago.’ Gates . agrees: ‘Humans have been eating insects for thousands of years. 'It’s . estimated that up to 2,000 species are available worldwide as a human . food source, from beetles and spiders to ants and crickets. 'In Thailand, . I visited a school where children ate fried crickets for lunch.’ Gates . went hunting red ants and, despite his initial revulsion, admits: ‘Add . some coriander, spring onion and soy sauce and the taste was incredible, . zesty and creamy and absolutely delicious.’ What impressed him most was . that bugs were responsible for sustaining communities. He discovered . this when he joined a group of  14-year-old boys in Cambodia to go . tarantula-hunting. ‘The spiders provide a vital source of protein and it . is part of the only main meal they will have all day,’ he says. TRY IT ON THE KIDS . After the tarantulas are dug out of their nests in the ground with wooden poles, the insects are then grilled for up to 30 minutes. ‘They tasted very like prawn or crab and were actually delicious,’ says Gates. ‘There aren’t enough tarantulas  to feed the world but the fact that they are so important to the diet of these boys highlights what an important food source insects can be.’ Despite this, it still seems rather a stretch to imagine we will soon be buying mealworm burgers from McDonald’s. The key, says Gates, is in the presentation. ‘As long as people are fully aware of what they’re buying, there is great potential in adding edible insects protein into supplements and processed foods. ‘I bought packets of mealworms online to cook for my children and we’ve even experimented with earthworms and wood lice. ‘Because they are young, they see trying them as an adventure. ‘It is only by encouraging youngsters to try them and prove that they actually taste good that we  are going to be able to encourage more widespread use of insects  in our diet.’ BEER AND CRICKETS . Gates adds: ‘When you think about it, we already eat some strange things – take cheese with mould, and lobsters – but we don’t find that odd. ‘Maybe it will start in the pubs with something like crickets as a snack food. ‘Then it will have to be marketed cleverly as an eco-choice. 'I can easily see a time when we will be able to buy mealworm burgers in the freezer sections of supermarkets but sold as a ‘‘green’’ burger and packaged to appeal to those who prioritise health and the environment when it comes to food-buying. ‘If it is edible, good for you and tasty, why the heck not make it a part of the British way of life?’ Can Eating Insects Save The World?, part of BBC4’s Alien Nation season, starts on March 11 .","Eating bugs could soon be the norm in Britain, says food writer .

Many towns spend thousands of pounds a year to remove graffiti off the walls of buildings and monuments. But a piece of reverse graffiti in Connecticut has become a popular local attraction after a talented artist designed a beautiful oak tree that only appears when it rains. Unlike usual graffiti, which is washed away by heavy downpours, Adam Niklewicz' reverse graffiti only becomes visible when touched by water and disappears again when it dries. Popular graffiti: Polish born artist Adam Niklewicz has created a reverse graffiti image of an oak tree in Connecticut that can only be seen when it rains . First step: Adam Niklewicz pictured drawing the the outline for the stencil of an oak tree . Hugh project: Adam Niklewicz then created a stencil of the Charter Oak Tree - Connecticut's official tree - to the correct size . The Polish born artist has been creating reverse graffiti since 2009 when he experimented with using waterproofing treatments on bricks to create the artworks. The artwork, which on located on the side of a former synagogue in downtown Hartford and commissioned by the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Real Art Ways and the City of Hartford, is of the state's official tree - a Charter Oak. Mr Niklewicz, who is in his mid fifties, said: 'It's a conceptual mural which is built on a brick wall and the basic idea is a giant image of an oak tree. 'I noticed that when water is applied to untreated concrete it changes colour. Big structure: Adam Niklewicz, pictured left, then stuck the stencil to the side of a former synagogue in downtown Hartford . Piece by piece: Adam Niklewicz cut the stencils into small square and then put them back together on the wall . Time consuming: Adam Niklewicz then had to painstakingly cut out the markings on each stencil . 'I wanted the tree to appear with the rain, staying there throughout the rain and then slowly disappearing when the wall dries up. 'That little element of magic is what were after and that's what good art is about, its about surprising the viewer.' Mr Niklewicz recalls using this technique as a child, spraying water on the pavements to make basic pictures and patterns. To create the piece, Mr Niklewicz drew the giant picture on hundreds of small square stencils before spending three days creating graphite transfers of every section. Technical: Adam Niklewicz then strayed the completed stencil with a waterproofing formula . Revelation: When the stencil was removed, the wall was sprayed with water to reveal the image of the Charter Oak tree . End result: The detailed image of a Charter Oak tree appears as the wall is sprayed with water . It then took another two days sticking the stencils to the wall before a final three days cutting the stencil to the final picture before spraying the wall with waterproofing formula. 'It's a wonderful feeling, I love getting dirty when working on art. I had two other artists helping me on this and it's nice that we're all speaking the same language. 'The beauty of this project is that this hasn't been a compromise of my artistic integrity, if anything my original smallish idea has blossomed into realisation . 'This has been an amazing opportunity for me and I'm really grateful to everyone who has helped me with this project.' Piece of magic: Adam Niklewicz wanted to create a piece of artwork that would surprise the viewer . Local attraction: The wall is sprayed with water several times a day so members of the public can see it . Finishing touches: It took five days in total to stencil the wall and spray it with formula .

Death: New images of Osama bin Laden's corpse have been discovered, but won't be released to the public if the Justice Department has its way . Additional images of Osama bin Laden taken shortly after his death in a daring Navy SEAL raid have been found by the CIA - but all of the photos will remain unseen by the public. The discovery was announced on Friday in a letter from the Justice Department. The new pictures would add to about 52 grusesome shots of the terror leader's body after he was killed in May 2011 by members of SEAL Team Six as they raided his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Those photos were requested in a Freedom of Information filing by Michael Bekesha of Judicial Watch after the federal government ruled they must be kept classified for national security purposes. In a letter to Mr Bekesha obtained by The Huffington Post, the Justice Department said that 'the CIA recently located seven additional images of Osama Bin Laden's body from the May 1, 2011 operation that resulted in his death.' The letter went on: 'These additional images were not located during the CIA's search for responsive records in this case. However, these images of Bin Laden's corpse are of the same nature as thematerials the CIA previously identified [as classified].' A lower court has already upheld the . government's argument that the photos should remain secret in the . interest of national security, according to WestWingReports.com. But a federal appeals court is now considering whether the 52 pictures should be released to Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning legal watchdog. The group says it is not seeking any information about equipment or techniques used in the raid. Viewing the raid: President Obama and his key staffers watch the Navy SEAL mission at Osama bin Laden's compound in this White House photo . But President Obama has maintained that the photos' release could endanger American citizens. During a recent '60 Minutes' interview, Obama said it was important to ensure that 'very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence or as a propaganda tool.' After bin Laden was killed, the Obama administration said his body was buried at sea off the USS Carl Vinson - in accordance with Islamic tradition. The raid itself was completed shortly after 1am local time when bin Laden was shot once in the chest and once in the head by a U.S Navy Seal who announced: 'For God and country Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo.' Geronimo was the code-name given to the al-Qaeda leader. As Obama himself said in the White House Situation Room watching events unfold: 'We got him.'

A school caretaker who cheated the . taxpayer out of thousands of pounds after he carried on claiming . benefits despite winning £90,000 on the Lottery, has escaped jail. Shameless Geoffrey McLuckie, 52, failed to tell the authorities about his windfall after he scooped the Lotto prize in 2001. But instead the fraudster carried on claiming over £12,000 in Jobseekers Allowance in a scam lasting four years. An investigation by the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) discovered he had failed to declare the win but he argued he should not have to - because the money was for his 'future financial security.' McLuckie pleaded guilt yesterday to making a statement to obtain a benefit at Walsall Magistrates Court. Prosecutor Nick Baker said: 'He claimed Jobseeker's Allowance from 2008 and said he was unemployed and had capital under the prescribed limit. 'But evidence was gathered by investigators that he had capital and had failed to declare it. He said he understood the rules and that he had over £16,000. He stated he had not considered that to be savings.' McLuckie, who lives with his mother in Beechdale, West Midlands, was given a 12-month community order and asked to complete 150 hours of unpaid work. He must also pay costs of £100. Speaking after the case McLuckie - who now works 10 hours a week as a caretaker - said: 'I was jobless so I was claiming Job Seekers [allowance] - I don't know what all the fuss is about.

Firing bullets at targets in a shooting range may not be everyone's idea of a relaxing holiday. But the chance to use pistols, rifles and other kinds of firearms is drawing large numbers of Japanese tourists to the US Pacific island of Guam where gun controls are far loser than they are at home. At Guam's well-equipped shooting ranges, tourists - many of who are women - can use a wide range of weapons from tiny revolvers to Berettas, Glocks, semi-automatic pistols and M16 military assault rifles. Taking aim: Japanese tourist Natsue Matsumoto, 38, warms up for a round of shooting at the Western Frontier Village shooting range in Tamuning, Guam . Thrill: Two tourists are taught how to fire a rifle by range master Mike Aeta. Many Japanese visitors are eager to to shoot a gun at one of Guam's ubiquitous ranges . Restrictions: In Japan gun ownership is tightly restricted so large numbers of people head to Guam to try their hand with firearms . Despite a shared sense of shock over the recent rampage by a gunman at America's Sandy Hook Elementary School, the gun tourism business on the US territory is as brisk as ever. 'It was such a feeling of power,' Keigo Takizawa, a 30-year-old Japanese actor, said after blasting holes in a paper target with a shotgun, a .44 magnum and a Smith & Wesson revolver at Guam's Western Frontier Village gun club. 'But,' he said, 'I still don't think anyone should be allowed to have one of their own.' Many Japanese see America's gun culture as both frightening and fascinating because the only people with handguns in their society are in the military, the police or criminals. Experience: Mr Aeta prepares shooting certificates for Japanese tourists following a session at the gun club . Thrill: Keigo Takizawa, (right) a 30-year-old Japanese actor, practices shooting a rifle at the Western Frontier Village range in Tamuning, Guam . Because firearms are so hard to find . in Japan, gun-related crime is extremely rare. They were used in only . seven murders in the country - a nation of about 130 million people - in 2011. In the US, by contrast, with 315 million people, there are more than . 11,000 gun-related killings annually. The Japanese are proud of their low crime rate and generally support tough gun-control policies. But for many - a trip to Guam's ubiquitous shooting ranges is just too tempting. Advertising: Tourists walk under a banner in Japanese advertising a gun club in Guam . 'I think it's human nature to be curious about something that is forbidden,' said Tetsuo Yamamoto, a Japanese native who emigrated to the United States 30 years ago and runs the Western Frontier Village range. 'Most of our customers are from Japan and have never had the opportunity to shoot a gun. It's very exotic for them, and it's very exhilarating.' So exhilarating that he sometimes asks his guests to stay around for a while to calm down after they have finished shooting. Many other tourists - from South Korea, Taiwan and increasingly Russia - are less impressed by the chance to shoot guns. All South Korean men, for example, learn how to shoot during mandatory military service. 'To them, learning how to use a gun was a chore,' said Patrick Chon, general-manager of the Hafa Adai indoor shooting range. 'It brings back bad memories. They hardly ever come here.'

'When most Japanese people think of American culture, one of the first things they think of is guns,' said Natsue Matsumoto, a 38-year-old Osaka woman who said she enjoyed shooting so much she was back at a range for the second time in three days. 'American movies and video games are full of guns and that's appealing, in a frightening sort of way,' she said, 'but I think Japan has it right.

But pensioner Eric Bradshaw, 83, is hoping to sweeten his retirement by cashing in on what is believed to be the world's biggest collection of fruit wrappers. Mr Bradshaw has 2,797 different designs - collected by him and his grandfather before him over more than 90 years - which have been meticulously stuck into albums. Colourful: Pensioner Eric Bradshaw from Camborne, Cornwall, is hoping to cash in on what is thought to be the world's biggest collection of fruit wrappers . Art work: Two examples of the colourful collection. Mr Bradshaw has 2,797 different designs meticulously stuck into albums . The collection was started in the early 1920s by Mr Bradshaw's grandfather Fred. Mr Bradshaw, from Camborne, Cornwall, said: 'He fell ill in 1921 and had to give up work.He lost his balance. He was told he had to eat lots of oranges. 'My grandmother said to him, 'Why don't you collect the wrappers?' and it all started from that.' For many years, citrus fruits were wrapped in decorated tissue-type paper to offer protection.Different suppliers used different designs on their wrappers. Impressive: Mr Bradshaw hopes to use any money raised from the collection to take his wife on a cruise . Vibrant: The collection was started in the early 1920s by Mr Bradshaw's grandfather Fred. Some of the examples are extremely rare . Eye catching: Many of the wrappers are very exotic including this one from Brazil. It is currently unclear how much the collection might be worth . Some countries still wrap their oranges in wax paper . In more recent times, citrus fruits - . such as lemons, oranges, limes and grapefruit - have been protected by a thin . coat of food-grade wax, which prevents moisture loss and mould growth, . minimises bruising and enhances appearance. Each box of fruit today usually still contains at least one colourful wrapper. Mr Bradshaw said: 'My wife has been online and the largest collections she found was about 200 wrappers.' 'There were about 2,670 citrus wrappers in the collection when I inherited it and I've added another 120 or so. I pop around to the local fruit shop, they know me and hang onto any wrappers that come in.' The problem now for Mr Bradshaw is what to do with what is potentially a world record collection. He said: 'There is nobody else in the family who is interested in keeping the collection going, so I shall probably sell it. 'It would be nice to get enough money to take the wife on a cruise.'

A woman and her elderly parents have died from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning at a caravan park.

A helper raised the alarm on Saturday afternoon when she called at the static caravan at Tremarle Home Park in North Roskear, Cornwall.

Tragic: The static home where John and Audrey Cook and their daughter Maureen died of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning . Tributes: A resident leaves flowers outside of the home where John and Audrey Cook died along with their daughter Maureen . No one answered the door and a person could be seen slumped in a chair. When rescue workers broke down the . door of the caravan near Camborne, Cornwall, after failing to get any . kind of response from the occupants, they found the three bodies, and . that of the family dog. The alarm was raised at around 1pm this afternoon at Tremarle Home Park, North Roskear, Devon and Cornwall police said. It is understood the family may have been using a heater to keep warm as the region experienced freezing conditions into the weekend . Friends and neighbours have today been paying tribute to Mr Cook, 90, who was known to his friends as John, Audrey Cook, 86, and their daughter Maureen, 46. The family's Jack Russell, called Jannie, also died. One neighbour, Sonya Owen, 53, said: 'It's very distressing. I knew the daughter, she was living her with her mum and dad. Everybody is really upset.' Margaret Holmes, 65, who lived near the couple and their daughter, said: 'They had lived here for around 40 years and they kept themselves to themselves. Touching: Neighbours have left floral tributes for the family at the caravan park today . 'I just can’t believe this has happened, it is so sad and I am so shocked, I think we all are, you just don’t expect this sort of thing to happen on your doorstep. 'Everyone will miss them, we used to chat a lot when we were both in the garden. 'I would just like to send my condolences to their family, I can’t imagine what they’re going through.' Nic Clark, 52, who was good friends with daughter Maureen, added: 'They were a lovely kind family, a great trio. 'Maureen used to go out and walk her dog, a little Jack Russell, it is so sad what has happened, I understand the dog went with them. 'They will be sorely missed and I think everyone is just in shock at the moment, I would like to send my condolences to the Cook family.' Linda Barr, 84, who lived opposite the family said: 'We have known them for 13 years, it is such a shame what has happened, I really can’t believe it. 'They were very nice people and it is so sad what has happened. 'We’re all going to miss seeing them terribly, they’ve been here for so long it will be strange not having them around.' Friend Judith Clarke said: 'They were a nice family who kept themselves to themselves. 'Maureen was a gentle soul who looked after her mum and dad. 'She loved her dog and she always used to fuss my dog Poppy as she walked by. I am absolutely gutted and it's hard to believe they are gone."" Julie Boon, 55, said the whole community was left shocked and devastated. She knew the family for 20 years. She said: 'I saw Maureen and her mum on Thursday morning when they were walking their dog. 'Maureen asked about my dog Rusko and her mum commented on the cold weather and then they went. 'That's the last time I saw them. They were a lovely family who loved their dog and their home. 'The whole community is shocked and devastated.' Jean Carr, 72, said: 'John and Audrey were quite ill I believe, they really didn't get the chance to leave the home very often. 'I think it was just down to old age, they were very old and have been here such a long time. 'Maureen loved her little dog, I would see her walking it every day, it really did give her a lot of joy. 'We aren't really a tight knit community, but still, I think this news has shocked everyone and it is just so sad, I really can't believe it.' Sue Isaacs, 58, added: 'My son told me it was on the news and it felt like someone had kicked me in the stomach when I found out what happened, it was horrible. 'I can't sleep knowing what has happened right on my doorstep, it is just awful. They were so friendly and this has rocked our lovely neighbourhood to its core.' Inspector David Eldridge of Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'Shortly . before 1pm this afternoon, we were called to a caravan park near . Camborne in Cornwall, where a helper had been unable to get a reply from . an elderly couple who lived in the caravan. 'We were able to see that there was a figure sat in a chair but they . were unresponsive to knocks at the door. Cornwall Fire and Rescue were . called. 'They forced entry into the property and found that the three occupants were all dead.' Emergency: Firecrews rushed to the Tremarle Home Park in North Roskear, near Cambourne, Cornwall and broke down the door of the static caravan . An investigation into what caused the deaths is under way, but the incident is not being treated as suspicious. Post-mortem examinations will be held to confirm the cause of death. A . Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said that a crew from . Camborne Community Fire Station attended the scene with a hazardous . materials advisor after being called at 12.56pm. The Health and Safety Executive said it would not be investigating as the incident took place at a domestic address. Stephanie Trotter, president and . director of the independent charity CO-Gas Safety, said Carbon Monoxide . was an incredibly lethal gas. 'Less than two percent of carbon monoxide can kill in between one and three minutes,' she said. 'It cannot be sensed using human senses of smell, touch, sight or hearing.' 'The . Department of Health estimates that about 40-50 people die of carbon . monoxide and about 4,000 attend A&E every year in England & . Wales alone. 'But the . numbers could be much higher because there is no automatic test of . carbon monoxide on dead bodies, even in cases of unexplained death. 'Also, GPs find carbon monoxide very difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are so similar to many viruses. 'It is also difficult because the gas emergency service doesn't carry or use equipment to test appliances for CO and a registered gas installer will tend to change the appliance to make sure it's safe before testing. Grim discovery: Police have said that they could see a figure sat in a chair through the window of the home but could get no response . 'It means that often people who have been poisoned, never know.' She added the charity was lobbying MPs to bring about changes to the Energy Bill currently going through Parliament - for more public awareness campaigns and for the gas emergency service to carry and use equipment to test gas appliances for carbon monoxide. Mrs Trotter said: 'We are very sorry to read of these tragic deaths. We send sympathy to family and friends and offer free, confidential help and advice.' Camborne Town Council member David Biggs described the incident as an 'appalling tragedy'. He said: 'Tremarle Park is a residential caravan site and has provided homes for people for many years.

But just as in the famous Biblical tale, size was no barrier to victory as the smaller creature got the better of its almighty - relatively speaking - counterpart. The contrast in size is amazingly evident but this doesn't seem to intimidate this ant as he goes and takes a chunk out of the grasshopper. The pictures were taken in Indonesia . Its head almost resembling a duck, the ant gives the mighty hopper a nip. The incredible images were taken using a Canon EOS 5 D . Despite the larger insect's desperate kicks, the ant managed to bite the grasshopper and was then joined by eight of its ant friends who joined forces to subdue the green critter. Photographer Adhi Prayoga took the pictures in a friend's garden. He said: 'At first I thought the locust would be able to escape easily, but the strength of an ant is amazing despite having a small body. 'Ants also have a good togetherness and are very fast. When they attacked the locust was caught.' The Indonesian father of three has been a photographer since early 2011 and enjoys specialising in insects. He used a Canon EOS 5 D to capture the snaps, which took him roughly 30 minutes to shoot. Despite . its suffering, the ordeal finished with a happy ending for the locust . as it eventually managed to fight its way out of the ants' grasp. The grasshopper tries to escape the grip of the tiny ant by scuttling towards the top of the plant - to no avail.

President Obama is set to make gun control - as well as taxes and spending - a key part of his State of the Union speech after the first lady invited the parents of the slain Chicago teenager who has become the poster child for gun violence in the president's home city. The president is also expected to press Congress for additional tax hikes, fewer . spending cuts, outreach for military families and immigration . reform, which is shaping up to be a key part of his second term agenda. The . agenda Obama will outline will include more money for infrastructure, . clean energy technologies and manufacturing jobs, as well as expanding . access to early childhood education. White House spokesman Jay Carney said . Obama would outline 'his plan to create jobs and grow the middle class' as the nation struggles with persistently high unemployment. Central topic: Barack Obama is set to make gun control of a key part of his State of the Union speech after the First Lady invited along the parents of the slain Chicago teenager who has become the poster child for gun violence . Recent tragedy: 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton was shot dead just a mile from Mr Obama's Chicago home and only a week after she performed at his second inauguration . Some . of Obama's job ideas will be repackaged versions of proposals he made . during his first term, though aides say there will be some new . initiatives, too. All of . the economic proposals are expected to echo themes from Obama's . re-election campaign, which focused on using increased spending to . generate jobs, protecting programs to help the middle class, and . bringing down the deficit in part by culling more tax revenue from the . wealthiest Americans. Obama has called for raising more revenue through closing tax breaks and loopholes, but he has not detailed a list of targets. He . and his aides often mention as examples of unnecessary tax breaks a . benefit for owners of private jets and tax subsidies for oil and gas . companies. But no portion of Obama's remarks may . be more poignant than the renewed call for tougher firearms laws with . Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton and Nathaniel Pendleton looking on. Their . 15-year-old daughter Hadiya was shot dead just a mile from Mr Obama’s . Chicago home and only a week after she performed at his second . inauguration. Chicago police announced Monday evening that they had arrested two men in the case. Mr and Mrs Pendleton have been invited . to make the painful return trip to Washington D.C. by First Lady . Michelle Obama, who offered them a seat in her box. There they will be joined by others who suffered tragedy and loss as a result of gun violence. Mr Obama has already pledged to ban the sale of assault weapons, introduce tougher background checks and reduce the capacity of magazines. He was moved by the shooting of 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December. Mrs Obama attended the Hadiya’s funeral along with Education Secretary Arne Duncan and White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, who are both from Chicago. A handwritten note to Hadiya's family from the Obamas was even published on her funeral program. It read: ‘Dear Cleopatra and . Nathaniel, Michelle and I just wanted you to know how heartbroken we are . to have heard about Hadiya's passing. 'We . know that no words from us can soothe the pain, but rest assured that . we are praying for you, and that we will continue to work as hard as we . can to end this senseless violence. God Bless, Barack Obama.' In attendance: Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton, Hadiya's mother, will attend the State of the Union address as one of Michelle Obama's guests . Funeral guest: Michelle Obama attended Hadiya Pendleton's funeral service in Chicago . Hadiya was shot dead January 29 while sheltering from the rain in a Chicago park, the innocent victim of a gang shootout. Her death made her the 42nd person to be gunned down in the city this year alone. In . a bitter irony, she was not only an honors student but an advocate for . her fellow pupils who said in a video posted online: 'It is your job as . students to say no to gangs and yes to a great future.' Chicago police said Monday evening . that two reputed gang members, Michael Ward,18, and Kenneth Williams, . 20, have been charged with her murder. They . were arrested after police used video surveillance and tips from . community residents during their investigations, sources told DNAinfo.com/Chicago. 'I’m ecstatic. The whole family is ecstatic,' Hadiya’s mother, Cleopatra, told The Chicago Sun-Times. Other main topics: In his State of the Union speech Mr Obama is also expected to speak about military families and immigration reform, which is shaping up to be a key part of his second term agenda . 'I just pray they are penalized to the full extent of the law.' Meanwhile, Republicans have shown little sign of falling in line behind the president ahead of his speech tonight, particularly when it comes to taxes. 'Clearly . the president wants more revenue for more government,' Senate Minority . Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in an interview. 'He's gotten all the revenue he's going to get. Been there, done that.' The . backdrop for Obama's address will be a March 1 deadline for averting . automatic across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester. The president wants lawmakers to push . that deadline back for a second time to create space for a larger . deficit-reduction deal, one he hopes would include a balance of targeted . cuts and increased tax revenue. Republicans want to offset the sequester with spending cuts alone. Couple: President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama were pictured on Monday during a Medal of Honor presentation ceremony at the White House . Speech: President Obama, pictured on Monday during a Medal of Honor presentation ceremony, will deliver his State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night . As he addresses lawmakers and the American people, Obama is expected to say that government entitlement programs should be on the table in deficit reduction talks. But he will also make the case that programs that help the middle class, the poor and the elderly must be protected. In keeping with that approach, the White House said Monday that Obama would not consider increasing the Medicare eligibility age as a way to reduce spending. The president's focus on the economy and deficit reflects the top concerns of many Americans. A Quinnipiac University poll out Monday showed than 35 per cent of registered voters are most interested in hearing the president during the State of the Union address the economy, more than any other issue. The federal deficit came in second, with 20 per cent saying that was the issue they were most interested in hearing Obama discuss. The poll also suggested that the slow but steady economic gains throughout Obama's first term may not be trickling down to many Americans. More than 50 per cent of registered voters said they thought the economy was still in a recession and 79 per cent described the economy as 'not so good' or 'poor.'","The president will make renewed call for strict gun control measures .

So, ladies, if you're fed up of wobbling along on perilously high heels, grab your chance to ditch them while you can – because flats are finally in vogue. Designers are swapping stilettos and platform heels for more comfortable footwear, according to industry insiders. Changing fashions: Industry insiders say designers are swapping stilettos and platform heels for flats . And the catwalk trend has already reached the high street, where sales of flats and trainers have rocketed over the past few months. The likes of Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn were seen sporting Burberry's micro-low wedges and Christopher Kane's flat shiny boots during London Fashion Week. Cool Britannia: Roberto Cavalli said the influence is coming from London . And at his Milan fashion show, Italian designer Roberto Cavalli said: 'Women are wearing trainers now and lower heels. It's the street influence. It's cool and it's all coming from London.' At Kurt Geiger, lower heels now account for about 60 per cent of sales, while at Debenhams sales of flat or low-heeled shoes have risen by 25 per cent in the past six months. Sales of comfortable shoes at John Lewis have doubled in the past year, and last week's figures were up by 153 per cent on the same period in 2011. Rebecca Farrar-Hockley, creative director at Kurt Geiger, said: 'There's definitely a radical shift towards lower heels. Sneakers are really on trend. 'Sneakers are really on trend. Girls are getting used to being able to run about and I don't think they are going back to the big high heels.' Helen Attwood, footwear buying manager for Selfridges, added: 'It's a revolution. Out of all our footwear categories we are repeating orders mostly on flats and trainers. They are selling out across every price point.' Kate Ormrod, a fashion analyst at retail analyst Verdict, said the Royal Wedding may have influenced the new trend. She said: 'Low platforms and wedges and nude finishes are on trend, particularly due to high interest in the styles worn by the Duchess of Cambridge. 'There has been a move towards more comfortable styles and catwalk trends are quicker to filter down to the high street.' Trend-setters: The shift is partly down to the likes of Cara Delevingne being seen out and about in trainers . Even Victoria Beckham, who is often seen pioneering the latest towering heels, was photographed in New York this winter wearing monk-strap flat shoes. She also dressed the models in her spring 13 catwalk show in Manolo Blahnik monks. And students at the London College of Fashion are also cottoning on to the new craze with designs for their degree projects. According to course leader Sue Sanders, students are increasingly ditching heels for flat designs with 'strappy, complicated constructions'. Francesca Burns, fashion editor of Vogue magazine, told the Sunday Times said the trend of teaming 'casual trainers with posh frocks'began last year and had been adopted by well-known figures such as Agyness Deyn, the model, and Kristen Stewart, the actress. She said: 'It's a rebellion - it's about mixing high and low together.'","Designers swap stilettos and platform heels for more comfortable footwear .

Fireworks have exploded at CNN after new boss Jeff Zucker hired and fired six big names in his first two days in the job. The first departure was political power couple James Carville, the veteran political analyst, and his wife Mary Matalin, who have been with CNN since 2005. CNN network's managing editor Mark Whitaker then announced that he was going to quit as it emerged ABC's Chris Cuomo was coming over to start a new morning show. RedState's Erick Erickson will also be leaving and will reportedly be heading to Fox News, which recently fired Sarah Palin. Shake-up: CNN's new boss Jeff Zucker, pictured left, has hired and fired six big names in his first two days in the job. However, the former editor of Britain's Daily Mirror, Piers Morgan, right, will keep his job . But perhaps the biggest news of all is that the voice of James Earl Jones will once again speak the 'This is CNN' greeting. The Oscar nominee and voice of Darth Vader has not been featured on the network for years but Zucker asked that it be brought back on Monday to coincide with President Obama's inauguration - also his first day in the job. It also appears that the former editor of Britain's Daily Mirror, Piers Morgan, will remain in his position as host of Piers Morgan Tonight, which he began hosting on 17 January 2011. The changes show just how serious Zucker is about turning CNN around, but for so much to happen so soon has raised eyebrows. His actions also leave huge questions over others whose fate rests in his hands, namely Ann Curry who wants to leave NBC for CNN. Another who will be feeling anxious is Soledad O'Brien, who currently hosts the CNN morning show 'Starting Point,' which has struggled in the ratings despite being critically applauded. Gone: The first departure was political power couple James Carville, right, the veteran political analyst, and his wife Mary Matalin, left, who have been with CNN since 2005 . Co-anchors: Chris Cuomo, left, will reportedly be paired with Erin Burnett, right, who currently hosts her prime time CNN show 'OutFront' O'Brien faces being ousted for Cuomo . who will reportedly be paired with Erin Burnett, who currently hosts her . prime time CNN show 'OutFront.'

O'Brien will now have to renegotiate her role and try to avoid being . put on the dreaded 'special assignment' duty which will see her . consigned to graveyard slots and obscurity. A CNN spokesman said: 'Soledad is very important to the network, and we're discussing various options with her.' Carver's firing seems less controversial. He claimed that he was 'completely cool' with being axed and that it . was to do with the fact he lives in New Orleans and not Washington. Fate unclear: It's not clear whether Ann Curry, right, will be able to leave NBC for CNN and Soledad O'Brien, right, who currently hosts the CNN morning show 'Starting Point,' could be out . Switch: Erick Erickson, left, is out, but James Earl Jones, right, is rehired for the CNN jingle . He . told Politico: 'I was told that they wanted the contributors to be more . available -- essentially, closer to Washington. I'm not always . available, I don't live there.' Matalin told Politico in an email: 'Agree with everything James said. 'I loved my time in and out at CNN and more, the many lifelong friendships made there.' Whitaker, . a former Newsweek editor, left with a barb and sent out an email to . staff saying that he stepped aside because Zucker has what he called . 'forceful ideas.' Gone: CNN's managing editor Mark Whitaker has resigned . He then tried to smooth things over . and said: 'For him to succeed, I believe he deserves his own team and . management structure and the freedom to communicate one clear vision to . the staff. 'I have shared that conclusion with him and he has agreed to let me step down as Managing Editor and move on from CNN. Zucker . will in fact take over Whitaker's role overseeing editorial content at . CNN and there will no new managing editor appointed. Zucker said in a statement: 'I want to thank Mark for his service at CNN. We are grateful for his contributions and wish him the best in the future.' Right-leaning Erickson has been with CNN since 2010 when he started as a contributor on John King, USA, which has already been axed, before becoming a contributor across the network. The worst affected by the switch seems to be his daughter and on his RedState blog he wrote: 'When I told my 7 year old I had decided to leave, she laid on the sofa for an hour crying that she'd never see Anderson Cooper again.' He also wrote that even though he was not an 'easy fit' at CNN and that the first month was 'tumultuous,' he was grateful for the chance to 'learn to be friends with people who I disagreed with.' Under Zucker's orders, CNN has already lured ABC's Jake Tapper to host an afternoon show on politics and John Berman has been brought in to co-host Early Start from 5am to 7am. Zucker was hired from NBC to shake up CNN after it suffered its worst rating slump in 21 years last summer.","Political power couple James Carville and his wife Mary Matalin were the first departures .

The District Attorney who refused to prosecute JonBenet Ramsey's parents did so because he was 'too scared' to put them on trial, it was claimed today. Alex Hunter did not indict John and Patsy Ramsey because he was 'in over his head', said Donald Davis, who co-authored one of the most authoritative books about what happened. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Mr Davis said that Mr Hunter was 'embarrassed' at the prospect of losing one of the most high profile cases in recent memory - so decided not to go forward with it instead. Cold case: John and Patsy Ramsey, the parents of murdered beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey, were indicted by a grand jury over her death, but prosecutors refused to press charges, it has been revealed . Unsolved: Six-year-old JonBenet was found bludgeoned and strangled to death in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado, on Christmas Day in 1996 . Mr Davis co-wrote ‘JonBenet: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation’ with Steve Thomas, one of the detectives in Boulder, Colorado who investigated JonBenet's death. He was speaking out after it emerged that back in 1999 a Colorado grand jury voted to indict the Ramseys on charges of child abuse resulting in death, a felony that can carry up to 48 years in prison. JonBenet, six, was found bludgeoned and strangled to death in the basement of her home in Boulder on Boxing Day in 1996. Sources, including members of the grand jury, told the Boulder Daily Camera that Mr Hunter refused to sign the indictment vote and never publicly revealed its decision. As a result Mr and Mrs Ramsey remained suspects until finally being exonerated in 2008. No-one has ever been convicted. Mr Davis’s comments threaten to re-open wounds that have barely begun to heal despite the passage of 14 years. Experts: Mr Davis co-wrote ‘JonBenet: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation’ with Steve Thomas, one of the detectives in Boulder, Colorado who investigated JonBenet's death . He has never spoken publically about Mr Hunter but said that ‘this would be about the way I would expect it to finally come down’. He told MailOnline: ‘Mr Hunter was scared. He was in over his head. ‘He didn’t want to take these people into the courtroom. He was embarrassed they might be set free.' Mr Davis said that Mr Hunter was ‘known as Mr Plea Bargain around here (Boulder).’ He said: ‘He wasn’t ready for anything beyond that’. Mr Davis’s book with former cop Steve Thomas was arguably the most sensational about the entire case. Mr Thomas quit the investigation in 1998 and wrote a scathing letter about Mr Hunter which he made public and explained in depth in the book. His resignation letter reads: ‘It is difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for the appointment of an entirely independent prosecution team to be introduced into this matter, who would oversee an attempt at righting this case’. Mr Davis said that Mr Thomas is now ‘living quietly with his wife and a little girl’. He said: ‘He doesn’t want anything to do with this. He feels that a huge injustice was done. I agree with him’. 'Last picture': JonBenet with her mother, apparently on the morning of her death. Her parents remained suspects in the murder until finally being exonerated in 2008 . Horrific: JonBenet was found with her wrists tied above her head and duct tape over her mouth . In a sign of how strong feelings are on the other side, a lawyer for Mr Ramsey, whose wife died of ovarian cancer in 2006, said that Mr Hunter and his staff were actually courageous for what they did. Attorney Bryan Morgan said: 'If what you report actually happened, then there were some very professional and brave people in Alex’s office.' Hunter, who left office in 2001 after 28 years as Boulder County's district attorney, has declined to discuss the grand jury's actions. In 1999 when he announced the end of investigation, he said: 'I and my prosecution task force believe we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant a filing of charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time.' It is unclear whether Mr Hunter was required to sign the indictment. However, one expert told the Daily Camera that in her opinion proper legal procedure would have been to sign the document and file it with the court before going to open court to dismiss the charges. Defending accusations: Patsy and John Ramsey hold a picture of their daughter during a press conference in 2000 where they released the results of an independent lie detector test, which revealed they had no knowledge of who killed their daughter . In a statement Mr Hunter told the Daily Camera: 'Colorado statutes, the ethical canons which govern the practice of law, and the Boulder District Court's oaths, instructions and orders in the JonBenet Ramsey grand jury proceedings, are well established and absolutely clear with respect to the various participants' legal obligations, duties and responsibilities, including the inviolate secrecy of the proceedings and the differing burdens of proof applicable to jurors and prosecutors. 'As the duly elected district attorney at the time and as an officer of the court then and now, I must respectfully decline further comment.' It was on Christmas Day of 1996 that the Ramseys received a ransom note saying that JonBenet had been kidnapped and that the kidnappers were demanding $118,000 - the amount of a bonus Mr Ramsey had recently received - or else she would be beheaded. It was not long before her body was found in the basement of the house. Her wrists were tied above her head, and she had duct tape over her mouth. An autopsy report revealed that she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death. Within hours, the Ramseys themselves became the chief suspects of the investigation and police were later criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family - including JonBenet's brother Burke - instead of following up other leads. Basement case: This 1996 police video shows the basement hours after JonBenet's body was discovered . For the next 12 years, the blame for their daughter's death - who was given the name Little Miss Sunshine - lay largely on their shoulders as they fought to clear their name and find the real killer. Eventually, Mr Hunter’s office completely cleared the Ramseys of any wrongdoing in their daughter’s slaying and issued an apology in 2008. Since then, Mr Ramsey has kept the memory of his daughter alive, despite losing his reputation, a thriving business and his wife. Christmas Day, 1996: Parents of six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey receive a ransom note demanding $118,000 . Boxing Day, 1996: JonBenet found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado . Boulder Police quickly placed her parents,John and Patsy Ramsey, under an 'umbrella of suspicion' but they were never formally named as suspects . Detectives were later criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family . 2003: DNA taken from the victim's clothes suggests the family were not involved . 2006: Patsy Ramsey dies of ovarian cancer . August 2006: Former teacher John Mark Karr reportedly confesses to the murder while being held on child pornography charges.

February 2009: Boulder Police Department takes the case back from the district attorney to reopen the investigation . He eventually found happiness through his relationship with fashion designer Jan Rousseaux, who he married at a private ceremony in Charlevoix, Michigan, in July 2011. Last year, a former detective officially broke his silence over the investigation, saying that overlooked clues like cobwebs and a child's toy could prove important in finding the killer in the high-profile cold case. In his self-published book, Foreign Faction: Who Really Kidnapped JonBenet Ramsey?, Jim Kolar revealed thousands of pages worth of investigations and police reports. He said he wanted the truth to be out in the public domain, and has a theory that a children’s toy could be responsible for the marks on JonBenet’s back. Mr Ramsey told police in 1996 that an intruder broke through a window in the basement. But in macabre police video that shows the basement hours after JonBenet was found dead, Koler pointed out that there are wispy cobwebs, moving ever so slightly. Koler speculates that an intruder would have brushed away the cobwebs upon entering the Ramsey’s residence and thus JonBenet’s killer would have already been inside the house. Under suspicion: The Ramseys arrive at their attorney's office in August 2000 to answer questions about the death of their daughter . Among those whose lives have never been the same after the JonBenet Ramsey case is retired Boulder chief of police, Tom Koby. He told MailOnline that he would still ‘like to justice because this case was never solved’. Mr Koby said whilst there’s ‘nothing to prevent this case from going to trial’ he has faith in the current Boulder District Attorney to make the right call. He said: 'The bottom line is this case is now as it was then. ‘There have been no charges in the case. My hope is that (Boulder) District Attorney Stanley Garnett, who is a very capable District Attorney, will one day be able to do that (file charges). ‘The Ramsey case is one of a number of homicides that become unsolved. Thirty per cent of homicides in America are not resolved. This is no different.’ Calls to Mr Hunter’s home in Boulder, Colorado went unreturned. MailOnline reached out to Mr Ramsey’s former lawyer L. Lin Wood but he has not called back. The Boulder District Attorney’s office declined to comment.","JonBenet, 6, found bludgeoned to death at home on Christmas Day, 1996 .

English people looking for lower tax rates may not have to seek out an offshore haven in future - they could just go to Wales. The Welsh government is set to be given the powers to reduce taxes in an attempt to attract businesses and individuals to the country from other parts of the UK. Officials hope the move will help to reduce inequality between the various regions of Britain. Idyllic: But new efforts to attract English people to Wales are set to centre around tax cuts for high earners rather than picturesque landscapes . House prices in Wales are around two thirds of the UK average, which could tempt English homeowners forced to devote most of their salary to mortgage repayments. And experts have recommended that the Welsh Assembly should be given the power to make Wales more business-friendly by varying tax rates in the country. Currently the devolved governments in Wales and Scotland have no tax-raising powers, but the Scottish Parliament will be allowed to set its own rates from 2016. The Silk Commission which issued a report on the future of Wales last year suggested that the Welsh Assembly should follow suit. Senior Conservatives are in favour of allowing the Assembly to set its own rates of income tax and stamp duty, according to the Independent. Policy: Andrew Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, is calling for a cut in taxes . The party's leader in Wales will today unveil a new policy which would see a tax cut for those earning more than £34,000 who are currently subject to the 40 per cent rate. Andrew Davies said: 'If some elements of income tax are devolved, it would be necessary to look at a period of reduced taxation for those paying the 40 per cent tax rate. 'This would not only send out a strong sign to business in competing regions of the UK, but it would spell out that Wales is well and truly open for business.' Some 64 per cent of residents in Wales would support the devolution of income tax, according to a poll conducted for the Silk Commission. Capital: Welsh politicians hope that their new tax powers would attract people to Cardiff and other cities . Currently just seven per cent of Welsh taxpayers are subject to the 40 per cent rate - 1 in 16 - compared to 1 in 10 in England. The British Government spends more than £6,000 on Wales per head of population, meaning that Westminster is keen to reduce the country's dependency on more economically vibrant areas like London and South-East England. As well as making Wales a more attractive place to live and do business, giving the Assembly the power to determine tax rates would boost interest in the devolved government. The new powers would allow local politicians to run for office promising to cut taxes or offer more public services.","Welsh Assembly 'to get power to set tax rates' like Scottish Parliament .

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 06:14 EST, 25 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:54 EST, 26 February 2013 . Quit: Cardinal Keith O'Brien has resigned as Archbishop of St Andrew's and Edinburgh . Britain's most senior Roman Catholic yesterday apologised for his failures after being ordered to quit by the Pope as a further sex scandal swept the church. Cardinal Keith O’Brien said sorry as it was revealed that he must resign now rather than wait until his 75th birthday, which falls next month. In a statement the Cardinal, 74, said: ‘Looking back over my years of ministry: for any good I have been able to do, I thank God. For any failures, I apologise to all whom I have offended.’ The Vatican instruction follows allegations made by three un-named priests and one former priest who say that they were subjected to ‘inappropriate’ approaches by the cardinal 30 years ago. The complaints were made to the Vatican’s representative in London early last month – before Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation, but after Cardinal O’Brien had made known to Rome that he wished to resign ‘in view of his 75th birthday’. The sudden departure of the cardinal leaves the church grappling with the implications of a new sex scandal affecting its senior leadership and denies British Roman Catholics any influence on the voting when 116 cardinals gather to elect Benedict’s replacement next month. The affair intensified the sense of intrigue and conspiracy that has grown around the Papacy since Benedict made the surprise announcement of his own decision to quit on February 11. The dramatic move to become the first Pope in 600 years to resign has provoked intense speculation both on what influences may have been at work on Benedict and on what role he will play after he stands down. A Vatican adviser in Scotland said the O’Brien resignation was ‘shocking and sad’ but ‘unsurprising’. Cardinal O’Brien’s apology follows growing controversy over his leadership in recent weeks. The vehemence of his public stand against same-sex marriage led to condemnation by the gay lobby. Scroll down for video . Staying away: Cardinal O'Brien, pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh and the Pope, will no longer attend the election to choose Benedict XVI's successor . However, in a surprise move just a day . before the sex scandal broke, he upset traditionalists by calling for . priests to be given the right to marry. His immediate departure was set out in an announcement from the Scottish church yesterday morning. Cardinal O’Brien said: ‘Approaching . the age of 75 and at times in indifferent health, I tendered my . resignation as Archbishop of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh to Pope . Benedict XVI some months ago.’ He added that he had been ‘happy to . know’ that on November 13 last year the Pope had accepted his . resignation, but that it would take effect at an unspecified later date. Position: The archbishop was the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland and the UK's senior priest . Senior church figures are expected to . go at 75, but the Vatican often allows leeway of a year or two. Following news of the sex scandal over the weekend, the Pope gave . Cardinal O’Brien no choice. ‘The Holy Father has now decided that . my resignation will take effect today, 25 February 2013, and that he . will appoint an Apostolic Administrator to govern the Archdiocese in my . place until my successor is appointed,’ Cardinal O’Brien said. The decision means he will no longer . travel to Rome as planned to take part in the conclave that will elect . the next Pope in March. The Cardinal said in his statement: ‘I . thank Pope Benedict XVI for his kindness and courtesy to me and…I wish . him a long and happy retirement. ‘I also ask God’s blessing on my . brother Cardinals who will soon gather in Rome to elect his successor. I . will not join them for this conclave. I do not wish media attention in . Rome to be focused on me – but rather on Pope Benedict XVI and on his . successor.’ Saying mass in Edinburgh: Cardinal Keith O' Brien in his role as Britain's most senior Catholic . Cardinal O’Brien, who on Sunday missed . a mass in St Mary’s Cathedral in Edinburgh that had been intended to . celebrate eight years of Benedict’s papacy, has contested claims of . inappropriate behaviour made against him. The claims were made to the Papal . Nuncio, the Vatican ambassador in London, Antonio Mennini, in the week . before the announcement of Benedict’s resignation on February 11. According to the Observer newspaper, . one former priest claims Cardinal O’Brien made an inappropriate approach . to him in 1980, after night prayers, when he was a seminarian at St . Andrew’s College, Drygrange. The man, who is now married, says he . resigned as a priest when Cardinal O’Brien was first made a bishop. He . said in his complaint: ‘I knew then he would always have power over me. It was assumed I left the priesthood to get married. I did not. I left . to preserve my integrity.’ In Rome: The cardinal had been due to travel to the Vatican to take part in the forthcoming papal conclave . A second statement from another priest . says he was living in a parish when he was visited by Cardinal O’Brien, . and inappropriate contact took place between them. A third man said he had had to deal with ‘unwanted behaviour’ by the cardinal in the 1980s after some late-night drinking. The fourth complaint came from a priest who said the cardinal used night prayers as an excuse for inappropriate contact. Retiring: Pope Benedict XVI delivers his blessing during his last Angelus noon prayer from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square at the Vatican yesterday . A Vatican adviser in Scotland, . Professor John Haldane of St Andrews University, said: ‘The resignation . of Cardinal O’Brien as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, within a . month of the date on which his formal resignation would normally have . taken effect is both shocking and sad. ‘Given the nature of the accusations, . however, and the publication of them over the weekend, ahead of the . formal abdication of Pope Benedict later in the week, it is unsurprising . that he has taken the decision to resign.’ Professor Haldane, added: ‘The . Cardinal could not but be mindful of the problems that would follow . given the inevitable press interest created by the accusations, and he . would not want that burden to fall upon the Church and the Pope at what . is obviously a critical moment in the life of the Roman Catholic . community.' The departure of the Cardinal leaves the five million faithful in Britain without a representative when the new Pope is chosen. It will mean that the number of cardinals with the power to vote in the conclave for Benedict’s successor is reduced to 116, with at least one other withdrawal a possibility between now and the opening of discussions in the Vatican next month. There are some 750,000 Catholics  in Scotland who would have been represented by the Cardinal as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh. More than four million Catholics in England and Wales have no voice in the talks and no vote in the final reckoning because there is no qualified cardinal among their leaders. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, who stepped down as Archbishop of Westminster in 2009, is 80, and so too old to join the voting bloc of cardinals. He will, however, travel to Rome to take part in advisory talks. His successor as Archbishop of Westminster, the Most Reverend Vincent Nichols, has yet to be awarded a cardinal’s hat more than three years after taking over as leader of Catholics in England and Wales. Some observers believe this is because Benedict has been suspicious of what he sees as liberal tendencies among English bishops. Another cardinal is under pressure to follow Keith O’Brien out of the conclave. Roger Mahony, former Archbishop of Los Angeles, who is being urged to step down by lobby groups who accuse him of covering up sex abuse by priests. The conclave may now begin around March 10. The Pope’s resignation takes effect on Thursday evening this week, 28 February.

Guilty: Jasmine Nassif, 21, was jailed for two years at the Old Bailey for her part in a gang attack which left an off duty British soldier with life-threatening injuries . A council youth worker who took part in a gang attack which left a soldier partially disembowelled was jailed for two years today. Jasmine Nassif, who had been out celebrating her 21st birthday, was one of a gang which attacked four clubbers, including on-leave British squaddie Alfred Kyei-Baffour outside London's Guildhall. The attackers had taken offence after one of the other party started chatting up girls in their group. The violence was captured on CCTV and showed Mr Kyei-Baffour and his friends being chased by at least ten people while being punched and kicked before a baseball bat appears and is used to hit on their the heads and body. During the melee the British Army squaddie was stabbed twice causing deep wounds and his 'intestines to hang out' leaving him with life threatening injuries last July. He has made a recovery and has returned to his regiment. Although no-one was convicted of the stabbing, seven people in court today, including Nassif, who had spurred the gang on, were jailed for violent disorder. Mr Kyei-Baffour's party had been to one club and were returning to their car when they came across crowds outside another club closing opposite Wood Street police station. Jasmine Nassif who had been celebrating her 21st birthday 'took offence' when one of Mr Kyei-Baffour's party started chatting up some girls but police quickly separated the two sides. Mr Kyei-Baffour and his party returned to their car while Nassif's group waited for two cabs. But as Nassif and her boyfriend Ishmael Francis, 22, headed towards their own car they came across Mr Kyei-Baffour and his friends in their BMW and another row erupted. Scroll down for video: .

Francis then flagged down the cabs and they were joined by eight or nine of their friends who attacked the four with fists and feet. Nassif was seen to stride into the fray and egged the others on before sprinting to the boot of her car with Francis. Judge Wendy Joseph QC said: 'Immediately she was joined by Francis who seconds later ran to the fight now armed with a baseball bat. 'That bat then to some extent superseded the physical violence that was taking place without weapons. There was some pushing, punches and kicking but the bat took central stage. Jailed: Nassif (left) - who wept in court during the trial - was criticised by the judge for egging on the gang. She was sentenced to two years in prison. Her boyfriend Francis (right) was jailed for 22 months . 'It was used with extreme violence, it . was directed certainly by some at the head and bodies of more than one . person from the BMW. The scene was described as chaos and mayhem.' She added in the course of the . incident Mr Kyei-Baffour 'suffered two deep wounds the injuries, one . that left the intestines hanging out.' The . prosecution could not say who stabbed Mr Kyei-Baffour, a Ghanaian serving in the Royal Logistics Corps, and causing GBH . charges were dropped during the trial. Judge Joseph told them none were . to be sentenced 'for inflicting or participating in inflicting these . wounds. 'The violent disorder of itself is . not, in light of the Crown's putting its case, to be treated as . involving the stabbing.

Nassif, of Alma Road Enfield who has . convictions for robbery, assault and threatening behaviour when she was . aged 15 and 16, was sentenced to two years behind bars. Judge . Joseph said: 'I am satisfied she was striding into the crowd egging and . encouraging it from the beginning and played a part in the bat being . produced from the boot of the car. 'It was her verbal aggression that . caused the initial confrontation. She has wept her way through this . trial presenting a pitiful spectacle.' Francis, of of Hadrians Ride, Enfield, who has a convictions for knife possession was jailed for 22 months. Sentenced: Colin Mbagwu, 27, (left) was jailed for 27 months for his part in the attack. Streete, (right) was pictured grinning as he left court during the trial. He was later jailed . Marlon Brown, 27, of Tottenham; Leonel Streete, 23, of Wood Green, and Riquelle Peterson, 24, of Holloway; were jailed for two years each while Colin Mbagwu, 27 of Hornsey was jailed for 27 months and Rowan Lopez, 25, of Muswell Hill was jailed for 18 months. Mr Kyei-Baffour has since recovered and returned to active service. Commander Wayne Chance of City of London Police said: 'We will not tolerate this kind of violent behaviour in the City of London. I am pleased that the officers in the case were able to bring it to a swift and satisfying conclusion and would like to highlight the good work done in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police. 'Anyone coming to the City of London with the intention of being violent should know that they will be dealt with so that those wishing to enjoy the vibrant nightlife in the City can do so without fear.'DS John Ellis, who led the investigation said: 'I hope the sentences passed will act a deterrent to those involved.'

A seafood lover who bought an oyster to cure his hangover claims he found a rare pearl inside. James Humphries, 34, bought two fresh oysters from his local fishmongers to help ease a headache caused by too much beer the night before. But after tucking into one of the shellfish he felt a 'lump' in his mouth. James Humphries bought two Pacific oysters from his local fishmonger in Newquay as a hangover cure . The small round pearl is an unusual find because the pearls sold as gems usually come from pearl oysters, not Pacific . Warehouse manager Mr Humphries, of Newquay, Cornwall, thought he'd lost a filling but spat out a round pearl. The find is rare as pearls are normally found in pearl oysters, part of the Pteriiidae family, not the Pacific oysters that he had bought, which belong to the genus Crassostrea. The fishmonger who sold it to him said his family business had never seen a pearl in a Pacific oyster in 80 years of trading. James said: 'I eat a couple of oysters every Saturday morning. They are the perfect hangover cure - refreshing, tasty, and much better than a can of Red Bull. 'I was eating a couple when I noticed a lump of something in my mouth. I thought a filling had fallen out. Mr Humphries with Gareth Horner of E.Rawle and Co fishmongers, where he bought the oysters . The fishmonger where Mr Humphries bought his Pacific oysters said he'd never heard of a pearl being found in one during his 30 years in the business . 'It was only when I spat it out I discovered it was a pearl. It's small but perfectly formed and I absolutely love it. 'I'm thinking of getting it made into a piece of jewellery, possibly a little silver fish with the pearl for its eye.' James . bought his oyster from E Rawle & Co fishmongers in Newquay,which is . run by Gareth Horner after it was founded by his grandfather in 1936. Mr Humphries claimed he found this pearl, with a coin for size comparison, inside a Pacific oyster . Mr Horner said: 'I've been here for 30 years and sold thousands of oysters - but I've never seen a pearl come out of one. 'My dad has been in the business even longer and he's never heard of it either.' Paul Cox of the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth said: 'It's extremely rare for pearls to occur naturally in the wild. 'They are normally formed when a bit of grit gets into the oyster and the oyster forms a pearl by gradually laying down calcium carbonate around it. 'Most of the pearls you see are cultivated or come from pearl oysters. I've never come across anyone who has found a wild pearl before. 'It's extremely unusual and he's a very lucky man.' Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of the gems on sale. Heather Bell of Newquay's Little Gem jewellers said: 'It's difficult to put an exact price on this but given the rarity, it’s a priceless find for James. 'It's very round, its has a wonderful lustre - it's a beautiful pearl.' Last year, scientists from the University of the Algarve and Portugal's Research Institute for Fisheries and Agriculture were stunned to discover pearls in four oysters from the Crassostrea family as they investigated potential viruses killing off oysters along the country's coast. At the time, the university's Professor Deborah Power told the Algarve Resident: 'We don't know whether it is the result of a foreign substance invading the oyster's shell or due to certain changes in the environmental conditions where they were growing.'","James Humphries bought two Pacific oysters from a Newquay fishmonger .

Britain is ‘worryingly underprepared’ for a dramatically ageing population, with 8million people expected to live to more than 100. The National Health Service, care system and public services face major challenges to deal with sharp rises in the number of older people, a Lords committee will warn next month. An inquiry into government plans to cope with more over-65s has been warned by a string of experts about the scale of the challenge, and shortcomings in the UK’s ability to react. Experts warn older people get worse care than younger patients in the NHS . The Lords committee on Public Service and Demographic Change has been repeatedly warned that the Government has ‘not done enough to react to the challenge and ensure public services are organised in a robust and efficient way’. By 2030 there will be 50 per cent more people over-65s, and the number of 85-year-olds will have doubled. Half of babies born after 2007 will live beyond 103, Professor Sarah Harper from the University of Oxford said. ‘The combination of a bulge in our population taking advantage of increases in life expectancy means that I think 8 million people currently will make it to a century,’ she told the committee. ‘One of the things we did at Oxford was do some simple modelling to extrapolate it to Europe, which said there will be 127 million people who are going to make it to 100 throughout the EU.’ Official projections for the number of centenarians in the UK shows the number could reach 550,000 by 2065 . The number of people alive who could expect to see their 100th birthday, by age in 2010 . In 1961 in the UK there were 600 people aged 100 or over.  There are now estimated to be 14,500 centenarians, the committee was told. By 2060 the number could hit 456,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. Life expectation at birth is increasing by more than two months every year, but experts disagree about whether the trend will continue and how old humans could eventually live for. The committee is due to meet tomorrow to discuss its final report. Labour peer Lord Filkin, chairman of the committee, has warned Britain appears unprepared to deal with an ageing population . But speaking before taking evidence from ministers last month, committee chairman Lord Filkin said: ‘Our inquiry is the first by Parliament to assess if our society, our policies and our public services are really ready for ageing. ‘The evidence we have received so far suggests that we are worryingly underprepared. ‘Across diverse areas of public service provision, from health and social care to housing and pension arrangements, witness after witness has told the Committee that the Government have not done enough to react to the challenge and ensure public services are organised in a robust and efficient way.’ The committee has been told that 29 per cent of people admitted to hospital should have been treated elsewhere, adding to costs for the NHS. Lord Filkin warns that such failures will be ‘simply unaffordable’ in the future. NHS officials also warned that older people get worse treatment than younger patients. Professor David Oliver, a consultant physician who is the Department of Health's national clinical director for older people services, said: . 'We know that older people—especially older people with complex needs or frailty—are systematically getting a worse deal than younger people. 'They are getting worse levels of treatment and assessment than younger people.' He added: 'Older people are not a minority.  They are now accounting for the biggest proportion of spending in the NHS, so the idea that they should be disadvantaged is perplexing.'","Experts warn Lords inquiry that not enough is being done to cope with ageing population .

The minister behind controversial plans to expand nursery and childminder places by cutting requirements for staff numbers has admitted she uses a nanny. Liz Truss, the Education Minister, wants to relax current rules which currently limit the number of children a childminder can look after to four. The plans have come under fire from some childcare experts who say they could dilute the quality of care for youngsters. But Miss Truss, who has two daughters, . will not be affected by the planned shake-up because she has hired a . nanny, who she said was ‘expensive’ but ‘an absolute lifesaver’. Yesterday . she explained that she had found it ‘impossible’ to get a full daycare . place in London for her two daughters. Many mothers returning to work . would prefer to leave under-twos with a nanny but the costs, up to . £30,000 a year, are too high. Yet . coalition plans to make childcare more affordable ignore the option of . nannies, focusing solely on nurseries and childminders. In addition, Miss Truss’s proposals . include relaxing the nursery worker to child ratio so that each staff . member can care for up to six two-year-olds. The argument is that childcare costs would come down and nurseries would be able to hire fewer but better qualified staff. Miss Truss, whose daughters are four . and six, said: ‘I feel I’m fortunate compared with a lot of parents in . being able to afford a nanny but, you know, it’s expensive,’ she said. ‘When we’ve looked into trying to find a full daycare place in London it’s just been impossible. You just cannot get one.’ However, . across England, the number of nursery places has almost doubled in the . last decade, according to figures from the Family and Parenting . Institute and Daycare Trust. The number of full-time nursery places in England has grown from 431,600 in 2003 to 721,500 in 2011. New rules: The new limits suggested by Miss Truss would see the allowed number of children per member of staff in nurseries or childminders increase from four to six . Miss . Truss also revealed she had to resort to bringing her children to work . once during a childcare crisis: ‘We had meetings throughout the day and . the girls had to play outside the office while mummy went to ‘boring’ meetings. ‘All of a sudden . one of my daughters bounded into the meeting because she decided she . wanted to say hello, to the shock and surprise of the officials. 'She sat herself on my knee and wriggled whilst we talked. The topic of the meeting - childcare!’ Needed: Elizabeth Truss, pictured with one of her daughters in a buggy, said her nanny is essential . Squeezed families deserved the same service for their children as she gets from her nanny, she said. Miss Truss wants childminders to have better qualifications and training and she wants agencies to cover holidays and sick days. She also wants to make the service more flexible, to make it home based and flexible for people who work irregular hours . Like many working parents, Miss Truss said she was guilty of ‘merging’ home and work life and constantly checking her Blackberry even when she was taking her children to the park. ‘I’m a BlackBerry person. My office get all these random messages at 11 at night because I find that when the children have gone to bed that’s a good time to get things done,’ she said. ‘It’s a merger of home life and work life. They aren’t that separate, I must confess, and my daughters know an awful lot about childcare reform now because of it.’ The Minister has been challenged by childminders and commentators to try looking after four children at once after her announcement on relaxing regulations for staff. In a riposte to her opponents, she said: ‘I’m a parent, not a trained professional. I don’t think being an early-years educator is something anybody can just walk into. It [the criticism] does betray an attitude that some people have that it shouldn’t be a professional career.’ Working women in Britain were getting a raw deal because everything had to be ‘juggled’, she said, but in France childcare was ‘a completely normal part of everyday life. Here we always talk about juggling, like it’s all a bit of a balancing act.’","Education Minister set to relax rules on number of children per minder .

Granddaughter Diana Valentin was horrified by footage from September, which allegedly shows a caregiver 'twisting the arm' of elderly Ana Louisa Medina and 'slamming' the helpless Alzheimer's sufferer into the bed. Nurse's aide Sandra Kerr, 55, has been arrested and charged with endangering the welfare of a physically disabled person. She could face a year in prison. Scroll down for video . Abuse: A Bronx woman was concerned by bruises on her grandmother's head so set up a hidden camera in her nursing home. She says she was shocked by the footage she recorded . The 89-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer had unexplained cuts and bruises on her head that caused her granddaughter to investigate . Valentin had noticed strange bruising on her grandmother's hand and forehead, and was unhappy with the explanations offered by the Gold Crest Care Center nursing home in the Bronx, New York City. 'They were telling me she had gotten the bruising on her hands by banging on the bed railing,' Valentin told ABC7. Valentin was frustrated by the home's reaction to her complaints. 'Everytime I tried to go and complain they said ""We know, it's going to be investigated.""' she recalled to NBC. So the granddaughter hid a camera into a potted plant and recorded more 600 hours of video. Ingenious: Valentin installed a hidden camera in the base of a potted plant and recorded over 600 hours of footage . Accused: Sandra Kerr has been charged with endangering the welfare of a physically disabled person in her care . Returning the favor: Valentin has said she has a strong relationship with her grandmother: 'She basically took care of me. I was very close to her, so now it's my turn to take care of her.' According to Valentin's attorney, footage from September 12, 2012, showed Kerr pushing the elderly woman into the metal railing of the bed. Two days later the nurse's aide allegedly hit Medina twice in the side in the side of her body. 'The first video that I saw, she grabbed my grandmother's arm, twisted it back, lifted her off the bed and slammed her into the bed,' Valentin explained. Kerr has been arrested and charged with three counts of willful violation of the public health law and three counts of endangering the welfare of an incompetent or physically disabled person. She has since been released on her own recognizance. Safe: The grandmother has now been relocated to a different nursing home . The video that Valentin recorded has not yet been released for legal reasons. Medina is now safe, having been relocated to a different nursing home in New Rochelle.

Owners of expensive homes could face a double death duty under plans proposed by Nick Clegg - pictured on the Eastleigh campaign trail . Owners of expensive homes could face a double death duty under plans proposed by Nick Clegg. The Liberal Democrat leader wants to force families to pay a tax of one per cent a year on the value of homes over £2 million. But pensioners who bought their home years ago for a much lower price and who cannot fork out the cash will be able to defer paying the ‘mansion tax’ until after their death. Families could see their estates whittled down as they would pay potentially tens of thousands of pounds on top of inheritance tax at 40 per cent for amounts over £325,000. Anyone with an expensive home who loses their job will also be able to defer paying the tax - but only for two years. Mr Clegg unveiled the policy when speaking to a man with a costly home on the Deputy Prime Minister’s weekly phone-in radio show on London’s LBC 97.3. The caller, who only gave his name as John, said he had bought a home in St Johns Wood, London, two decades ago. The price had ‘skyrocketed’ and it was now worth an ‘obscene’ £5 million, he said but he could not afford the £30,000 a year ‘mansion tax’. ‘I work hard, I earn a reasonable salary. I do not earn as much as Mr Clegg but I’m happy with what I earn, but no way could I afford to buy a house now for anything like £5 million,’ he said. A mansion tax would force him from his home as he could not afford the extra £30,000 a year tax. ‘This would take my total tax rate to 78 per cent. So my only option would be to sell the house that my family and I have lived in for 20 years and to withdraw my children from school.’ But Mr Clegg, who owns a home worth £1.5 million in Putney, south west London, revealed his plans for an inheritance tax blitz. He suggested the caller sold his home or pay the tax on his death. ‘Of course you could make exceptions for those people who have lived in properties for a long period of time and have retired and obviously aren’t in a position to pay that kind of levy every year,’ he said. ‘You could pay it as part of your estate, for instance.’ But Chancellor George Osborne has ruled out adopting the Lib Dem policy of a mansion tax, warning it lead to intrusive revaluations of every home in the country, not just expensive ones . Mr Clegg has defended the policy, however, saying he did not want to ‘clobber’ people who were ‘asset rich but cash poor’, so they would allow them to defer the payment. Mr Clegg also triggered fury when he suggested to the caller that he sells the home ‘because you would be millions of pounds better off because you’ve got a small mortgage from 20 years ago and that is in a sense, pure profit.’ Chancellor George Osborne has ruled out adopting the Lib Dem policy of a mansion tax, warning it lead to intrusive revaluations of every home in the country, not just expensive ones. But the Tories have also been criticised for reneging on their pledge to increase the inheritance threshold to £1 million. This has now been frozen at £325,000 per person until 2019. A source close to Mr Clegg said that he stood by his policy. ‘Nick leads by example, when he sold his Sheffield constituency home he gave the £30,000 profit back to the taxpayer.’ The source said the Conservatives were supportive of the policy. However Labour has said it will introduce a mansion tax if it wins the next election, prompting Mr Clegg to accuse Labour leader Ed Miliband of ‘blatant plagiarism’.","Lib Dem leader  wants families to pay a tax of one per cent a year on the value of homes over £2m .

A man who forgave his girlfriend after she nearly killed him by stabbing him in the back has now been dumped from prison. Gregory Todd, from Hessle, East Yorkshire, spent three months in hospital after Tiffany Baillie, 33, plunged a 12in kitchen knife into his back as he slept. The 49-year-old forgave her for the attack and was planning to marry her after turning up at Hull Crown Court with an engagement ring in April last year. Forgiven: Gregory Todd (left) forgave his girlfriend Tiffany Baillie (right) for stabbing him in the back, but she has now dumped him from prison . The chef however has now had his heart broken after she sent him a letter from prison saying 'it never would have worked out' and that they had been apart for too long, the Sunday People has reported. Mr Todd said: 'I was used like a fool but love is blind and I didn't see it. Tiffany has ruined my life and I will never be the same again. 'She has stabbed me in the back twice.' Baillie was jailed for three years after she admitted GBH with intent. Hurt: Mr Todd had been planning on marrying Baillie before she sent him the letter ending their relationship . Mr Todd wrote an emotional letter to the judge which was read out in court during the hearing. It said: 'She has made a big mistake that she will regret for the rest of her life. Please show compassion and allow her to prove what a valuable member of society she is and a mother to her son. She will have a husband, if you allow us to marry. I promise we won’t let you down.' Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'You must realise what you did could have killed him or caused him long-term serious injury. I will sentence you on the basis he has fully recovered or nearly recovered from the attack. The offence was aggravated by the use of a knife and the fact he was asleep at the time of the stabbing.' Following the marriage proposal, which was relayed by her barrister, Mr Todd had to wait 24 hours to be told it had been accepted in a phonecall from Newhall Prison to his home in Hessle which the couple share.","Gregory Todd spent three months in hospital but still forgave his girlfriend .

The children who survived the Newtown massacre were so traumatized they thought a ‘wild animal’ had torn through their school and killed their classmates. As they emerged from the blood-spattered building, a boy of seven asked a volunteer firefighter if the carnage had been caused by some a beast of some kind, according to a report. When she replied yes - to shield him from the full horror -  the children began a chilling whisper amongst themselves which went: ‘A wild animal, a wild animal, a wild animal.’ Reunited: A woman carries a boy from Sandy Hook Elementary out of the firehouse staging area for families following the shooting. Some of the children that survived believed a 'wild animal' had caused the carnage at their school . Trauma: A police officer leads two women and a child from Sandy Hook Elementary, shortly after Adam Lanza opened fire, killing 26 people, including 20 children . The disclosure shows how the dozens of children who were inside the building tried to make sense of what was going on in a way they understood. They had been told to close their eyes as they were led out of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, after the rampage on December 14 last year. Had they not done so they would have seen the bodies of 20 of their classmates and six of their teachers, plus that of gunman Adam Lanza, 20. According to an article in the New Yorker magazine, Shannon Hicks, a reporter and photographer with local paper the Newtown Bee and a volunteer firefighter, spoke to one seven-year-old shortly afterwards. She was on her way to the firehouse, which is 350 yards from the school and where the survivors were taken, when the boy asked her a question. Disbelief: First-grader Henry Terifay and his sister, fourth-grader Kelly Terifay, wait outside Sandy Hook Elementary School after the massacre . Horror: Parents pick-up their children outside Sandy Hook Elementary School after the shootings in December . The New Yorker article reads: ‘He asked her if there had been a wild animal in the building. ‘Yes honey’, she said. As the boy’s class continued to the firehouse she heard the children whispering to each other down the line 'a wild animal, a wild animal, a wild animal.’ The article also reveals that police initially thought that there could be up to 60 victims and tells of the moment that parents realized their children were among the victims. Mums and dads had been asked to come to the firehouse but as the number of children left to be claimed got fewer and fewer it felt like the ‘room was filling up with some kind of gas’, said John Voket, another reporter with the Newtown Bee. When one mother realized that her child would not be coming back, a rabbi who was in the firehouse stood by her asking her to breathe. He said: ‘My focus was cardiac arrest. I didn’t want the physiological reaction to kill her.’ Terror: A child reacts to police and fireman staged nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School in December . The pupils of Sandy Hook Elementary have not gone back to their classrooms since the tragedy and are being educated at the Chalk Hill Middle School in Monroe which was reopened to accommodate them. The fate of Sandy Hook itself is still being decided by a council board in Newtown which could choose to demolish it. At two hearings earlier this year the majority of residents said it should be razed to the ground with one parent saying: ‘That ground is sacred now.’ Shock: A father is reunited with his daughter .","Seven-year-old survivor of Sandy Hook shootings asked volunteer firefighter if the brutal scenes had been caused by a beast of some kind .
