"Father-of-one Christopher Foster was stabbed to death in a case of mistaken identity outside a pub in south London last year . An innocent father was stabbed to death outside a London pub after a gang targeted him by mistake in a revenge attack. City porter Christopher Foster, 34, was stabbed in the back as he smoked a cigarette with a friend outside a pub in Borough High Street, south London on November 29 last year. Mr Foster, who has a four-year-old daughter, suffered catastrophic internal injuries and died an hour after the attack at the St Christopher's Inn. The man who led the gang, Aytach Lisani, 33, has previously pleaded guilty to murdering the father-of-one and faces life behind bars. Three more men - Rocky Djelal, 34, Billy Dove, 30, Ali Lisani, 38, of south east London - admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm after murder charges against them were dropped mid-trial at the Old Bailey. Two more defendants were cleared today of the GBH plot. The court had heard Aytach Lisani had mistaken Mr Foster for another man, Harry Saunders, who was drinking in the same bar and had allegedly slashed the face of a friend, Aydin Salih, months earlier. Prosecutor David Fisher told the jury: 'On the evening of Friday November 29 last year Christopher Foster was standing with his friend Danny Murphy outside Saint Christopher's Inn on Borough High Street. 'They were having a last drink outside as were a number of people. The atmosphere in the alleyway was good but it was interrupted by a group of approximately seven men and a man named Aydin Salih. 'Faces obscured by hoods and scarves, their conduct was menacing, some were carrying bats and at least one knife. 'Christopher Foster had his back to the advancing group until at the last moment he turned. 'Danny Murphy believed there would be trouble but had no idea why. They decided to go back inside the pub but before they could do so Christopher Foster was stabbed once to the left side of his back, most probably from behind. Guilty: Left, Aytach Lisani, who led the gang, previously admitted murdering Mr Foster and faces life behind bars, and right, Rocky Djelal, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause GBH part way through the trial . Left, Ali Lisani, and right, Billy Dove, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit GBH after murder charges were dropped . 'Both men managed to enter the pub but Mr Foster had been seriously injured and collapsed.' He died in hospital an hour and a half later. The prosecutor told the jury: 'Christopher Foster had not said or done anything at all that could begin to explain why he was stabbed and you may conclude that he was wrongly believed by a number of these defendants to be a man called Harry Saunders who was in the same area as Mr Foster and had just weeks earlier apparently slashed the face of Aydin Salih.' Salih was the cousin of Aytach Lisani, of south east London, and an associate of others in the group, the court heard. Mr Fisher went on: 'This was therefore a revenge attack on a man believed to be Harry Saunders but who was in fact a totally innocent man and a stranger to most of the defendants, if not all of them.' The attack stemmed from an incident on September 20 last year when Salih, who is in Cyprus, was treated at St Thomas's Hospital for a serious facial injury which needed stitches, the court heard. But he refused to co-operate with police or substantiate the fact that he had been attacked. Instead, phone records showed that he contacted Aytach Lisani who in turn phoned his brother Ali Lisani, jurors were told. Meanwhile, Harry Saunders was in custody between October 9 and 25 last year, the court heard. But Ricky Huggins, 29, of south east London, and Mohmmed Aalamani, 28, of east London denied the offence and were cleared today. Michael Gore, 55, and Joanna Stevens, 33, of south east London, were also found not guilty of perverting the course of justice. CCTV footage shows the gang  approaching the pub in Borough, south London where Mr Foster, 34, was killed . Mr Foster was stabbed outside the St Christopher's Inn pub, pictured, where he was smoking a cigarette . The Old Bailey public gallery erupted in cheers as Huggins, a jobbing actor who had been due to appear as an extra in Our Kind of Traitor, starring Ewan McGregor, was cleared with property consultant Aalamani. The actor had told the court: ‘It was nothing to do with me. I didn’t want to get involved.’ He admitted he was at the scene and was asked to see if he could spot Mr Saunders in the pub. ‘I didn’t know what he looked like so I knew I wouldn’t be able to see him,’ said Huggins. He refused when he was asked to go into the pub and was crossing the road as the stabbing happened. ‘I didn’t know an attack was going to take place,’ Huggins insisted. ‘I wasn’t involved.’ Huggins said he was on his way home when he later saw the group chasing Mr Saunders, but did not know what was happening. ‘I was confused as to why people were running,’ he told the court. Flowers were left at the scene in tribute to the father-of-one, who was targeted in a revenge attack gone wrong . Aalamani also admitted he was at the scene but insisted he only realised an attack was planned when he heard the cry, ‘get him, get him, get him’. He said he wanted to go to the police after the attack but was too frightened because murder suspect Aydin Salih, who is believed to be hiding in Cyprus, threatened to kill him. He added that Salih was ‘pleading’ with him not to contact the police and said he wanted to speak to his solicitor. ‘I was adamant I was going to go to the police,’ he told the jury. ‘He was threatening me, he said don’t be a f*cking idiot and was threatening me.’ He added: ‘I was in an awkward position, I was in the worst position to be in. ‘I knew something but I couldn’t go to the police. ‘I was really scared, really scared.’ ‘I was scared of anything that could happen from him, from his side, it could be his cousins or his friends. ‘Just because he is out of the way doesn’t mean that no one could get me. ‘I tried to do as much as I could.’ Aalamani denied he was being part of the gang who attacked Mr Foster. Two other defendants, Joanna Stevens, 33, and Michael Gore, 54, were also cleared of helping Huggins and Aydin Salih escape from the scene. Mr Foster worked for six years as a facilities assistant at international law firm Pinsent Masons. Sentencing will take place at the Old Bailey on a date to be fixed.","Christopher Foster, 34, was killed in a case of mistaken identity last year .

"Good Guys founder Andrew Muir and his wife have purchased a very sought after historically significant home . These amazing snaps show off the magnificent views of a special home which has been snapped up by Good Guys founder Andrew Muir and his wife Emma for a cool $19million. It is called Baillieu House and it is on Point Nepean Road on the Mornington Peninsula in Sorrento, Victoria and was built in 1958. The Guilford Bell-designed home was listed as one of the top 10 Victorian dwellings featured in Neil Clerehan's book Best Australian Houses in 1961, reports Property Observer. The home was considered in the Survey of Post-War Built Heritage in Victoria in 2010 and it was decided that any house included in the study should automatically qualify. Property Observer reports the Melbourne home was selected because of its 'cutting-edge residential design of the day'. Views from the beach front home are simply spectacular and the home boasts an outdoor seating area perfect for entertaining family and friends on a summers night. The Sorrento home, who it is named after, was sold by Antony Baillieu when his wife Elizabeth died in early 2007. Simply stunning: Andrew Muir and his wife Emma will now be able to have breakfast out sitting out on the grass looking at the ocean . The seaside home has the perfect combination for wowing guests and entertaining with this outside seating area . The Guilford Bell designed Baillieu House is in Sorrento, Victoria, an hour south of Melbourne .

Keeping it cosy: The beach-side home has a bit for everyone with a coal fire for when the temperatures drop . The site says that the area has more than 60 retailers including restaurants, fashion shops, galleries and beauty centres. Sorrento is also believed to be the 'first European settlement in Victoria' which was discovered in 1803. The site says that the area was later developed as a 'tourist destination for the rich and famous' by George Coppin from the 1870’s onwards. Mr Muir's father Ian built The Good Guys franchise from a single shop in Melbourne suburb Essendon in 1952. The picturesque home is beautiful inside and out and will be a very comfortable home for the Muir family . The two storey house has lots of outside and indoor space . With the house set at on the ocean for the best vies the rest of the plot gives the new owners lots of extra outside green space .

"An MMA fighter accused of savagely beating his porn star ex-girlfriend has returned to social media with a series of bizarre and self-pitying poems. Christy Mack was allegedly beaten by her ex Jonathan Koppenhaver - who legally changed his name to 'War Machine' - and sustained a blowout fracture to her left eye, had her nose broken in two places, smashed teeth and internal injuries including a lacerated liver. 'Rose are red / I found a man in our bed / Than to deserve this.../ I'd rather be dead,' War Machine tweeted Friday in the opening lines of a the first poem. War Machine has spent his time behind bars composing verse claiming he was victimized leading up to the alleged incident in which he beat he severely beat his ex-girlfriend . No Wordsworth: War Machine's return to social media read as self-pitying verse as he awaits trial for beating porn star Christy Mack . In a second poem posted later that day he wrote: 'Pain! / On the inside / Pain! /  I wish it were outside/ . The poems follow his Thursday return tweet following two months of silence, in which he quoted Nietzsche. 'It is terrible to die of thirst in the ocean,' he quoted the philosopher. 'Must you salt your truth so heavily that it no longer even quenches thirst?' Deadspin reports that War Machine is due back in court for an Oct. 17 preliminary hearing and remains in jail. Mack is still in an ongoing and painful recovery process. Miss Mack said she escaped the August 8 attack by running naked out of her back door, climbed the fence and began banging on her neighbor's doors in Las Vegas for help. Scroll down for video . Porn star Christy Mack posted this photo on social media on Saturday to show the progress of her recovery after she was attacked on August 8 by her ex-boyfriend, an MMA fighter . Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, appeared in court this month in Las Vegas. Koppenhaver was arraigned on battery, lewdness, assault and coercion charges in the August 8 attack on Christy Mack and her male friend at a Las Vegas home, but prosecutors charged him with additional felonies including kidnapping and assault . The four-frame picture, posted on Twitter and Instagram, shows Miss Mack two days, two weeks and four weeks after the attack. The last picture is the porn star attending a charity ball for domestic abuse victims on Saturday, smiling and wearing a glamorous dress and flamboyant fascinator. She wrote: '2 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and last night. I’ve had several dentist visits to make eating more comfortable and make my smile look more normal. 'I still have a few more dental visits to go. I’ve had my eyes checked out and made aware that I’m very lucky to have my vision where it is, since the muscle is tethered by the fragments from the blowout fracture in my left eye. 'My multiple nose fractures will be fixed in the next couple of months.' Miss Mack went on to say that doctors told her she will regain movement in her top lip in the next six months and her liver appeared to be healing without surgery. She said that the swelling in her face was slowly going down and she was getting used to the changes in her appearance. She has lost 15lb during her recovery and cut off what was left of her long hair after Koppenhaver took a knife to her locks during the attack. Miss Mack posted the shocking pictures of her bruised and swollen face online just three days after the attack in August . The mixed martial arts fighter known as 'War Machine' pleaded 'not guilty' on September 3 to 32 felony charges including attempted murder in a Las Vegas courtroom. Prosecutors, who originally charged  Koppenhaven with nine felony counts in connection with the beating of his ex-girlfriend, added about two dozen more charges that stretch back to May 2013. The new charges include allegations of burglary, first-degree kidnapping, coercion and sexual assault. Justice of the Peace Melanie Tobiasson ordered Koppenhaven held without bail, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The 32-year-old MMA fighter was arrested in a hotel room in a Los Angeles suburb on August 15, one week after allegedly beating Miss Mack so severely she feared for her life. Ms Mack, 23, told police that the 'War Machine' on August 8 showed up unannounced at her house where she and friend, Corey Thomas, were sleeping. Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Koppenhaver after Ms Mack (pictured when the couple were together) posted the graphic photos of her injuries online on August 11 . She said Koppenhaver began beating Thomas, before sending him away with the threat that he would have friends kill him if he reported the assault. Ms Mack told Las Vegas police that the fighter then turned his attention to her and started attacking her, as he scrolled through her text messages. According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver. Ms Mack said she escaped, naked, out of a back door when the fighter went to the kitchen, where she thought he was fetching a knife. She later posted a statement online that she feared for her life when Koppenhaver allegedly sawed off her hair with a dull knife. She wrote: 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning (August 8), Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego. 'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me. Face Forward hosts star-studded gala supporting victims of domestic abuse at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, Calfornia on Saturday. Christy Mack attended in a glamorous dress and hat . 'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating. 'My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in two places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.' Ms Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth. She also said she could not walk on her own, and had a fractured rib and ruptured liver from a kick to her side. 'I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen,' she wrote. 'He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife. 'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. 'He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts.' Ms Mack also alleged her ex-boyfriend threatened to rape her. 'He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard. After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.' Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife. 'I ran out my back door, shutting it behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house. 'Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought to the hospital and treated for my injuries.' Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she dealt with beatings and infidelity in the past. After she put the graphic images online on August 11, the authorities issued a warrant for Koppenhaver and he became the subject of a manhunt. The welterweight fighter made his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut in 2007. He legally changed his name in 2008. He lost his only pay-per-view bout that same year. He fought out of San Diego for a variety of promotions and had a 14-5 record as a welterweight. He lost his last fight, in Iowa, last October.","MMA fighter Jonathan Koppenhaver - who legally changed his name to War Machine -has posted a several lines of verse to Twitter defending himself .

"Matthew O'Donnell was unaware a flea had buried into his foot after working  in Tanzania (pictured) A backpacker was left horrified after a flea and hundreds of eggs burst out of his foot following a trip to Tanzania. Geography graduate Matthew O’Donnell, 22, was unaware a tiny chigoe flea had burrowed into his flesh and was feeding off his blood until weeks later when he had flown back to Britain. He was sitting on his bed at home in East Sussex when he felt a tingling sensation and suddenly the black bug burst through his skin and onto his bedclothes – followed by hundreds of tiny eggs. Mr O’Donnell had spent the summer working as a volunteer in rural Tanzania after completing his studies at Plymouth University and returned at the beginning of September. He had been warned about the chigoe – or jigger flea as it is known locally – but had no idea he had been carrying one in his foot. He said: ‘I looked down to see a lump and thought “What on earth is that?” ‘A tiny black bug dropped out, followed by 100 little white eggs tumbling after it. ‘I had an idea of what it was because while I was out there one of my friends also got it in one of her toenails.’ He added: ‘This type of tic lives in the sand over there, so if you’re walking around in flip flops it burrows into your skin. ‘It seems this insect used me as a free ticket back to Tanzania only to pop out a month later.’ Mr O’Donnell has been left with a small crater close to his little toe where the bug was nesting but doctors have given him the all clear. The chigoe flea is the smallest flea known to man at just 1mm and is usually extremely hard to spot. The parasitic arthropod is found in most tropical and sub-tropical climates and males feed on warm-blooded hosts, such as humans, cattle, sheep, dogs and mice and return to the sand. However females burrow head-first into the host’s skin and lay dozens of eggs, leaving just the tip of their abdomen exposed. The small hole where the flea had been living with its hundreds of tiny eggs. They came tumbling out this week . A diagram of a pregnant female chigoe flea, similar to the one that buried itself into Mr O'Donnell's foot . When the eggs hatch they tumble out of the abdomen while the flea dies. Matthew added: ‘I wasn’t expecting all the eggs to come out of my foot. I wrapped it all in toilet paper and flushed it down pretty quickly. ‘I thought if they are going to hatch I would rather not see. The tic was proper fat, so I got rid of that pretty quickly too. Mr O'Donnell, pictured right while in Tanzania, has been given the all clear by doctors after the flea burst out of his foot (right) ‘It wasn’t painful, it was like a tingling sensation. It’s fine now, it has left like a crater sort of shape in my foot.’ He added: ‘It was pretty creepy. I’ve basically acted as a walking incubator for a month without knowing or giving my permission. ‘I wasn’t sure whether to laugh at the situation or run into my kitchen hysterically shouting at 3am to cut my foot off with a carving knife.’ He had spent the summer volunteering in East Africa after completing his studies at Plymouth University .","Matthew O'Donnell was unaware a chigoe flea had burrowed into his skin .

"Just a year from today, Beth Whaanga went under the knife during a life-changing surgery. It was a confronting and traumatic moment when the 33-year-old saw her own reflection for the first time. Refusing to hide her body, she asked her friend Nadia Masot to photograph her scars to illustrate the devastation of her cancer surgery. But when the images went viral, the critical reaction is what inspired both Queenslanders to do more. Scroll down for video . Beth Whaagan made headlines in February when she bared all to illustrate the devastation of her cancer surgery . Her intimate photos went viral and received worldwide attention and criticism. Many found the images 'offensive' Jillian (pictured) is among the 50 contributors for the Under the Red Dress project led by Mrs Whaanga and photographer Nadia Masot . Jillian, who's from the Gold Coast, underwent a total bilateral mastectomy as she has metastatic breast cancer . 'I wanted those photos taken because I wanted to finally be comfortable in my own skin,' Mrs Whaanga told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was a traumatic change but I trusted Nadia completely to take a photo that will help my own healing process.' The mother-of-four shared her intimate images to a selected number of friends on Facebook but was shocked to find that she was later 'unfriended' by more than 100 users. The images were reported to Facebook administrators multiple times, some complaining that they found the nude photos of Mrs Whaanga 'offensive'. Despite the worldwide backlash, Mrs Whaanga doesn't regret sharing her images and is in fact working on a project inspired by the whole ordeal. She and Ms Masot, 36, have been working together once again - this time photographing others with a similar story. Beth (left), from the US, had a total bilateral mastectomy with an superior gluteal artery perforator reconstruction (fat removed from her buttocks and implanted into her breasts). Cherie, from New Zealand, had a colectomy with a pouch reconstruction of her bowels . Sue, of Brisbane, participated in the Under the Red Dress campaign and showed her scars from a prophylactic total bilateral mastectomy . Yasmin, also from Brisbane, was photographed after her prophylactic total bilateral bastectomy . The Under the Red Dress project has about 50 others who like Mrs Whaanga bare their scars of cancer surgery. 'Basically we wanted to show that cancer isn't just about glitter, galas, fun runs or pink ribbons,' Mrs Whaanga said. 'It's real and this is people's lives we're talking about. They go through horrible things and it also puts an emotional strain on their families. 'It's hard and scary.' Mrs Whaanga, who's now an ambassador for the Cancer Council in Queensland, underwent her double mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery on November 8 last year. 'When we found out that I had four lumps in my right breast it was a daunting and it's still hard for me to talk about the whole experience,' she said. 'But  I would do it again in a heartbeat. I have an obligation to my family and my kids so I know that I've done the right thing. 'The scars are now part of my body and it's a reminder to me of how lucky I am.' Mrs Whaanga says her scars also keep her on track of her goals of raising awareness for cancer research. And this time, her husband has also jumped on board the initiative. The 33-year-old says she doesn't regret sharing the photos and hopes it encourages others to accept their scars . The Queenslander is now working on a project to help others with a similar story to share their experience . Maui, 33, is ready to give up his beloved dreadlocks of three years to raise funds that will help his wife complete her book of photographs for Under the Red Dress. He will be losing the dreads at the end of the month. 'I'm so proud of my husband because I know how much he loves his dreadlocks,' Mrs Whaanga said. 'They're part of his image and persona and it's a big sacrifice for him to make. 'But cancer doesn't discriminate and we hope we can finish this book so that people can look at the photos and realise what cancer can do to people's body and their lives.' The project includes contributors worldwide, the youngest being the age of 16. Mrs Whaanga (left) with her friend and photographer Nadia Masot (right), who are both passionate advocates for cancer research . Mrs Whaanga and her husband Maui, 33, who will be cutting off his dreadlocks to raise funds for her Under the Red Dress project . Ms Masot says each individual has been photographed in a similar concept to Mrs Whaanga's images. 'The book aims to compare and contrast images of each person with what the world sees and what has happened behind the scenes in their life and to their bodies,' Ms Masot told Daily Mail Australia. 'Under the Red Dress allows us to help people bare their grevious bodily scars of cancer and to help them find self acceptance, assist in the anti-body-shaming revolution and banish disease taboos.' While the project is still in the works, Ms Masot says the experience so far has been humbling. 'I myself haven't had cancer but through this project I've come to realise that my trials are so trivial and it really puts things into perspective,' she said. 'At the end of the day, we just want people to accept their scars because they're okay and it just means that you're alive.'","Beth Whaanga underwent a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction last November .

"A Tory MP caused a Twitter storm today after claiming that Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli had turned up at the House of Commons to listen in on a Government drug debate. Guy Opperman was so sure he had spotted the famous footballer that he breathlessly tweeted his 5,000 followers: 'Mario Balotelli has popped in to Commons gallery'. The tweet, sent during a debate on the merits of decriminalisation, added that he was donning 'a sharp suit, pink shirt and a poppy'. A Tory MP caused a storm today when  he claimed that Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli (right) turned up for a Government drug debate in the House of Commons. It turned out to be 55-year-old dancer Ken Hinds (left) Guy Opperman was so sure he'd spotted the famous footballer that he breathlessly tweeted his 5,000 followers: 'Mario Balotelli has popped in to Commons gallery' The apparent sighting sparked excitement in Parliament, with members of the press craning their necks to catch a glimpse of the Italian player. But they soon realised Mr Opperman was mistaken - and the man was actually a 55-year-old with a similar Balotelli-style mohawk. The man in question was later revealed to be Ken Hinds, a dancer and activist who has worked as a mediator for Scotland Yard. After the initial tweet, journalist David Wooding said: 'Balotelli lookalike in the public gallery for the drugs law debate. Some MPs think it's actually the Liverpool striker! (Why always him?)' The former Manchester City star had the words 'Why always me?' printed on his shirts, after a series of headlines about his bizarre behaviour. And Press Association's Arj Singh commented: 'Definitely not Balotelli... Mohawk is too thin and old Mario will be training. Just been to see for myself.' The apparent recognition sparked excitement in the house, with members of the press craning their necks to see whether the spot was genuine . Reporters soon worked out the man was not in fact Balotelli but Ken Hinds, 55, an activist and dancer . After the confusion was settled, Mr Hinds explained how several MPs had asked him if he was Balotelli - but that he had to 'disappoint them and say no'. He told The Telegraph: 'I was sitting down watching the debate and I was approached by a number of MPs asking me if I was Balotelli. 'I had to disappoint them and say no - but he is a great man and I am only privileged to associated with man like that.'","Guy Opperman tweeted that the Liverpool striker was sat in public gallery .

"A friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on Tuesday of lying during the investigation into the 2013 attack and now faces up to 16 years in prison. Robel Phillipos, 21, was charged with lying about having visited suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room three days after the attack, which killed three people and injured more than 260. Phillipos was with two other friends who removed a backpack containing fireworks and other potential evidence three days after the bombing while an intense manhunt was underway for the suspected bombers. FBI agents testified that Phillipos told them a string of lies about the night of April 18, 2013, before finally acknowledging he had been in Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth with the two men who removed Tsarnaev's backpack and computer. Scroll Down for Video . Convicted: Robel Phillipos, (center), departs federal court with defense attorney Derege Demissie, (left), after he was convicted in Boston Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2014 on two counts of lying about being in the dorm room of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev three days after the bombing in 2013 . 'This is a kid that was likely in the wrong place at the wrong time and didn't do a very good job of choosing his friends,' said Boston College law professor Robert Bloom to WCVB. Phillipos' lawyers said he was a frightened 19-year-old who was intimidated by the FBI and too high on marijuana to clearly remember what he did that night. The defense called several friends who said Phillipos smoked marijuana a half-dozen times that day. The defense also called former Massachusetts governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to testify for Phillipos. Dukakis, an old family friend of Phillipos' mother, described a phone conversation he had with Phillipos five days after the bombings. Dukakis said Phillipos told him he had been questioned by the FBI for five hours, but was so confused he didn't remember what he said. Terror attack: The April 15 bombings killed three people and injured almost 300 other people at the finishing line of the Boston marathon in 2013 . The defense also claimed that Phillipos' confession was coerced by FBI agents. Refuting this, the Assistant US Attorney Stephanie Siegmann told the court that Phillipos lied again and again about the night of April 18, 2013. She said it was inconceivable he could not remember according to WCVB. 'First, ladies and gentlemen, there are some events that are so profound, so significant, that you cannot possibly forget them,' said Siegmann to the jurors during closing arguments. Accused: Dzhokahr Tsarnaev is accused of planning and carrying out the bombings along with his brother, Tamerlan . 'Would you ever conceivably forget that you went to the dorm room of someone that you believe murdered three people and maimed hundreds of others?' Phillipos' attorney, Derege Desmissie, said that this was plainly not fair or true, . He called his client a 'kid' and said that he spent the night in Tsarnaev's dorm room simply watching television that night. Desmissie said that Phillipos did not remove the backpack or fireworks and did not see anyone else remove them either. 'This criminal mastermind brought his cellphone and did not delete anything related to going to Dzhokhar's room and handed the phone to the agent,' Demissie said according to WCVB. 'It's consistent with a kid who has nothing to hide.' Phillipos attended high school in Cambridge with Tsarnaev. In August, one friend Dias Kadyrbayev admitted in U.S. District Court on Thursday that he removed a backpack containing emptied-out fireworks from Tsarnaev's dorm room several days after the 2013 attack that killed three people and injured more than 260 others. Under the plea agreement, federal prosecutors said they would ask for no more than seven years in federal prisons for the 20-year-old Kadyrbayev. His lawyer still could seek a lighter sentence.And also in July, Azamat Tazhayakov, 20, was found guilty of being part of the same conspiracy. Friends: Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev (pictured with friend and Boston bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev before the terror attacks) They both removed Tsarnaev's backpack and were convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice . Surprising testimony: During the trial, the defense was bolstered by evidence given by former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis (seen here with Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley on Sunday) Phillipos apparently showed no emotion when he was found guilty and his sentencing is scheduled for January 29. Phillipos will not be taken into custody before this and will return home with the GPS tracker he has worn since his arrest. The two friends who removed Tsarnaev's backpack were both convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Tsarnaev is awaiting trial in the bombings. He has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and could face the death penalty if convicted.","Robel Phillipos, 21, convicted of two counts of lying to FBI investigators .

"Luis Suarez's lawyer has condemned FIFA's punishment of the Uruguay striker for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini as 'draconian, totalitarian and fascist', and said an appeal will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Speaking just before Barcelona and Liverpool confirmed reaching an agreement for the transfer of Suarez to the Catalan club, Alejandro Balbi reacted angrily to FIFA's announcement on Thursday that an initial appeal from both Suarez and the Uruguayan Football Federation (AUF) had been rejected. Suarez had appealed against FIFA's sanctions, which include a ban on 'all football-related activities' for four months, a nine-match ban from international football, as well as a fine of 100,000 Swiss francs (£66,000). Decision maker: Claudio Sulser said the incident 'could not be tolerated on any football pitch' Chomping at the bit: Luis Suarez appears bites Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 1-0 win against Italy . Ouch: Chiellini attempts to show the bite marks to referee Marco Rodriguez . Bite night! Luis Suarez holds his teeth after the biting incident during the World Cup against Giorgio Chiellini . Not fooling anyone: Suarez holds his teeth after sinking them into the shoulder of Giorgio Chiellini . Thumbs up: Luis Suarez has signed for Barcelona in a £75m move from Liverpool . VIDEO Suarez appeal rejected . The ban prohibits Suarez from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. In an interview with Spanish radio station Cope, Suarez's lawyer Alejandro Balbi hit out at football's global organising body and confirmed an appeal would go forward in an attempt to see the ban reduced. 'We hope they revoke this sanction that is blatantly draconian, totalitarian and fascist,' said Balbi. 'The right of a footballer to work is being violated, and football should be worried about that. The nine (international) games may seem excessive, but the fact that he can't watch a game of football, or train or carry out his job, we are talking about unpleasant things.' Although Suarez initially denied biting Chiellini, claiming in his defence that he 'lost balance' and 'hit my face against the player', he later issued a public apology to the Juventus defender, who in turn accepted the apology and said the ban imposed on Suarez was excessive. Step 1: Suarez approaches Chiellini from behind during a Uruguay attack . Stage 2: The Liverpool striker moves his head close to Chiellini's shoulder as he prepares to attack . Stage 3: Suarez appears to clamp his jaws down and bite Chiellini's shoulder . However, neither Suarez nor Chiellini's latest responses could persuade FIFA to alter its stance. 'Luis recognised his error but we've seen that for FIFA saying sorry is not an important factor,' added Balbi. 'Justice will take its time but it will come. 'We knew that FIFA would uphold the ban because they are corporatists. We will not stop, we are going to go to the CAS and we will keep taking the juridical path that is available to us.' If Suarez does to go CAS, he could ask the court to suspend the ban pending a final decision. CAS may refuse to do so but, if it agrees, it could mean Suarez being available at the start of the domestic season. The downside, however, is that if CAS puts the ban on hold, it means that, instead of Suarez being banned for a month of the close season when no clubs are playing, he would instead face being out for even longer when the campaign starts.","Suarez banned for four months and nine matches after biting Giorgio Chiellini last month .

"A massive surge in immigration is driving the need for at least 42,000 new homes a year to be built in London, a report warned yesterday. A damning dossier accused London Mayor Boris Johnson of ‘entirely misrepresenting’ the reason for the capital’s relentlessly rising population – a trend which will lead to unprecedented housing development. But a predicted increase of a million foreigners over the next 15 years must be matched by the same number of  Londoners being ‘driven’ out of the metropolis, or the ambitious target will be doomed to failure because there will still be too few homes, it warned. Migrationwatch UK, the immigration think-tank which published the report, said it was ‘sheer nonsense’ for the Greater London Authority’s to claim that the predicted population boom would be caused by natural growth from the city’s ‘youthful population’. Scroll down for video . A migrant camp in Calais, France. The coastal town is a hub for many trying to make their way into Britain . Between 1991 and 2011, the UK-born population of London was static at 5.2million while foreign-born residents doubled to 3million – a total population of around 8.2million. It is projected to increase to 10million by 2029, overwhelmingly driven by the arrival of 1.1million immigrants and births to existing and future foreign families, says the report. In 2012, only one-third of births were to parents who were both UK-born, it said. Migrationwatch UK said this would place further huge demand on the city’s housing stock, which is already struggling to cope with its rapidly swelling population. Housing supply has not kept pace with the number of residents living in London meaning waiting lists for social housing have doubled since 2000, private rents soared to more than £1,400 a month and property prices soared to an average price of £514,000 – around nine-times median earnings. Critics have recently said the cost of buying or renting a property in the capital is being pushed ‘beyond the boundary’ of what is affordable. To tackle the problem, Mr Johnson has pledged to double the number of homes being built to 42,000, by freeing up brownfield sites, converting existing properties into flats or building on the green belt. But in its 20-page report, ‘The Demand For Housing In London’, Migrationwatch UK said the target was ‘optimistic’. A new report has accused London Mayor Boris Johnson (pictured) of misrepresenting the reason for the capital's rising population . Achieving this number was dependent on around 1million Londoners leaving the capital for other parts of the country. Many are middle-class families who are pushed out because they cannot afford a house in London and can find cheaper homes in other places with better schools, hospitals and transport, and less crime. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migrationwatch UK, said: ‘London’s huge population increase in the last two decades has been driven solely by immigration and the same will apply over the next 15 years. ‘City Hall has been less than frank about what is going on. The general public have no idea of the extent to which immigration is driving the city’s housing crisis and causing Londoners to leave. Sir Andrew Green (pictured), chairman of Migrationwatch UK, said London's huge population increases have been driven solely by immigration . ‘The business lobby seem to have a lofty disregard for the lives of ordinary Londoners. It is ludicrous for them to suggest that London needs immigrants on anything like the present scale. ‘The inevitable effect is massive pressure on schools and hospitals and, especially, on housing. London needs skilled migration, not mass migration.’ He added: ‘Those who promote the idea of an international city effectively free of constraints on immigration seem to be blind to the implications for the existing population of London. ‘They should be clear that the result will be more Londoners forced to leave the city and find somewhere else to live. Are they content with that outcome?’ Concerns about the impact of migration have increased since Tony Blair introduced an effectively open-door immigration policy after the 1997 election, affecting the social make-up of cities, unemployment and pressure on housing and services. Net migration remains stubbornly high at more than 200,000 a year, mainly due to EU immigration. Critics have warned it means David Cameron's promise to reduce net migration to tens of thousands, the levels of the 1990s, will be virtually impossible to achieve. In a joint statement, Labour MP Frank Field and Tory grandee Sir Nicholas Soames MP, who co-chair the cross-party group Balanced Migration, said: ‘Just as the Scottish referendum has blown open the British constitution, so has this latest report on housing needs blown open the debate on immigration. The report shows London’s housing stock is creaking.’","A predicted increase of a million foreigners must be matched by new builds .

"Spectacles for horses, a bicycle railway and a steam-powered man that can pull carts filled with people. These are just some of the wacky inventions that were designed by innovative Victorians looking to make the next big technological breakthrough. They are documented in a series of black-and-white illustrations that were uncovered by Caroline Rochford, an author and family historian from Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Bizarre breakthroughs: The steam man, left, was invented by a Canadian professor  in 1893 to pull wagons filled with people. The sunshade, right, was designed in 1885 for British soldiers fighting in the Sudanese desert . Future of commuting? Those using the bicycle railway, pictured, pedaled on an inverted bike that rode along a single track on top of a wooden fence. Plans for the innovative network were scrapped after five years . Mrs Rochford came across the images in a collection of rare magazines from the late 1880s while carrying out research for the genealogy company she runs with her husband, Michael. She said: 'The volume was packed with articles about everyday life in Victorian times, and as soon as I saw the illustrations of the latest inventions of the day, I was hooked. 'I loved their charm and quaintness, as well as the diversity of technology, from an automatic egg-boiling machine, which was no doubt the Victorian housewife's dream, to a steamship made out of paper!' Diagrams of hundreds of long-forgotten inventions are published alongside insights into Victorian life in Mrs Rochford's book, Great Victorian Inventions: Novel Contrivances & Industrial Revolutions. One striking illustration taken from the book shows the steam-powered man, which was invented in about 1893 by a Canadian professor named George Moore. Professor Moore dreamed that all tasks would one day be carried out by robots and set about building a mechanical man, made of steel and tin and powered entirely by steam, that would pull a wagon filled with commuters through city streets. Seeing things more clearly: Mr Dolland, from the opticians Dolland & Aitchison, developed a set of bi-focal spectacles for horses, shown in the photograph, in order that the animal might see distant objects more clearly . The futuristic figure was said to have stood six feet tall and could walk at a brisk pace of five miles an hour. The trunk of the figure, which looked like a knight in armour, contained the furnace, boiler and engine, and the limbs the mechanisms for walking. It is not known what became of the steam man. While Professor Moore's endeavours in early robotics amounted to a quirky one-off piece, other early Victorian inventors came closer to reaching the mass market. Inspired by the success of the railroad, an unnamed American inventor from New Jersey, came up with the idea of a bicycle railway. His single rail was mounted on a wooden fence, and an inverted bicycle - with wheels above the handlebars - was placed on top. Saving lives? The Whitby lifebuoy (left) was a safety device that could be found on board Victorian ships. Right: A woman holds the hand-grenade fire extinguisher (left hand), billed as a way to put out small house fires . All-terrain vehicle: The road and river cycle was introduced in America for travelling across roads and rivers in a single vehicle, thereby eliminating the inconvenience of having to travel for miles around stretches of water . There was no danger of falling of, and no need to use any form of steering, which meant commuters could freely look about and enjoy the scenery. It also combined exercise with travel. Though plans were underway to double the track for coming and going passengers - and also to provide stations at intervals which offered fresh supplies of vehicles - the bicycle railway closed down just five years after its opening. Similar trials were made in England across Norfolk, Great Yarmouth and Blackpool, but by the turn of the century this unusual mode of transportation fell out of favour and the tracks were ultimately dismantled. Other inventions, like the sunshade that was designed for soldiers in the desert, sought to tackle smaller-scale problems. Doomed: The aerodrome, pictured, was invented by Professor Samuel Pierpont Langley. It crashed shortly after takeoff on its first flight, paving the way for the Wright brothers to invent their own flying machine . Early animator: In 1893 a French inventor named Charles-Émile Reynaud developed his own motion picture technique based on the same principle as the zoëtrope, above. He later transposed the same principle to drawings, and was ultimately responsible for showcasing the first ever animated cartoon at a public exhibition . The sunshade was conceived by the women in the National Aid Association, who wanted to make life more comfortable for the British soldiers involved in the bitter Sudan Campaign of 1885. The drawing of the invention shows a man with a kind of sunshade made from paper and bamboo, worn as a virtually weightless backpack - leaving his hands free to carry a notepad and pen. Mrs Rochford said that while the majority of the inventions that are featured in her book were made by the inventors, very few of them stood the test the time. She said that her favourite invention is probably the first one she saw when she opened the book: an office chair railway. She said: 'It ran from a clerk's desk to the different bookshelves in his office, so he didn't have to keep getting in and out of his seat all day. 'I think it would be fun to re-invent that!' Mrs Rochford, who runs Heir Line Ltd with her husband, is now planning a follow-up book entitled Great Victorian Discoveries, which will be published next year. She added: 'People often see the Victorians as stuffy and repressed, but really many of them were full of creative ideas, and in our modern technology-obsessed world I feel we owe a debt of gratitude to our 19th century forebears.'","Caroline Rochford uncovered the illustrations in rare magazine collection .

"The last time Ingeborg Oswald saw her son alive, she was urging him to carefully prepare for his quest into the Amazon to experiment with an organic hallucinogen. He left California and died in the middle of the jungle in Peru and Oswald isn't even sure the body she brought back is him. Two years later, she's trying to move beyond his death and stop hating the Jose Pineda Vargas, the shaman that her son had entrusted his life to and who covered up his death when things went wrong. Lost: Kyle Nolan (right), 18, felt like his was falling behind his triplet sister and brother and went to the Peruvian Amazon to experiment with ayahuasca to see if it would help him discover himself . 18-year-old Kyle Nolan was trying to make sense of his life in 2012 after having dropped out of junior college and moving back into his childhood home. Being one of a set of triplets, Kyle felt he was falling behind his brother and sister and that he needed to find himself. He stumbled upon the documentary Stepping Into the Fire about an ex-Marine who manages to shed the trappings of wealth after taking ayahuasca and decided to seek out the drug. 'I really tried to discourage him,' Oswald tells CNN, reflecting back on her son's interest in the hallucinogen. 'I kept telling him over and over, there are no easy answers in life.' But Kyle had become fixated on ayahuasca, and traveled to the jungles of Madre de Dios to meet Master Mancoluto, Pineda's shaman persona. Though it's known Kyle started the ayahuasca regimen, at some point in his journey to find himself, he was lost. Shaman: Jose Pineda Vargas, pictured here in the trailer for Stepping Into the Fire, was convicted of culpable homicide and concealment after covering up the death of Nolan . Mother: Ingeborg Oswald, Nolan's mother, became worried when he didn't return on his flight from Peru and traveled to Madre de Dios . He missed his return flight home, and when Oswald called the center, she was told he 'just decided he wanted to leave, he took off down the road, and he's left.' Oswald and Kyle's sister Marion traveled down to Peru to attempt to track him down, speaking to taxi drivers and locals, but finding that 'No one ever saw him.' They returned to Northern California, only to find out later that Pineda admitted to lying to police about what happened to Kyle. Preparation: Taking ayahuasca, pictured in this file photo, requires the subject to undergo intense preparation and body cleansing, which Nolan followed before traveling into the Amazon . Guidance: Americans traveling to the Amazon to try ayahuasca rely on the traditional healers or shamans to guide them, though the high demand leads to little oversight of a booming industry . In fact, the boy had been 'found him dead outside, under a bush' and Pineda 'panicked and covered him up, and told everyone that he wasn't feeling well, that he was in his cabin.' Instead of revealing Kyle's death to his mother and to authorities, the shaman and two other men threw his body into a wheelbarrow, carted him down the road and buried him in a pit before they burned his belongings. The Peruvian shaman was eventually convicted of culpable homicide and concealment and sentenced to five years in prison. Two others were also charged. Closure never really came for Oswald. She returned to Peru to identify her son's body, but there the autopsy came back inconclusive. The body was brought home and another test performed, but this also did not provide a definitive answer about whether the body belonged to her son. The family finally cremated the body, now Oswald says she's trying to move on, though she finds herself struggling to forgive Pineda. 'I just have to try to get this behind me. I can't continue to hate the shaman,' she said. 'I can't let him ruin my life any more than he already has. I need to get beyond it.' As for the American tourists who head to Peru to partake in the hallucinogen that left her son dying under mysterious circumstances, Oswald says there needs to be caution, even regulation of the drug. 'If you're going to do this, you really really really need to research it and make sure wherever you find is properly supervised and there's medical supervision there,' she says. 'They call it a medicine, but it is a hallucinogenic drug. Obviously there's side effects to everything. Anyone can have an adverse reaction to something. You don't leave someone alone with a hallucinogenic drug.'","Kyle Nolan left his California home and traveled to the Peruvian Amazon to experiment with hallucinogenic drug ayahuasca .

"Bestselling writer Elizabeth Jane Howard left none of her £1.3 million fortune to her novelist stepson Martin Amis – because she thought he was rich enough already. Ms Howard, who died in January aged 90, was married to fellow author Kingsley Amis for 18 years before they divorced in 1983.

Her family confirmed that her personal estate, including her home in Bungay, Suffolk, was likely to be worth a further £1 million. She left the bulk of her estate to Nicola Sparks, her only daughter from her first marriage to naturalist Peter Scott, son of Antarctic explorer Captain Robert Scott. Mrs Sparks, who also lives in Bungay, said: ‘She thought that Martin was earning a reasonable salary and it was not necessary to leave him anything. 'She just wanted to leave legacies to people who worked for her and made her life OK. She and Martin were on good terms and there was certainly no rift.’ After his stepmother’s death, Martin, 65, paid tribute to the ‘erratic and mercurial’ figure, writing in The Mail on Sunday of how she encouraged his interest in literature, firstly as a reader and then a novelist.

Chloe said: 'My mother was voicing an opinion on the matter of criminals being accepted back into society. 'The comments she made on the case in question were facts, so not opinions. While it may anger some that the term ""non-violent rape"" exists, unfortunately it does. 'Referencing it and explaining why that was the charge does not mean that you think this category of rape is acceptable. 'To believe that my mother is pro ""non-violent rape"" is ridiculous and I am shocked that many people have jumped to this conclusion. 'To the trolls wishing rape on me, stop, you are utterly pathetic.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'An allegation of harassment was made to Barnet police relating to messages received via a social media site. 'A criminal investigation has commenced. There are no arrests at this stage but enquiries continue.'","Health-conscious 27-year-old is encouraging her parents to be healthier .

"The preserved shell of a glyptodont which was unearthed by an amateur paleontologist near Padilla, in central Bolivia . Near the town of Padilla, in central Bolivia, children play in a river beside the shell of an ancient glyptodont which sticks out of the ground nearby. The earth around the tiny settlement is so rich with fossils that they have begun unearthing themselves after wind and rain eroded soil in the area. Around 70 archaeological sites have been identified so far, but with little government funding it has been left up to university teams and amateurs to ensure the treasures are preserved. Among the fossilised remains are the bones of mastodons - the ancestors of modern-day elephants - glyptodonts - a huge relative of the armadillo - and giant sloths. Juan Carlos Espada, an IT teacher from a nearby primary school, has been extracting the remains, storing them in newspaper, then sticking them back together with glue. Despite having no experience in paleontology, he has managed to gather enough fossils together to found a museum, helped by a grant from the local tourist board. Among his collection are teeth, bones, jaws and small invertebrates that he has unearthed. The area around Padilla is just one of the many sites in the Chuquisaca province of Bolivia where bones have been discovered. Medina Sword, a researcher, says the province could be home to 'one of the biggest fossil deposits in South America, by the extent of the area and the variety of species that have been found.' Glyptodonts, the ancestors of modern armadillos, were huge animals that lived around 10,000 years ago . Remains discovered stretch from the Pleistocene epoch of the Cenozoic era, which began about 65 million years ago, to the last ice age roughly 12,000 years ago. Digging his fingers into the ground around two miles outside of Padilla, Mr Sword quickly begins pulling teeth out of the earth. 'This one is a molar and appears to be from a baby mastodon. This other tooth seems to be from a different animal, what could it be?' he asks. Fossils are often unearthed by children playing in the area who take them without realising their importance, or by poor locals who attempt to sell them. In nearby Sucre, researchers found 460 trails containing more than 6,000 dinosaur footprints. The area around Padilla is now thought to contain one of the larges treasure-troves of preserved animal bones anywhere in the world - including fossilised mastodon remains (pictured) Mastodons are related to the modern-day elephant and lived around the time of the last ice age . Many of the prints date from the Cretaceous period of the the Paleozoic era, which took place around 145 and 65 million years ago. Scientists attempted to have the find declared as a Unesco World Heritage Site, but the request was declined due to a lack of planning around preservation. However, as media attention on the areas intensifies, the politicians are beginning to understand the importance of the finds, and are working to preserve them. Juan José Padilla, the secretary of culture and tourism for Chuquisaca, said: 'We need to implement policies for the preservation and promotion of these issues in the municipalities, the departmental government and the central government.' The soil around the small village is so rich with bones that many have been unearthed by wind erosion and recent rains, with 70 sites identified so far .","Fossils unearthed near Padilla, Bolivia, after wind and rain eroded soil .

"Of all the stories to emerge from the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster, it's possibly the hardest to believe.

For they have revealed how the theme tune from the film Titanic was . playing onboard as it struck rocks and started to keel . over. Eerie: Costa Concordia passengers say Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On, from the film Titanic starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, was playing in a restaurant as the ship went down . They said survivors of the disaster were 'astonished' by the eerie coincidence which saw them listening to Celine Dion's hit My Heart Will Go On as the cruise ship began to founder. The song was made internationally famous in 1997 as the theme of James Cameron’s epic movie about the 1912 sinking of the Titanic, starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet. The men said they were listening to My . Heart Will Go On with passengers in a restaurant on board the ship when . the accident happened. Yannic Sgaga, who escaped from the Costa Concordia with his brother Keven, said: 'Images from the film Titanic are more realistic than one might imagine.' Spooky: Two Swiss brothers have 'revealed' how the theme tune from the film Titanic was playing on the Costa Concordia (pictured) as it struck rocks and started to keel over . A survivor of the Costa Condordia cruise ship disaster is the grand-daughter of a woman who survived the Titanic tragedy 100 years earlier. Valentina Capuano, 30, said she was 'dumbstruck' that history was repeating itself when the giant Italian ship began sinking on Friday night. Her grandmother and great uncle had both been aboard the Titanic when it sank on its maiden voyage from Southampton to new York in 1912. Her grandmother survived but her great uncle Giovanni - working as a waiter aboard the ship - was one of the 1,517 people who died. Ms Capuano was travelling with her fiance, her brother and his girlfriend when the 140,000 tonne vessel struck rocks off the Italian island of Giglio. She said: 'It was like re-living history, it was horrible, I was really shocked. I am still shaken up and get very upset when I think about what I've been through, I have heart palpitations.' He said the tune was 'stuck in my head' as most crew members did absolutely nothing to help them. He added: 'Besides kitchen staff, who helped, there were no other crew members.' Georg Linsi, who is also Swiss, told the Geneva paper La Tribune: 'The evacuation was a catastrophe within a catastrophe. 'Never in my life have I seen such a display of incompetence, lack of awareness and irresponsibility. 'When the boat started to lean to the left, we held onto the right side. Besides one young sailor, there was not a single crew member near the life boats who was able to organise the evacuation.' As the ship began to bank, he said 'hundreds of people were inside without information, with no indication of what to do. 'There was so much panic when the boat was so steeply inclined that we had to walk on the walls. We remained inside for three hours before managing to get out, and were able to leave the ship via a flexible ladder  and reached the a coast guard vessel.'

"You might have seen Saturn photobomb the moon and a comet get in a shot with the Rosetta spacecraft, but have you ever seen the red planet turn up in a picture of the blue one? In an image of Earth taken from the moon our planet appears large and easily visible, but a much smaller speck of light reveals the fourth planet in the solar system - Mars - in the same shot. Despite being 300 times further than our own planet, the planet can just about be spotted with a keen eye in one of the longest-distance photobombs ever. Washington DC-based Nasa has released an image of Mars and Earth (shown, Mars is in the red ring). The picture was taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. This spacecraft in lunar orbit normally images the surface of the moon. But this time it was pointed towards Earth to capture the rare photo . The image was taken by Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter on 24 May this year. Usually the spacecraft is used to photograph the moon, but on this occasion it was pointed back at Earth to see our planet and Mars together. In the image Earth is about 234,062 miles (376,687 km) from the spacecraft. Mars, meanwhile, is 70 million miles (112.5 million km) away - 300 times further than Earth. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) entered lunar orbit in June 2009 equipped with seven instrument suites to map the surface, probe the radiation environment, investigate water and key mineral resources, and gather geological clues about the moon's evolution. The robotic mission set out to map the moon's surface and, after a year of exploration, was extended with a unique set of science objectives. LRO observations have enabled numerous groundbreaking discoveries, creating a new picture of the moon as a dynamic and complex body. These developments have set up a scientific framework through which to challenge and improve our understanding of processes throughout the solar system. The image was taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), which is actually a set of two narrow-angle cameras (NACs) on the spacecraft. The images were built from rows of pixels taken by each of the cameras. However the cameras can't move by themselves and instead always point in the same direction. This means that they rely on the movement of the spacecraft to take a picture. To make Mars more visible a technique known as contrast stretching was used, making the planet more noticeable against the enormity of Earth. ‘This view of Earth includes several cloud patterns that satellites observe frequently,’ Nasa writes on their site. 'A line of rain and thunderstorms are visible in a band near the equator, an area known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone. 'To the north, off the west coast of North Africa, notice the banks of closed-cell clouds over the Atlantic Ocean. 'Moving into the high latitudes, we see comma-shaped cloud patterns caused by extra-tropical cyclones.' In the image Earth is about 234,062 miles (376,687 km) from the spacecraft. Mars, meanwhile, is 70 million miles (112.5 million kilometres) away - 300 times further than Earth. The images were built from rows of pixels taken by each of the cameras on Nasa's LRO spacecraft .

"Gary Ballance cracked a century to keep England in the second Test against India at Lord’s — and then admitted he had learned his lesson after his shirtless, drunken antics earlier this week. Ballance, who was reminded of his responsibilities by England coach Peter Moores after being photographed naked from the waist up in a Nottingham nightclub on Sunday, made 110 before being caught shortly before stumps as England closed on 219 for six in reply to India’s 295.

"Click here for the latest leaderboard from The Open Championship . Nothing more could be asked from an opening day at The Open Championship than the two biggest names setting out their stall alongside the world number one before a raucous audience of lucky sunbathers at Royal Liverpool. Rory McIlroy’s sumptuous 66 to set the pace was nothing less than expected, of course, since he’s become Thursday’s child. This was the fifth time in 14 starts this season he has led following the opening day. Neither would anyone be too surprised that Adam Scott made light of the fact he was playing in the more difficult afternoon conditions to demonstrate why he began the event as favourite. Given the wind’s added strength his 68 was perhaps the equal of the leader’s score in terms of merit. VIDEO Scroll down for The Open: First round highlights . Out in front: Rory McIlroy shot a stunning 66 on day one at The Open to lead by one shot heading into Friday . Big draw: A large crowd at Royal Liverpool watches on as McIlroy putts on the 14th green . Feeling good: McIlroy smiles as he watches a tee shot fly down the fairway during his first round . VIDEO The Open: First round highlights . But it was the sight of Tiger Woods holing putts and tip-toeing menacingly into the top ten that was the real bonus and gave the day its delicious flavour. Certainly, those pundits who wrote him off in the build-up must be shifting uneasily in their seats. Kidding himself if he thinks he can win? There was enough compelling evidence here to emphasise the point that the most futile punditry of all is calling into question the prospects of the fourteen-time major champion. This was his first round in a major for 11 months owing to back surgery in March but the sight of him skipping onto the media podium following his three under par 69, before marching merrily to the practice ground, illustrated that the 38 year old is healthy again and back in business. What a leaderboard we have already. Fireworks were promised and duly delivered at this wonderful venue. How on earth did the Open go 39 years from 1967-2006 without being played here? Back to his best? Tiger Woods managed an impressive round of 69 on his return from a serious back injury . Confident: Woods believes winning the Claret Jug is a realistic goal despite his lack of playing time this year . VIDEOVIDEO Tiger Woods press conference . In contention: Adam Scott lived up to his billing as the bookmakers' favourite with a round of 68 on Thursday . Players who made double-bogey or worse on the brutal 480-yard, par-four seventh hole. Only five players made a birdie there. Evocative stories pulled at the full range of emotions. When was the last time two brothers were tied third after the first day of an Open, for example? The Molinaris Frankie and Eddie shared bragging rights with their 68s but still lost out by a stroke for top Italian to Matteo Manassero, now thankfully emerging from his half-season funk. Also on 68 is gentleman Jim Furyk, determined to atone for his last day failings at Medinah at the Ryder Cup this year and who must have impressed his playing partner, none other than captain Tom Watson. Remember Sergio Garcia, dressed all in yellow on the final day here in 2006, to the vast amusement of the man who beat him on that occasion? Woods duly texted a friend: 'I’ve just killed tweety-pie.' Dressed all in black, one of the nearly men of major championship golf is also on the popular four under par mark. Then there was the other end of the scale and the Aussie Brydon Macpherson, who qualified by finishing fourth in his national Open last December but is now suffering so badly from the yips the poor soul failed to break 90. Young gun: Matteo Manassero finds himself in outright second place after a fine round of 67 in Hoylake . Finding his form: Spaniard Sergio Garcia (right) also shone during a sun-drenched opening day at The Open . Still going strong: Veteran Jim Furyk has put himself in position near the top of the leaderboard . The game takes lumps out of everyone at some point. Two years ago on the Lancashire coast Ernie Els was crowned champion. Here he began with a triple bogey seven, including three putts from no more than 12 inches, his concentration shattered after his tee shot struck an unlucky spectator flush in the face. Woods began slowly too, with bogeys on the first two holes. By his side, Henrik Stenson’s imperious ball-striking early on offered a sharp contrast. Things started to change at the fourth. Woods had struck a tentative putt at the second from 6ft to miss but here from the same distance there was something of the old authority to instil some confidence. A lovely up and down for his first birdie at the 5th was followed by a series of pars before the next key moment at the 11th, where he holed from off the green. Talk about a light switch going on. At the next two holes Woods struck gorgeous approach shots that led to two more birdies, followed by further gains at the 15th and 16th. Five birdies in six holes, then. Someone asked: did it feel like old times? ‘It’s not that long ago,’ said Woods, smiling. ‘I did win five times last year.’ Frustrated figure: Ernie Els endured a nightmare front nine and ended the day seven over par . Slip up: Sweden's Henrik Stenson got himself to two under par but finished with a round of 72 after . Under par: Lee Westwood, pictured here playing his approach on the 14th, came away with a first round 71 . There have been winners who have received a less rapturous reception than the one afforded Woods at the 18th. Part of it is to do with what happened in 2006, of course, when Woods found an inner peace here, to use his own words, following the death of his father Earl that April. Clearly, the locals are rather taken by the thought they might be able to help out again, as he looks to end a drought in the majors stretching back six years. The wind had freshened by the time Scott and Justin Rose stepped on to the first tee. Both oozing with confidence, it showed over the front nine with Scott, in particular, striking a series of quite majestic blows. When he reached the turn in 31 shots, with three par fives to come, it looked as if the Australian would threaten McIlroy’s lead. The back nine proved a beast for the late starters, however, and he pick up no more strokes to par. Rose bogeyed the 12th and 14th  and had to settle for a 72. Just behind, sentimental favourite Lee Westwood showed he retains plenty of fight as he battled manfully to a 71. Leading Englishman? Twenty-four year old amateur Ashley Chesters, from the same small Shropshire village of Wem that produced Sandy Lyle. He shot 70. It was a day to score then, with the wind expected to blow significantly on Friday morning. We’ve seen the best players plunder. Now, can they protect?","McIlroy shot a first round 66 to lead The Open by one shot .

"Two phone calls, just moments before the front door burst open, was the only warning Maywand Osman, 20, had before his home was raided by counter-terrorism police. He claims the early morning swoop by Australian Federal and state officers last Thursday now has him 'living in fear'. 'Every morning I get a phone call I think it's the police calling because they called that morning,' Mr Osman told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's developed a sense of paranoia and fear. It will go away in time.' Scroll down for video . Maywand Osman claims he's 'living in fear' after being detained and then released by police during last week's counter-terrorism raids .

"Jeffrey Deskovic has won a settlement $41,650,000 after he was wrongly convicted of raping and killing 15-year-old Angela Correa when he was 16 . A man who was wrongly convicted of raping and killing a fellow high school student has won a $41,650,000 settlement. Jeffrey Deskovic, 40, from Putnam County, New York, was jailed in 1991 after 15-year-old Angela Correa was found raped, beaten and strangled two years earlier. Mr Deskovic won the lawsuit against Putnam County and sheriff’s investigator Daniel Stephens, which his lawyers have said is the largest sum awarded in US history. Investigators had focused on Deskovic, who was 16 at the time, because he had turned up to school late that day - despite DNA found on the victim's body not being a match. In 2006, he was cleared of the crime after DNA evidence taken from the victim pointed to another suspect - Steven Cunningham, who later confessed to the rape. At the time, he was given three lie detector tests over the course of a six-hour interrogation. His wrongful conviction, and imprisonment, mostly in maximum security Elmira Correctional Facility in Chemung County, New York, came after a confession that was later found to have been coerced. Since his release, Mr Deskovic has been a public face of wrongful conviction and imprisonment. He has won numerous settlements since his release and set up The Jeffrey Deskovic Foundation for Justice, an organization dedicated to anti-wrongful conviction advocacy. The city of Peekskill, New York paid him a $5.4 million settlement last year and previously received $1.8 million from the state of New York for the wrongful imprisonment.

"This video - entitled ‘Papa bought his daughter a Lexus’ - has done nothing to enhance the reputation of women drivers in Russia. Apparently leaked by an insurance industry source, it shows a spectacular crash as a new owner - perhaps on her first outing with a gleaming black 4x4 - reverses, cautiously, from her parking place. Abruptly, she speeds up, ramming a bush and sinking into a ditch at the side of the road, flipping the expensive new SUV onto its roof. Gently does it: The owner of this gleaming new SUV at first slowly and cautiously reverses from the space . Jump: It seems the driver's foot has slipped on the accelerator somewhat, causing the vehicle to jerk back . Oh dear: The car, said to be a brand new Lexus GX460, sinks into an unfortunately located ditch . Disaster: The vehicle rolls over onto its roof. The driver was said to have been saved from harm by the airbags . Youtube user MegaTrover uploaded the 16-second footage stating: 'The video was filmed by CCTV camera. I was given it by a friend who deals with car insurance. 'The Lexus was brand new. They didn’t even take the factory’s protective covers from inside the car. 'The car was driven by a young woman. She wasn’t hurt thanks to the airbags.' The female driver was not identified, nor was the location in Russia where the accident happened. The Lexus was believed to be a present from her wealthy father. The vehicle is believed to be a Lexus GX460, retailing at around £38,000 in Russia. A voice on the video - believed to have been re-recorded from a security camera - says 'No way.....' - as the action unfolds. Comments to the video - which has gone viral on the Russian web - include such observations as: 'No matter what you’ve got under your bum, Lexus or Lada, you’ve got to keep your brain in gear too.' Some were laced with sexism about female drivers, such as: 'Women have no place in such vehicles.' 'This indulgent father bought her a luxury motor - but he should have made sure she had a driving licence before she drove it,' said one commenter. 'I think it was extremely lucky that she tested her driving skills in a quiet yard, didn’t injure herself and didn’t get other drivers or pedestrians hurt. Imagine her in the middle of a busy motorway,' said another. Yet another complained: 'Why oh why are inexperienced drivers like this getting heavy cars like that?'","Video was apparently leaked by a source in the insurance industry .

"Barclays Premier League footballers will be warned in the next fortnight that they could face retrospective action if they follow the example of England cricketer Moeen Ali and make a public show of political support on the football pitch. In light of the current conflicts engulfing the Gaza Strip, Ukraine, Libya and Syria, both the Football Association and the Premier League are acutely aware of the sensitivities but a new amendment to the Laws of the Game by FIFA will see a global crackdown on such political statements this season. Only this week, English cricketer Moeen Ali was banned from wearing 'Save Gaza' and 'Free Palestine' wristbands by the International Cricket Council and even though athletes may argue the message is humanitarian, rather than political, football's governing bodies will follow the lead of their cricket counterparts in clamping down on this. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Israeli football players fight with Palestinian pitch invaders . Statement: Moeen Ali batted for England against India wearing wristbands that read 'Save Gaza' and 'Free Palestine' Wristband banned: Moeen Ali and his 'Free Gaza' and 'Save Palestine' slogans on his wrists . As it transpires, similar wristbands would not be permitted by the FA as jewellery and accessories that are not worn for the sole purpose of protecting a player are already banned. However, a new change to FIFA laws will also stiffen the resolve of the governing bodies. Previously, footballers were allowed to reveal a personal message or image on their undershirts but the law change, which comes into effect for the 2014/15 season, introduces a total ban against any messages being revealed by footballers. The amendment to the FIFA rules sees a change to Law 4, entitled The Player's Equipment, and it now reads: 'Players must not reveal undergarments that show political, religious, personal slogans, statement or images, or advertising other than the manufacturer logo.' 'A player/team of a player that reveals an undergarment that shows political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturing logo will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by FIFA.' If, when celebrating a goal, a player was to lift their shirt to reveal any kind of message, the referee would be expected to include the incident in their subsequent post-match reports. Retrospective action would then be taken by the FA or FIFA against the footballer. It would then be up to an FA disciplinary commission to decide the punishment, whether it be an official warning, a fine or a suspension. Not allowed: Fulham's Kieran Richardson showed a religious messages when he scored against Liverpool . Banned: Players are not allowed to show messages like Mario Balotelli's infamous 'Why Always Me?' t-shirt . A senior FA source confirmed to Sportsmail: 'We apply FIFA's rules which cover player equipment and include the banning of political messages.' The new law would include potentially volatile messages about international politics but also tongue-in-cheek ones such as Mario Balotelli's infamous 'Why always me?' statement. The FA are responsible for enforcing discipline in English football but Premier League officials will also hold their annual pre-season meetings with leading managers in the coming weeks, where clubs will be briefed on these matters. The PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Limited) will also pay a pre-season visit to all squads to clarify the amendments to the Laws of the Game for this season. The stance will also apply to UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and Europa League. The strict changes to the legislation were agreed in March by the International Football Association Board and came into effect for the World Cup. However, following the the intensification of tensions, particularly between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, there is growing concern that some individuals may follow in Ali's footsteps and attempt to show their support for certain factions. Vocal: QPR's Joey Barton has spoken out about the situation in the middle east on Twitter . On Twitter, QPR midfielder Joey Barton has been outspoken in his opposition against Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip. On Friday, he posted 17 Tweets in just over one hour, in which he questioned the existence of God and shared a picture that appeared to show Palestinian children severely injured. He then wrote: 'If God does exist. Then he has to have allowed this to happen. Which makes him well, a bit of a c*** really...#f***organisedreligion.' There is, however, an area of confusion developing as some would argue that expressing such volatile opinions on social media arguably constitutes a more powerful statement than unveiling a message on the field. On Friday, the FA would not comment on Barton's four-letter rant and it is understood that they recognise a divide between a player promoting political views on the pitch - wearing the colours of his team and representing the Barclays Premier League - and writing on a personal online account. Kick: Supporters of reportedly Turkish origin entered the pitch and headed for Maccabi Hafia players . Yossi Benayoun was involved in Maccabi Haifa's match which had to be abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters invaded the pitch . Nonetheless, Barton has 2.65m followers and there is an acknowledgement that players must behave responsibly and there are precedents in place to impose sanctions on footballers for online behaviour that is deemed to be offensive. Earlier this year, Tottenham Hotspur defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto and Hull City forward Yannick Sagbo were both punished when they Tweeted their support for Nicolas Anelka after the Frenchman was banned for five matches when he celebrated a goal for West Brom with the quenelle gesture, a signal interpreted by most to be an inverted Nazi salute. Any sanctions for improper conduct on social media would, however, be down to the FA's interpretation alone, while on-pitch messages are now enshrined into FIFA law. QPR, Barton's employers, refused to discuss the player's actions when approached by Sportsmail on Friday afternoon. It was telling, however, that the player returned to Twitter late on Friday evening to say: 'Shouldn't have used foul language in and around religion before but was angry at what I'd seen. Apologies if I offended anyone.'","Premier League players will be reminded of the rules on political support on the pitch .

"Prosecutors in the sentencing retrial of the lurid case of Jodi Arias finished his opening statements Tuesday by telling jurors the Arizona murderer deserves the harshest sentence of them all. 'The only just punishment in this case is death,' Juan Martinez told the Maricopa County Superior Court. The sentencing retrial of Arias, 34, started with a new jury and opening statements by lawyers to decide whether the convicted murderer should live or die after the brutal killing of her ex-boyfriend. Scroll down for video . Calls for her head: Jody Arias was already looking exhausted as opening statements began in her lurid sentencing retrial where prosecutors were swift to tell jurors that only a death sentence befits her crime . Jodi Arias pictured today in the Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix, Arizona as the opening statements in her death penalty phase retrial begins . The 34-year-old Arias was convicted of murder last year but the first jury was deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison . Mentally ill: Jodi Arias defense attorney Kirk Nurmi argued his client is mentally ill and should not, therefor, be executed . Arias had her hair cut to shoulder-length for her return to the courtroom and appeared to have it dyed darker. She was wearing a new pair of nude-framed glasses - perhaps because earlier this month, a Phoenix food bank auctioned off the glasses she wore at the original trial and raised close to $1,000 for charity. Also on Tuesday, defense lawyer Kirk Nurmi began opening statements, telling jurors it was up to them to write the final chapter to the story. He warned the jury that it will see graphic evidence about the killing and relationship between Arias and victim Travis Alexander - but said she should not be executed because she is mentally ill. Prosecutor  Martinez proved his point by showing jurors a picture of Arias' victim, ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, with his throat slit. 'This is how much she loved him,' Martinez told the jury, according to ABC. The victims' siblings were in court today along with Arias' parents and brother. Arias was convicted of murder last year but the first jury was deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison. That required a new jury and trial to decide her punishment. A new jury that was picked over the past several weeks will listen as the former waitress tries to make another case that her life should be spared. Four hundred people were called as prospective jurors. Many of them were cut after they said they either made up their minds about the case or knew too much to be impartial. Some jurors cited their objection to the death penalty. They won't consider whether or not she's guilty - that's already been decided. The retrial is expected to last into December. Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slit his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shot him in the forehead. Complicated process: Four hundred people were called as prospective jurors. Many of them were cut after they said they either made up their minds about the case or knew too much to be impartial. Some jurors cited their objection to the death penalty. Judge Sherry Stephens has shut the media and public out of nearly every hearing in the case and drawn complaints from First Amendment lawyers that she has gone too far . Arias was found guilty of first degree murder in the death of former boyfriend Travis Alexander, but the jury deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison. Now defense attorney Kirk Numi (pictured) is facing off against prosecutors in a battle where Arias' life, and fate, hang in the balance . She left his body in his shower where friends found him about five days later at his suburban Phoenix home. She acknowledged she killed Alexander, but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her. Prosecutors said it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after the victim wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman. Weeks after Arias was convicted, the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on her punishment. Her attorneys have since sought, unsuccessfully, to dismiss the death penalty as an option. If another deadlock occurs, the death penalty would automatically be removed as an option, leaving a judge to sentence Arias to one of two options: life in prison or life in prison with the possibility of release after 25 years. Arias, pictured in court on January 9, 2013, must now convince the jury at her retrial that she does not deserve the death penalty for the brutal slaying of her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander . At her last trial, she testified for 18 days, describing for jurors an abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, a shocking sexual relationship with Alexander, and her contention that he was physically abusive . Jodi Arias was found guilty of the murder of Travis Alexander in 2008 after slitting his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shooting him in the forehead . Arias left the body of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in his shower where friends found him days later at his suburban Phoenix home. Crime scene pictures from the first trial (pictured) revealed the brutal nature of the killing . Left for days: Alexander was here, in this shower, for around five days before friends found his decaying body . The sentencing retrial will be a mini-trial of sorts to get a fresh jury - of 12 women and six men, including six alternates - up to speed on the case. At her last trial, she testified for 18 days, describing for jurors an abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, a shocking sexual relationship with Alexander, and her contention that he was physically abusive. Her first trial drew a global following and inspired spectators to wait in line in the middle of the night to get a coveted seat in the courtroom. This time around, the judge has ruled that cameras can record the proceedings, but nothing can be broadcast until after the verdict. Judge Sherry Stephens has shut the media and public out of nearly every hearing in the case and drawn complaints from First Amendment lawyers that she has gone too far. Judge Stephens said the hearing closures are intended to protect Arias' right to an impartial jury. Attorney David Bodney, who represents several media outlets fighting for transparency in the case, said there have been repeated violations of the public's constitutional right to attend proceedings in the case. The costs of defending Arias have topped $2.5 million and will mount during a second penalty phase. Prosecutors have declined to provide their costs to try the case.

"An Ohio town leader has rejected claims from a lesbian mother embroiled in a lawsuit with a sperm bank that their biracial baby is unwelcome in his community. John Arnold, a trustee of Lake Township, was referring to Payton, the two-year-old daughter of Jennifer Cramblett who is suing a Chicago sperm bank alleging she was wrongly impregnated with a black man's sperm. As part of the lawsuit, she has complained that Uniontown, where the family live, is 'racially intolerant' and has forced her to consider moving elsewhere to protect the child's well-being. However Arnold, told NBC News: 'There's no reason anyone would act that way to a two-year-old. I could not fathom it.' Scroll down for video . John Arnold (left), a trustee of Lake Township, Ohio, has rejected claims by Jessica Cramblett (right) that his community is 'racially intolerant' Ms Cramblett (left) says she and her partner Amanda Zinkon (right) love their daughter Payton, now two years old, but that they have to leave their hometown to find a more diverse city for their biracial daughter . Census data shows Uniontown is 98 percent white, but Arnold said the community welcomes diversity. Mr Arnold added: 'We have a large Mennonite community and a lot of the members have adopted African-American children and babies from all over the world and those kids have been treated fine. 'They obviously have a beautiful, healthy two-year-old. I hope that their perception of how they might be treated in Uniontown is not the reality.' Ms Cramblett's lawyer, Thomas Intili, told NBC that the mother and child have already experienced prejudice. He said: 'Not all of it is overt. Some of it is the looks on people's faces. Lines of communication once open to her from friends and families are diminishing.' Ms Cramblett is suing Chicago-based Midwest Sperm Bank for allegedly sending her the wrong sperm samples after a receptionist transposed a number on the paperwork. Donor 380, the sperm donor Ms Cramblett and Ms Zinkon had picked to father their child, was a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white man. She was sent vials of sperm from donor 330, a black man. 'I am happy that I have a healthy child,' Cramblett told NBC News through tears. Ms Cramblett says in the lawsuit that Payton has been stigmatized by residents in the community, forcing her to consider moving elsewhere in order to protect her 'well-being' Jennifer Cramblett (right) and her partner Amanda Zinkon (left) picked out a white sperm donor from Midwest Sperm Bank, but were instead sent a black man's sperm, they allege . 'But I'm not going to let them get away with not being held accountable.' In a lawsuit filed this week in Cook County, Illinois, Ms Cramblett says Midwest Sperm Bank sent her several vials of a black man's sperm by mistake because the clinic keeps paper records and accidentally transposed numbers on her order. Midwest Sperm Bank charged $400 per vial of semen and Ms Cramblett and her partner received six vials of the wrong semen. The lawsuit says the clinic later sent Ms Cramblett an apology note and a refund for the six vials - though charged her for the vials of the correct semen she received. Ms Cramblett she has 'limited cultural competency relative to African-Americans' and worries that her daughter Payton will not be accepted in her hometown of Uniontown. 'Jennifer lives each day with fears, anxieties and uncertainty about her future and Payton's future,' according to the lawsuit. Ms Cramblett, the assistant manager of an AT&T store, said she and her partner Amanda Zinkon love their daughter, who is now two years old, but say they must now consider moving to a more diverse community. Ms Cramblett says her family is racist and has not fully accepted her sexuality. Having a mixed-race daughter makes it even harder, she claims in her lawsuit . Ms Cramblett says she's thankful she had a healthy daughter, but she says even simple tasks like getting Payton's hair cut can be dau . Ms Cramblett says in her lawsuit that much of her family is racist and that one uncle openly makes racist comments. Even simple tasks have become more complicated because Payton is mixed-race, the lawsuit says. 'Payton has hair typical of an African American girl. To get a decent cut, Jennifer must travel to a black neighborhood, far from where she lives, where she is obviously different in appearance, and not overtly welcome,' according to the lawsuit. Ms Cramblett says she grew up in Scio, Ohio - population 762 - and didn't meet a black person until she attended college. She currently lives in Uniontown, population 2,802, and fears Payton will be the only non-white child in class when the time comes for her to attend school. Ms Cramblett says her family has difficulty accepting the fact that she is gay and encourage her to hide her sexual orientation when she is around them. She says no matter what she does, Payton cannot hide her race - nor should she have to. Ms Cramblett is alleging breach of warranty and wrongful birth.

"Bayern Munich beat Wolfsburg 3-0 in the final of the Telekom Cup after dispensing with Borussia Monchengladbach in the semis. Pep Guardiola's men strolled to victory in Hamburg. A brace from Robert Lewandowski came either side of a Sebastian Rode strike to give the German champions a comfortable victory.

"When he was elected Prime Minister he dispensed with his police motorbike outriders and said he was willing to sit in traffic like anyone else. But now David Cameron has been forced to step up his security after a jogger ran into him on Monday in Leeds sparking a major alert. A team of four motorcyclists have begun escorting Mr Cameron’s prime ministerial car following a review of his protection. Scroll down for video . David Cameron was seen leaving Parliament  following PMQs on Wednesday  with his police outriders - just two days after being ran into by a jogger on Monday. He had originally dispensed with the motor cycle escort . The Prime minister outriders have now been re- introduced following the increase in security arrangements . In 2010, after being elected Prime Minister, Mr Cameron scrapped his motorcycle outriders - and was pictured stuck in traffic . After his weekly Commons appearance at Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron was accompanied by a police escort that helped him speed through traffic. As his Jaguar left the Houses of Parliament shortly before he was due to host a lunch a short distance away at Downing Street, a team of four motorbike outriders joined his convoy. Gordon Brown used outriders for most car journeys on security grounds, but when Mr Cameron was elected in 2010 he decided to do without them. A No 10 source at the time said: ‘The Prime Minister feels this is probably an unnecessary extravagance. He is happy to put up with the same type of driving conditions as everyone else.' The source added: ‘Mr Cameron feels that the police have better things to do than hold back traffic to let him get through more quickly. ‘It was an expense, or perhaps an ostentation, that he did not feel he needed.’ The decision saved the Met Police tens of thousands of pounds a year but it caused consternation from security experts who said the outriders are needed to keep the PM’s car moving so it does not become a sitting target and can escape quickly if there is an attack. The Prime Minister was shoved by a member of the public who was later arrested but then released . Mr Cameron was in Leeds city centre today when the major lapse of security occurred . Mr Cameron can be clearly seen bracing as he spots the jogger running towards him, while security appear oblivious . Dai Davies, a former head of Royalty Protection at Scotland Yard, yesterday welcomed the decision to bring back the outriders. He said: ‘I’m delighted that common sense has kicked in at long last. I was astonished and dismayed when they did away with the Special Escort Group. ‘Keeping a principal moving at all times is key to protection, especially with the phenomenon of suicide bombers. ‘I would hope that following Leeds there has been a swift review of the Prime Minister’s security.’ Protection measures are under review after a jogger evaded Mr Cameron’s armed bodyguards and bumped into him on Monday as he left an event. The 28-year-old was arrested but released saying it was 'nothing sinister, just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time' Response: Runner Dean Balboa Farley said he brushed the PM before being assaulted by police . Dean Farley, 28, almost knocked the Prime Minister off his feet before being taken away by police officers. Mr Cameron was unhurt after the incident in Leeds but it exposed gaps in security around him at a time when the terrorist threat level has been raised. Westminster is currently on high alert in case of a terrorist attack on Parliament after the shooting of a ceremonial guard outside the Canadian parliament. MPs are being told to consider fitting their constituency offices with panic buttons and designating a 'safe room' in their homes. They are also being briefed on the security plans in case of an attack on the Commons. Troops with machine guns have also been deployed at Horse Guards Parade. Both Downing Street and the Metropolitan Police declined to comment on the new protection arrangements.","EXCLUSIVE: PM forced to step up his security after a jogger ran into him .

"The body of Alice Gross was found wrapped in plastic and buried under logs in the river Brent . Former Met police officers have expressed concern that the senseless murder of 14-year-old Alice Gross bears disturbing parallels with two other unsolved cases from the same area. This week, Alice's body was found wrapped in plastic and buried under logs in a West London river. The murder investigation has a prime suspect, Arnis Zalkalns, a convicted murderer from Latvia, who vanished from his home in west London, days after Alice went missing. But former Met Office police officers are worried about the striking similarities between Alice's murder and two unsolved cases from the London borough of Ealing. In April 1999, a 19-year-old student, Elizabeth Chau, left Thames Valley University and was caught on CCTV walking home along the Uxbridge Road near Ealing police station. She was never seen again. Her sister, Bich, has never given up hope of being reunited with her sibling. She said: 'We want Liz to know that we love her and miss her very much.' Nine months later, in January 2000, Lola Shenkoya, 27, an American-born computer graduate, got off a bus outside Burger King station near Ealing Broadway station. She too disappeared without trace. Both instances occurred within a few hundred yards of the spot where Alice went missing on August 28. Scroll down for video . Vital forensic leads may have been lost for ever after it took police more than a month to find Alice's body . Lola Shenkoya (left) and Elizabeth Chau (right) both went missing in similar circumstances within a few hundred yards of where Alice went missing on August 28 - neither have ever been found . And the case has struck a chord with former officers who were involved in the incidents of the missing women. The victims all went missing at busy times of the day and their disappearances went unnoticed by members of the public. They told Tom Harper, of the Independent: 'The odds against three girls disappearing or being murdered in such a small area of London, even over a 14-year period, are astronomical. 'Stranger murders on lone young females walking in the street during the day by a man unknown to them are extremely rare occurrences in the UK. 'The vast majority of victims are known to their attackers and any such cases always become big news stories. There are only ever two or three a year nationally, if that. 'Whoever killed these girls showed considerable coolness, sophistication in avoiding being seen during the act, and avoiding capture. 'The killings took place out of sight and sound of the public, as did the subsequent disposal of the bodies. This latter aspect takes considerable planning and coolness on the part of the attacker, raising the question of whether there was more than one attacker. 'All the above circumstances are extremely rare in any case of murder, let alone in such a small area of London.' Alice's body was recovered from the River Brent in west London on Wednesday, a month after she vanished . Former Met Officers said the disappearance of Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns made him the prime suspect in the inquiry in to Alice's murder . The Met said Chau and Shenkoya were strongly suspected to have been murdered by Andrezej Kanowski, a convicted rapist and murderer from Poland who died in 2009. Kanowski, known as 'The Beast', was questioned in 2004 but the Met never found any hard evidence against him. But officers who were involved in the murder inquiries disputed that claim, although they accepted he was a 'good suspect'. Elsewhere, former Met Officers told the Independent that the disappearance of Latvian Zalkalns made him the prime suspect in the inquiry. The source was also concerned at the delays in contacting Latvian police over Zalkalns' whereabouts, although the police dispute any such delays. Privately, several retired detectives are shocked it took the Met five days to launch a murder inquiry into Alice's disappearance. One said: 'It was an unacceptable delay. A 14-year-old girl should have been classed a high-risk missing person and the murder inquiry should have started after 24 hours - particularly when the police realised her phone was not working.' Vital forensic leads may have been lost for ever after it took police more than a month to find Alice's body. The Met faces questions over the time it took to find Alice's body in shallow water just yards from where her rucksack was found . Aerial shot reveals how close Alice's body was found to her rucksack and where police had earlier searched . In the hours after Alice's body was found, her family said in a statement: 'We have been left completely devastated by the recent developments and it is difficult to comprehend that our sweet and beautiful daughter was the victim of a terrible crime. 'Why anyone would want to hurt her is something that we are struggling to come to terms with. 'Alice was a loving and much loved daughter and sister, a quirky live spark of a girl, beautiful inside and out. She was a funny companion, a loyal friend, both passionate and compassionate, and so talented with a bright future ahead of her. She brought so much joy to our family and those who knew her. 'We still don't know who is responsible for this crime and we ask that people continue to help the police by giving them information that could help bring the perpetrator to justice.'","Ex Met officers concern at similarity of two unsolved cases from same area .

I was very impressed with him and I think he’s got at least the level to play for this club,’ said Arteta. When asked if he thought Campbell had a future at Arsenal, he said: ‘That’s not for me to say but what I can tell you is that I think he’s got the capacity and the ability to play for Arsenal, that’s for sure.’ Arteta warned that Arsenal would need to improve on last season given that a number of their rivals have already strengthened their squads.

"Even before voters went to the polls to decide who would be the next Senator of Louisiana, the Republican National Committee was preparing for a run-off situation that would require dozens of campaign operatives to spend the next month in the state campaigning for Republican Bill Cassidy. By election night the number of RNC staffers airlifting into the state on Wednesday had ballooned to 300 people as Louisiana officials confirmed that a second election would be held on Dec. 6. Neither Cassidy, the top Republican in the race, nor sitting Sen. Mary Landrieu were able to beat back a cadre of other candidates challenging them for the seat and reach the state's required 50 percent mark. Help is on the way! The Republican Party announced tonight that it would send 300 operatives to Louisiana to help Congressman Bill Cassidy in the Senate runoff . Incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu acknowledges supporters at her election night headquarters in New Orleans. Landrieu immediately began attacking her opponent on Tuesday night after she learned that they would again face off next month as a result of the state's jungle primary . Louisiana's jungle general elections allows for any candidate who fulfills state requirements to appear on the ballot. As a result eight candidates were allowed compete in today's election, including four Democrats and three Republicans. The only candidate to garner more than one percent of the vote, however, besides frontrunners Cassidy and Landrieu, was Republican Rob Maness, who siphoned off just over 14 percent of the vote from fellow Republican Cassidy. With Maness and the other candidates gone from the race, polls predict that Cassidy with sail to victory in next month's redo election. National Republicans were already preparing for a run-off scenario in Louisiana for weeks before Election Day and planned to send in staffers of all types to aid Cassidy, who currently represents Louisiana in Congress. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus confirmed on Tuesday that the national party had already locked down hotels for the staffers for the duration of the ongoing campaign season. Priebus made the announcement from the jam-packed lobby of the party committee's Washington, D.C. headquarters on the edge of Capitol Hill. At the time Republicans were still waiting on the results in several key states that would determine whether their party would take over the Senate, including Georgia, which also called for a run off if no candidate topped 50 percent. In the end, the GOP came out on top on Tuesday, gaining just enough seats to take control of the Senate just after 11 p.m. Landrieu needed to win 50 percent of the vote to keep her seat outright. Now she will have to square of again against Cassidy on Dec. 6. Polls give Cassidy the upper hand . Blocks away the Democratic National Committee was mum as the majority and the last two years of President Barack Obama's term slipped out of the party's reach. The political organization declined to have a victory party this year, likely in anticipation of a GOP wave and its chairman did not hold a briefing with the press. A request for comment on the results of Landrieu's race was not immediately returned by the DNC, either. A half hour before Midnight Cassidy emerged online to acknowledge his supporters and the battle ahead. 'Thanks to everyone who supported me today. We sent an important message to Washington: we're ready for new, conservative leadership,' he wrote. 'Thanks to everyone who supported me today. We sent an important message to Washington: we're ready for new, conservative leadership,' Cassidy said in a follow-up tweet. While Cassidy was thanking his supporters, Landrieu was already back in campaign mindset. 'This race is about the future.The bright & strong future that Louisiana deserves. Join us for the next 32 days,' she tweeted from her campaign account. Moments later she began re-attacking Cassidy over his policy positions. 'Where was Congressman Cassidy when Louisiana women fought for equal pay?' she said, linking to a website that ponders where Cassidy was when women, veterans, seniors, students and disaster survivors needed him most. Polling site Real Clear Politics gives Landrieu unfavorable odds at winning the run-off election. On average, surveys of the state taken in the last week give Cassidy a 4.8 percent lead in the one-on-one.","RNC chair confirmed that national party would send in 300 operatives ahead of a runoff election to be held on Dec. 6 .

"A 41-year-old mother of three from California has been acquitted of first-degree murder in the shooting death of her schoolteacher husband, and the jury deadlocked on lesser charges against her. Julie Harper was found not guilty Wednesday of murdering her husband of 11 years, Jason Harper, 39, in the couple's home in Carlsbad in August 2012 as their three children watched cartoons upstairs. Judge Blaine Bowman declared a mistrial on the charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter, and it is now up to the prosecution to decide whether or not to re-try Harper. Scroll down for video . Not guilty: Julie Harper, 41, pictured in court September 15, has been acquitted of first-degree murder in the shooting death of her schoolteacher husband, Jason, in August 2012 . Not so happy couple: A wedding portrait of Julie and Jason Harper is projected on a screen on the first day of the murder trial. The wife testified that her husband abused her throughout their 11-year marriage . In the course of the three-week trial, prosecutors argued that Harper shot dead her husband during a domestic dispute as part of a plot to regain her freedom. Authorities responded to the Harpers' home in the 2400 block of Badger Lane in Carlsbad after getting a call from Julie Harper's attorney. Officers entered the house and found Jason Harper's lifeless body lying on the floor of the second-story master bedroom. Police issued a bulletin to search for Julie Harper and her children, ranging in age between 18 months and 8 years. Sixteen hours after the killing, Harper turned herself in at her father's home in Scripps Ranch . Prosecutors described the Harpers’ marriage as turbulent and punctuated by frequent arguments over money and the wife's weight gain. A week before the killing, Mrs Harper filed for divorce and allegedly forged her husband's signature so she could withdraw $20,000 from two bank accounts and their daughter's college fund, reported 10News. Her version of events: Mrs Harper said in court she shot 39-year-old Jason Harper (right) in self-defense to stop him from raping or killing her during a domestic fight . Bust: After going on the run for 16-hours Julie Harper was arrested at her father's home in Scripps Ranch . Throughout the trial, Julie Harper portrayed herself as a victim of domestic and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband, and insisted that she fired the fatal shot in self-defense. But prosecutor Keith Watanabe challenged Harper's claims, saying that she had prepared for the final showdown with her husband by packing a ‘getaway bag’ and putting inside passports for herself and her children, U-T San Diego wrote. . After killing her husband, Watanabe said in court, his wife did not call 911 and hid the gun, which has not been found to this day. Julie Harper, a former real estate agent-turned-homemaker, testified that on that fateful night in August 2012, Jason was threatening to kill her, prompting her to fire the gun to stop him from sexually assaulting, or otherwise harming her. ‘He would just be in an absolute fury, in his rage, yelling and screaming,’ she was quoted as saying by ABC News. The 41-year-old woman told the jurors that in the course of their troubled marriage, Jason Harper, a math teacher and volleyball coach at Carlsbad High School, raped her no fewer than 30 times. Raving mad: The jury panel was shown this video recording of Jason Harper berating and hurling insults at his wife while holding one of their children in his arms . A few days before the shooting, Julie Harper said she had started sleeping with an unregistered handgun under her pillow for protection. ‘I didn’t even intend to shoot him. I only wanted to scare him or to make him stop,’ she said from the stand while under cross-examination, according to Times of San Diego. ‘[I] felt my hand jerk, and heard the loud noise, and he was still coming forward at me. And then all of a sudden, he froze, completely. Like a tree in the forest, he just fell forward at me.’ Who was Jason? Harper's friends and colleagues portrayed him as a 'gentle giant' and a loving father . The jurors got to watch video recordings made by Mrs Harper showing her husband yelling and hurling insults at her, at times in the presence of their children. In one of the videos, an enraged Jason Harper holding a toddler in his arms screams at Julie: 'You’re putting our kid in the day care and making me pay for it and you claim you're taking care of her. F*** you, b****!' But those close to Jason Harper, including his friends and colleagues, have painted a starkly different picture of the man, describing the father of three as a 'gentle giant.' ‘He was a very, very nice person,’ Harper's colleague Andy Tomkinson told 10News. ‘He was gentle, he was calm, he was above all a really, really good father.’ Another Carlsbad High School staffer Amanda Waters challenged Julie Harpers' claims that she had been abused by her husband. ‘My friend and colleague was portrayed as this abusive guy, and in my opinion, they [jurors] bought it,’ she said. In his obituary, the 39-year-old educator was described as a man who 'had integrity, was honest and taught his children what is right.’ Julie Harper is due back in court October 15, at which time the prosecution is expected to announce its decision regarding a possible retrial.","Julie Harper, 41, has been acquitted of first-degree murder in shooting death of her California schoolteacher husband, Jason, in August 2012 .
Harper shot her husband of 11 years during a domestic fight and went on the run in California with their three children for 16 hours .
In court Julie Harper argued she acted in self-defense out of fear that Jason would rape or kill her .

"If you are scared of spiders, it might be an idea to go on a long holiday abroad. For the mild spring and long, warm summer has created a perfect storm for arachnids to thrive. The scuttling insects are at their most prevalent at the moment during the key mating season. A Red Kneed Spider. This one lives at London Zoo. Zoologist Tim Cockerill says 'This is the time of year when the males mature and start wandering about looking for a mate' Zoologist Tim Cockerill, who presents BBC Four documentary Spider House next Wednesday, said: ‘Lots of fruit on the trees meant lots of flying insects, which in turn has meant lots of spiders.’ He told the Radio Times: ‘This is the time of year when the males mature and start wandering about looking for a mate. So if you see them scurrying around, that’s what’s on their mind.’ This false black widow spider, steatoda grossa, was found in Hampshire, England . Dr Cockerill insists there is no need to fear the insects. ‘Is it something deep within our evolutionary consciousness that we’ve inherited, or is it just something that we’ve learned from our parents? Personally, I don’t understand it. ‘There is no reason why we should be afraid. They’re things of great fascination and ingenuity. They just make you gasp with amazement.’","Zoologist Tim Cockerill insists that there is no need to be afraid of spiders .

"A man has been ordered to pay his ex-girlfriend £28,500 in a landmark ruling for unmarried couples because he promised her 'the security a wife would have'. David Southwell, 55, said he had never envisaged marrying Catherine Blackburn and had never promised her anything when they began their relationship in 2000. The court heard the businessman had paid for the £240,000 home they shared in Droitwich, Worcestershire, and also covered the £100,000 mortgage, intending it should always stay in his name alone. Court of Appeal judges have ruled that unmarried man David Southwell should pay his ex-girlfriend £28,500 in a landmark ruling after she was left 'effectively homeless' following their break-up . But the court heard Miss Blackburn and her two daughters were left stranded after the acrimonious break-down of their relationship in 2012. Ruling on the case last year, Judge Daniel Pearce-Higgins QC said that Mr Southwell was 'shrewd, cautious and guarded' and had not wanted to marry Miss Blackburn because he knew what she would be able to claim should they break up. Now a judge has ruled Mr Southwell, a claims handler, should give Miss Blackburn a £28,500 stake in the property to uphold his previous promise of security. Dismissing the appeal lodged by Mr Southwell, Lord Justice Tomlinson said that to go back on the assurances he gave her would be 'unconscionable'. Insisting he should not pay her the money, Mr Southwell claimed he had no legal obligation to Ms Blackburn after their relationship ended. But the judge ruled that he 'did reassure her that she would always have a home and be secure in this one'. Lord Justice Tomlinson said Mr Southwell had told her that he was 'taking on a long-term commitment to provide her with a secure home'. He added that Miss Blackburn had 'abandoned her secure home', in which she had invested what little money she had, to move in with Mr Southwell. During the case, the court heard how Miss Blackburn, a divorcee, had taken a 'big risk' in giving up her job and home to move in with Mr Southwell. The court heard he had 'reassured' her she would be secure after the couple made a joint decision to buy the house in 2002. The court heard that Catherine Blackburn was left effectively homeless when their relationship broke down in 2012 (File picture posed by models) But Mr Southwell 'made sure she was kept away from any paperwork that might suggest she had an interest', the court was told. Judge Pearce-Higgins had previously said: 'He led her to believe that she would have the sort of security that a wife would have, in terms of accommodation at the house and income. 'And she relied on that'. Judge Pearce-Higgins added it was unlikely Mr Southwell would have promised Miss Blackburn an equal share in the house, knowing it would have been 'against his interest to do so'. He said: 'He did not envisage marriage because he was aware that, as a wife, Miss Blackburn might have a substantial claim against him in the event of a breakdown. 'He was prepared to provide a home to Miss Blackburn and her two daughters, but it was to be on his terms. 'Both parties may have been 'in love', as they claim, believing that their relationship would never end, but I do not believe that either of them were blind to the realities'. The court heard that, with the benefit of hindsight, Miss Blackburn realised that she had been 'too trusting and foolish' in failing to secure her rights. But Judge Pearce-Higgins said Mr Southwell made 'reassuring promises to persuade her to move'. He said added: 'He thought he was taking on a long-term commitment to provide her with a secure home and said so to her. 'He made such reassuring promises as were necessary to persuade her to move, and thereby give up her own independence and security. 'She was taking a big risk, moving from a secure rented house on which she had spent a lot of money, leaving her job and moving her children. 'Without trust in Mr Southwell and reassurances from him she would not have moved as she did'.","David Southwell, 55, said he never envisaged marrying Catherine Blackburn .

"Women are kicking the drink-drive habit more slowly than men, new research from the AA reveals today. It said that while the likelihood of a male driver failing a breath test after an accident was falling steadily, the decline in female failure rates was only a third of that of men. The findings come as ministers launch a new hard-hitting drink-drive campaign to mark 50 years of Government efforts to persuade motorists to avoid alcohol when getting behind the wheel. Scroll down for video . Campaign: 50 years after the first drink-drive campaign the THINK! initiative has launched a new  advert which juxtaposes Kool And The Gang's 1980 Celebration song with a dramatic crash scene and the events that follow . Findings: An AA poll found that while the likelihood of a male driver failing a breath test after an accident is falling steadily, the decline in female failure rates was only a third of that of men . The AA said the number of male drivers who failed a breath test after an accident had dropped by 17.6 per cent between 2010 and 2013 (2,992 compared to 2,466). But the number of female drivers who failed a breath test after an accident in the same time period dropped by just 5.9 per cent (853 to 803). However, three times as many men fail a breath test after an accident than women - even though female drivers make up 46.5 per cent of full driving licence holders. AA president Edmund King said: ‘While women have a better track record on drink-driving than men, it is important to shine a spotlight on the fact their improvement rate has stalled in recent years, and in some age groups, regressed. Pioneering: The first drink-drive campaign aired in November 1964 and followed events after an office party . Assumption: The first campaign came in the form of a public information film set in an office Christmas party -and assumed the driver would be a 'he' Easy to understand: This graphic showing the amount the man had to drink was also used in the 1964 advert . ‘Part of this may be down to the fact women are more likely to be the designated drivers, but whatever the reason there is no excuse for drink-driving.’ To mark the 50th anniversary of drink-drive campaigns, the Government’s THINK! initiative is launching a new hard-hitting advert which juxtaposes Kool And The Gang's cheery 1980 Celebration song with a dramatic crash scene and the sequence of events that follow, reminding people that there are still too many people being killed on the roads by drink-drivers. The first campaign in November 1964 came in the form of a public information film set in an office Christmas party - and assumed the driver would be a 'he'. Desperate call: The 1980 also featured events stemming from someone driving after drinking at a party . Video nasty: The 1982 campaign was entitled 'Stupid Git' and starred actor John Altman, who would go on to find fame in EastEnders as 'Nasty' Nick Cotton . Fifty years on from the first anti-drink-drive campaign, nearly all motorists would be ashamed to be caught over the limit, according to a survey. But 18-24-year-olds are seven times more likely to think drinking and driving is acceptable than 55-64-year-olds, the poll by the Government's THINK! campaign showed. Based on responses from 2,000 people, the THINK! survey showed that 91 per cent agreed drink-driving was socially unacceptable and 92% would feel ashamed if caught offending in this way. Hard-hitting: The 1992 advert featured an injured woman with the slogan 'Quick drink never hurt' But 7 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds said drink-driving was acceptable compared with only 1 per cent of 55 to 64-year-olds. Older people were most likely to see drink-driving as socially unacceptable and would also be more likely to be ashamed by it, which suggests the public information campaigns over 50 years have reinforced this message. Road deaths due to drink-driving have fallen from 1,640 in 1967 to 230 in 2012. In 1979, more than half of male drivers admitted drinking and driving on a weekly basis, with the proportion rising to two thirds for young male drivers. New version: Another scene from the new 2014 campaign, which features a woman injured in a crash . Shameful: Fifty years on from the first anti-drink-drive campaign, nearly all motorists would be ashamed to be caught over the limit, according to the survey . Hitting home: The number of female drivers who failed a breath test after an accident between 2010 and 2013 dropped by just 5.9 per cent, compared with the number of men which fell by 17.6 per cent . Aim: The campaign aims to remind people that there are still too many being killed on the roads by drink-drivers . Danger: In 1979, more than half of male drivers admitted drinking and driving on a weekly basis, with the proportion rising to two thirds for young male drivers . Statistics: Road deaths due to drink-driving have fallen from 1,640 in 1967 to 230 in 2012 . Today more than 88 per cent of people say they would think badly of someone who drinks and drives and 45 per cent of respondents said they would prefer to tell their partner they watch pornography regularly than confess to being caught drink-driving. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘The change in attitudes to drink-driving over the last 50 years is a huge success story. ‘It is hard to imagine now how shocking and ground-breaking the first drink-drive campaigns were when they launched. Clearly THINK! has had a significant impact. ‘Most of us understand drink-driving wrecks lives but there is further to go. In 2012, 230 people were killed in drink-driving accidents - 230 too many. This makes the THINK! campaign as relevant as ever.’ AA president Edmund King said: ‘Fifty years of education has had a fantastic impact on changing the public's perception of drink-driving, but there is more to do.’ Perception: Today more than 88 per cent of people say they would think badly of a drink-driver . Worrying: The poll found that 18-24-year-olds are seven times more likely to think drinking and driving is acceptable than 55-64-year-olds .","Likelihood of a male driver failing a breath test after an accident is falling .

"Bad cop: Florida sheriff's deputy Ted Arboleda, 32 (pictured), was arrested on Monday after it was revealed he accepted oral sex in exchange for letting a woman off on a driving without a license charge . A  Florida sheriff's deputy was arrested Monday, after it was revealed he accepted oral sex from a woman who he could have arrested for driving without a license, drug possession and violating her parole. Broward County Sheriff's Deputy Ted Arboleda, 32, allegedly chatted up a local woman on July 13, 2013, at a Mobil gas station. During their conversation, Arboleda discovered that the woman did not have a valid license, despite driving a car to the gas station. He also found that she was in possession of marijuana, an unlabeled bottle of prescription medication and on felony probation. Fearing arrest, the woman  bribed the officer with money to avoid legal action. But apparently that wasn't necessary, as Arboleda reportedly let the unidentified woman keep her drugs and even offered to drive her home. When they arrived at the woman's Dania Beach house, Arboleda asked if he was going to be invited in and the woman agreed. Inside, she offered Arboleda oral sex, and while he accepted, he allegedly said he had never done anything like that before. He said 'he could not believe he agreed' and swore her to secrecy.  He left without arresting her. But that same day, the woman's boyfriend called the sheriff's office to report the incident, and Arboleda has been under investigation ever since. He was put on administrative duty on August 19 of this year before his October 13 arrest. Arboleda has been at the sheriff's department since February 2011, when he voluntarily left the Surfside Police Department after two years of service. On Monday he was held at Broward Mail Jail on $1,000 bond, after being charged with unlawful compensation or reward for official behavior -  a second-degree felony. The sheriff's public corruption unit continues to investigate the incident. 'There's a possibility that he's done this before,' sheriff's office spokesman Dani Moschella said. Anyone who may have been a victim of Arboleda is being asked to call the Broward Sheriff's internal affairs office at 954-321-1100. Scene: Arboleda allegedly met the woman at this Mobil gas station. and discovered that in addition to being on felony probation, the woman did not have a license to drive and was in possession of marijuana and unmarked prescription medication.

"A couple of years ago, I stepped off a plane at a small airport in a far corner of the planet, and caught a taxi into town. You do not really notice Ushuaia as you enter it – because, despite marketing itself as the world’s most southerly city, there is not a great deal of it. But what you do spot, about halfway through the cab ride, is the memorial to the Argentinian dead of the Falklands War, placed very prominently at the roadside. Indeed, you cannot miss it. This stark slab of iron – from which the outline of the Falklands archipelago (or Las Malvinas, as the Argentinians prefer to call it) has been cut – could scarcely be described as pretty. But it makes a firm point: What happened in 1982 has not been forgotten here. Under fire: The Top Gear team - with Jeremy Clarkson centre of image, seated - while filming in Argentina . My mind has drifted back to that memorial over the last couple of days, as the furore over the actions of the Top Gear team, and its star Jeremy Clarkson, has gathered momentum. For those of you who have missed this ‘event’ (perhaps you have better things to do with your life, or perhaps you prefer some news with your news stories), Clarkson has been accused of angering the locals in southernmost Argentina by driving around in a Porsche whose number plate apparently references the Falklands War. The plate in question reads ‘H982 FKL’. A line of numbers and letters which has been taken by the Argentinian media to refer to the year of the conflict, 1982 – and the islands over which it was fought. Cue unpleasant scenes in Ushuaia, this outpost at the foot of South America – with various reports of vehicles being pelted with stones, the Top Gear presenters being pursued to the Chilean border by a mob, and police assistance required to get them out of the country. Cause of controversy: Clarkson's 1991 Porsche, with the number plate that has been seen as a war reference . After the event: The same Porsche is seen with damage to its windscreen after an encounter with a local mob . All very unsavoury, then, with Top Gear cast, again, in an unpleasant light, and Ushuaia – an important tourist destination – doing its image a considerable disservice. The city is the key point of access for the spectacular islands of Tierra del Fuego – the fractured lower tip of South America – as well as voyages that venture to Antarctica. But as with a juvenile spat in 2012, where two British ships were refused harbour in a show of lingering bad feeling, Ushuaia is once more in focus for reasons other than its glorious scenery. Naturally, Top Gear has issued the requisite denials. The number plate was a coincidence, we have been told – a work of total chance. The 1991 Porsche came with the plate when it was bought by the show back in August – acquired specifically for the 1350-mile drive through Argentina which has been filmed for the programme’s 2014 Christmas special. Make of that what you will, although bear in mind that Clarkson has a record of trying to offend his hosts when filming Top Gear in overseas locations – in 2012, he prompted complaints from the Indian High Commission after driving in India with a lavatory strapped to the back of his fast Jaguar, in a glib pot-shot at the country’s sanitation issues. Doomed: The sinking of the General Belgrano in 1982 was the most controversial moment in the Falklands War . Not forgotten: The General Belgrano sailed from Ushuaia in April 1982 - and its sinking is still keenly felt there . Perhaps the producers are telling the truth. Perhaps serendipity has frowned upon Top Gear, handing it the equivalent of a Countdown Conundrum that it could not solve. But what should be very clear is that if this was a deliberate stunt, pulled by the makers of the show in a gesture of boys’-club humour, then it was both crass and insensitive. Thirty-two years after its outbreak, the Falklands War is still a notoriously thorny issue between Britain and Argentina – and it remains a highly troublesome topic in Ushuaia. The losses of the war are still keenly felt in the city because the conflict’s most difficult moment – the sinking of the Argentine warship General Belgrano – had its roots here. The naval cruiser set sail from Ushuaia on 26 April 1982. Six days later, it was sunk by the British nuclear submarine HMS Conqueror, with the deaths of 323 men on board. Site of remembrance: Ushuaia has a very visible memorial to the Argentinian dead of the Falklands War . Very much an emotive issue: The war is still a big topic in a city that played a direct role in the events of 1982 . The incident has helped to keep the fires of the Falklands debate aflame ever since. Notoriously, the General Belgrano was outside the 200-mile exclusion zone around the archipelago that had been declared by Britain as a theatre of definite conflict – and was sailing west, away from the Falklands, and back towards the Argentinian mainland. Some naval officials in Argentina – including Héctor Bonzo, the doomed vessel’s captain – have described the sinking as a legitimate military act, revealing that the ship was mid-manoeuvre, and ready to attack. Others, including some here in Britain, have called it a war crime. The rights and wrongs of the assault on the Belgrano are never likely to be resolved into one smooth narrative. But you do not need a degree in military history to understand that the subject is still emotive in a city that waved farewell to the dead men. Nor do you need a Masters in geography to appreciate that people are still upset in a place that sits just 400 miles from the Falklands (a hop and skip in a region of long distances and empty horizons). And you do not need to be an apologist for Argentina’s aggression and invasion of the Falklands in 1982 to realise that people mourn their loved ones who do not return home. Missing the point: Jeremy Clarkson's latest Twitter defence fails to understand why people might be upset . Argentina lost 649 soldiers in the conflict. Half of them passed through Ushuaia en route to a watery grave. In other words, it is not a city where you make jokes about the war. It is certainly not a place where you make references that treat the drowning of so many sailors as if it were the result of a football match. Or that most noxious of terms, ‘banter’. Perhaps, as has been said, the number plate was an accident. But Clarkson’s responses to the matter show he hasn’t grasped why this has caused outrage. He has said via Twitter: ‘These war veterans we upset. Mostly they were in the 20s. Do the maths.’ Thus utterly missing the point. Does he think that only soldiers who have seen service are affected by war? That their families and children just shrug and carry on with their lives, oblivious? No doubt the Top Gear team will repeat the coincidence claim until the story has faded into the background. No doubt the Christmas special will be an enormous success, its viewing figures boosted by the controversy. No doubt it will go on to sell a huge number of DVDs, and add to the reputed £150 million the show makes for the BBC every year. At the end of the world: Undeniably pretty, Ushuaia can lay claim to being the most southerly city on the planet . In happier moments: Normally, Ushuaia is a tourism destination where cruises for Antarctica start and finish . If so, perhaps I could suggest a few more unforeseen coincidences of which the show could be an entirely blameless and wholly unfortunate victim in future episodes. What about a dash around northern France in cars that – good lord, who could ever have made the connection? – accidentally refer to the 19,240 British men who were slaughtered on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in July 1916? How about a quick jaunt to the beach at Dunkirk with a number plate that – oh dear, if only we’d spotted it in time – casually mentions the 11,000 Allied soldiers killed in the evacuation of 1940? What wit. What chutzpah. What bravado. Oh my aching sides.","Popular BBC TV show is embroiled in row over the Falklands War of 1982 .

"Teenager George Williams grabbed a hat-trick as Wigan stormed to the top of the Super League table with a 10-try rout of an outclassed Hull at the DW Stadium. The reigning Super League champions never looked back after full-back Lewis Tierney, son of former dual international Jason Robinson, put them in front with a spectacular fourth-minute try while England winger Josh Charnley celebrated his 100th Super League appearance with a try in his side’s 56-10 triumph. The defeat was another hammer blow to the play-off hopes of Hull, who have taken just a point from their last five games. Treble: Teenager George Williams grabbed a hat-trick as Wigan romped Hull 56-10 at DW Stadium . Summit: Reigning Super League champions Wigan returned to the top of the table with this win . Remarkably, the Black and Whites, who gave a debut to18-year-old Jack Logan in the absence of former Great Britain centre Kirk Yeaman, won 34-33 in the corresponding game in 2013 but will be glad to see the back of the Warriors after conceding 100 points in two matches to them this season. Wigan made the best possible start when Tierney, making his first Super League appearance of the season in place of the injured Matty Bowen, gathered Jordan Rankin’s kick on his own 20-metre line and scythed through a fragmented Hull defence for a spectacular solo try which his father would have been proud to score. Hull were briefly level when Charnley made a hash of an attempted clearance from Jordan Abdull’s grubber kick to present winger Fetuli Talanoa with a soft try but the visitors rarely threatened the Warriors line. It took Shaun Wane’s men some time to find their groove but they effectively put the game to bed with three tries in a 12-minute spell before half-time. In the corner: Lewis Tierney celebrates his score for Wigan against Hull . Charnley took Anthony Gelling’s pass to force his way over at the corner for his 12th try in six appearances since returning from injury and then stand-off Williams briefly took centre stage by scoring one try and making another. First he dummied his way over from close range and then burst out of his own half with skipper Sean O’Loughlin in support. As the cover closed in on the Wigan loose forward, he slipped a superb overhead pass for Matty Smith to finish off the move. Smith kicked his third conversion to make it 22-4 and it could have been worse for Lee Radford’s side. Wigan’s former Hull KR prop Scott Taylor lost the ball on the stroke of half-time as he attempted to touch down and Charnley fumbled Tierney’s pass early in the second half with the line beckoning. No way through: Hull FC's Tom Lineham is treble-teamed by Wigan defenders . Wigan’s superior class eventually began to tell on the scoreboard, with Williams demonstrating fleet of foot to score his second try and hooker Sam Powell doing likewise to jink his way over for a score. Williams completed his hat-trick on the hour after Smith had demonstrated the dribbling skills that once earned him a trial at Everton and the scrum-half took his goal tally to six from seven attempts to extend the score to 40-4. It was rapidly turning into a rout as Hull’s defensive efforts descended into farce. Centre Dan Sarginson pounced on a handling error to get left winger Dom Manfredi over for one try and then repeated the feat after Gelling’s speculative kick caused confusion in the visitors defence. Loose forward Liam Watts scored a consolation try for Hull, converted by Rankin, but Wigan had the final say when Scott Taylor became the first forward to touch down for them in the final minute and Smith took his goal tally to eight. Opening the floodgates: Tierney (left) scored the first try and then nine more followed for Wigan .","Williams scored three of Wigan's 10 tries during victory at DW Stadium .

"Tiger Woods set himself up for another miraculous Major triumph by shooting an opening round of 69 to fire himself into contention at The Open. Despite playing in just his second tournament since undergoing major back surgery in March – he missed the cut on his return two weeks ago – Woods insisted earlier this week that the only acceptable result for him at Hoylake would be victory. That looked like nothing more than hubris on Thursday morning after the 14-time Major champion got off to a dreadful start at the venue where he won his last Open in 2006, bogeying both of the opening par fours amid some shoddy ball-striking. On the prowl: Tiger Woods looked in good form in his first round of The Open at Hoylake . In the sand: Tiger plays a shot from a greenside bunker on the final hole of his first round at Hoylake . VIDEOVIDEO The Open: First Round highlights . But Woods was not fazed and appeared . more visibly relaxed on the course than at any time in recent memory. The former world No 1 was even spotted smiling at the galleries at . times, causing gasps of shock among seasoned Tiger-watchers used to his . usual cold exterior. Woods rallied with his first birdie of the day on the long fifth to head out in 36 strokes. As Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler and the game’s young guns raced into the lead, Woods’s score looked well short of what was required to challenge this week, but he stayed patient and hit a stunning patch of form on the back nine. Three . birdies in a row came from the 11th to the 13th holes. Then, despite a . dropped shot at the 14th, Woods rallied to birdie both the next two . holes. On . the par-five 15th he eased any fears over the state of his back by . whipping through a full-blooded three-wood from the fairway. Although . his ball missed short right of the green, his gossamer touch from the . rough earned a brilliant birdie. Only a lip-out prevented another stroke . gained on the 17th. Reading the line: Tiger prepares to putt on the ninth hole as a gallery looks on during the first round . Another explosive three-wood on the long final hole found a bunker protecting the front of the green but he set up a chance to seal a back nine of 32 strokes with an act of escapology. The putt slid agonisingly wide of its target, however. He said afterwards: 'I didn't exactly get off to the best of starts but I turned it around. 'I . felt like someone could shoot 63 out there but the wind is picking up. The ball was dancing round all over the place out there.' 'I knew I could do it. That's why it was so important for me to play Congressional. I'm only going to get better. 'I felt fine, my warm-up was good. It was good being out there competing again.' Frustration: Tiger looks dejected after wasting a birdie opportunity on the 17th hole at Royal Liverpool . There are still three rounds left for Woods to complete but were the American superstar to win at Hoylake it would rank among his most stunning victories – of which there are plenty to choose from.Woods has not tasted victory in one of golf’s big four tournaments since 2008, when he won the US Open despite playing through the intense pain of stress fractures in his left leg and a torn cruciate knee ligament. The pressure on him to break Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major titles is building after a six-year drought, and Woods is two shots behind the early pace set by Matteo Manassero, who held the clubhouse lead at five under par when Woods ended his round. But the rest of the field will be all too aware that the big beast is back on the prowl.

"The parents of a a Muslim fanatic who died in Syria after bragging about his ‘5-star jihad’ have been released on bail after being arrested over Syria-related terrorism offences. Enu Miah, 57, and Hena Choudhury, 48, the parents of 23-year-old Ifthekar Jaman, were arrested yesterday in a dawn raid at their home in Southsea, Portsmouth. Their son - who became known for his online advice to fellow British Muslims seeking to go to Syria - was killed in December after travelling to the war-torn country to fight government troops. The parents of jihadist Ifthekhar Jaman, 23, (left) have been released on bail after their home in Portsmouth was raided on terrorism charges. His sister Tamannah Shaharin (right) was arrested after a raid in Greenwich . After the raid, Mr Miah was arrested on suspicion of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism; engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts and arranging availability of money and property for use in terrorism. He was also arrested for engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts and raising cash and property for the Syrian fighters who flocked to follow his son. Ms Choudhury was detained on suspicion of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism. Both Mr Miah and Ms Choudhury have now been released on bail, police said. Three other members of Jaman's family who were also arrested yesterday remain in custody, Thames Valley Police said. These include Mr Jaman's brother Tuhin, 26, and Mustakim, 23, both from Portsmouth, and their 29-year-old sister Tamannah Shaharin, who was arrested in Greenwich, south east London. They were arrested by the south east counter terrorism unit yesterday and are being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. Police stood guard outside the terrace house in Southsea, where the door window was smashed during the dawn raid . Police were also seen at this  house in Greenwich, thought to be where Jaman's sister Tamannah lives . A 23-year-old woman from Farnborough, Hampshire, was also arrested over the same alleged offences. A Thames Valley Police spokesman confirmed the arrests were related to the conflict in Syria. He said: 'Officers would like to reassure residents that the police activity... is in relation to conflicts overseas and is not linked to any immediate threat to local communities or anywhere else in the UK.' A Thames Valley Police spokesman confirmed the arrests - which led to the front door being smashed - were related to the conflict in Syria . After the raid, police were seen standing guard outside the terraced house in Hudson Road, Portsmouth, where Jaman used to live. The same property - which now has a smashed front door and is surrounded by police tape  - was previously targeted by police in April. The family’s business, Masala Takeaway in Portsmouth, was also raided. Detectives also swooped on Shaharin's semi-detached home where she lives with her husband Muhib Ud Deen Mohammed Khan, 33, and his parents. A dozen policemen searched the property and vehicles in the driveway. Shaharin’s husband, son and parents-in-law were seen arriving home under police guard and picked up some belongings before leaving. Jaman became known for his online advice and encouragement to fellow British Muslims seeking to go to Syria, including women, whom he urged to marry men back from the front lines. The 23-year-old became one of the most infamous British extremists when he boasted on BBC Newsnight that the ‘holy war’ in Syria was like ‘5-star jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature. He also claimed it was ‘cool’ to hold a gun. The former Sky call centre worker left the UK last year after telling his parents he was going to study in Turkey. On May 14, he slipped across the border to Syria. In a series of calls back to England, Jaman managed to persuade five of his friends from Portsmouth and another three from Manchester to go out and fight alongside him. Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Jaman had described fighting in Syria as ‘5-star jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature . Jaman (right) with his friend, former Primark supervisor Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, (left) who was also from Portsmouth and was shot dead in July . Separately, police investigating possible terrorism offences have also been given more time to hold a number of other suspects. Counter-terror officers said they had disrupted what is believed to be the early stages of what could have turned into a 'significant plot' following the raids in central and west London last Tuesday. Officers from the Metropolitan Police's counter terrorism command (SO15) have been given until October 21 to hold three of the men arrested that day. The suspects, a 21-year-old man and two aged 20, were arrested in London on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Jaman, was who born in Portsmouth and attended local schools, pictured as a young child . Two other men arrested on the same date for the same offences were released from custody on Monday. Counter-terrorism officers have also been granted more time to hold a 24-year-old man arrested on Monday on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Scotland Yard said it had applied for and been granted a further extension until Sunday. Two other men - aged 21 and 25 - who were arrested on Monday for the same offences remain in custody.

"Sunderland striker Ignacio Scocco has completed his move back to former club Newell's Old Boys. The 29-year-old, known as 'Nacho', has returned to Argentina following a short, but disappointing spell on Wearside. Scocco joined the club from Brazilian outfit Internacional for £3.2million in January, and is understood to have left for slightly less after failing to score in his eight appearances for the Black Cats. Flop:  Ignacio Scocco has left Sunderland to join former club Newell's Old Boys . A club statement said: 'Striker Ignacio Scocco has completed a move to Argentine club Newell's Old Boys. 'Scocco, who joined Sunderland in January, has signed a five-year deal with the South American club for an undisclosed fee.' The confirmation from Sunderland comes after Newell's Old Boys revealed on Wednesday that Scocco was returning to the club. His departure came as head coach Gus Poyet's hopes of welcoming a new addition took a turn for the better with the news that Chelsea full-back Patrick van Aanholt is close to completing a move to the Stadium of Light. It is understood the Black Cats are hopeful of striking a deal for the 23-year-old Holland international within the next 24 hours after becoming increasingly frustrated in their pursuit of Fiorentina defender Marcos Alonso. Dutch of class: Van Aanholt seen here playing for Vitesse (left) and the Holland national team (right) this year . Depleted:Gus Poyet know he faces a race against time to get players in before the start of the season . Indeed, club officials were hopeful of including Van Aanholt in the party heading off for a pre-season training camp in Portugal on Friday. The Dutchman, who came through the ranks at Chelsea while sporting director Lee Congerton was at the club, has spent the last two-and-a-half seasons on loan at Vitesse Arnhem. He has made only nine senior appearances for the Blues and has been sent out on loan to five different clubs, including a month at Newcastle in 2010. However, he has indicated that he feels his future lies away from Stamford Bridge, and Sunderland are keen to take advantage of his hunger for regular first-team football. Van Aanholt's capture does not necessarily preclude a continuation of efforts to land Alonso, who proved a key player on loan last season, but it would provide a welcome boost for Poyet, whose hopes of sealing a permanent deal for Fabio Borini are also yet to be realised. In addition, the Uruguayan has confirmed his interest in compatriot and Atletico Madrid midfielder Cristian Rodriguez. On the radar: Poyet's compatriot and Aletico Madrid winger Cristian Rodriguez . Poyet told the Sunderland Echo: 'This has been out for a few days and this week I had a chat with people in Uruguay, who are obviously desperate for Rodriguez to come with us. 'It's ongoing. At the moment, it's a possibility, but it's no more than that. 'He's a player that I admire a lot because he's got power, desire and experience playing with the top teams. 'He wants to play football, he's desperate to be playing week in, week out. 'There are plenty of positives, but there is something you need to do (agreeing a deal) before having a player like that available.'","Ignacio Scocco leaves Sunderland to return to Argentina with Newell's .

"A would-be prankster died after he slipped out of the front seat after he opened the van door after telling his fellow passengers 'watch this.' Wayne Rowlands, 27, is believed to have fallen from the moving Ford Transit van, which was travelling at about 40mph, after slipping from the edge of his seat. Seconds earlier the bricklayer and amateur footballer said to his friends 'watch this for a prank boys.' An inquest into his death heard that Mr Rowlands, of Llanrhyddlad, Anglesey, suffered a severe brain injury after rolling into the road. Wayne Rowlands, 27, is thought to have died after a prank gone wrong when he fell from a van travelling at around 40mph after he opened the door and said to friends 'watch this boys' as they drove through Anglesey . Shaun Wharton told the hearing at Caernarfon, Gwynedd that Mr Rowlands was between tipsy and drunk. He said: 'Everyone was taking the Mick out of each other. He said ""watch this for a prank boys."" He has opened the door. 'I thought he was going to close the door. He has gone on the edge of the chair. I clenched the corner of his jacket. He exited the vehicle and rolled in the road. 'I said 'Oh my God he's jumped.' Mr Wharton, who had been sitting between the driver and Mr Rowlands, said: 'It's like he slipped on the seat. I don't think he jumped out.' Mr Rowlands was a keen footballer in the Anglesey area. He also was a manager of Bodedern FC . Robert Jones was driving the van and said he was doing about 40mph when Mr Rowlands fell as they drove to a pub at Rhosneigr, Anglesey. It happened on an unclassified country road between Bryngwran and Llanfaelog in April. Coroner Nicola Jones recorded a conclusion of accidental death. She said Mr Rowlands was twice the drink-drive limit and had been in 'high-spirits, good humour and usual happy-go-lucky self' during a ten-minute journey. The coroner said : 'It seems Wayne has slipped off the edge of the seat and fallen from the vehicle. It is too far-fetched to say this is a prank where Wayne jumped out of the vehicle. I don't think he was that drunk. 'I am satisfied, on the evidence of Mr Wharton, Wayne was just trying to wind his friends up. He's got to the edge of the seat and slipped away. The head striking the road caused the head injury.' Mr Rowlands was involved in football and manager of Bodedern FC, which told the Daily Post his death was a 'huge loss.'","Wayne Rowlands, 27, was in 'good spirits' travelling with friends in Anglesey .

"A New Zealand retail outlet has been forced to defend criticism about an incredibly thin mannequin displayed in one of its stores. The thinly-shaped female model photographed by a New Zealand University student, Emily Robins, has sparked intense discussion about female body issues and how women should be represented. Ms Robbins, 25, tweeted the image she photographed inside Fashion retailer Glassons accompanied by the caption: 'Purging is in this season!' and has been the subject of intense criticism by health experts despite the company's boss deeming the model 'healthy.' The mannequin displayed in the Glassons shop which was posted to Emily Robin's twitter page . Ms Robins, a former actress on New Zealand show Shortland St, tweeted the mannequin has the potential to make women feel inadequate and that was a form of 'control.' But the company's boss, Graeme Popplewell, told Stuff.co.nz  that science determines what a healthy weight is and defended the woman wearing the two piece bikini as 'healthy.' He said the mannequin's proportions meant it would have a 'healthy' body-mass index (BMI) of 18.8, just above what would be classed as underweight at 18.4. Many, including NZ radio presenter Jen Bainbridge were a little taken a back by the female mannequin . He also said that because of the way the mannequin is positioned - its arm raised and slightly inverted - people are led to believe that it is thinner than it really is. He said a female in a similar position would have an enhanced rib cage. He also said the position of the lights in the store, relative to the body,  accentuates the woman's rib cage. 'The key is that due to the position of the mannequin with the arm elevated and slightly twisted, the rib cage is naturally enhanced as it would be in real life,' Popplewell said. But Ms Robins said the debate should not be based around a classification of what is deemed healthy, but  making women feel more adequate about their body image. 'It's not the mannequin would have a healthy BMI, it's we need a wider range of representations for women's bodies,' she tweeted. A New Zealand Women's Health Action director Julie Radford-Poupard said the mannequin undoubtedly 'full on.' A budget British clothing store Primark removed a line of models it used which attracted widespread criticism. The thin looking females also had protruding ribs and removing it from their stores. A range of thin looking female mannequins used by a budget British clothing store were removed after being criticised . The retail stores should bare the responsibility for the image they put out to customers, she said, and respect different shapes and sizes in women. women through accurate mannequins of a range of shapes and sizes. A 2011 University of Otago and Ministry of Health survey showed the average BMI for a Kiwi woman was 27.6 - classified as 'overweight'. University of Waikato  lecturer in health education Debi Futter-Puati said the 'incredibly thin' mannequin was 'disturbing'. 'When I look at that image with all her ribs showing, the message it's sending is that that's desirable and that's the way you're supposed to look as a young woman.' 'What's the message they're hoping to give by using a mannequin like that - that if you wear our clothes you'll look this so-called 'good'?' She said developing girls between 10 and 12 would be exposed to the image and perpetuate the myth that you had to be thin to be healthy. 'Let's ask Glassons to have a diverse range of women's shapes and sizes that portray much more everyday New Zealand women. Let's be real.'","The mannequin was spotted by Emily Robbins, a university student, inside an Auckland retain store in New Zealand .

"A Baltimore teacher is under fire after a cellphone video emerged of her fighting a 17-year-old student, slamming the girl against a locker and threatening to kill her. The beginning of the video, taken last Friday and obtained by local stations WBAL and WBFF, shows the girl shoving a chair in the teacher’s direction inside a classroom at Carver Vocational-Technical High in west Baltimore. The 17-year-old senior reportedly became upset after the female teacher ordered her to stop using her cellphone during an exam. Scroll down for video . Hallway brawl: This cellphone video shows a Baltimore teacher attacking a female student, with a male classmate caught in the middle . Shocking behavior: The teacher, seen here pushing a boy trying to break up the fight, has been placed on administrative leave . Fisticuffs: The teacher slammed the 17-year-old senior against a locker yelling at her, 'I'll kill you in here' A video taken inside the classroom last Friday shows the teen pushing a swivel chair at the teacher and then throwing an object, believed to be a keyboard, at her before storming off. The argument between the teacher and student quickly escalated and spilled outside the classroom into the hallway, where the teen hurled a book at the woman. That is when the grainy footage shows the teacher charge the girl as a tall male student tries to intervene, but to no avail. Later, the recording captures the enraged educator slamming the 17-year-old against a locker and pulling on her long hair. At one point, she is heard yelling at the girl, ‘I’ll kill you in here,’ followed by expletives. City schools spokeswoman Anne Fullerton said the teacher was treated for minor injuries and was placed on administrative leave pending an internal and external investigation. The student, she said, was charged with assault and released to a parent. The girl’s family told WBFF they are outraged by what the video shows. ‘You’re supposed to be a role model to these children and you took your shoes off and physically was fighting her like you was outside on the street?’ said Nikia Jones, the student’s aunt. Nancy Jones, the girl’s grandmother, said it does not matter if a student is a problem child. ‘You don’t expect nobody to fight her like that,’ she said. Place of learning: The altercation took place at Carver Vocational-Technical High in west Baltimore . Not a class act: The teacher and student came to blows after the girl pushed a chair towards the educator and slammed an item down on her desk for telling her to stop using her cellphone . The violent altercation has divided the Carver community, with some parents siding with the teacher, while other saying she should not have resorted to violence. ‘Somebody throw something at me, that’s just your natural reaction,’ Tanya Thompson told CBS Baltimore. ‘No one is going to just stand there and let someone assault them.’ But Baltimore parent Earl Halstead said the teacher should have conducted herself in a more professional manner. ‘If there were no weapons or nothing involved, I feel the teacher could have tamed the student better than she did,’ he said.","The brawl took place at Carver Vocational-Technical High School in west Baltimore .

"Reports suggest Paypal is gearing up to purchase mobile payment service Square. The talks come as Paypal prepares to split from eBay in 2015, allowing it to take on competitors like Apply Pay more easily. And by purchasing Square, the company seems to be gearing up to give its users access to faster and easier transactions. Paypal (stock image of app shown) is gearing up to acquire San Francisco-based start-up Square, which lets people make payments over their phone by linking their cards. A recent valuation suggests it is worth more than £3.8bn ($6bn). The mobile service would help Paypal take on competitors like Apple Pay . According to Bank Innovation the talks are in early stages but have been described as 'serious'. With Paypal apparently looking to move into the mobile payments business, the merger would allow the company to get a leg up on its competition. San Francisco-based Square lets users make payments via their phone. Square lets merchants accept credit-card payments over mobile phones and tablets with smaller fees than they had been paying via traditional credit-card networks. It offers a number of services including Square Order, which lets businesses see when a customer using the app is approaching. The app can tell a barista at a coffee shop, for example, when you are coming in, thanks to your phone's GPS. They can then have your favourite coffee ready and waiting - and the app can even pay the bill using your stored credit card information. Square Cash, meanwhile, lets users send up to £160 ($250) a week to any email address, on any email provider without the need to sign up and manage an account each time. A debit or credit card can be linked to your device, and money can then be sent to any email address or other services. It was founded in 2009 by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. The first app and service for Square launched in 2010, and it is now predicted to be worth more than £3.8 billion ($6 billion). That’s based on a recent valuation after they raised $150 million, reported the New York Times. The merger would seemingly help both in the face of mounting competition from Apple Pay and elsewhere. CEO Jack Dorsey took to Twitter to deny that any merger was imminent, saying the news was ‘false’. However Bank Innovation notes that the company denied similar reports that Google was attempting to acquire the company earlier this year, despite confirmations from elsewhere. PayPal's impending split from long-time partner eBay, meanwhile, is expected to ratchet up its appeal to online retail competitors such as Amazon.com and give it the freedom to aggressively take on new mobile pay challenger Apple Pay. And it will also give it more opportunities to make acquisitions such as this one of Square, if the merger turns out to be true. CEO Jack Dorsey says the news of a merger is 'false'. The reports come as Paypal prepares to split from eBay next year.Square Cash lets users send up to £160 ($250) a week to any email address, on any email provider without the need to sign up and manage an account each time .

"Facebook has turned over evidence to police from two profiles set up by a teenager accused of shooting dead his parents and sister in a bid to get his inheritance. Alan Hruby, 19, allegedly gunned down his dad John Hruby, 50, mother Tinker Hruby, 48, and his 17-year-old sister Katherine Hruby at their home in Duncan, Oklahoma in October. He later admitted to killing them to get $3,000 to pay off loan sharks. Posts on his Facebook pages reportedly suggest a dislike for his family, while other messages online boast about his 'shopaholic' habits and his joy at swiping his credit card. On October 14, the district attorney's chief investigator was granted permission from a judge to collect data from his Facebook pages, the Oklahoman reported. Locked up: Alan Hruby, 19, allegedly shot dead his parents and sister in October so that he could get his inheritance to pay off a loan shark. Authorities now have access to his Facebook pages . Victims: He allegedly shot dead his sister Katherine, 17, dad John, 50, and mother Tinker, 48, in their home . The investigator said police had received information that Hruby had posted comments on the page indicating that he didn't like his family - but it is not yet known if these comments were indeed found. On one of the pages made under the option of 'Public Figure', he called himself 'an up and comer from Oklahoma' who was 'striving for the best life has to offer'. The 19-year-old college freshman also claimed to be 'represented' by a public relations company in Oklahoma City and a modeling agency in Oklahoma City. Investigators are likely collecting evidence from Twitter, Instagram and his blog, the Oklahoman reported, but a gagging order is in place so authorities can not share any further details. Ego: On one of his Facebook pages, the teenager called himself 'an up and comer from Oklahoma' Social: His other pages, including Instagram, may also be under investigation, according to reports . Cold: After killing his family, he stayed in a hotel and shared images of him and his friends hanging out . In his blog, he described himself as a shopaholic. 'There is no bigger rush then getting to the register at a store and swiping your credit card,' he wrote. 'And in that moment you are waiting for the screen to say, ""Approved"", you start to get heart palpitations and you get a rush of adrenaline. 'By the time she is handing your stuff to you, you are so high on adrenaline, the $15,000 total does not even phase you until you've gotten home and seen the receipts.' Hruby clearly enjoyed the finer things in life - often posting images of expensive trips, drinks and luxury watches and cars to his Instagram page. Prosecutors have described Hruby as a money-obsessed teen who, by his own admission, 'had been cut off financially … due to an abundance of spending in recent times,' People reported. It also emerged that he had racked up debts after allegedly pinching his grandmother's credit card, and later used a credit card not belonging to him while he was in Paris. Money-obsessed: Hruby, who had been financially cut off by his parents, called himself a shopaholic online . Flashy: He shared boastful images online, including this one showing off his watch in front of the Eiffel Tower . Motive: He allegedly told authorities he killed his family for his inheritance to pay off a loan shark . Rap sheet: He was previously in trouble with the cops for using a credit card that wasn't his in Europe . After his arrest for the murder of his family, Hruby said he owed a loan shark $3,000 and was hoping to pay it off by inheriting money. He said he killed his sister so he would be the sole heir. His parents had recently cut him off financially, and a search of his dorm room also turned up multiple stolen checks. Hruby has since been charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the October 9 shootings. On the night of the murders, he made a point a point of saying he was at his dorm at The University of Oklahoma on his social media accounts. Hruby then checked into a room at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas while the University of Oklahoma played the University of Texas in a football match nearby - and acted as though nothing had happened. 'Nothing that he said or did ever raised any suspicion from me,' friend Andrew Bormann said. Victims: His parents, Tinker and John, were shot dead inside their home in Duncan, Oklahoma on October 9 . Missed: He killed his sister Katherine, a member of her high school's volleyball team, to be the sole heir . Scene: Their dead bodies were found four days later by a housekeeper at their Oklahoma home, pictured . 'Every time I saw him on the weekend, he was happy and laughing and having a good time. Even early Monday morning, 1am, he was laughing and joking with me as we were studying.' People started getting concerned about the family when John, the publisher of the local newspaper The Marlow Review, did not show up for work on Friday morning. His wife also worked there. Mr Hruby also failed to cover the weekly high school football game that he always attends, according to his employees. A housekeeper eventually found the cold bodies of the family in the kitchen of their home, four days after they were shot dead. Hruby is being held without bond. Prosecutors have said they will be considering the death penalty.","Alan Hruby, 19, 'shot dead his father John, 50, mother Tinker, 48, and 17-year-old sister Katherine in their Oklahoma home in October'

"A temporary piece of artwork painted onto Mt Snowdon in celebration of the area's sheep-farming community has been turned into 'graffiti' after it failed to 'wash away' in the rain. The 100ft mural - which consisted of a poem written by Wales' national poet - was painted onto a cliff face near Gladstone Rock as part of The Gathering, an outdoor performance staged by the National Theatre of Wales. The four-hour performance used the national park's landscape to tell the story of ancient farming techniques and involved herding the audience around the mountain. The poem, one of the main features of the production, was meant to 'wash off' in the rain once the performances were over - a crucial caveat when the artwork was granted permission. A temporary 100ft mural of a poem used in an outdoor theatre performance has been labelled as 'graffiti' after it failed to wash away in the rain from the lower slopes of Mt Snowdon . But now the mural has been branded as 'graffiti' after a hotter-than-average summer left the paint to be imprinted onto the rock. The NTW told MailOnline it was 'genuinely sorry' that the removal of the paint is taking 'longer than anticipated'. But John Harold, director of the Snowdonia Society, said the mural had left permanent damage on the base of the mountain and that the episode showed a lack of consideration for the national park. He said: 'We have some sympathy with the National Theatre for Wales. They had an idea and they asked the relevant people for permission. But I just do not think the relevant guidance was really that good. 'It does look rather like graffiti - it's hard to call it anything else. 'We would hope lessons are learned and that more respect and consideration is given in the future to the landscape  that, at least in part, they (the theatre) were celebrating.' The mural formed part of The Gathering, an outdoor production staged in the national park by the National Theatre of Wales . Permission was given for the mural by the National Trust, which owns the land, on the basis the paint would wash off in the rain. But attempts by the NTW to clear it away - and 'return the site to its original state - have so far failed. Mr Harold says there have been two types of damage caused by the mural. He said the aesthetics of the rock have not only been ruined, but that is has had long-term damage on the environment. He said there is centuries-old lichen growing on the rock, which will be unavoidably removed in the aggressive cleaning process. He added: 'By all accounts it was a great event which is why what has happened is a real shame. But the national park is a very precious resource, it's our world-famous brand and it's precious for all its features. The mural was painted onto a cliff face near Gladstone Rock in Snowdonia National Park, shown here above . 'A really wonderful event has unfortunately left a very bad taste.' James Arnold, recently climbing in the area on holiday, told the Independent: 'They are left with probably the biggest piece of graffiti in the UK in a national park, and it looks awful.' A spokesman for the National Theatre for Wales said: 'The poetry written on the rock face near Hafod y Llan was part of National Theatre Wales’ production The Gathering/Yr Helfa. 'The production involved a series of temporary installations, developed in collaboration with Hafod y Llan farm and the National Trust, highlighting the life and activity of the farm. 'The intention with all the installations was to return the whole site to its original state. Despite detailed research, the removal of the poetry on the rock face is taking longer than anticipated. 'Following consultation with the National Trust, the words in this installation were written in a natural, clay-based paint, which is non-harmful. After the performance, the vast majority of the paint was removed, but some of the words remained visible. 'A team has begun a second phase of cleaning the site this week, according to the expert advice we have been given. We are loath to make any attempts to clean the rock in any way that is not recommended by ecologists, though we are seeking further advice. 'We will repeat this cleaning process until all the paint has been removed. 'We are genuinely sorry that it is taking this long, but it is our priority to put things right as soon as possible. A National Trust spokesman said: 'This National Theatre Wales production of Yr Helfa/The Gathering was a powerful depiction of life in the hills, and shone a light on the work and dramatic landscape of this iconic part of Wales. 'Naturally as such a special corner of Wales and a Site of Specific Scientific Interest (S.S.S.I) the theatre were very thorough in all their four years of community work and research. The production team worked closely with all the relevant authorities to ensure that the materials used would cause no harm to the surroundings. 'National Poet of Wales Gillian Clarke’s poem was written on bare rock with a non harmful clay based product designed to wash away in the rain. 'However, the unseasonably dry weather in September has meant that her powerful words have remained visible longer than expected. With Autumn now upon us nature can take its course and continue to wash away the poem.'","National Theatre of Wales hosted four-hour show called The Gathering .

"A  mother-of-two has detailed her transition away from the typical 'tiger mom' parenting she used to employ in favor of a more relaxed and nurturing approach. Tanith Carey, 47, a journalist based in London, admits she academically over-stretched her daughter Lily, now 12, to the point where she became anxious, self-critical, and was actually under-performing. 'The stressed and anxious kids of today are the depressed adults of tomorrow,' she tells MailOnline. 'Tiger parenting wrecks family life and it ruins our enjoyment of parenting. It's heartbreaking.' Scroll down for video . Reformed: Tanith Carey, 47, (pictured) admits she academically over-stretched her daughter Lily, now 12, to the point where she became anxious and self-critical, but has since changed her ways . Ms Carey's competitive streak first made itself known when Lily was just two years old, while the family was living in New York and Lily had just been denied a place at Manhattan’s elite International Preschool. At the time, according to a piece written by Jane Ridley for The New York Post, Ms Carey was 'devastated' over the rejection. Now she 'shudders' when she remembers how much she let it get to her, and how inadequate she felt as a mother. The next few years in New York were a flurry of prestigious schools, expensive private tutors and jam-packed after-school activities schedules. Phew: 'Now there is no longer tension and expectation, Lily has got rid of those negative voices,' says Ms Carey, pictured with her daughter Clio, nine, (left), husband Anthony (center right) and Lily (right) Smiles: 'Tiger parenting backfires ultimately because while we think we are ""improving"" our children, in fact, over-stretched, anxious kids don’t learn,' Ms Carey says, pictured with Clio (left) and Lily (right) Ms Carey, a working mom, claims she once supplied her nanny with a 20-page instructions manual to keep Lily and her other daughter Clio, now nine, on track. 'I asked her to play Bach and Mozart in the background while [they were] eating breakfast,' she said. 'They went to every toddler music, ballet and art class I could find.' It wasn't until Lily was seven years old and in second grade at a private school back in London that Ms Carey got her wake-up call. Lily had won a science prize, but rather than be happy, she fled the ceremony 'in tears.' Ironically, it was an educational psychologist Ms Carey had hired who advised her to relax the reins and to drop the intensive after-school learning centers Lily had been attending. 'Tiger parenting backfires ultimately because while we think we are ""improving"" our children, in fact, over-stretched, anxious kids don’t learn,' she tells us. 'One of the most worrying things is that kids internalize critical voices in their own heads because they are constantly told they ""must do better"" in this hot-house educational environment.' Ms Carey, who claims her own parents weren't strict with her at all, points to a specific area of Lily's education as having caused the young girl anxiety in the past: math. She had simply made her mind up that she was 'rubbish' at it and was having serious trouble overcoming her mental block; a time during which she had a private math tutor, and when Ms Carey was in the habit of standing over her at homework time. 'Now there is no longer that tension and expectation around the subject, and she has got rid of those negative voices, she is actually excelling in that subject,' Ms Carey reports. 'The other day she came home beaming because she scored 78per cent in her math test – something that was unheard of a few years ago - and that was completely down to her and nothing to do with me.' Tiger queen: Amy Chua, a 52-year-old mom and Yale Law School professor, prompted a widespread backlash after her memoir was released, with critics blasting her extreme parenting approach . Antithesis: Ms Carey's book (left) deals with taming tiger parenting, whereas Ms Chua's (right) champions strict rules and high expectations in regards to her daughters . Where once Ms Carey's first questions when her kids got home from school every day centered around tests or performance, she now focuses on different aspects. 'Now I am more interested in hearing about what games they played and how they got along with their friends,' she says. 'And now when I am with my kids, it’s not about constantly looking for ""teachable moments."" It’s just about being together.' Even when Ms Carey feels her perfectionist urges come on, she manages to turn her thinking round. 'It’s just not fair on kids to make them run a race they didn’t ask to compete in,' she remarks. Ms Carey's book, Taming The Tiger Parent, is at definite odds with a well-known book released by infamous tiger mom Amy Chua in 2011, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. Ms Chua, a 52-year-old Yale Law School professor and mom to two daughters, prompted a widespread backlash after the memoir was released, with critics blasting her extreme parenting approach. 'I was raised by very strict Chinese immigrant parents,' Ms Chua writes on her website. 'As parents, they demanded total respect and were very tough with my three younger sisters and me. 'We got in trouble for A minuses, had to drill math and piano every day, no sleepovers, no boyfriends. 'But the strategy worked with me.... that’s why I tried to raise my own two daughters the same way my parents raised me.' Ms Carey, who has read the book, isn't so sure. 'I really admired Amy's honesty,' she says. 'But it was one of the things that got the ball rolling for me. 'It showed how pushy parenting can alienate parents from their children, something that she experienced with her second daughter.' Indeed, Ms Chua writes of Lulu: 'My younger daughter seemed to turn against everything I stood for and it felt like I was losing her and everything was falling apart. At 13, she rebelled.' Ms Chua may have been very open about her tiger parenting, but many moms have a habit of keeping their methods behind closed doors, suggests Ms Carey. 'These parents - I call them 'swans' - aim to ensure their children do better than everyone else’s,' she says. 'But to make it look as if it’s all by magic – and done without any pushing or tutoring - because their offspring are genetically blessed.' Now that Lily, who is thriving, is left more to her own devices, she has developed a love for playing the violin. Her sister Clio is doing well too. 'I believe and hope that truly being themselves, rather than living up to my expectations, has made both my children happier and more resilient,' Ms Carey concludes.

"A millionaire socialite who is on trial for force-feeding her autistic son a fatal dose of drugs emailed her financial adviser as she watched him die, a court heard yesterday. Gigi Jordan, 54, forced a cocktail of crushed pills and orange juice down the throat of eight-year-old Jude Mirra in a $2,300-a-night suite at Manhattan's exclusive Peninsula hotel. As he lay dying on the bed next to her, she then reportedly emailed adviser Patrick Walsh, saying: 'Hi Pat, can you please wire $125,000 to Bruce as requested below?'. Mother and son: Gigi Jordan (right), 54, forced a cocktail of crushed pills and orange juice down the throat of her eight-year-old son, Jude Mirra (left), in a $2,300-a-night suite at Manhattan's exclusive Peninsula Hotel . Standing trial: As Jude (right) lay dying on the bed next to her, Jordan (pictured, left, in court) then reportedly emailed adviser Patrick Walsh, saying: 'Hi Pat, can you please wire $125,000 to Bruce as requested below?' She hoped to siphon the large sum of cash from her son's trust fund into one of her business accounts, prosecutors said. Although Jordan has never disputed feeding the fatal drugs to Jude, she has described her actions in the luxury hotel room on Fifth Avenue in February 2010 as a 'mercy killing'. However, prosecutors said the pharmaceutical executive's emails contradicted her defense lawyer's assertions that she was 'emotionally distraught' at her son's autism. Instead, Jordan wanted to live the life of the socialite and not be tied down by a young son who required so much attention because of his condition, said lead prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos. Aim: Jordan hoped to siphon cash from her son's trust into one of her business accounts, prosecutors said . Scene of the crime: Although Jordan has never disputed feeding the drugs to Jude, she has described her actions in the luxury hotel room on Fifth Avenue as a 'mercy killing'. Above, the Peninsula hotel on Fifth Avenue . During yesterday's trial, Mr Walsh claimed that Jordan was a demanding, high-maintenance client who often made 'unreasonable' requests, according to the New York Post. 'My job was to deal with that, but most requests she would make I think would be considered unreasonable,' he told the court. When asked about the times Jordan reportedly transferred money from her son's account into her own, Mr Walsh replied: 'If she wanted to use it for her own personal use, we would not stop her from doing that.' Jordan currently has a pending civil suit against the financial adviser, whom she claims helped her ex-husband steal millions of dollars from her. Devastating: Prosecutors said the pharmaceutical executive's emails contradicted her  lawyer's assertions that she was 'emotionally distraught' at her son's autism. Above, emergency crews take away Jude's body . Allegations: In addition to his medical condition, Jordan alleges that her son's (pictured) biological father, and her second husband, Emil Tzekov, had been sexually abusing the boy since he was an infant . During an earlier hearing, the court heard that Jordan had also balanced her checkbook after forcing the lethal concoction of pills down her son's throat. 'Ms. Jordan is so distraught, so emotional, so emotionally disturbed that she balances her checkbook in that room on her bed with her dead child only a few feet away,' Mr Bogdanos told jurors. The mother then reportedly attempted to take her own life by consuming a mixture of pills and Grey Goose vodka. Jordan, who faces up to life in prison if convicted of murder, is pictured at an earlier court appearance . But she was foiled when members of law enforcement kicked down the door to the room and found her on the floor incoherent and babbling. She immediately said to one officer, 'I want a lawyer', the court heard. In his opening statement, Allan Brenner, defending, said Jordan was a caring, loving and devoted mother who was terrified of the suffering her son was going through. In addition to his medical condition, Jordan alleges that her son's biological father, and her second husband, Emil Tzekov, had been sexually abusing the boy since he was an infant. She also claims that her first husband, Ray Mirra, had threatened to murder her and the boy if she turned him in to authorities for selling black market prescription drugs. Neither Tzekov, who has strongly denied the allegations, nor Mirra have ever been charged with a crime. Mr Brenner plans to argue that Jordan killed her son while in the grip of an extreme emotional disturbance, which would allow the jury to convict her of manslaughter rather than murder. Killing a person to save them from future abuse has never been a recognized defense to murder in the state of New York. Jordan, who according to the New York Times has gone through 11 defense lawyers since she was charged over four years ago, faces up to life in prison if convicted. The trial is expected to last until November.","Gigi Jordan, 54, force-fed her son Jude Mirra fatal cocktail of pills and juice .

"The Earl of Cardigan has failed in a bid to block the sale of the  ancestral home which has been in his family for almost 200 years for £11.25million. Trustees of the estate are looking to sell Tottenham House, a 100-room mansion in the 4,500-acre Savernake Estate in Wiltshire. The Earl, who lives in a different house on the estate and is currently living on his £71-a-week Jobseekers' Allowance, took the case to the Court of Appeal as he tried to stand in the way of the sale of the mansion. The Earl of Cardigan failed in a bid to block the £11.25m sale of Tottenham House, Wiltshire, which has been in his family for nearly 200 years . Trustees hope to sell the 100-room mansion on the Savernake Estate, but the Earl, 60, took the case to the Court of Appeal . But three appeal judges, Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lady Justice Black and Lord Justice Vos, unanimously agreed to dismiss the Earl's objections. Lord Justice Vos said Tottenham House was decaying fast and had been largely unoccupied since the 1990s. He added that 'everyone now agrees it must be sold - what is in dispute is the process by which the sale should be achieved'. The judge said the trustees of the Savernake Estate were seeking approval 'for their momentous decision' to sell Tottenham House to an unnamed buyer, known only as Mr A, for £11.25m. They said the sale price was 'a good one that represents an opportunity not to be missed'. But the Earl, 60, said the price was 'inadequate.' He had wanted the trustees removed 'broadly on the grounds that they are unfit to act'. After an earlier hearing at the High Court, the Earl said that once the case was over he would 'turn my hand to finding another hotelier who wants to make Tottenham House a very elegant hotel that befits the building'. The Earl, pictured with his second wife Joanne, Countess Cardigan, said the £11.25m sale price was 'inadequate' The trustees, John Moore, a barrister’s clerk, and Wilson Cotton, an accountant, were appointed by the Earl when he moved to America for four years. But when he returned they refused to give up control of the estate, leading him to take legal action. The bitter dispute that followed has seen the trustees make at least 14 criminal allegations against him, ranging from damaging pheasant feeders to spitting at them, although none of the charges resulted in a conviction. Last year, property tycoon Jamie Ritblat was reportedly in discussions with the trustees to buy the Grade I-listed, 19th Century Palladian mansion.","The Earl of Cardigan's loses bid to block the sale of his ancestral home .

"Chelsea legend Frank Lampard is likely to play alongside a crop of Manchester City’s best young starlets when he joins new MLS franchise New York City. Lampard, 36, is expected to confirm this week he is signing for NYC having been released by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho at the end of last season. It is a huge boost for north America’s MLS which is gaining new respect after the recent performances of the USA in the World Cup and has attracted other big-name players like Thierry Henry, Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Frank Lampard reliving more than 200 of his career goals . New beginning: Frank Lampard is set to sign for New York City after his contract at Chelsea ended in June . Legend: Lampard is Chelsea's all-time leading goalscorer and won the Champions League there . The new season kicks off in early 2015 and Lampard may spend the intervening months in Australia on loan with Melbourne City. Lampard scored a record 211 goals for Chelsea but his next club NYCFC is part-owned by Manchester City chief Sheikh Mansour. They have already signed Spanish World Cup winner David Villa from Atletico Madrid. The club’s director of soccer operations, former Manchester City and USA star Claudio Reyna, acknowledges their relationship with the Premier League champions may lead to under-21 players from Manchester playing for NYCFC. ‘There are some very talented players,’ said Reyna about the Manchester City youngsters. ‘That could help us, all those things we're weighing up. ‘There's synergy between the three teams (also including Melbourne City FC), but nothing is being forced upon us at all.’ Among the youngsters who could be used are Swedish striker John Guidetti and 18-year-old Portuguese whizzkid Marcos Lopes.

"Rory McIlroy admits that his unwanted habit of turning in awful second-round scores has 'got into my head' ahead of The Open. The Northern Irishman is searching for his third major title this week but arrives at Hoylake on the back of a disappointing Scottish Open, in which he began with a then course record 64 before seeing his victory hopes disappear after collapsing to a shocking 78 the next day. It is the latest in a string of poor second-round scores which have scuppered his chances at high-profile tournaments and McIlroy admitted at a press conference on Tuesday morning that his Friday scoring is becoming a problem. 'I'd like to stop it this week,' said the 25-year-old Northern Irishman. 'It's got into my head and I've been going out on Friday trying to back up my score. VIDEO Scroll down for Tiger Woods and Rory Mcilroy prepare for The Open . Improvement: Rory McIlroy admitted he is concerned by his poor second-round scores . Looking up: The Northern Irishman is hoping to improve at Hoylake this week for The Open . The biggest concern, however, could be that McIlroy seemed uncertain just how he was going to do so. 'I've . got to go out and pretend it's a Thursday again,‘ he said, before . adding: ‘I don't know. I've got to go out and play, play a few solid . holes and get the round underway. Hopefully this week I can turn around . that second round thing.' The . former US Open and US PGA champion added: 'I have been caught out by a . bad stretch of holes at every tournament this year. I just need to . eliminate that. It's easier to eliminate the bad stuff than find the . good stuff.' Preparation: McIlroy practices his putting at Hoylake ahead of The Open this week . Those second . round woes have cost McIlroy either victory or a chance of contending . for the top prize at the Masters, Wells Fargo Championship, The Players . and the Memorial Tournament. But despite that bizarre Friday feeling, . McIlroy insists he is in top form ahead of The Open and in the best . position he has ever been to battle for the Claret Jug. For . a player who once shot a scarcely believable 61 at Royal Portrush - one . of the toughest links of them all - McIlroy’s record in The Open is . poor for a player of such immense talent. A third at St Andrews in 2010 . is his only top-10 in The Open, while he raged against the capricious . nature of links golf after struggling at Royal St George’s a year later . and missed the cut at Muirfield 12 months ago.

McIlroy appeared to be in a positive frame of mind on Tuesday ahead of . his latest attempt to master golf by the British seaside at Hoylake. 'I . feel as prepared as I ever have coming in to the Open Championship,’ he . said. ‘I had a good week in Aberdeen in preparation for The Open. I was . a little disappointed with my finish. I had one not so good round. But . my game is in good shape. 'My record in the Open isn't as good as I'd like. I want to do something about that this week.’ 'The . Open is special - it's the only major played outside the United States, . it's on links, it has the oldest and richest history of all of them. It . would be great to put my name on the Claret Jug one day. It would be . the third leg of a career grand slam. Not many players have done that. I . would love to get my name on the trophy.'

"Scotland's Peter Whiteford will hope to turn his season around when he goes head to head with Englishman David Horsey in the final round of the Russian Open on Sunday. The 33-year-old fired a six-under-par 66 in the third round at Tseleevo Golf and Polo Club to rein in Horsey, who signed for a 70, and at 13 under the pair are four shots clear of Scotland's Scott Jamieson (69), Italian Andrea Pavan (64) and Belgian Thomas Pieters (72). Whiteford, who is 190th in The Race to Dubai having only made four cuts all season, had a brilliant front nine, notching five birdies and an eagle against one dropped shot, and then played the back nine in level par. Lady luck: Peter Whiteford is hoping his fortunes change on Sunday . 'I had an amazing start,' Whiteford told the European Tour website. 'I holed a bunker shot on the first and then chipped in on the third. Dave chipped in as well - he stole some of my glory there! So I got off to a flyer and then the back nine I was just hanging on for dear life. 'The swing didn't feel great at all to be honest. I'm hoping I wake up with a better swing. I had a lot of good luck. 'On the 15th I hit my tee shot straight into the forest - it's a tricky shot straight into the wind from an elevated tee which is never going to add up to much fun - but it bounced back out onto the fairway. 'Hopefully I haven't used up all my luck. The back nine was tougher today - the stretch from 10 to 13 is where you might slip up.Â . 'I'm not . confident at all but that front nine today helps massively and I'm glad . Dave and I have put a bit of breathing space between us and the next . guys. It might be a bit like match play on the front nine tomorrow.' Competition: David Horsey will come up against Scotland's Whiteford . Horsey, who had led by four shots after the second day, said: 'Pete started like a train and I was just trying to tell myself to concentrate on my own game. 'It wasn't that easy out there today and I certainly didn't see a five or six under through nine holes. I just kept reminding myself to stay patient and concentrate on my own game, not what Pete was doing. 'I was disappointed not to birdie the eighth and then bogey the ninth - three under at the turn would have been nice. But then I birdied the 10th and 11th and tried to get back to the thought process that I've had the first two days. 'I didn't quite maintain it that well on the back nine but I kept myself in there and hopefully it will be a little better tomorrow.'","Scotland's Peter Whiteford will come up against England's David Horsey .

"There appear to be noises that another Belgian is set to arrive in the Premier League? Are we starting a colony? Calm down. But yes, a trio of English clubs led by Liverpool are monitoring Zakaria Bakkali, PSV Eindhoven’s 18-year-old forward as he develops his game in the Eredivisie. Tottenham and Arsenal are also said to admire him. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bakkali hit a superb hat-trick for PSV in the Eredivisie . Teenage kicks: Zakaria Bakkali (R) is being monitored by Liverpool, Arsenal and Totenham . Top Gunn: Arsene Wenger . Red leader: Brendan Rodgers . Hot Spur: Mauricio Pochettino . So is any bid likely this summer? The suggestion is that offers could wait until next year but interest from Valencia could prompt action. Why is he on the radar of these clubs? Having impressed at various age levels he burst to prominence with a hat-trick against NEC in August last season aged just 17 years and 196 days. It made him the youngest player to score three goals in a game in the history of the Dutch top-flight. His strikes were all high quality too; his first a left-foot shot arrowed in off the bar, his second a well-placed effort from distance, his third a precise curler from his right boot after a smart dribble. Three s the magic number: The PSV Eindhoven forward celebrates scoring a hat-trick against NEC . Some statement. Did it prompt international recognition? Yes, Marc Wilmots called him up for Belgium and he made his debut in the World Cup qualifier against Wales last October, coming on as a 78th minute substitute for Everton’s Kevin Mirallas. The appearance ended speculation about which country he would represent given his parents are Moroccan. But like Marouane Fellaini, Bakkali chose the country of his birth. That begs the question – where was he born and how did he come to Holland so young? Bakkali was born in Liege, and represented Standard Liege until moving to PSV at the tender age of 12 to join their academy. Take a bow: Bakkali was given his Belgium debut against wales in October 2013 . So what is his style and what are his stats? Standing at under 5ft 5in tall, Bakkali has been compared to Sergio Aguero for bustling running and sharp shooting. He is extremely quick and possesses rapid acceleration as well as close ball control skills. He likes to run at players, cut in from the wings, and strike with either foot. He impressed on his debut for PSV, a Champions League qualifier against Belgian club Zulte-Waregem, and scored in the second leg. He has been used intermittently since his breakthrough as he progresses, with three goals in 16 Eredivisie appearances. Across various youth levels for Belgium his return is 18 goals in 26 games.

Kim Luan, who is part of the M'Nong ethnic group from central Vietnam, has now become inseparable from her pet elephant and the two are best friends.

He said: 'Elephants are considered members of the community - everything related to them must follow M'Nong traditions. 'As a foreigner I was very surprised to see this bond but for the M'Nong minority group it's common to have an elephant in the garden - just like we might have a cat. 'I felt the respect between both. The girl was more scared of me than the elephant.' The photographer has lived in Vietnam for seven years, capturing some 45,000 photos of the country. But this is the first time he has witnessed such interaction between M'Nong and their elephants. He added: 'It's not dangerous for her - the elephants are peaceful until you try to do wrong with them. 'But M'Nong live in nature with elephants and know how to keep them quiet. 'It's unique, plus the M'Nong don't really wear traditional costume anymore which makes the photos more special.'","A Vietnamese girl has tamed a fully grown wild elephant and keeps it as a pet .

"Mystery deepens as an autopsy concludes that a bear found dead in Central Park on Monday was most likely run over and killed by a vehicle.

After lighting the fires, Noble would alert authorities to their whereabouts, then arrive himself to help put them out. But he was caught after police grew suspicious over the speeds he was appearing to the flames. In 2012, Noble lit the first fire on his way home from a dinner one night at Dyalson RSL club, along along Gorokan Road, in Wyee. Two weeks later he struck at Dyce Road, Wyee. The frequency and severity of his arson attacks quickly grew. In October 2013, Noble was responsible for a blaze that ripped through the Catherine Hill Bay area, north of Sydney. The blaze burned for weeks before winds pushed it through the beachside town. It later destroyed the iconic Wallarah House and the Jetty Master's Cottage,  threatening hundreds of lives. Newcastle Herald reported that at Nobel's sentencing, the defence council member Mandy Hull said he had 'expressed genuine sorrow and remorse for his actions and was disappointed with himself for letting the Rural Fire Service down.'

"Britain should have no fear of quitting the European Union, which could ‘open up opportunities’ for the country, a senior Tory minister says today. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. ‘I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all,’ he told the Daily Mail in a wide-ranging interview. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. He said it could 'open opportunities' The Tories’ pledge to give people their first say on Britain’s place in Europe for nearly 40 years – and a commitment to stop European human rights judges interfering in British law – will be centrepieces of the party’s pitch at next year’s general election. The Prime Minister will unveil plans to curtail the role of the controversial European Court of Human Rights in the UK at the final Conservative Party conference before the election, which starts this weekend in Birmingham. He is expected to pledge to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. Mr Cameron will promise a mechanism which will establish pre-eminence for Britain’s Parliament and Supreme Court, allowing them to over-ride Strasbourg rulings, according to sources. Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by the end of 2017. ‘We have reason to be confident,’ he said. ‘Look at what we have already achieved – getting us out of the EU bailout fund, reducing the budget of the EU, vetoing a treaty.’ But the Culture Secretary went further than Mr Cameron on the possibility of an exit, insisting Britain could prosper outside the EU. ‘If you said to me: “Are you worried or frightened or concerned that the British people might vote to leave?”, that doesn’t frighten me,’ Mr Javid said. The Culture Secretary backed Prime Minister David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by 2017 . ‘We should have a referendum on in/out, and if the British people decide Britain is better off outside, I would respect that decision. I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all.’ The European Convention on Human Rights, which is enshrined in British law by the Human Rights Act, has become increasingly unpopular with most Conservatives. Critics say the Strasbourg court has roamed way beyond its remit and created new rights never intended by the founders of the convention – such as its recent attempt to insist Britain must overturn a blanket ban on prisoners voting in elections. The ECHR has also been cited by dozens of people fighting deportation, who have argued its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights to be considered, including the right to a family life. Mr Cameron is understood to be convinced that much anti-European sentiment is due to Strasbourg rulings preventing the removal of foreign-born criminals and terror suspects, though the convention and the court in fact have nothing to do with Brussels. Two of the Government’s biggest defenders of the court – former Attorney General Dominic Grieve and veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke – were sacked in the Prime Minister’s Cabinet reshuffle this summer. ‘This issue is now going to be dealt with,’ said one government source. Tory strategists also hope a harder line on human rights laws will help win over disaffected voters considering backing Ukip.","Sajid Javid said he's not concerned about Britain's prospect outside of EU .

"After working decades to build a wildly successful firearms company, Gaston Glock conspired with associates to push out his ex-wife and business partner of almost 50 years and steal millions of dollars she was entitled to, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Atlanta. They participated in a worldwide racketeering scheme over decades aimed at taking money from Helga Glock, who was divorced from her husband in 2011, through various criminal methods, including improper royalty payments, laundering money through fraudulent billing companies, and sham lease and loan agreements, the lawsuit claims. A woman who answered the phone Thursday in the media relations department at Glock Inc., the company's U.S. headquarters, referred questions to the company's lawyer but then hung up before giving a name or contact number. She did not answer when called back and did not immediately respond to a voice message. Gun battle: Helga Glock is suing her billionaire gun maker ex husband Gaston Glock over claims he bilked the family out of their inheritance through scheming and shell companies around the globe . Several lawyers who have previously represented Glock Inc. in legal disputes did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The lawsuit details what it claims are the exploits of a man who regularly engaged in unscrupulous business practices and kept a stash of 'fun money' used to 'cavort with women around the world,' going so far as to buy homes for some mistresses in the Atlanta area. Glock's actions toward his family 'resemble the senseless and self-destructive rage of Shakespeare's King Lear, when he foolishly mistreats a loyal but candid daughter, Cordelia, in favor of cunning and ruthless flatterers,' the lawsuit says. 'Perhaps neither pathology nor psychology can provide a satisfactory explanation for why an aging billionaire would spend his twilight years seeking to terrorize members of his own family.' Other defendants include companies owned by Glock around the world and several former Glock executives. The Glock suit spiel: Mrs. Glock accuses him and his associates in a lawsuit of conspiring to cheat her out of up to $500 million. The lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Atlanta names as defendants: Gaston Glock, several of his associates, the Austria-based company and a number of its international entities . Trickery: Gaston Glock avoided questions from his wife and business partner using intimidation and demanding trust, telling her it would be better if she wasn't involved in their finances, the lawsuit says . Helga Glock's lawsuit asks for a jury trial and seeks potential total damages of approximately $500 million, as well as attorney fees. She also asks a judge to remove Gaston Glock and others from their roles in the company, reorganize the companies owned by Glock and restore a larger ownership interest for Helga Glock. Helga and Gaston Glock met in 1958 and married in 1962. They started a company in 1963 that eventually became a gun manufacturer called Glock Ges.m.b.H. in 1983, according to the lawsuit. Gaston Glock established a U.S. subsidiary of the company in Smyrna, just outside Atlanta, in 1985. Glock's pistols quickly became popular among law enforcement officers and civilians alike, and the U.S. subsidiary became a main economic engine for the company, the lawsuit says. Gaston Glock and his associates had complete disregard for any form of corporate structure and set up a network of sham companies in locations that included Bermuda, Curacao, Hong Kong, Ireland, Liberia, Luxembourg and Panama, the lawsuit says. They transferred money out of Glock Inc., and into shell companies he owned or controlled to hide the origins of the money, the lawsuit says. Gaston Glock avoided questions from his wife and business partner using intimidation and demanding trust, telling her it would be better if she wasn't involved in their finances, the lawsuit says. She trusted and relied on him. 'While Glock Sr. had been promising his wife that all of his efforts were directed at building up the Company, and preserving it for the family's future, he and his associates had instead been systematically stealing from, and laundering the proceeds through separately-owned business entities and bank accounts,' the lawsuit says. Until 1999, Gaston Glock owned 85 percent of the shares of the Austrian parent company and Helga Glock owned 15 percent. Gaston Glock and his associates created foundations and convinced Helga Glock and their children to contribute their assets and waive inheritance rights, ostensibly to benefit them and protect the family's control of the company, the lawsuit says. Helga Glock was left with a 1 percent interest in the company, and Gaston Glock had complete control of the trusts, the lawsuit says. After they divorced, Gaston Glock removed his wife and three adult children as beneficiaries of the foundations and said they and their descendants could not have any further association with the company, the lawsuit says. Shortly after the divorce, Gaston Glock married a woman roughly 50 years his junior. Thursday's lawsuit is not the first time Helga Glock has turned to this U.S. federal court in a dispute with her ex-husband. In March 2013, she asked the court to help her get financial records for Glock's American companies so she could use them in the couple's divorce proceedings in Austria to establish marital assets and the amount he should pay her in support. The judge in that case granted her request for subpoenas. Lawyers for the company have responded in court filings that there's no basis for the federal court to compel the company's U.S. entities to turn over the financial documents because Helga Glock can't use any of them in the Austrian proceedings.

"It's destination Real Madrid for Toni Kroos as the Germany midfielder admitted he is to leave Bayern Munich in the immediate aftermath of clinching the World Cup. The 24-year-old was instrumental for Joachim Low's side in Brazil, even with talk surrounding his future in Munich being rife throughout the tournament. And, when celebrating the 1-0 win against Argentina on Sunday night, Kroos confirmed he would be linking up with the La Liga giants in a 'dream' move.

Kroos has agreed a five-year deal with Carlo Ancelotti's Champions League winners. Despite being widely talked about as one of the best in Europe in recent years his attitude has been criticised by senior figures at the Allianz Arena - Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and fellow directors raising questions about the decision not to take a penalty in the European final against Chelsea two years ago. Formerly a target of Manchester United, Kroos has shown in the last few weeks exactly why David Moyes earmarked him as the club's major signing in the summer rebuilding process had he kept his job at Old Trafford. He has been a standout performer for the eventual victors, scoring twice in the semi-final humiliation of Brazil, and kept the Germans ticking over in midfield - things to raise further eyebrows over Louis van Gaal's decision to pull the plug on any deal.

"Groningen's coach Erwin van de Looi had predicted a tight, closely-matched contest. He proved a sound and decent judge. With matching 4-5-1 formations, Aberdeen and their Dutch league opponents embarked on a game of North Sea chess. At home next week, the Eredivisie team will surely find another gear. But there was little here to alter the accuracy of van do Looi’s assessment. Despite some strong play – particularly in the first half – Aberdeen couldn’t get the goal their chances merited. Yet a scoreless first leg is no disaster. Critically, they didn’t concede despite substitute Dino Islamovic coming within inches of scoring three minutes from time. Debut: David Goodwillie makes his first appearance for Aberdeen in the Europa League tie . ABERDEEN: Langfield; Logan, Anderson, Reynolds, Jack; Flood, Robson, Pawlett (Low 88); McGinn, Hayes, Rooney (Goodwillie 76) Subs: Brown, Considine, Taylor, Smith, Wright. GRONINGEN: Padt; Hateboer, Botteghin, Kappelhof, Burnet, Lindgren, Kieftenbeld, Chery, van der Velden (Islamovic 82), Hoesen (Antonia 66), Kostic. Subs: van der Vlag, Magnasco, van Nieff, Hiariej, de Leeuw. Referee: H Miguel (Portugal) Groningen left the Granite City the more content team. Yet both coaches were united in their view afterwards. This contest will go all the way. Home advantage pushed Aberdeen to some neat attacking football. On nights like this, in front of a 16,523 crowd, Pittodrie is a good place to be. Groningen were a step up from Daugava Riga, the Latvians dismissed on an 8-0 aggregate. Yet in a strong opening half hour the Dons did enough here to merit a narrow advantage for the second game. It had seemed Peter Pawlett might make the difference. In the early stages he had right-back Hans Hatebor in a state of alarm with his pace, the full back eventually earning a second-half booking for one foul too many. Groningen’s languid passing game was geared towards counter-attacking containment.  But Aberdeen weren’t having it. They harried and probed, pressed and pushed, and Pawlett didn’t look like a player willing to be constrained by anybody. He almost broke the stalemate in nine minutes, showing great endeavour to simply collect the ball and go past Johan Kappelof, gaining a yard before striking a left foot shot parried outwards by keeper Sergio Padt. The ball almost fell perfectly for Adam Rooney, seeking his 15th goal in 21 appearances, but was thumped out of play for a corner. Qualifier: Players emerge from the tunnel for the opening round European match . Pawlett’s direct play posed the visitors more problems in 24 minutes when he collected a pass from Niall McGinn and took a superb first touch, holding the ball long enough for the Northern Irishman to advance into the area. McGinn tried to dink the return pass over Padt, but the keeper made himself big and saved. Aberdeen were growing into this game, too. Perhaps their one frustration was the need to play Jonny Hayes at left-back. Ostensibly a winger, his attacking instincts were bound to out eventually and – not the tallest of players – he got up to head a Willo Flood cross towards goal in 26 minutes. Padt collected it unconvincingly. Yet Aberdeen could take heart from the fact his opposite number Jamie Langfield had nothing to do until four minutes from half-time. Even then it was Mark Reynolds who almost turned Hatebor’s overlapping cross into his own goal. Langfield got down to stop it and the Dons defence froze as Groningen’s No9 Danny Hoesen reacted first to strike the ball from the most acute angle. It ran across the face of the goal and Aberdeen cleared their lines. For the first time in ages you could hear the Dutch contingent of 600 fans. Pot shot: Aberdeen's Adam Rooney (right) closes down Johan Kappelhof . When Aberdeen’s notoriously quiet home support – out in fine numbers – are making all the racket it’s a sign a game is going well. Yet the problem remained at half-time of how to take an advantage to Holland next week, however narrow. All whilst resisting a damaging away goal on the counter. Groningen provoked another roar from their support in 62 minutes, Rasmus Lindgren’s rasping low drive forcing Langfield to dive full length to his right and turn away. In Pawlett and Hayes, Aberdeen had the game’s most dangerous attackers on the left side. In the centre, Rooney was having a less effective night. McInnes made the big call of removing his hat-trick hero from the last round and throwing on David Goodwillie for the last 20 minutes. But the former Scotland striker had little to feed off  - and Groningen subs Jarchinio Antonia and Islamovic almost combined to turn the ball past Langfield with moments to go. For Aberdeen that would have been harsh. At half-time, this tie is finely poised.

Twenty-two people were arrested and $723,635 was also seized by authorities, the Office of the Attorney General said in a Monday news release. 'The takedown, named Operation Road Trip, represents the culmination of several related investigations targeting California-based Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTO) connected to Mexico’s Sinaloa Federation drug cartel,' the release said. Scroll down for video . Seized: Over 1100 pounds of methamphetamine were recovered during the investigation, along with drugs and thousands of dollars . It emerged that the Nitro gang would receive the drug, and 'would make regular ""road trips"" to Contra Costa County in order to distribute to other DTOs, including the Urtiz gang based in Northern California,' the release from the Office of the Attorney General said. Four vehicles as well as a gun were also seized during Operation Road Trip, it stated. As part of Operation Red Reach, which ran for two years, 135 pounds of meth was seized, along with 26 illegal guns and about $150,000, the office said. 26 people also were convicted.

"A California woman has been charged with ‘theft by false pretenses’ after she allegedly tricked people into giving her money and gifts by falsely claiming she had breast cancer. Cristina Lagman, 39, of Homeland used Facebook to string along hundreds of 'friends' and well-wishers with regular updates on her struggle along with photos of herself with no hair and wearing breast cancer awareness T-shirts. 'I am so scared … I have fought really hard … I don’t think I really believed it might really take me till today,” Lagman wrote on February 2. Scroll down for more . Cristina Lagman, 39, of Homeland, California, used Facebook to string along hundreds of 'friends' and well-wishers with regular updates on her struggle along with photos of herself with no hair . 'I’m down to possibly just weeks … my children and parents are in their own worlds and I’m left with the burden of dying by myself,' read another post. Kindhearted supporters established a GoFundMe page and even organized a fund-raising event on her behalf at the Aces Comedy Club in Murrieta. It was after the fundraiser that some people started to become suspicious about Lagman's condition. 'Cristina was happy, frolicking around, drinking quite a bit, passing donation bags around, and I thought her behavior was odd since she had said she only had four to six weeks of life left,' said Valerie Cortes, who'd previously been one of her strongest supporters. Lagman raised suspicions when she took a cross country road trip rather than spending time with her kids . Rather than using the money raised to help prepare her teenage children for a life without their mother, Lagman took a cross-country road trip and asked for gift cards for restaurants and spa treatments. 'She was going drinking every night and partying like a rock star,' Cortes, who had personally donated about $250 in cash and gift cards, told ABC10. Cortes also noticed that a photo that purported to show Lagman receiving chemotherapy was actually a stock photograph posted widely online. 'One of the things she said to all of us was that she was in stage 5 and stage 5 doesn't exist,' said Cortes. With suspicions growing, Cortes confronted Lagman for proof of her illness and she was promptly 'unfriended'. ‘People started hitting her up on Facebook and asking her to prove that she really had cancer, and as they did that she would start deleting them on Facebook,’ comedy club owner Rocky Osborne told KTLA. Cortes reported Lagman - who remains very much alive and well - to Murrieta police who charged her on October 21. It is estimated that she received around $3,000 in donations and gifts from duped givers, court records show. Lagman has denied the allegations and maintains that she does have cancer – although she is now doing better. 'That’s how cancer is,' she said. 'Every day people are told they’re not going to make it and miracles happen. 'I’ve done nothing, nothing illegal whatsoever.' Lagman is due in court for arraignment on December 2. She is already on probation for a 2013 embezzlement conviction and was also convicted of welfare fraud in 2012.

"Return: Nicolas Sarkozy has finally announced  that he will seek the leadership of the opposition UMP party in a move that would position him for a 2017 presidential bid . France's former president Nicolas Sarkozy announced his return to politics today by declaring he would seek the leadership of the opposition UMP party in a move that would position him for a 2017 presidential bid. The announcement on his Facebook page ends months of  speculation that the 59-year-old conservative would return to the fray after his defeat by Francois Hollande in 2012. 'I am a candidate for the presidency of my political family,' he said. 'I will propose reforming it from top to bottom so as to create, within three months, the basis of a new and broad movement that can speak to the French as a whole. 'This broad movement will adopt a new project,' he added. The former leader had told journalists they would 'never hear from him again' after he lost the election to socialist Francois Hollande in the 2012 election. But he then announced last year that he was considering standing for re-election because the socialists were 'ruining France'. Disastrous left-wing policies left him 'no choice' but to make a challenge for the leadership, he said. He added: 'Looking at the disastrous state France risks finding itself in, I will have no choice in 2017. 'The question is not knowing whether I'm going to make a come-back, but if morally I have the choice regarding France to not come back... Morally, I can not let the French people down.' His political comeback is said by friends to be strongly opposed by his own wife Carla Bruni, who has 'begged him' not to stand because people were 'mean to him' as president. Sarkozy's leadership bid could also be hindered by a raft of corruption charges he faces over illegal campaign funding. He is accused of accepting illegal party funding payments from France's richest woman and L'Oreal heiress Lilian Bettencourt in return for tax breaks. He has accused the country's socialist government of 'framing' him with the charges and branded the accusations 'grotesque'. Pascal Perrineau, of the Institute of Political Studies in Paris, said: 'If he becomes UMP president, Sarkozy's political agenda will be constantly pushed around by an investigation into this case or that case, by a judge summoning him for questioning. Decisions: Sarkozy said he would be 'letting the French people down' by not stranding against socialist incumbent Francois Hollande (left) at the 2017 French presidential elections. Sarkozy's political comeback is thought to be strongly opposed by his own wife Carla Bruni (right), who has reportedly 'begged him' not to stand . 'He had also gradually forged the image of a wise man who stayed on the edge of the river and who only made comments every now and then,' Mr Perrineau added. 'But if he becomes UMP president, he will be asked for his opinion on everything every morning. There is a risk he will be worn down,' he said. While his supporters are desperate for Sarkozy to return to politics, the wider French population doesn't really care. A poll released on Tuesday by OpinionWay found that 64 per cent of French people were not interested in his upcoming comeback announcement. Sarkozy's main rival for the nomination of his right-wing UMP party to run for president is former French prime minister Alain Juppe. He was found guilty in connection with a separate corruption scandal seven years ago and handed a 14-month suspended prison sentence and banned from holding public office for two years, then went on to be foreign minister after the ban expired.","Former French president will seek leadership of the opposition UMP party .

"A homeowner is so desperate to shift his decrepit house in Detroit that he's willing to swap it for an iPhone 6. The property, a two-story, three-bedroom home, is falling apart, and has been stuck on the market for four months. Even with an asking price of just $3,000, the property sparked so little interest that the unnamed owner said he would give it to anybody who'll hand over one of Apple's latest smartphones. Scroll down for video . Unusual offer: The Austrian man who owns this house in Detroit has said he'll trade it for an iPhone 6 . Tumbeldown: The decrepit house has had its windows smashed in and is 'in terrible condition', according to the realtor trying to shift it . The desperate owner - who lives in Austria and has never been to the stricken house - would even be willing to part with it for a 32GB iPad, Fox News reported. He man bought his house in 2010 for around $40,000, hoping to turn a quick profit - but even at that price he was overpaying, and has never seen a return. All the while the property has been accruing backtaxes, which now stand at $6,000 and would have to be paid back by anybody who took over the home. The house boasts three bedrooms, a bathroom, a basement and a garage, and a location just 20 minutes out of downtown Detroit. But it is currently uninhabitable, with smashed up windows, broken shutters and furniture and overgrown plants strewn in front of it.

Allegations: Julia Marquand, 28, took a handful of photos of known sex-offender Daryl Sharma, who walked up beside her on a sidewalk near Westlake Park in the city and supposedly touched her inappropriately . Frustration: Marquand handed police the photos of Sharma, but they did not want to use them as evidence . She told Q13 Fox: 'I know the difference between being bumped into and being groped. I pulled out my phone and I just started snapping pictures.' Marquand contacted the police who recognized him as being under Department of Corrections supervision. However, officers would not take her images as evidence. But when she uploaded the photos, the response changed the course of the investigation. She told the TV station: ''I had no idea this would happen. I had 13 followers on Twitter when I started this.' The Seattle Police Department acknowledged Marquand's frustration and  confirmed a detective was contacted by DOC officers after they recognized the man in photos the victim circulated on Twitter. Sharma is said to have a history of groping and is a level 3 sex offender - meaning he is most likely to re-offend. Following Marquand's tweet, more people have come forward with allegations the same man has made advances at them. In 2011, he was accused of groping a woman on a bench at Seattle's University Village. He was convicted twice in 2003 on assault charges related to rubbing himself against a woman and later grabbing another woman’s behind. After his actions were noticed on Twitter, Sharma was taken back into custody at the King County Jail on Wednesday for violating his probation. Serial offender: Sharma is said to have a history of groping and following Marquand's tweet, she claims 200 people have come forward with allegations the same man has groped them . A statement from Seattle PD read: 'SPD Sexual Assault detectives and Department of Corrections (DOC) officers have identified a person of interest in a weekend assault on a woman in downtown Seattle. 'This person of interest is currently being held at the King County Jail for a violation of his DOC supervision. 'Police began investigating the incident after a woman contacted an officer at the West Precinct on October 12th to report a man groped the woman as she walked down the street near Westlake Park. 'The victim photographed the man before contacting police at the West Precinct. 'A West Precinct officer documented the incident, including a detailed description of the suspect, but did not collect the victim's photograph of the suspect at the time of the report. 'The victim, understandably frustrated by the incident, pro-actively circulated a photo of the man via social media, along with an account of her experience reporting the incident. 'DOC officers contacted SPD detectives about the case after recognizing the man in the photo as a level III sex offender on DOC supervision. 'Police are still investigating the case, but are working to confirm a connection between the man identified by DOC officers and the Westlake incident.; .","Julia Marquand, 28, took photos of known sex-offender Daryl Sharma .

"From right down south in Tierra del Fuego, from the capital Buenos Aires . and from Lionel Messi’s home town in Rosario, they are arriving in Rio de . Janeiro in camper vans, minibuses and beaten-up old cars. They are . even opening up Sambodromo, where the Carnival normally takes place, to . accommodate them all as they stream into the city. They are an . invading army of Argentine hopefuls, brought here by a desire to be . present at an historic coronation. Flights are full so the only way to . be part of the show is to settle down for the long drive — two days from . Buenos Aires — up through the country and into Brazil. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lionel Messi showing off his skills during training . Influential: Lionel Messi is carrying a nation at World Cup as Diego Maradona once did . And almost to a man, woman and child, their Argentina shirts bear the names of two men, representing the past and the present: Diego Maradona and Messi. Messi is carrying a nation here in Rio de Janeiro as Maradona once did. As Jorge Valdano, the 1986 World Cup winner, wrote: ‘As in  politics, in Argentina we are always looking for one man to save us. If Argentina win, the people will crown him with laurels; if not they will give him a crown of thorns.’ And it has been a mixed World Cup so far for the world’s greatest player. Messi carried the team through the group; he provided the crucial assist against Switzerland in the last 16; he was by far the most influential player against Belgium in the quarter-finals; by the semi-final, though, he looked fatigued, jaded and unable to offer much energy to the team. Focused: Messi, left, heads the ball during a training session in Vespesiano, near Belo Horizonte . ‘My only fear is that the kid is tired, but in the final game you cannot be tired,’ said Maradona of his heir. ‘He’ll understand that. Even if he doesn’t score, he will be the best in the world, just the . same.’ Messi has had a season disrupted by a hamstring injury at . Barcelona. He does not look to have the energy levels he displayed a few . years ago when Pep Guardiola convinced him to contribute to Barcelona’s . pressing game. Here he has been a different player, performing deeper, . rather than as the farthest forward striker, and has influenced . midfield. The semi-final against Holland was played in trying . circumstances for the Argentina team. They had woken up on the morning . of the game to tragic news that Argentine journalist Jorge Lopez had . died in a car crash in Sao Paulo the night before. Lopez knew many of . the squad and even shared a flat briefly with Messi in Barcelona when . the player was still a teenage hopeful. Sealed with a kiss: An Argentina fan with a replica of the World Cup on Copacabana beach in Rio . For Valdano, though, too . much  rests on one man. ‘How can we build a competitive team? How can we . fulfil expectations? How can we make up for the lack of intensity, the . lack of goals? Until now, the answer to all these questions has been in . one man: Messi,’ wrote Valdano after the group stages. ‘But the name . that captivates Argentinians and dazzles the world, frustrates the . manager, who is trying to ensure that the team is more solid behind Leo, . to create more options and mobility up front. ‘If the manager can . get a collective unit playing well, then he can have confidence in the . team rather than continually hoping for the inspiration from the No10.’ Up for it: Argentina fans park in a camp after arriving in Rio for the World Cup final . That . manager, Alex Sabella, has stiffened up his team by bringing in Lucas . Biglia alongside Javier Mascherano, which has brought greater defensive . balance to the line-up. Ezequiel Garay has been a sturdy presence at the . back and Martin Demichelis, alongside him, a surprisingly calming . presence. But it is still Messi who elevates this Argentina team from . being merely a good one to potential World Cup winners, especially in . the likely absence of Angel Di Maria and the limited fitness of Sergio . Aguero. ‘He represents 80 per cent of our creative capacity,’ said . Cesar Menotti, the 1978 World Cup-winning coach. ‘He can solve the match . in just one second. Even though the Germans can create more space, . Argentina enjoys the luxury of having Messi, which the Germans lack.’ backing: Argentine fans with a flag of Diego Maradona on Copacabana Beach . That said, Menotti has also compared Germany with the Brazilian side of 1970, indicating the size of the task Argentina face. ‘Even . after a bad season with Barcelona, Leo turned out to be the man at the . World Cup,’ said Mario Kempes, Menotti’s principal striker in that 1978 . World Cup win. ‘He won’t be able to do it alone, but I’m sure he will . show his best form in the final game. He is wonderful.’ While Gary . Lineker doubts that Messi is at his physical peak here, he concedes that . even if not at 100 per cent he could still intimidate Germany. England . felt similarly cowed facing Maradona in their World Cup quarter-final in . 1986, according to Lineker. ‘Subconsciously, you know what you’re up . against: a phenomenal talent,’ said Lineker. ‘There was a feeling if he . (Maradona) had a bad day then you’ve got half a chance. I’m sure it . would be the same now if you played against Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. They score a goal a game. ‘The Germans will know that and I’m sure . they’ll make plans for that, but it’s hard to change your entire system . for someone. But when I look at him at the moment, I think he’s quite . easy to mark.’ Rivals: Argentina and Brazil fans (below) trade chants on Copacabana Beach on Saturday . Maybe Messi has done enough simply be getting to the . final to  satisfy the honour of Argentinians. It is noticeable that the . Germans, losing finalists in 2002 and semi-finalists in 2006 and 2010, . have greeted every victory here with an understated sense of . satisfaction. For this generation of German players, only victory . today will mark a job well done. They will not accept another glorious . failure. ‘Normally after a 7-1 victory you would be really happy,’ said  Arsenal’s Per Mertesacker following the semi-final against Brazil. ‘But we were all subdued. Only the final matters to us now and that . comes down to winning or losing.’ By contrast, Argentina were . euphoric even to win their quarter-final, ending what they regarded as a . 24-year curse of not making the last four. Clearly their semi-final was . a degree more tense than  Germany’s, but it has unleashed a cascade of . euphoria in Argentina, prompting the march on Rio. Colourful: Argentina fans gather on Copacabana Beach on Saturday ahead of the World Cup final . Mascherano spoke of his soul  soaring upon reaching the final. Gonzalo Higuain was similarly  emotive. ‘We . are just one little step from writing eternal history for our . football,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to explain and this is a unique moment.’ Perhaps . it is simply the difference in how Germanic and Latin cultures express . themselves, but the Argentines have been noticeably more effusive. But . now that the massed ranks are here, there is only one result imaginable. And that means one man will shoulder the responsibility. Even Valdano, . who preaches the virtues of the team above the individual, might concede . that. Prior to the World Cup he was asked who was the best player in . the world and, of course, selected Messi. And who’s the second best, he . was asked? ‘Messi injured,’ he replied.","Argentina fans have been arriving in Rio by plane, camper van and car .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is angry with his protege Jose Mourinho for putting unfair pressure on the club’s new teenage signing Luke Shaw. Van Gaal knows Mourinho tried to hijack Shaw’s £27million summer move to Old Trafford at the eleventh hour and is angry he is now trying to effectively portray the 19-year-old as a money-grabber. The Dutchman, who gave Mourinho his start in football  management by giving him a first coaching job at Barcelona in 1997, promised to speak privately to the Chelsea manager after his controversial claim that Shaw’s wages would have 'killed' Roman Abramovich. VIDEO Scroll down to watch what Jose Mourinho thinks of Man United's Louis van Gaal . Expensive: Luke Shaw cost Manchester United £30m and is reportedly earning £120,000 a week . Just a kid: Mourinho says he didn't want to sign Shaw because of his extraordinary wage demands . In fact, Chelsea were still in the hunt for Shaw on the day that United announced they had got their man and tried desperately to get the young England left-back to change his mind. A senior source close to the deal confirmed to Sportsmail: ‘They (Chelsea) pushed, very hard. Even up to the final hour.’ The previously close relationship between van Gaal and Mourinho adds extra significance to the row that has broken out. Mourinho has often sited Van Gaal as his role model and the major reason he was later able to branch out with such spectacular success at Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid. And yet the Special One does have a history for falling out with those closest to him. Sir Bobby Robson, who initially took him to Barcelona as an interpreter, grew distant from Mourinho when he worked in England and Mourinho was noticeable by his absence at Sir Bobby’s memorial service at Durham Cathedral in 2009. His long-time assistant Andre Villas-Boas also had an argument with Mourinho and the pair weren’t even on speaking terms by the time  AVB managed at Chelsea and Spurs. United clearly regard Mourinho’s latest comments on Shaw as a case of bad sour grapes. Chelsea were confident they would be able to sign Shaw as a long-term successor to Ashley Cole because he had supported them as a boy and was settled in the south playing for Southampton. But Shaw was persuaded by United’s guarantee of being a first-team regular at Old Trafford and Mourinho’s treatment of Cole last season also put a doubt in his mind. Making his point: Louis van Gaal has revealed he will talk to Jose Mourinho over his claims about Luke Shaw . Chelsea fought back hard to stop . United getting their man, even up to June 27 when United announced the . signing, which is why van Gaal believes Mourinho’s latest comments are . dishonest. Mourinho gave the impression last week that Chelsea were not serious contenders because of the wages being asked. ‘If . we pay to a 19-year-old boy what we were being asked for, to sign Luke . Shaw, we are dead,’ he said. ‘We would have killed our stability with . financial fair play and killed the stability in our dressing room.’ ‘They . would have been saying, 'How is it possible I play 200 games for this . club, won this and that, yet a 19-year-old comes here and gets more . money than I get?’ Van Gaal . responded to questions about Mourinho's comments by saying: 'I don't . think I have to discuss things with the media. It is better to discuss . it with Jose.' Mourinho has . since signed Brazilian left-back Filipe Luis from Atletico Madrid for a . reported £20m though his wages of around £80,000-a-week are . approximately what Shaw is receiving at United. Van Gaal has drilled the importance of team ethic into his United players during pre-season training camp in America. The Dutchman has even stopped seven-a-side practise games when a pass isn’t perfect – even if they reach their intended target. The . manager’s point is that for the sake of the team, every pass must be . made so the receiver is in a comfortable position to play the next pass. Hence anything hit at the wrong speed or not directed perfectly is no good for the flow of the move. United . have signed two players Shaw and Ander Herrera this summer. Van Gaal . would ideally like three more with Matts Hummels, Thomas Vermaelen and . Daley Blind being looked at, and Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman a . target in January. Not for me: Jose Mourinho has revealed he did not sign Luke Shaw because of his high wage demands .","Jose said Shaw's wage demands would have ruined Chelsea's stability .

"A perfectly preserved glass ‘witch bottle’ has been unearthed in Newark - three centuries after it was buried in the ground.

"[headerlinks] . Alexander Kristoff of Norway, in a solo show of opportunistic racing, won the 12th stage of the Tour de France in a sprint as Vincenzo Nibali kept the yellow jersey for a 10th day on Thursday. After hitching a ride behind the back wheel of Italian sprinter Matteo Trentin, Kristoff powered out of the barreling pack and beat Peter Sagan of Slovakia, who was second, by nearly a bike length, while Arnaud Demare of France was third. The pack overtook a pair of breakaway riders with less than seven kilometers to go. Kristoff, who won the Milan-San Remo race this year, pointed his fingers skyward and shouted as he crossed the line - pretty much without any of his Katusha teammates: Sagan's Cannondale team and Giant-Shimano took turns leading the pack at the end. But Kristoff timed his burst perfectly. Sprint finish: Katusha procycling team rider Alexander Kristoff his win in the 12th stage of the Tour de France .

Top of the charts: Italian Vincenzo Nibali of Astana Pro Team kept his grasp of the yellow jersey . VIDEOÂ Kristoff Leave Sagan sulking on Stage 12Â . 'I won, finally, and I am really happy,' Kristoff said of his first Tour stage win, adding he had been second in two previous sprints. 'It was time to win. 'In Norway, there was a lot of pressure on me: I am the only Norwegian this year!' Kristoff paced himself without two big rivals: Giant-Shimano rider Marcel Kittel, who has won three stages, was dropped earlier in the ride along four small- and medium-sized climbs, while German countryman Andre Greipel, who won Stage 6, crashed within the last few kilometers. 'I went at just the right time,' said Kristoff, adding he had no idea the two Germans were out of contention for the stage win. 'I was just thinking about myself.' The mostly flat 185.5-kilometer (115.5-mile) course from Bourg-en-Bresse to Saint-Etienne in southeastern France was well suited for a possible sprint finish. Hands up: Kristoff crosses the finish line ahead of France's Arnaud Demare to win the twelfth stage . Over the bridge: The pack push through the 185.5km stretch from Bourg-en-Bresse to Saint-Etienne . The top standings didn't change. Nibali leads Richie Porte of Australia by 2 minutes, 23 seconds, and Alejandro Valverde of Spain was third, 2:47 back. Nibali is looking to become the first Italian to win the Tour since the late Marco Pantani in 1998. American rider Andrew Talansky pulled out before the stage due to severe back pain from previous crashes. The Garmin-Sharp leader who won the Criterium du Dauphine last month rode for several hours with excruciating back pain on Wednesday, when he finished last on the 11th stage. The pack now faces two days in the Alps - which are getting relatively short shrift this year - even if both stages feature uphill finishes that are likely to shake up the top standings. Friday's relatively long Stage 13 will also put riders' legs under the most strain so far. The 197.5-kilometer (123-mile) trek begins in Saint-Etienne and will crescendo: It first covers a mid-sized climb, then the Category 1 Palaquit pass, and finally an 18-kilometer (12-mile) ascent to the Alpine village of Chamrousse - one of cycling's hardest climbs. Nibali, however, said his Astana team will try to manage the race on Friday, before what he sees as a greater challenge a day later. 'It's surely the second stage in the Alps that scares me the most,' he said, 'because on the first one everyone has energy, and it's always the second one that requires more energy - and where you pay for your efforts.'

Police say the 42-year-old man, who is not believed to be a resident, was alone and locked inside a parked car in the carport of a block of units in Inala in Brisbane's south west from around 12pm. A police media spokesman confirmed the man had 'been hit with a projectile'. Scroll down for video . SERT Police attended the scene of a standoff with a gunman in the south-west Brisbane suburb of Inala . Queensland police wore bullet proof vests as they attend the scene . A home in Inala in Brisbane's south west, was surrounded by armed officers where a man armed with a gun hid in a parked car . He was then dragged out of the vehicle by officers who handcuffed him at about 4pm before declaring he was in a critical condition. Aerial news footage has shown riot police gathering around a patient on a stretcher in the car park of the apartment complex, while a TV journalist on the scene reported hearing several gunshots. A black armoured vehicle had been parked directly in front of the car with the man inside, while armed SERT officers monitored the situation and tried to talk him down. Brisbane regional duty officer, Inspector Richard Kroon, conformed that police had been conducting an investigation at the units when they began speaking to the man. He then allegedly presented a firearm causing police to immediately withdraw from the area and attempt negotiations with the man. 'At about 3:45 further interactions had occurred and as a result of that a number of shots were fired and a 42-year-old man was subsequently pronounced deceased,' Insp. Kroon said. 'The matter is being investigated by the Police Ethical Standards Command and they will be preparing a report for the state coroner.' NSW police media reported of the siege: 'they've sent in the big guns' Police surrounded him and were attempting a negotiation before the shoot-out . Earlier in the day, Insp. Kroon said: 'there's no real threat. I don't believe he is a resident, and no one has been evacuated. 'They are speaking to him by phone that was given to him by police and police will take as long as it takes to negotiate a peaceful outcome.' 'The best outcome is that the man comes out the vehicle, unarmed, and surrenders.' A police media spokesman also added: 'officers are behind him, he's not going anywhere.' 'The man was being investigated for something, he came to the attention of police who found him in a car with a gun, he pointed it at them so they’ve sent in the big guns, a negotiator and the heavy duty cops in black,' he said. SERT Police attended the scene of a standoff with a gunman in the south-west Brisbane suburb of Inala . A siege unfolded in a car parked outside an Inala house in Brisbane's south west .

"Imagine having an under-bite so severe you could barely chew. For one 21-year-old woman, that was a fact of life - until she underwent a major jaw realignment surgery four years ago in Toronto that not only corrected her bite, but also completely transformed her appearance. 'Before the surgery. I was afraid to smile and couldn't even look at my own reflection in the mirror without getting distraught,' said Brittany, who goes by the moniker LackofaBetterNameX on Reddit. 'I was depressed and battled with substance-abuse problems because of it.' Before! Brittany, who goes by the name LackofaBetterNameX on Reddit, had an under bite so severe she could barely chew. In these photos, her jaw is actually closed; in the photo on the left, the lower protrusion is caused by her teeth . And after! After her surgery, Brittany's look was completely transformed, but she said it took about a year for her jaw to stop feeling 'fragile' Brittany, who was 17 when she got her surgery, had to have her lower jaw moved back, her upper jaw moved forward, and her chin realigned. She had to have a total of 12 screws permanently placed in her mouth during the procedure. She posted her before and after photos on Reddit - and the change was so noticeably drastic that the post quickly moved to the top of the site and garnered more than 1,000 comments. The response to her story and photos was almost entirely positive, with many users asking for advice about getting the surgery themselves and others leaving accounts of their own experiences. Brittany had to have the surgery for medical reasons, but said she found 'the mental health benefits to be much more immense.' Before the procedure, she suffered bullying at the hands of her classmates  - and said that the physical appearance of her jaw was one of the main reasons she underwent the surgery when she did. 'My classmates were relentlessly cruel,' she said. 'I feel so much happier and stronger now because of everything that has happened though.' Brittany would've liked to get the surgery done earlier, but couldn't because her bones were still growing. Her surgeon even thought 17 was too soon, but over-corrected her bit by a few millimeters to account for future growth. Wow! Brittany posted another before and after, this time showing her profile - and the change is drastic . Ouch! Brittany, who's pictured here immediately following her surgery, said she wouldn't recommend the procedure to others unless it was 'absolutely necessary' because of the expense and long recovery time . Making progress! Five days after the surgery, Brittany started getting feeling back in her mouth and jaw area . When Reddit users asked if they should get the surgery done, Brittany said she wouldn't recommend it unless it was 'absolutely necessary' because of the expense and long recovery time. 'I spent two or three nights in the hospital after the procedure,' she wrote. 'I could have stayed for less, but I had an abnormal amount of bleeding, so they had to keep tubes in my mouth and my nose. Also, I was so sore and drugged up that I couldn't bring myself to drink, so they kept me for monitoring until I was more conscious and willing.' She said it would take or two or three weeks unless she could even open her jaw the slightest bit - and she had to wear rubber-bands in her mouth to ensure she didn't over-extend her jaw. It wasn't for nearly two months that she could fully open her mouth. Heavy metal! Brittany had to wear large rubber bands in her mouth to ensure she didn't over-extend her jaw and also to help re-build the muscle . Already showing progress! Even 12 days after the surgery, the change is noticeable . Still smiling! Four years after the surgery, Brittany says she is 'happy, healthy and about to start [her] Master's degree' It took about a year, Brittany says, before her face didn't feel fragile. Now, four years later, her jaw feels 100per cent back to normal - and she has all but forgotten about the pins in her mouth. The only time she thinks about them when she's getting X-rays, though she isn't sure they wouldn't set off metal detectors. 'Today, I am happy, healthy and about to start my Master's degree,' she says.","Brittany, 21, posted her photos to Reddit and they quickly moved to the top of the site and received more than 1,000 comments .

"Louis van Gaal clearly favours the 3-5-2 system and has implemented the formation since taking over at Manchester United earlier this summer. Defenders Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans started as the back three during the penalty shoot-out victory over Inter Milan on Tuesday during Van Gaal's third game in charge. Are these the three who could be the foundation for the Red Devils' title challenge next term? Many Man United supporters would suggest not. Three of a kind: Chris Smalling (left), Phil Jones (right) and Jonny Evans are Man United's current defensive trio . Man with a plan: Manager Louis van Gaal has been quick to implement his 3-5-2 system at Manchester United . VIDEO Van Gaal looking for defensive reinforcements . Van Gaal, who guided the likes of Ron Vlaar, Daley Blind and Bruno Martins Indi through the World Cup as Holland went unbeaten in normal time, is keen to use three centre-backs at Old Trafford this season. With the new desired system taking shape during United's friendlies over in America, the Dutchman is likely to look for defensive reinforcements before the transfer window closes next month in a bid to improve the club's backline. Having lost the seasoned defensive duo of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic this summer, the Red Devils lack an experienced head at the back. Should the United boss decide to dip his toe into the transfer market, here are six defenders for him to consider. Tussle: Defender Evans attempts to challenge Inter Milan's Mauro Icardi during Tuesday's shoot-out win . Thomas Vermaelen . Club: Arsenal . Value: £12m . The 28-year-old Belgian offers cover in the left-back position as well as at centre-back. Ideal for Van Gaal's plans. Versatile: Arsenal's Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen can play as a centre-back as well as at left-back . Mats Hummels . Club: Borussia Dortmund . Value: £30m . His father Hermann has ruled out Manchester United but they may still give it a try. Lacks pace but puts his body on the line. World Cup winner: United may try to sign Mats Hummels despite the defender's father ruling out a move . Daley Blind . Club: Ajax . Value: £17m . Versatile defender can play left-back, wing-back or in midfield. Not the quickest but is clever and possesses good distribution skills. Eyes on the prize: Daley Blind (right) has excellent distribution skills and can play in a number of positions . Joel Veltman . Club: Ajax . Value: £18m . Up and coming centre-back who all of Europe's top scouts are monitoring. Was in Van Gaal's World Cup squad. Young talent: Ajax centre-back Joel Veltman was in Van Gaal's Holland squad and would cost £18million . Joao Miranda . Club: Atletico Madrid . Value: £25m . Chelsea are very keen as are Barcelona and they have made offers. Not great value at 29 but a wily defender. Competition: Atletico Madrid defender Joao Miaranda is wanted by Chelsea and Barcelona . Raphael Varane . Club: Real Madrid . Value: £35m . The one everyone wants but will Real sell? Tall, athletic and young. Tipped to be the best defender in Europe.

"Former Open champion Ernie Els feared he had seriously injured a spectator with his wayward tee shot on the first hole at Hoylake. The drive that missed the narrow fairway hit the man, believed to be in his sixties, smack on the jaw and he was taken to hospital on Thursday. And South African Els, 44, known as the Big Easy, was so affected by the incident that he three-putted from a foot to record a triple-bogey seven on the first, followed by a bogey five at the second and an opening round of 79, seven over par. Scroll down for highlights . Els pushed his one-footer about 18 inches past the hole (pictures 1 and 2, above), but rather than re-address the ball, he leaned over to his left and hooked it back instantly with the ‘wrong’ side of the putter (3). It missed the hole again, obliging him to tap in for a seven (4). Els said afterwards: ‘It looked pretty bad, with blood everywhere, I hope the gentleman’s better. It was like a bullet coming at him. I talked to him, but he was in a daze. We’ve all hit spectators before at some time, but nothing quite as bad as that. It was difficult to concentrate on the golf after what happened.’ VIDEO The Open: First Round highlights . Shocker: Ernie Els walks off the 18th after nightmare first round at The Open . Bubba Watson, Els’ playing partner, said: ‘You could tell Ernie was shaken up by it.

"Former 100metres world record-holder Asafa Powell returned to the track in Lucerne, Switzerland on Tuesday after his 18-month ban for taking a banned stimulant was reduced to six months on appeal. The Jamaican claimed he felt 'like a virgin' before his year away from the sport ended with him finishing third in 10.30secs. Sadly, however, the purity and thrill of watching a man run as fast as is humanly possible disappeared a long time ago. The Commonwealth Games start in Glasgow a week on Wednesday and, although Powell's time will not force Jamaican selectors into making a difficult decision, the 31-year-old could still feasibly have been picked to represent his country once again. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Powell and Simpson bans reduced . Astonoshing: Half the men who competed in the 2012 Olympics 100m final have served bans for drug offences . Decent return: Asafa Powell looks pleased after returning to 100m action in Luzern, finishing third . Speed: Powell, who had his drugs ban reduced to six months, finished in a time of 10.30 . VIDEO Powell and Simpson bans reduced . Powell missed the national championships with 'stomach flu' and the Jamaican team has already been named, but changes can be made on medical grounds up until July 25. His inclusion, however, would have been a further slight on those who have paid up to £90 to sit inside Hampden Park and trust what they are seeing is the result of real human endeavour and natural talent. Increasingly, it is only the clever work of highly-paid lawyers, hired to take their client's cases to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and get them back on track as soon as possible. Already this year, Jamaican 400m runner Dominique Blake has successfully appealed for her six-year ban for taking a banned stimulant to be cut by 18 months. Three-time Olympic champion Veronica Campbell-Brown, who will compete in Glasgow, also saw a two-year suspension dismissed as CAS berated the 'deplorable' mistakes in collecting her positive sample. Powell and fellow Jamaican sprinter Sherone Simpson employed American attorney Paul Greene to fight their 18-month bans, arguing three months was more appropriate for their 'minor' offences because the banned substance, oxilofrine, had been found in a contaminated food supplement, Epiphany D1. Their appeal was partially upheld and the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission (JADCO) has been forced to pay 'historic costs' in lawyer and appeal costs, believed to be 'one of the biggest rewards in the history of CAS.' Sport's highest authority will reveal the full reasons for its findings in due course. Reduced: Sherone Simpson is also able to compete again . Pondering: Powell gets ready to compete in Lucerne on Tuesday night . In Australia, meanwhile, an amateur surfboat rower, Brendan Ellis, who paid £20 for an over-the-counter supplement at a health food store, is saddled with a two-year ban for testing positive for the same stimulant, oxilofrine. An Australian Football League (AFL) midfielder, Ahmed Saad, is serving an 18-month suspension for a banned stimulant he inadvertently took in a sports drink on match day. UK Anti-Doping operates a 'no excuses' policy and has forced all home nation athletes competing at the Commonwealth Games, as well as more than 200 coaches, to complete a mandatory education programme. Its goal is to avoid a single positive test during Glasgow 2014, but there is no uniformity across the globe or in different sports, and it is ultimately the clean athletes and the fans expected to fill stadiums who suffer. The IAAF, athletics' world governing body, is committed 'to doing everything in its power to eradicate cheating' and will return to four-year bans for 'serious doping offences' from January 2015. The list of athletes currently serving drugs bans stretches to 26 pages and the IAAF has been testing blood, as well as urine, since 2001. When athletes are banned for taking drugs, the default position is still to desperately cling on to the positives and talk about the strong message of zero tolerance those suspensions send out. But the messages at the moment are so mixed it's difficult to take any positives at all. Letting them back in too easy? Tyson Gay is another who has been banned over drugs in the past . Yes, we're catching them, but then we're letting them back into the sport. Relatively little is still known about the long-term effects of doping on performance, while the short-term impact in terms of trust and reputation is acutely damaging. Sprinting, in particular, has become a merry-go-round of former drug cheats. Half of the men who featured in the 100m final at the London 2012 Olympics are now tainted and 40 sub-10-second performances have had to be scratched from the archives. And yet organisers of the Lucerne meeting still clamoured to sign Powell and blow most of their modest £500,000 budget on staging his comeback. They then trumpeted his return at a press conference on Monday, during which he was sitting next to Valerie Adams: New Zealand's Olympic shot put champion who was denied her moment on top of the podium in London by a drugs cheat. Angry: Shot-putter Valerie Adams of Valerie Adams said Olympic Champion Nadzeya Ostapchuk 'tainted the sport' Angry: Shot-putter Valerie Adams of Valerie Adams said Olympic Champion Nadzeya Ostapchuk 'tainted the sport' Nadzeya Ostapchuk of Belarus cried her 'crocodile tears' while a gold medal was placed around her neck, only to then twice test positive for methenolone, an anabolic steroid. She claimed her coach had intentionally spiked her coffee, but was given a four-year ban and stripped of the Olympic title. 'I was pissed off,' said Adams last year. 'I was really angry at her. I think one thing is that I will never forgive her. She has tainted the sport.' Ostapchuk did, and so too do the hundreds of others who cheat, serve their time and then return to track and field crying their crocodile tears. We need to believe what we are seeing is real.","Powell finishes third on return to action, clocking 10.30secs in Lucerne to finish third .

"Click here for the latest leaderboard from The Open Championship . Caroline Wozniacki take note. Rory McIlroy is looking down on the rest of the field from a great height after consigning black Fridays to the ether in the most spectacular manner imaginable — at The Open Championship. The Dane had wielded her stiletto by informing the world via social media that she could finally wear her heels for the first time in three years. Trust her former fiance Rory to respond by showing a clean pair to everyone at Royal Liverpool and banishing all talk about what the heck happens to him on Fridays. Size doesn’t matter in golf, and certainly not when you play like the Northern Irishman. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Open leader Rory McIlroy say he wasn't put off after he was interrupted by a pheasant on the eighth green . Top of the pile: Rory MicIlroy watches on after his tee shot at the 143rd Open Championship at Royal Liverpool . Destined for the top: McIlroy looks on as he stands in front of the leaderboard - which he sits comfortably on top of after his second round . Feathered friend: McIlroy negotiated the awkward task of dealing with a green-invading pheasant to set himself up with a lead after his round on Friday . The 25-year-old followed his first-round 66 with another one to open a four-shot halfway lead over American Dustin Johnson. Here was a vivid demonstration of all the cruel beauty links golf possesses. Pity all the ball strikers who had the worst of the weather on Thursday afternoon and again on Friday morning. Those in that half of the draw, such as defending champion Phil Mickelson, world  No 1 Adam Scott and leading home hope Justin Rose, must have played a golf course that was three or four shots harder over the first 36 holes. As if Rory doesn’t have enough going for him, they must have thought. How helpless they must have felt as McIlroy went on one of his usual Thursday rampages on Friday. This morning, something like a meteorological armageddon is due to visit these parts, with six hours of heavy rain predicted. So Rory may well  have soft greens to play with when he goes out in the third round. Has fate already decreed the destination of the Claret Jug? Mind you, it’s one thing for Mother Nature to offer a helping hand; quite another to take full advantage. There were plenty of form players in McIlroy’s half of the draw who didn’t capitalise, including the highly fancied Henrik Stenson and Graeme McDowell. And then there’s Tiger Woods. Struggling . for form: Tiger Woods shot a five-over-par round of 77 to leave him . just inside the cut-mark at The Open Championship in Hoylake . Getting . out of the long stuff: Woods watches his shot from the rough on the . tenth hole at Royal Liverpool Golf Course in Hoylake during his second . round . The American ripped up his blueprint for Hoylake but it backfired spectacularly. In five rounds at Hoylake he had used a driver on only two occasions. Here he used it on both the first and second holes and the result was he double bogeyed the former and bogeyed the latter. He could probably have taken a seven iron off both tees and done better than that. Thereafter the driver remained sheathed for a while and a more customary service was resumed. Par followed par but that start had hurt him deeply. The first hole on this course for the members is the third in The Open. How Woods (right) must have wished it was the first for him as well. By the time he got to the 17th, he was still after his first birdie of the day. Forced to gamble, out came the driver. Cue more calamity. Another horrific slice and his ball disappeared out of bounds. Reload time and this one was a duck hook. The resultant triple bogey seven meant he needed to birdie the last to make the cut. Sensibly he left the driver in the bag. He was six over par on the four holes where he’d used it. By the side of the par five 18th green in two, he holed a tricky seven-footer to avoid the ignominy of consecutive missed cuts for the first time as a professional. Beautiful day: McIlroy and his caddie JP Fitzgerald wait on the eight fairway before he secured his third birdie of a highly impressive round . Beautiful day: McIlroy watches his tee shot on the tenth on an afternoon of fine weather at Royal Liverpool as he took a five shot lead . Scouting: McIlroy lines up his putt at the fifth hole on an impressive display at Royal Liverpool as he established a decent lead . By the side of the par five 18th green . in two, he holed a tricky seven-footer to avoid the ignominy of . consecutive missed cuts for the first time as a professional. Clearly, those in the unlucky half of the draw have plenty of catching up to do. Scott is nine behind, while it was rough luck on Rose and Mickelson. Both shot rounds of 70 which were highly commendable in the morning but were rendered average in the afternoon as they trail by 10 and 12 shots respectively. It’s not just McIlroy they have to catch either, but a stack of good players as well from the draw’s most favourable half. Four shots behind are two Europeans in Spaniard Sergio Garcia and Italian Frankie Molinari and two Americans in Ryan Moore and Rickie Fowler. The wind was still blowing significantly when McIlroy’s approach to the opening hole failed to hold the green and he didn’t get up and down for a par. All those ugly stats were whirling in the brain: 59 under par for first rounds; seven over for second. McIlroy responded with three pars before taking up the birdie on offer at the long fifth. Now the wind was dropping and the glint in McIlroy’s eye could be seen a mile off. He knew he had been presented with a massive opportunity. How he seized it. Easy does it: A successful shot from the rough on the 12th hole meant that McIlroy was able to maintain his lead at the top of the leaderboard . Versatile: It was a great day for McIlroy as he set up a lead that any of the opposition from the field will struggle to claw him back in from . A pheasant running across the eighth . green seemed appropriate as McIlroy made three birdies in four holes . around the turn. The man who won the 2011 US Open by eight shots and the . 2012 US PGA Championship by seven was pulling away once more, and . history has moved into view again. Only two players have won three . majors at an earlier age and they just happen to go by the Christian . names of Tiger and Jack. On . his 28th birthday, George Coetzee did his best to conjure up some . support over the weekend by revealing he is a lifelong Liverpool fan. It . would be wrong to underestimate him, too. Think what another South . African of similar age and similar status at the time did at St Andrews . in 2010, when Louis Oosthuizen pulled away from the field. Coetzee . showed his liking for links golf when he opened with a pair of 69s at . The Open at Royal St George’s in 2011 — his first-ever major. These . 36 holes were more impressive however. To emerge from his half of the . draw with a five under par total was a great effort. The next best from . his half was Scott on three under. Finally, . no one would begrudge Tom Watson being in the kinder half of the draw. At 64 years of age he followed up his opening 71 with a 73 to make the . cut. The greatest links golfer of all time has still got it.

"He suffered a heart scare last year, when an irregular heartbeat forced him into hospital, and there was further heartbreak for Michael Jamieson last night. The so-called 'poster boy' of Glasgow 2014, the man tasked with giving Scotland's Games the start it deserves, had to settle for silver again in the 200 metres breaststroke. That he was beaten so convincingly by his compatriot, 20-year-old Ross Murdoch, in both the heats and final on Thursday, will only add to the pain. This was a responsibility Jamieson had taken on his broad shoulder and vowed to carry out himself, waking up at 5.45 each morning to see the world record time of 2mins 7.01secs etched on his alarm clock.

'J'aime son' read the banner in the Scot's hometown pool in his east end corner of Glasgow, very close to Celtic Park where thousands watched Jamieson win Olympic silver on the big screen two years ago. But silver was the last thing on Jamieson's mind on Thursday night: after settling for second place at Olympic, world and Commonwealth level, he desperately wanted gold. 'Ross deserved to win,' he said. 'But I don't prepare to come second and it is just not good enough.' Jamieson smiled as he walked out to the inevitable rapturous applause, apparently determined to enjoy this momentous occasion, but he was always fighting for a podium place behind a world-class swimmer, never mind the title he so desired. Australian Christian Sprenger flew off the blocks from lane eight, but Murdoch and Jamieson clawed him back. It was the Scot in lane four, however, not Jamieson in five, who began to edge clear of the field as the race entered its final two lengths and, despite a late surge, it was Murdoch, wide-eyed with shock, who touched in first.

"Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley has spoken of his pride after being handed the captain's armband by new manager Louis van Gaal. Cleverley, who has graduated through the United academy, wore the armband for the first time in his side's 3-2 victory over Roma in Denver. When speaking to MUTV afterwards, he said: 'It was fantastic, a really proud moment. I've been here since I was 11. Now, whatever I go on to do, I can say i captained Manchester United.

It is understood that Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick remain the leading candidates for the role, while Darren Fletcher was handed the captaincy for Van Gaal's first match in charge against LA Galaxy. Rooney did his chances no harm on Saturday evening, scoring twice, including one thirty yard scorcher and also producing a magnificent assist for Juan Mata's goal in an impressive first-half showing.

It was their brilliant magic that put us in control.'

'We are disappointed to concede two goals,' admitted Cleverley. 'We should see the game out better but we are still learning and progressing. 'It is obviously good game preparation for us in tough conditions, the pitch was quite sticky and it was warm at altitude against very tough opposition. Roma came 2nd in Serie A last year.

"Sam Allardyce appears to have done a U-turn by claiming he wants Ravel Morrison to stay at West Ham - providing his injury problems and wage demands can be managed. Hammers co-owner David Sullivan had previously said that the mercurial midfielder was not wanted by the manager, telling talkSPORT: 'Sam has said Ravel is not part of his plans but we as a board see him as part of our plans.' Allardyce now seems to support the club's view after insisting the 21-year-old still has a role to play, especially if he recovers from the hernia problems that plagued him last season.

'If he continues to do what he did last season then yes [we want to keep him] but that does depend on how much players want, how much they demand.

"Louis Smith went from ‘fat boy to skinny boy’ to Commonwealth champion in less than seven months and declared he was more in love with gymnastics than ever after a historic day for England, with their men and women winning team titles. Smith said he had ‘proved a point’ after England won despite being a man down for most of Tuesday afternoon. Sam Oldham was carried from the competition floor by the team physiotherapist and left the arena in a wheelchair after suffering a suspected broken ankle. The women also overcame physical travails. Becky Downie was in tears as she battled through the pain of a twisted ankle to complete her beam routine, a vital performance on the way to a score of 167.555 that clinched England’s first team victory since 1994. Winners: England's (left to right) Louis Smith, Max Whitlock, Nile Wilson and Kristian Thomas celebrate winning the team gold medal during the men's artistic gymnastic's Team Final . Winners: Louis Smith helped England to gold in the men's team gymnastics final . ‘The men’s team winning the gold medal earlier in the afternoon gave us a boost,’ said Downie. Smith, 25, was competing for the first time since coming out of retirement. He had to perform a salsa, a Charleston and a shirtless Showdance to get his hands on his most recent piece of major hardware on the final evening of Strictly Come Dancing. A blockbuster pommel horse and a solid routine on the parallel bars over two days of competition was his contribution to a team score of 266.804, which comfortably won England the title for the first time since 2002. It was a first Commonwealth gold for Max Whitlock — who qualified in first for today’s all-around final — Kristian Thomas and 18-year-old Nile Wilson, who was making his international debut. Smith, who retired after winning silver in the pommel horse and team bronze at the London Olympics, returned to his gym in Huntingdon only last December after 18 months enjoying the trappings of his celebrity status. ‘How easy was it to come back from being a fat boy to a skinny boy? Not very, gymnastics is a hard sport and if you’re out of shape it’s even harder,’ said Smith. ‘I think everyone was waiting to see if I have still got it. I have to prove myself because everyone else has been training since London. I am the one who took a break.’ Spinning around: England's Kristian Thomas (left) and Nile Wilson compete on the vault . Talent: England's Max Whitlock competes on the High Bar during the final on Tuesday . Although Smith — who is targeting the Rio Olympics — was overlooked for the European Championships, he insisted he didn’t regret taking time out to pursue interests outside gymnastics. ‘It’s the best thing I have ever done because I have fallen back in love with the sport,’ he said. ‘You kind of lose your way a bit with sponsors and appearances. To fight my way back and get to where I am shows how much I am enjoying it.’ Smith may be the most famous member of the England team, but it was Whitlock who was the most consistently impressive. He nailed his vault with a score of 15.733, overwhelming the best in the field. On the parallel bars, he held his body aloft and motionless for  several seconds before spinning through the air and landing as if his feet were superglued to the mat. ‘It’s a fabulous feeling and a brilliant stepping stone to Rio,’ said Whitlock. ‘British gymnastics is just getting better and better because the juniors can look up to the seniors and see what they are doing.

"Kentucky Senator Rand Paul sent a signal on Wednesday that he won't pull punches about his political party's public-perception problems during a 2016 presidential run, candidly confessing that 'the Republican Party brand sucks.' Appearing at a Michigan GOP field office in a predominantly black section of metropolitan Detroit, the eye-surgeon-turned-politician lamented Republicans' reputation of unfriendliness toward minorities, conceding that nonwhite voters are miles away from abandoning Democrats. 'Remember Domino’s Pizza?' he asked. 'They admitted, ""Hey, our pizza crust sucks."" The Republican Party brand sucks and so people don’t want to be a Republican.' 'And for 80 years African-Americans have had nothing to do with Republicans,' he continued. 'Why? Because of a perception. The problem is the perception is that no one in the Republican Party cares.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'The Republican Party brand sucks': GOP Senator Rand Paul hasn't pulled punches about his party's problem connecting with millennials and minorities . Paul, an eye surgeon-turned-privacy hawk, has ventured into neighborhoods and spoken to audiences where Republicans have historically feared to tread . 'We’re also fighting 40 years of us doing a crappy job, of Republicans not trying at all for 40 years, so it’s a lot of overcoming,' the senator said. 'You got to show up, you got to have something to say and really we just have to emphasize that we’re trying to do something different.' Paul has conducted an outreach offensive since last year, speaking to black audiences at the NAACP, the historically black Howard University, and other venues where Republicans are typically treated with hostility and distrust. Those speeches have brimmed with projections about policies that he says would help minorities more than what the party of Barack Obama has managed. 'Republicans face a daunting task,' he told the Howard University audience in Washington, D.C. in April 2013. 'Several generations of black voters have never voted Republican and are not very open to even considering the option.' 'Democrats still promise unlimited federal assistance and Republicans promise free markets, low taxes and less regulations that we believe will create more jobs.' He also promised to work toward reforms of a federal justice system that often sentences minor drug offenders – overwhelmingly minority offenders – to lengthy prison sentences. In an interview last year with MailOnline in New Hampshire, Paul said the net effect is 'generations of young black kids who don't have father figures around, and that's how the cycle of poverty keeps going. That's how the cycle of crime and despair keeps going.' On Wednesday, The Hill reported, he put in in stark terms of racial unfairness – a political taboo for most Republicans. 'We look at incarceration and we see a disproportionate number of people of color in jail,' Paul said, 'and then when we see statistics on drug use, it seems to be about equal among all the different races.' 'Blacks and Hispanics seem to populate our jails more.' During another of his listening-tour appearances, he spoke at the University of California Berkeley, a traditionally hostile Democratic enclave. That audience, however, hooted and hollered in support of his civil-libertarian positions on electronic privacy. He also debuted his pizza-as-politics observation there. 'Remember Domino’s finally admitted they had bad crust?' he told the students in March. 'Think Republican party. Admit it, okay. Bad crust; we need a different kind of party.'","Paul spoke at a GOP field office in a predominantly black area of Detroit .

"John Lowe, 82, told officers that his ex-partner and her daughter 'had to be put down', a court has heard . An elderly dog farmer accused of murdering his ex-partner and her daughter told police he would 'rather have put them down than the dogs', a court has heard. John Lowe allegedly told officers he 'was not sorry' and that his alleged victims 'had to be put down' after being arrested at the scene of the double shooting in Tilford near Farnham, Surrey. The 82-year-old is accused of murdering Christine Lee, 66, and her 40-year-old daughter Lucy Lee 'amid a scene of carnage' at his run-down farm on February 23 this year. The pensioner - who was arrested at the scene after a stand-off with armed police - allegedly made several comments about the shootings as he was taken into custody in the back of a police van. In evidence at Guildford Crown Court today, PC Philip Potter told the court that Lowe stated: 'I'll tell you now, I'd rather have put them down than put down the f****** dogs.' Lowe later signed all his comments - which were noted by officers at the time and read back to him - as true, the court was told. The jury was also shown a video of Lowe in the holding area at Guildford Police Station after his arrest. The footage shows him making comments to officers about the 'torment' he claimed he suffered at the hands of the Lees. He is also seen expressing concern for his dogs, including his four pet Chihuahuas, one of which he said he had cost £7,500. Talking about the mother and daughter, he later said: 'They have been giving me such a terrible f****** time. The daughter was worse than the mother. 'I know it's terrible thing to say, but it's a terrible relief that all that harassment has gone off my shoulders. F****** hell, terrible, morning, noon and night.' PC Richard McEwan told jurors that Lowe had said: 'They had to be put down, there was nothing else I could do. I've had terrible problems with Christine, they wouldn't let me eat.' He later added: 'I'm not sorry, I'm out of the problem, they are causing me problems every day', the court was told. During the video shown in court, Lowe was seen asking officers to call the area manager of the RSPCA, whom he apparently knew well. Christine Lee, 66, had been living with Lowe and providing him with care and assistance after he fell on hard times, Guildford Crown Court was told . Mr Lowe is also accused of murdering Mrs Lee's daughter Lucy, 40, who made a frantic 999 calls moments before her death . An image of the gun allegedly used to murder Christine and Lucy Lee was today shown to the jury . He said: 'Tell him I've put four dogs down at Keeper's Cottage, a cane corsa, which is an Italian mastiff, and three alsatians. 'They were four dogs I didn't want to leave for anybody else to look after as they were pushy. Somebody would have gotten bit.' Later on, he claimed to officers that Christine's shooting was an accident, the court was told. He allegedly said: 'That shooting, the older one, was a complete accident. It happened as they were pushing me out the conservatory and a gun went off by accident. 'A lot of things will go in my favour, about how they acted, but you can't get past the fact I shot them so that's that.' Mr Lowe (left) denies murdering Christine (centre) who is pictured with her daughter Stacey Banner (right) The farmer told police after his arrest that the two women had been 'giving me s*** for weeks', Guildford Crown Court was told . Lowe, pictured arriving at court, allegedly told officers he was 'glad' the two women were out of his life . PC Potter told how Lowe had commented that he 'should've thought more seriously' about his actions. He allegedly said: 'If that cow hadn't gone all f*****g mental at me, I wouldn't gave gone and pulled the trigger. I didn't mean to pull it.' Later that evening, Lowe said he had 'made a mistake today and I'm very sorry about that', the court was told. Christine Lee's daughter Stacey Banner left the court in tears as the alleged comments were recounted . The court also heard how Lowe told an officer at the scene the pair, who were supposed to be caring for him at his home, had starved him and spent his money. He was also heard referring to 'the two I shot' while travelling in the van to Guildford police station, jurors were told. Christine's daughter, Stacy Banner, ran screaming from the court in tears as officers recounted the comments allegedly made about her mother. The trial has heard that Ms Banner spent a period in 2013 living in a caravan with her partner in the grounds of Lowe's farm. Detective Constable David Jones told the court that the defendant had also made comments about Ms Banner, saying: 'I didn't want to get in s*** over her but she had two young kids otherwise I would have sorted her out.' After his arrest, Lowe showed no remorse or regret for the shootings, which he said were accidental, according to prosecutor Mark Dennis QC. Describing the killing of Lucy, Mr Dennis said: 'The defendant in effect ended her life in the same heartless way as he used to dispose of the lives of the four dogs.' In court, the jury was shown a shotgun which was recovered from the house by scenes of crime officers. It had two spent cartridges inside, which jurors heard had been used in the shootings. Mr Dennis also showed the court two notes allegedly left by Lowe at the scene. One of the notes appeared to leave Keeper's Cottage - the name of the farmhouse - 'lock stock and barrel' to an unnamed person. Armed police arrested Lowe after finding Mrs Lee and her daughter dead at his farm in February this year . The pair were looking after Lowe at his run-down farmhouse is in Tilford, near Farnham, Surrey, the court heard . A second note transferred ownership of a horse named Lucky and its foals to a friend, Lesley. The court heard the note, which was signed by Lowe, said: 'I'm sorry about what has happened here but I've been having a really bad time with Christine.' The jury had previously heard that Lucy had made a 'desperate' 999 call to police moments before she died aying that Lowe had killed her mother and she was 'running for her life'. She then told the operator that she was going back to confront the pensioner. She was then shot twice, the court heard. Christine was found dead in the lounge of Lowe's home, while Lucy's body was discovered lying on steps outside the property. Lowe, who had a valid shotgun licence at the time, had used the same weapon to kill the pair and the four dogs. A post-mortem examination confirmed Christine was killed by a single gunshot fired into her chest from about 1ft away . The court heard officers found a 'scene of carnage' at the rural site, with four dogs also shot dead . Police, pictured at the scene in February, Lowe is accused of shooting his partner and her daughter in a fit of rage . Mr Dennis said evidence suggested that he shot Christine as she was in a 'cowering position' as he stood over her. Lucy was shot in the back of her head from around 9ft away. Lowe then had to reload before firing a second fatal shot into her chest. The court heard that the former gamekeeper had a love-hate relationship with the pair. Mr Dennis said that Christine had known Lowe for many years and had occasionally been in a relationship with him. She had moved into his house to care for him after he fell on hard times. Lowe's long-term partner Susanna Wilson had died in 2013 and he had lost his licence to breed dogs at the farm. But Mr Dennis said that the defendant had complained about the mother and daughter interfering in his affairs. A few weeks before the killings, Lowe told a mechanic who visited the property to repair a vehicle: 'Those two between them drive me ******* mad, they want to know about the ins and out of everything.' PC Chris Gleeson, who arrested Lowe, said: 'He said she [Christine] was an ex-girlfriend and added, ""She's been supposed to be looking after me but she's been starving me to death and she's been keeping me short of money. I just sold my Toyota Landcruiser for £5,500 and they've spent the lot.""' Lowe denies two charges of murder and a third of possessing a firearm with intent of endangering life. The trial before High Court judge Mr Justice Singh, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.

"A man who was helping a neighbour contain a fire near his South Australian home has died of severe burns in hospital. The 38-year-old from Mount Templeton, in SA's south-east, was airlifted from Nantawarra to the Royal Adelaide Hospital but died on Friday evening. Country Fire Service (CFS) chief officer Greg Nettleton said the man's death was a tragic loss to the CFS community. Scroll down for video . Smoke bellowed from an uncontrollable bushfire in Nantawarra, 20 kilometres north of Port Wakefield . 'It is with deep regret that we confirm the death of a CFS volunteer following injuries sustained at the Nantawarra fire in South Australia today,' he said in a statement. 'This is a tragic loss to the CFS community and our deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends during this difficult time.' The man was believed to have fallen from the back of a ute and suffered burns to 70 per cent of his body. He was airlifted by helicopter to Adelaide for treatment, while the blaze continues to rage in South Australians mid-north. 'We believe (he) is a farmer operating on a private farm fire unit,' a CFS spokesman told ABC radio.

"A New York congressman shocked his Long Island audience on Sept. 12 by saying that as many as 40 Americans have returned to the U.S. after fighting for the ISIS terror army overseas, and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has them all under surveillance. Democratic Rep. Tim Bishop made the remarks during a breakfast speech to Long Island Metro Business Action, a regional economic development organization. 'One of the concerns is the number of U.S. citizens who have left our country to go join up with ISIS,' he said. 'It is believed there have been some number up to 100 that have done that.' 'It is also believed that some 40 of those who left this country to join up with ISIS have now returned to our country. Those 40 are under FBI attention and surveillance. So they are known and they are being tracked by the FBI.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New York Democratic Rep. Tim Bishop told the Long Island Metro Business Action group on Sept. 12 that 40 Americans have returned to the U.S. after going overseas to fight for ISIS, and that the FBI has all of them under surveillance . The Pentagon says only about a dozen Americans have gone overseas to join up with ISIS, but Rep. Bishop said more than three times that number have already gone and returned to the US . American jihadis, part of a swelling 'foreign fighter' contingent aiding the self-designated Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) could put their ideologies and experience to work in the United States, a fact that has some in Congress clamoring for easier ways to revoke their citizenship. The Pentagon said two weeks ago that only about a dozen Americans had left the country to join up with ISIS, while as many as 100 are suspected of taking up arms with a wider range of Islamist extremist groups in the Middle East and Africa. Although Bishop cited a larger number of confirmed U.S. citizens who have come back into the United States after fighting for ISIS, he insisted that they don't pose a serious threat. 'At the present time,' he said, 'the intelligence is ISIS does not present a threat to the homeland, although that is not something that will remain static going out into the future.' 'But there is a concern,' he allowed, 'that it could metastasize in such a way that it could become a threat to the homeland.' Bishop backed President Barack Obama's approach to defeating the terrorist would-be country, which he said 'is a very, very complex and very, very dangerous threat.' Referring to remarks Obama delivered on Sept, 10, he said, 'I think the plan that the president outlined the other night [in his national speech] is a good plan.' The president 'is correct to recognize the threat, and it clearly is a threat to the stability of the Middle East, a region that is already remarkably unstable.' The Washington Free Beacon first reported on Bishop's remarks. Up to 12,000 so-called 'foreign fighters' from 50 countries have joined with various Muslim militant groups, including those who fight alongside ISIS in Iraq and Syria, according to the U.S. State Department. ISIS itself can now muster 31,000 troops, the CIA reported on Sept. 17. That number has grown dramatically since June 29, when ISIS declared itself a 'caliphate,' or an Islamic nation led by a supreme religious authority. On Thursday, Senate Democrats thwarted legislation that would have revoked the citizenship of Americans who swear allegiance to terror groups that threaten the U.S. Foreign fighters: As many as 12,000 soldiers in the 31,000-man ISIS terror army have traveled into Syria or Iraq to join the Islamist group in battle . FBI Director James Comey said he would welcome a legal tool to keep ISIS fighters from returning to the US by stripping them of citizenship, but fears it would be hard to argue cases in court without publicly describing classified intelligence . Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii put a halt to Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz's attempt to fast-track the bill, objecting that her party needed more time to consider its legal implications. James Comey, the director of the FBI, told a Capitol Hearing Thursday that he would be open to seeing such a law passed. But he expressed concerns that it could be impractical to enforce in court since much of the evidence would likely be classified. 'How would I protect sources and methods?' he asked. 'How would we be able to use, if at all, classified information to make the showing that would be necessary [in court]?' Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican, told Secretary of State John Kerry in a separate hearing that Congress should do more to restrict the travel of ISIS fighters who hold American passports. 'I think we need a way to approach this to make certain that their ability to come into the United States is made a hell of a lot more difficult than it is right now,' Royce said.","Long Island Rep. told a business group on Sept. 12 that the would-be terrorists 'are known and are being tracked'

"Frank Lampard has revealed that he rejected an offer from his uncle Harry Redknapp to join QPR before deciding to sign for New York City. Lampard was unveiled in Brooklyn on Thursday after it was confirmed that the former Chelsea midfielder has agreed a two-year deal to play for the Manchester City owned club in Major League Soccer next season. But the 36-year-old admitted that he and his father Frank Snr spoke with QPR boss Redknapp – who gave him a first-team break at West Ham in 1996 – about staying in the Premier League after he left Stamford Bridge at the end of last season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Frank Lampard in his first press conference at New York City . Snub: Frank Lampard rejected an offer from QPR before signing for New York City . ‘We had some conversations and so did my dad,’ said Lampard. ‘I think my dad spoke to Harry quite a lot. But it wasn't really an option for me. ‘I had 13 years at Chelsea and it's something very dear to me, so it would have been difficult to play for a club so close. From that point of view coming out here to New York is a good option. It's a new start. ‘I was aware before the World Cup that I was leaving Chelsea. I had a decision to make and I didn't want to make it during the World Cup, even though I was thinking about my future. ‘I’ve only made the decision very recently but I've been handed something which is an outstanding opportunity. ‘There were other options, yes. Some in England, other parts of the world but this was the one that always stood out to me. The idea of coming to this city and playing for a new team with a really good vision for the future, it just made it easy for me. It wasn't a hard decision.’ Option: Lampard and his father Frank Snr spoke with QPR boss Harry Redknapp about a move . Lampard will team up with David Villa at New York next season but is unlikely to follow the Spanish star to City’s other sister team, Melbourne, to stay fit in the meantime. It is unclear where the England midfielder will train before pre-season begins in January, but he is determined to be ready for the new challenge. ‘I really don't know but I will have to keep fit,’ said Lampard. ‘I'll have to train at the very top level, whether that's on my own or with a club somewhere. I'll have to see. ‘Pre-season here will start mid to late January and that will soon come around. I've had time out of football with injury before – three or four months sometimes and it's not that long. ‘In the meantime of course I'll keep fit and make sure my levels don't drop too much. When we come here for pre-season I want to be ready to go. I want to fly out of the blocks. I don't want to come out sluggish.’ Wanted: Redknapp had hoped to lure his nephew to Loftus Road along with Rio Ferdinand . Lampard is certain there will be an increasing trend of top players moving to MLS, and believes his old Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will approve of his decision. ‘Absolutely, the quality has grown and there are players from England and players from all around the world coming here,’ he added. ‘There are new clubs springing up like this one. Players like David Villa are coming in. You're hearing names linked with clubs here all the time and it's a very attractive option for players to come and play here. ‘I haven't spoken to Jose that much about it but he'll understand why I've done it. He loves coming out here for pre-season. Maybe he'll come out and have a game against us, he'd get that for sure. ‘But this was a decision for me to take, nobody else. And I know it's the right one. I'm sure Jose will respect my decision. He'll support me no matter what. Wherever I'm playing we'll always be close. Even if we're far away, I'll still admire him and support Chelsea.’ Blessing: The Chelsea legend claimed he is sure Jose Mourinho respects his decision to play for New York City .","Frank Lampard reveals he could have signed for Queens Park Rangers .

The German-flagged MV Colombo Express and the Singaporean-flagged MV Maersk Tanjong collided at the mouth of the canal, knocking three containers from the Colombo Express into the sea, and causing a 65 foot long dent to the vessel, the sources said. The collision was expected to delay traffic through the canal in both directions. Scroll down for video . Two container ships collided at the the northern end of Egypt's Suez Canal yesterday, delaying traffic through a vital global trade route . The vessels, the German-flagged MV Colombo Express and the Singaporean MV Maersk Tanjong, appeared to be travelling side by side before the collision . Agents Inchape Shipping Services said: 'The incident has severely interrupted the second southbound convoy and the northbound convoy is therefore expected to be delayed.' The Suez Canal is one of the world's most strategic waterways, facilitating much of the maritime trade between Europe and Asia, providing about $5 billion in annual revenue for Egypt. Three containers were knocked from the Colombo Express during the accident which delayed traffic through the Suez Canal in both directions; both ships remain parked in the canal lakes while authorities investigate the incident .

"A 32st sumo wrestler who has spent 30 years and £9,000 learning to drive claims she can't pass her test because she is unable to fit in the instructors' cars. Professional wrestler Sharran Alexander, from London, has had 10 instructors turn her away from driving lessons because she was unable to squeeze behind the wheel of their vehicles. She has already spent £9,000 trying to gain her driving licence - and has even sat the driving test five times, spending £62 on each go, with no success. Scroll down for video . Sharran Alexander, a 32st sumo wrestler, who claims she keeps failing her driving test because she is unable to fit in the instructor's car . The smallest car Miss Alexander  can squeeze into is a Ford Focus, but she says many instructors have just refused to teach her due to her size and difficulty in fitting behind the wheel. And even when she has been able to get behind the wheel for the test, she says her nerves get the better of her. Miss Alexander explained: 'I'm six foot tall and the cars people learn to drive in are just too small. 'When I book a lesson with a new instructor I always tell them ""I'm as big as sumo wrestler"" but I don't think they take me literally! 'In the last few years I'm sure they've even got smaller. Miss Alexander in action as a professional sumo wrestler taking part in the Women's Openweight final at the US Sumo Open last year . 'Even when I try and warn instructors on the phone by saying that I'm a big person and there needs to be room for two giants it has gone wrong. 'I once went all the way to Eastbourne in the hope of an instructor who would fit me in - but when I arrived the seatbelt didn't go round me and I had to buy a seatbelt extender. 'Ten instructors have just flat out said no. They're never rude, they always try and help but I've been told if the steering wheel doesn't turn freely in front of me it's just not safe for me to drive. 'And more than once I've turned up and, even though I've fitted into the car, the instructor hasn't been able to get in after me. 'It makes me nervous that I'm not cut out to drive and I really suffer with nerves - it's just so difficult under pressure. Miss Alexander has so far been unable to gain her driving licence despite sitting the test five times . Miss Alexander has admitted that during the driving test, she suffers from nerves and says when it comes to the test, she just 'goes to pieces' 'Whether I've been doing the most recent set of lessons for six months or six years I still have the same nerve problems . 'When it comes to the test I just go to pieces.' But even when Miss Alexander has been able to make it behind the wheels of a car, she has struggled to make it out of first gear. This is despite spending a year taking classes with the AA costing £1700, doing three at intensive courses at £750 a time and having lessons with another six private instructors over the years. However, she still manages to clock up both majors and minors, when it comes to sitting the test. At the moment she has to spend £100 a day on taxis to so she can visit her parents, who are ill and live on opposite sides of London, to care for them. Sumo wrestler Miss Alexander, pictured competing in India last year, weighs in at 32 stone and is six foot tall . After realising that it was unsustainable to spend so much money, she has now signed up for an intervention and is currently being taught to drive by instructor Ursula Young from the ITV show Undrivables. Miss Alexander explained: 'I was spending hundreds on taxis every week and I realised that if I had a car things would be so much easier so I started trying to learn again without much luck. 'Desperate times called for desperate measures and I knew I needed professional help so I signed up for the show. 'Ursula has given me the confidence and brought me faith in myself to believe that when I finally get to take the test - I'll be ready. 'I fell down the stairs during filming and ended up on crutches so I couldn't take the test before the show ended. 'But Ursula is still in touch and helping me get back in the car - that's just the kind of person she is. She wants to see me succeed. 'It's crazy thinking about it. I've had hundreds of lessons and spent thousands of pounds and I'm still waiting to pass.'","Sharran Alexander says she has spent 30 years trying to learn to drive .

"Resplendent in a fitted navy blue dress and a stylish pair of specs, the Duchess of Cornwall made an impassioned plea for more people to use credit unions during a speech at Clarence House today. Camilla, 67, admitted to being 'no financial wizard' but said that credit unions 'serve people not profit' and added that it didn't take a banking expert to recognise that they can provide a 'common-sense basic banking service to ordinary people'. The Duchess, who herself has a credit union account, was joined at the reception by people from the worlds of business, banking and politics, as well as credit union members. Specs appeal! The Duchess of Cornwall looked stylish in her specs as she made a speech at Clarence House . Also at the reception, which took place this morning at Prince Charles and Camilla's London home, were celebrity supporters, among them Irish singer-songwriter Imelda May, TV presenter Eamonn Holmes and money-saving expert, Martin Lewis. Speaking to guests at the reception, the Duchess added: 'I believe credit unions can change the way we talk and think about savings and loans. 'They can encourage those who have the means to save, and bring in from the cold those vulnerable people who struggle to qualify for loans. 'The simple fact is that if more of us support them by opening savings accounts, they will be able to offer more loans to those who really need them.' Camilla's interest in credit unions began in 2010, when she visited North Wiltshire credit union in Chippenham. Important: Camilla chats to Jacqueline Gordon-Edwards and Emma Watson who were helped by credit unions . Expert: The Duchess was joined by money-saving expert Martin Lewis and Eamonn Holmes at the reception . Celebrity support: Along with Eamonn Holmes, supporters included BBC journalist Paul Lewis and Imelda May . Since then, the Duchess has visited six other unions in England, Scotland, Wales and most recently, the Assiniboine Credit Union in Manitoba, Canada. Credit Unions are regulated, not-for-profit community banks which provide a place for their members to save money and access loans. They are run by their members and exist to serve them, and consequently are often very engaged with their local communities. In total, the UK boasts 524 credit unions with more than 1.5 million members, while worldwide, there are more than 57,000 with 208 million members spread across 103 countries. Because there are no shareholders and they are not driven by profit, credit unions can offer very low interest rates – on average 12 per cent a year – for those seeking loans to tide them over in financial difficulties. Enjoying herself: Camilla, who is the president of the UK Vineyard Association, spent yesterday in Kent . Lovely: During her visit to the Chapel Down Winery, she was given a magnum of new vintage, Cuvée Camilla . This compares with payday lenders such as Wonga, the country’s largest, which has charged a staggering 5,853 per cent in annual interest. MPs, debt campaigners and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is involved in setting up the Church of England’s own credit union, have all joined the growing clamour of critics branding short-term lenders ‘legal loan sharks’. Camilla herself was reluctant to broach the topic of payday lenders but did encourage more to join credit unions. 'I do believe that credit unions could be a real force for change in the financial landscape,' she added, 'and are truly a cause worth championing.' Memory: At St Ronan's School, she unveiled an astroturf pitch which will be named Shand-Ba after her brother . Tragic: Camilla's brother had been due to return to the school but died before he was able to visit . Enthusiastic: The Duchess was greeted by crowds of flag waving children as she arrived at the Kent school . The Duchess is in the middle of a busy run of engagements that yesterday included a visit to Kent, where she met pupils at her brother Mark Shand's former school. The late conservationist attended Saint Ronan's School between the ages of eight and 13 and was due to return to speak to pupils before his untimely death aged 62 in New York in April. Following the visit, during which the Duchess unveiled a new astroturf sports pitch that will be named Shand-Ba in Mr Shand's memory, she continued on to Chapel Down Winery in the nearby village of Tenterden. There, after inspecting the vines and cutting some grapes, she was presented with a magnum of the vineyard's newest vintage, a white wine named Cuvée Camilla.","The Duchess of Cornwall looked spectacular in navy as she made a speech .

"Nico Rosberg appreciates his Mercedes bosses have endured a 'very difficult' time handling his relationship with Lewis Hamilton this season. Motorsport boss Toto Wolff, non-executive chairman Niki Lauda and executive technical director Paddy Lowe have been forced to contend with a fair share of issues between Rosberg and Hamilton. The partnership threatened to explode at one point over the course of the Monaco Grand Prix weekend in late May when Rosberg took pole via a dubious manoeuvre during qualifying that Hamilton believed was deliberate. Strained: Nico Rosberg (R) has admitted his relationship with Lewis Hamilton has been hard on the team . Peace keeper: Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has had to contend with the fractious relationship between drivers . A one-two followed, with Rosberg taking the chequered flag ahead of a furious Hamilton, resulting in neither acknowledging the other during a tense podium ceremony. Wolff and Lauda did well to keep the lid on that particular saga, and whilst there have been other niggles along the way, for now there is a peace of sorts. But with the championship a two-horse race as the duo are separated by just 14 points in the title fight, there is plenty of opportunity yet for the battle to become truly explosive. Asked whether he felt there would have been more fireworks by now, Rosberg was cryptic with his response as he said: 'You don't know, maybe there have been more fireworks. There could have been.' Pressed on the matter, Rosberg added: 'Yeah, but I've forgotten! 'It's always the same, it doesn't change. It's neutral, sometimes easier, sometimes with more difficult periods. 'You just work through the difficult ones and that's it. It hasn't really changed.' Flare up: The German hinted that there have been more fireworks with Lewis Hamilton than revealed . Playing catch up: Lewis Hamilton trails his teammate by 14 points in the driver's championship . For those in charge, though, Rosberg said: 'It's difficult, very difficult. 'We need to find a balance because in the first instance we're racing for Mercedes, representing Mercedes and wanting to do a good job for them. 'We're also representing the thousand-plus people - my colleagues - at the factory who have families and who depend on us. 'So we need to work as a team, but there comes a point where you want to beat the other guy. It's a fine line.' That fine line is becoming a well-worn path that could well become a furrow as the season enters the final stretch and the nerves and tension increase. In turn, that will apply further pressure on the likes of Wolff and Lauda . 'It's a very, very difficult job,' assessed Rosberg. 'There are difficult periods to manage the whole situation, but we're very fortunate because we're set up really well from that point of view. 'The three of them - Niki, Toto, Paddy - more Toto and Paddy who do more of the day-to-day running, I'm grateful for the way they have managed the team and the situations. 'They've done a good job, but it will remain a challenge.' Need for speed: Nico Rosberg is looking for a first podium in Hungary but was behind his teammate in practice . Fine tuning: Lewis Hamilton complained about braking during practice in Budapest . Rosberg's challenge this season is to score his first career podium at the Hungaroring where Hamilton has won four times in seven years. On Friday, Hamilton at least continued his love affair with the track as he finished quickest at the end of both practice sessions. Quickest in FP1 when the medium-compound tyre was used throughout, Hamlton posted a time of one minute 25.814 seconds, finishing 0.183secs clear of Rosberg. Come FP2 when the drivers were allowed a run on the soft Pirelli rubber, the faster of the two choices this weekend, Hamilton improved to 1:24.482secs, with Rosberg down by 0.238secs. The session was not without its difficulties for Mercedes, though, as Hamilton at one stage complained of a loss of braking. That will likely have sounded a few alarm bells on the pit wall in light of Hamilton's accident during qualifying last Saturday for the German Grand Prix when he suffered a 30g impact into a tyre wall after a right-front brake disc failure. As for Rosberg, there were engine concerns just over two thirds of the way through, although neither man seemed overly burdened as long runs were eventually undertaken. Close: Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel was within a second of leader Lewis Hamilton during parctice . For Hamilton, a lack of grip left him particularly unhappy as he said: 'The tyres don't feel very good here. 'There was very, very poor grip out there. I don't know if that's the tyres or the track, but it was pretty bad. 'You're driving so slow to look after the tyres it feels like you have to slow down too much now to the point it's a bit boring . 'So we have some work to do overnight to ensure we get the best set-up for the weekend as we're not fully comfortable with the car just yet.' Reigning four-times champion Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull and double title-holder in Ferrari's Fernando Alonso were the only two drivers to finish within a second of Hamilton. McLaren's Jenson Button was 1.752secs back in ninth, with Marussia's Max Chilton down in 21st and just over four seconds in arrears.","Nico Rosberg says strained relationship with Lewis Hamilton affects team .

"An historic collection of some of the first photographs taken in China have sold for a staggering £40,000 - four times the estimated value. The album of rare images and also watercolours was complied by a British interpreter who worked in the Far East  for 50 years in the 19th century. Enterprising Herbert Elgar Hobson collected the shots of dignitaries, ships, landscapes and cities when he worked with the Chinese Maritime Customs Service - a governmental tax collection agency. The collection - one of the best ever seen by experts - remained with his family until it sold for £40,000 at Dominic Winter auctioneers in Gloucestershire on Thursday. Pictures of life in China in the 1860s: Herbert Elgar Hobson's photographs reveal an insight into daily life and traditional clothing of the Manchu Qing dynasty era . The collection, here featuring distinctive architecture from the period, was sold at Dominic Winter auction rooms for four times it's estimate, at a staggering £40,000 . Auctioneer and senior valuer Chris Albury said: 'It was an album of about 200 photographs and watercolours and printed items from between 1860 and 1870. 'They were collected by Herbert Elgar Hobson, who was an interpreter for General Gordon during the Taiping Rebellion.

'We had £10,000 to £15,000 on it as an album but there was a lot more interest in it than we expected.' He added: 'It is very special and different. The fascinating archive shows China at the birth of modern photography and features some of the country's first ever photographs . Herbert Elgar Hobson joined the Imperial Maritime Customs in China in 1861 and worked his way up to Commissioner in 1873- during which time, he took about 200 photographs . The photographs document an interesting time for China around the time of the Taiping Rebellion, a massive civil war in the south against the ruling Manchu Qing dynasty, and here features men wearing military dress . 'People who view these things see a lot of them and they get jaded, but every now and then one comes a long and you say 'wow' - and this was one of those. 'It is more than the sum of its parts. 'It has some amazing photographs, some in fantastic condition. 'Everything in the album is annotated by Hobson in his own hand so it offers a fascinating insight into thoughts of the time. Hobson was born in Ashbourne, Derbyshire and arrived in Shanghai in August 1861 where he worked until his retirement in 1912 . The album contained around 200 photographs and watercolour which were taken between 1860 and 1870 . 'When I first opened it I sat down and looked at it and when I finished I didn't know what to say.' There were five bidders of the phone from America, the UK and China, as well as buyers in the room from France and Ireland and a handful of internet hopefuls. The album - as well as a second smaller collection by the same collector - went to the same agent on the phone bidder from America.

"Louis van Gaal has criticised the decision to play a pre-season game against Roma in the afternoon heat of Colorado on Saturday. It is expected to be 33 degrees in Denver when Manchester United’s game kicks off and the new Old Trafford manager pulled no punches when asked about the prospect. 'You are fully right to ask that,' Van Gaal said. 'It is unbelievable that we play at two o’clock. We will adapt to the situation because all the players will play for 45 minutes except Tom Cleverley, who will have to play the whole match.'

"A man has totally transformed his life after losing an astonishing 15st and, in the process, found love. Rhys Jones joined a slimming club to tackle his dangerous size, losing the weight in just 20 months, and met Clare Jones, now his wife. Rhys, 40, weighed in at 27st 3lb and had a 50in waist at the start of his journey but has managed to reach 12st 1lb, with a 32in waistline through willpower alone. When Rhys first began his weight loss journey his waist measured 50in . Rhys managed to drop from 27st 3lb (left) to a slim 12st 1lb (right) in just 20 months . Newly slim Rhys, of Gwersyllt, Wrexham, celebrated his 40th birthday on Friday and then, in one of the happiest weeks of his life, got engaged on Saturday. He said: 'The weight loss has changed my life. I feel fantastic. Rhys, pictured with Clare, proudly shows off his success- showing his Slimming World awards and holding up his old trousers . 'I suppose it all came about after my friend wanted to go to Slimming World but she didn't want to go by herself, so I went along with her. 'I used to eat everything and anything unhealthy; takeaways, burgers, pizza, and I was addicted to chocolate. 'I would just eat and eat and eat to be honest. 'I've always been a happy-chappy type so being large didn't affect me too much but obviously I wasn't very happy about it.' Rhys shunned fad diets or surgery, instead reverting to the classic weight loss solution. He said: 'Healthy eating and exercise have played a key part in my weight loss but it has also taken sheer determination and willpower. It has been a case of 'just do it' really.' Despite working hard to shed the stone, Rhys said he doesn't deny himself a good time. He said: 'I still have a beer with the lads every now and then and enjoy myself. It isn't about just denying yourself - that's not fun.' Rhys said walking and swimming are his main ways of keeping active, as well as biking to and from work. Rhys works as a fishmonger at Tesco in Wrexham. Rhys is a shadow of his former self, and says it is all down to gentle exercise and moderate diet . Last week, Rhys and Clare enjoyed a walking getaway. He said: 'We walked about 70 miles during our time away. It was excellent. 'We spur each other on, we support one another which helps.' Rhys said Clare has lost nearly 3st since joining the group. On Saturday afternoon, Rhys popped the question while on a walk with Clare in Bradley. He said: 'As a group, Slimming World members do a lot of walks together, and the first walk we went on together with them was in Bradley. So I thought I'd take us back to where we started, I'm an old romantic really. Rhys and Clare, now engaged, enjoy walking together and Clare has even lost 3st just through following Rhys's diet and exercise regime . 'I'm just delighted she said 'yes'. As well as my achievement, I've got my gorgeous woman too.' As well as sticking to a healthy regime, Rhys said the support of loved ones has helped him. 'Of course Clare's been brilliant but so have my family. They've been amazing and they're really proud of me which is great,' he said. 'My housemate Becky has been smashing too. She's come along on walks with me and has been generally fantastic. I've got to say a big thank you to her. 'My Slimming World consultant Beth Jones has also been amazing, this is the first time she's given out a 15st award too. 'I just feel amazing, I feel lucky too to have these great people around me. I'm going to carry on leading a healthy lifestyle.'","Rhys  weighed 27st 3lb when a friend convinced him to join slimming club .

"Dunkin' Donuts plans to roll out a croissant-doughnut hybrid in the U.S. next week, but the company says please don't call it a 'Cronut.' The chain tells said it will launch its 'Croissant Donut' nationally for a limited time starting Nov. 3. It comes more than a year after the Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York City introduced its now trademarked Cronut, which became a viral sensation and spawned numerous knockoffs . Definitely not copying: . Last summer, Dunkin' also introduced a croissant-doughnut in South Korea it dubbed a 'New York Pie Donut.' John Costello, Dunkin's president of global marketing and innovation, said in a phone interview that bakers around the country have been mixing doughnuts and croissants for at least 20 years. He said Dunkin' is constantly tracking consumer and bakery trends and has been looking at pastry 'combinations' for several years now. 'Are we copying a specific bakery in New York? The answer is no,' Costello said in a phone interview. The Croissant Donut is one of several new offerings Dunkin' has in the pipeline after reporting disappointing quarterly sales last week and warning it might struggle to make its long-term growth targets this year. Among the challenges the company is facing is increased competition, with chains including Taco Bell going after the breakfast crowd. Dunkin', based in Canton, Massachusetts, has nevertheless been opening new U.S. locations and last week said it sees potential for more than 17,000 U.S. locations over time, up from its current 8,000. Original: French pastry chef Dominique Ansel has fiercely protected his trademarked creation . As for the Croissant Donut, Dunkin' says the pastry will cost $2.49. That's less than the $5 for a Cronut, but more than twice the $1 or so for other Dunkin' doughnuts, making it more profitable for the company. The Croissant Donut will be covered with the same glaze used for its Glazed Donut, giving it a familiar taste, but won't have any cream filling like the Cronut. Costello said Dunkin' is looking at fillings and glazes for future versions. Ansel was not available for comment. When asked to explain how the Croissant Donut and Cronut differ, Dunkin's Executive Chef Jeff Miller said: 'I've tried the product that you mention. As the executive chef of Dunkin', I like ours better.' Rob Branca, a franchisee who's on Dunkin's committee that develops new products, said his friends and acquaintances have been asking when the company would roll out a version of the Cronut. He said he thinks the Croissant Donut will be a hit because the popularity of Cronuts hasn't faded. But he noted it took some time for Dunkin' to come out with its croissant-doughnut hybrid. 'We're going to be selling a lot more of them than a single shop bakery, so it was important to do it right,' Branca said.","Dunkin' will release $2.49 'Croissant Donut' next week in stores nationwide .

"Federal prosecutors have charged a Roman Catholic priest who is alleged to have engaged in 'illicit sexual conduct' with children and as well as possessing images of child abuse in the rectory of his church. Fr Joseph D. Maurizo Jr, 69 was charged following an investigation by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Secuirty Investigations unit into his activities during trips to Honduras. Fr Maurizo appeared in Federal court yesterday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and was remanded in custody until Monday morning. Fr Joseph Maurizo was arrested following and investigation by federal authorities into allegations of child sex abuse, agents raiding Maurizo's home recovered digital storage media alleged to contain images of child abuse . Fr Maurizo was parish priest at Our Lady Queen of Angels Church in Central City, Pennsylvania until his arrest when he was forced to stand aside. According to Federal prosecutors, between 1999 and 2009 Maurizo travelled from Pennsylvania to Honduras as part of a non-profit organisation he established providing help to small children in Central America. Each trip lasted between two and three weeks. According to a statement released by the United States Attorney's office: 'The HSI Pittsburgh investigation that began in February revealed that during the timeframe in which he travelled to Honduras, Maurizio engaged in various and numerous unlawful sexual activities with minors. 'However, after the charged illicit sexual conduct occurred in March of 2009, Maurizio did not engage in any foreign travel again until July of 2011. 'From July 2011 through the present, foreign travel records indicate that Maurizio has made approximately 10 separate trips to various Central American countries. 'On September 12, search warrants were executed by HSI special agents at the rectory at Our Lady Queen of Angels Church in Central City, Pennsylvania, and a farm owned by Maurizio in Windber. 'Dozens of pieces of evidence were seized from the rectory including four computers, a laptop, hundreds of CDs, a loose hard drive, camera, floppy disks, thumb drives, VHS tapes and media cards. Fr Maurizio, centre,  is accused by federal authorities of travelling to Honduras to abuse vulnerable children . Maurizio also faces a child porn charge based on images of a prepubescent boy posing on a bed with his genitals exposed. Maurizio has said abuse allegations against him were a bogus plot by the Honduran government to thwart his charity work. The priest's attorney, Steven Passarello, said the criminal complaint regurgitates allegations made five years ago after the priest's charity had a falling out with a local charity. He said children were bribed or coerced into making abuse allegations. According to the complaint, ICE's Pittsburgh office of Homeland Security Investigations began investigating in February after a board member of a nonprofit that assists Honduran street children reported abuse allegations against Maurizio on a watchdog website that tracks such claims against Catholic priests. 'The board member reported the allegations of abuse to the website after growing dissatisfied with what he believed to be an apparent lack of progress in the four-year criminal investigation of Maurizio,' the complaint said. Homeland Security agents learned that the FBI began investigating allegations that the priest abused Honduran children in 2009, it said. The FBI said it couldn't comment on the delay in the investigation but said it was working with ICE. Federal agents have travelled to Honduras where they have interviewed several alleged victims who claim Mauizio abused them, took naked photographs and offered them chocolates in return for performing sex acts. Maurizio would face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign place. The pornography charge carries a 10-year maximum sentence upon conviction.

"Jessica Judd, the teenage 800 metres star who shot to prominence by breaking the two-minute barrier last year, takes on the might of female British middle-distance running at the Sainsbury’s Glasgow Grand Prix with a point to prove. Judd finished fourth at the British Championships last month, beaten by Scotland’s European champion Lynsey Sharp and English duo Jenny Meadows and Alison Leonard, all of whom are competing at Hampden Park. Laura Muir, 21, is also dropping down to the two-lap race after setting a Scottish 1500m record in Paris last week. It promises to be quite a battle, less than three weeks from the 800m final at the Commonwealth Games in the same stadium, with selection for August’s European Championships also at stake. Hair we go: Judd took inspiration from Paula Radcliffe and is now gunning for Grand Prix glory . Judd, 19, has already lowered her lifetime best to 1min 59.77sec in Oslo this year, but she’s determined this season will not be a repeat of 2013 when she set personal bests in May and June then failed to progress from the heats at the World Championships. She said: ‘I don’t want to just run fast times in May or June, I want to back it up when it matters. The 800m is the most competitive it has been for ages. Everyone’s there, and everyone can come out and run a fast time. The competition in Great Britain is brilliant and the fact there are so many of us is only going to make it better.’ Judd has sought guidance from marathon world record-holder Paula Radcliffe following three ‘unbelievably hard’ months without running after suffering a stress fracture in her back in November. She turned her ankle during a cross-country run in Basildon but carried on training before feeling ‘like a ghost’ and realising her back was the problem. Judd could not run on Christmas Day for the first time in memory, nor by her 19th birthday in  January, and drove her parents mad ‘bouncing off the walls’, desperate to get back on the track. She was also frustrated that her plan to take a gap year and delay her place at Bath University to read human biology had seen her largely confined to the gym and swimming pool. Judd said: ‘I had broken a bone in my back when I fell but I carried on training because I was more focused on my ankle. I was gutted; really despondent. ‘Paula knew it was really hard for me and she really did get me through it. She gave me some really nice shoes for aqua jogging — trainers for the pool, basically. It’s nice to take inspiration from her because she’s been through it all.’ Judd genuinely loves running. Just like Radcliffe, she would run even if it were not her job, because it is her passion. This is more unusual than you might think for an elite athlete, and Judd has had to rely heavily on her coach, former Commonwealth 5,000m champion Rob Denmark, to keep her from doing too much, too soon. Passion: Judd genuinely loves running like marathon world record-holder Paula Radcliffe . The Canvey Island athlete speaks with enthusiasm and stands out on the track because her long, brown hair flows behind her when she competes, but her style is  distinctive, too. She calls it ‘unpleasant’, but the tall, long-limbed Judd is simply a little clunky and choppy. She and Denmark have, however, been working in the gym and biomechanics lab to try to alter how she runs. Judd said: ‘My running style is very strange. I know it’s not brilliant. I look really unpleasant when I run so I’m trying to make it a bit smoother. There will be certain traits I will never get rid of, but I want to be the best in the world. ‘We’ve taken on different types of training to make me stronger. I just did runs, press-ups and runs again, but now I’ve got an elite programme. I’m always busy and I love it. I just want more and more.’ Jess Judd is supported by the Sky Academy Scholarships Scheme.","Judd will take on Lynsey Sharp, Jenny Meadows and Alison Leonard at Hampden Park .

"Australian universities are in the good books with eight tertiary institutions now ranked inside the world's top 200 - but there are warnings that the planned deregulation of fees could threaten the standard of the nation's education system. Australia has increased its representation in the 2014-15 Times Higher Education World University rankings, with most of the nation's top institutions improving their standings on last year. Melbourne University is still leading the local pack, climbing one spot from last year to be in 33rd place, ahead of the Australian National University (45) and University of Sydney (60).

Of Australia's eight universities in the top 200, only fourth-ranked Queensland University lost ground in the latest standings. Time Higher Education World University Rankings editor Phil Baty said the improvement, and the fact another 12 Australian universities were ranked in the 200 to 400 bracket, provides evidence of a world class university system. 'It's a really impressive performance,' Mr Baty said. 'I think the great thing for Australia is they've got great strength in depth. 'It's not just the eight in the top 200 but below the 200 there's a really healthy group of really interesting universities.'

However, while he lauded the universities, Mr Baty issued a note of caution about Australia's future in tertiary studies. He said the government's plans to deregulate tuition fees from 2016 could reshape the landscape in the coming years. 'The big question is whether this admirable strength-in-depth can be maintained,' Mr Baty said. 'The reforms may help a small Australian elite protect or even improve their global standing, but what about the rest? It may mean the second-tier institutions are weakened. 'There is a lot at stake over the next few years.' The Australian National University remains the nation's second ranked Australian institution (up three spots to 45th overall) followed by Sydney University, which climbed several spots to be 60th. University of Sydney ranks 3rd of Australian tertiary institutions behind University of Melbourne and ANU but has moved up several places on world rankings to be in 60th place . University of Sydney ranks third of the Australian institutions, with eight of them in the world's top 200 including new addition in the University of Adelaide. The US and UK dominate the top 10 . California Institute of Technology held on to the world's top ranking for the fourth straight year ahead of Harvard University, with the US filling seven of the top 10 spots. The UK holds the other three, led by third-placed Oxford. Leading Asian institutions continue to rise with 24 universities in the top 200, an increase of 20 on last year.

"Charged: Maine resident Sidney Kilmartin (pictured) is accused of sending the poison to former soldier Andrew Denton's home in Hull . An American man who posted cyanide to a suicidal Englishman who later took his own life has been charged in connection to the death. Maine resident Sidney Kilmartin, 52, is accused of sending the poison to former soldier Andrew Denton's home in Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire in 2012, according to papers filed with the U.S. District Court. British and U.S authorities launched a joint investigation after learning Denton, 49, had ordered the potassium cyanide online and used it to commit suicide after struggling with depression. Over 18 months, officers were able to track the mail order down to Kilmartin's home in the town of Windham, near Portland. He was arrested and charged with mailing injurious articles resulting in death - a crime that could result in him spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted. Potassium cyanide is a highly toxic, colorless salt often used in gold mining and electroplating. Exposure to it can result in rapid death. The court papers say Kilmartin, who lived in South Windham, posted the poison 'with the intent to kill or injure another.' Authorities arrested Kilmartin yesterday morning, and he remains in custody in the Maine city of Bangor, Attorney Halsey B. Frank said. Kilmartin is understood to have pleaded not guilty to the crime during a primarily court hearing yesterday. He is expected to make a second appearance at a detention hearing scheduled for November 14, according to Inquisitr. Officers are said to be in the dark as to how Kilmartin came into possession of the deadly cyanide, as he is not thought to have worked in industries where the product was used. Kilmartin could have faced the death penalty if convicted, but U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder intervened and declined to seek it in this case, the Portland Press Herald reported. At the court hearing, Kilmartin's attorney, Jeffrey Silverstein, asked that a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity be recorded. Location: Holland Street in Hull where former soldier Andrew Denton lived before his suicide in 2012 . At Mr Denton’s inquest in Hull, the coroner’s court was told that remnants of potassium cyanide had been found at his home. The toxicology report confirmed that he had died from cyanide poisoning.","Sidney Kilmartin, 52, accused of sending poison to British former soldier .

"Investigators say the student who killed a classmate before taking his own life at a suburban Denver high school described himself in a diary as 'a psychopath with a superiority complex' and indicated he was exacting revenge for being teased in elementary school. In a report released Friday by the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office, Karl Pierson, 18, wrote that he planned the Dec. 13 attack at Arapahoe High School to start a conversation about elementary school teasing. 'Words hurt, can mold a sociopath, and will lead someone a decade later to kill,' he wrote in a document titled 'A diary of a madman.' The student who killed a classmate before taking his own life at a suburban Denver high school described wrote in a diary that he was exacting revenge for being teased in elementary school . Karl Pierson shot and killed 17-year-old classmate Claire Davis before taking his own life in the school library as security officers closed in on him . Police have said Pierson held a grudge against his debate coach and was targeting him when he entered the school with a shotgun, a machete, homemade bombs and 125 rounds of ammunition. Pierson shot and killed 17-year-old classmate Claire Davis before taking his own life in the school library as security officers closed in on him. The coach escaped unharmed. Police have said Pierson planned to harm many people. He wrote numbers and letters corresponding to the library and four other classrooms on his forearm before entering the school. The shootings shocked Littleton Public Schools, one of many across Colorado that bolstered protocols for identifying the severity of threats and fashioning response plans after the 1999 shooting at nearby Columbine High School left 13 people dead. The two gunmen, both Columbine students, then killed themselves. Pierson wrote numbers and letters corresponding to the library and four other classrooms on his forearm before entering the school. Pierson, pictured here in September 2013, held a grudge against his debate coach and was targeting him when he entered the school with a shotgun, a machete, homemade bombs and 125 rounds of ammunition . School disciplinary records showed that in September 2013, Arapahoe High officials deemed Pierson 'not a high-level of threat' after he shouted a death threat against the debate coach after his demotion from team captain. Pierson was allowed to return to class less than a week after the threat. Disciplinary records said Pierson showed no remorse over the incident.

Littleton Public Schools officials have refused to discuss their handling of that incident. 'Words hurt, can mold a sociopath, and will lead someone a decade later to kill,' Pierson wrote in a document titled 'A diary of a madman' Two days before the shooting, Pierson was sent to the assistant principal's office after pounding on a locked classroom door and yelling, disturbing other classrooms, according to the documents. He was sent home for the day. Authorities have said Pierson entered the school through a door that should have been locked but was propped open. Christina Erbacher-Kolk, a school security guard at the time, has said that administrators took no action after she and another guard saw Pierson looking up guns on his computer at school less than two months before the shooting.

"England’s Test series against India exploded with ill-feeling on Tuesday night when Jimmy Anderson was charged with a physical assault on Ravindra Jadeja. The sensational claim revolves around an incident between the pair as they left the field for lunch on the second day of the first Test at Trent Bridge. Anderson is alleged to have pushed and verbally abused the India all-rounder and could face a ban of up to four Tests after being charged with a serious Level Three offence under the International Cricket Council’s Code of Conduct. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alastair Cook's reaction to James Anderson disciplinary saga . Alleged altercation: James Anderson and Ravi Jadeja exchanged words at Trent Bridge . Heated: James Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja exchange words during the first Test at Trent Bridge . Article 2.3.3 of ICC's Code of Conduct . 'Where the facts of the alleged incident are not adequately or clearly covered by any of the above offences, conduct that either: (a) is contrary to the spirit of the game; or (b) brings the game into disrepute'. Level 3 penalty . All Level 3 breaches carry a penalty of between four and eight Suspension Points. Two suspension points equates to a ban of one Test, or two ODIs, depending on which type of match is scheduled next for the suspended player. England’s key bowler exchanged words with both Jadeja and India captain MS Dhoni as they left the field and then the row escalated in the pavilion corridor. India are adamant that Anderson instigated the physical clash but England counter that Jadeja was just as aggressive and had to be pulled away by Dhoni. No punches were thrown between the pair as they began to climb the narrow Trent Bridge stairs to the dressing rooms while Sportsmail understands there is no suggestion that there was any racial element to the row. Both sides settled down to lunch and England thought nothing more of it until they received a phone call from India coach Duncan Fletcher, who used to be in charge of England, on Monday saying they were pushing for the ban. England expressed their ‘surprise’ at the charge, which came in an ICC statement, on Tuesday and vowed to support Anderson, who went on to become man of the match in the drawn first Test more for his batting than his bowling. The ECB will make a counter-accusation blaming Jadeja as much as their man but will insist that both should face a lesser charge as they do not consider it to be serious and suspect India have a motive for pushing for the charge. Verbals: Anderson and Jadeja have a frank exchange of views out in the middle on day two of the first Test . Tension: James Anderson waits to talk to Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni at they walk off for lunch . Jubilant Jimmy: Anderson (centre) celebrates dismissing Ravindra Jadeja during the first Test . VIDEO England 'surprise' at Anderson charge . England believe that India want to push for a ban on Anderson because he is such a key figure in this series and are prepared to ‘sacrifice’ Jadeja, their second-choice spinner and a lower middle order batsman, in exchange. The ICC will now appoint a Judicial Commissioner who will compile evidence over the next 14 days, meaning there is no danger of Anderson being banned for Thursday’s second Test nor the third match at the Ageas Bowl. Yet if he is found guilty he could be banned for the last two Tests of the series at Old Trafford and the Kia Oval or, if England appeal, it could delay any suspension until the one-day series that immediately follows between the teams. Sportsmail understands that it is very much at the instigation of Dhoni, who has long been irked by Anderson’s sledging, that India have pushed for the serious charge rather than sorting things out between the teams. The Indian captain has long considered England to be an arrogant team, going back to the ‘jelly beans’ incident, also at Trent Bridge, between these nations seven years ago. Now he has his opportunity to hurt England. Jellybeangate: Zaheer Khan (centre) gestures to the ground where he said the sweets were in 2007 . The surprise is that this news, which came as a bolt from the blue after both teams had practiced on Tuesday, came when relations appeared to be cordial between the teams, certainly off the field where ECB chairman Giles Clarke has been involved in an ICC ‘power’ grab’ with the boards of India and Australia. The only hint of bad feeling on the pitch came towards the end of Anderson’s world record last-wicket stand of 198 with Joe Root when Ishant Sharma exchanged words with Root after having an appeal for caught behind turned down. Ironically, the fiery Anderson acted as peace-maker and pushed Root away. Now that ‘peace’ has been blown out of the water and the charge has guaranteed added spice when the teams take to the field for tomorrow’s second Test, when Anderson is unlikely to hold back when he bowls at Dhoni. ‘James Anderson categorically denies the charge made against him,’ said the ECB of a ‘minor incident’ in a statement made to pre-empt the governing body. ‘The ECB have pledged their total support of the player.’ Peacemaker: Jimmy Anderson (right) steps in to diffuse a row between Joe Root (centre) and Ishant Sharma . Squaring up: Joe Root (right) and Ishant Sharma were involved in a confrontation during the first Test . Making his point: Joe Root (right) and Ishant Sharma continue to argue during the first Test . Sportsmail understands that the umpires were not involved in the reporting of the matter and were quite happy to let the matter lie before India team manager Sunil Dev made the official complaint to the ICC. Dev said on Tuesday night he lodged the complaint only after talks with Dhoni. ‘The captain and everyone complained that he physically touched him,’ said the India manager. ‘It was all over the dressing room. It is a serious matter because you can’t push anybody. So I complained to the match referee.’ It means that Anderson could face unprecedented punishment for an England player. ‘All Level Three offences carry a penalty of between four and eight suspension points,’ said the ICC’s statement. ‘Two suspension points equate to a ban of one Test, or two ODIs, depending on which type of match is scheduled next for the suspended player.’ England will strongly dispute the charge but will see how the state of the series lies before deciding whether they will appeal in the event of a ban.

"It was the proudest moment of Tom Cleverley's career and he understandably didn't want to say a word out of turn. Louis van Gaal had just named him captain for Manchester United's tour match against Roma and the midfielder wanted to say something that would resonate with the new boss sat beside him. 'I watched the Netherlands in the World Cup and I think I'm going to be his type of player,' Cleverley asserted, sending out a clear signal of his intent to hold down a starting place this season. It was a smart remark but the reaction was merciless. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tom Cleverley put the finishing touch to a brilliant move . Fresh start: Tom Cleverley was handed the captain's armband by new Man United boss Louis van Gaal for the tour match with Roma on Saturday night . Impress me: Louis van Gaal has stated that he is willing to give even the under-performing members of United's squad the chance to show what they can do . Fall guy: Cleverley was the scapegoat for many of United's poor performances under David Moyes last season . The snippet was posted to the 2.85m followers of United's official Twitter account and immediately met with a torrent of scorn and mockery from fans of all allegiances. 'Tom should be a comedian,' retorted one wag. Others suggested he move to Arsenal, or Scunthorpe United. Most were variations on 'lol' or 'lmao'. Some we can't repeat. It showed once again how Cleverley's stock has plummeted since Sir Alex Ferguson identified him as a homegrown replacement for Paul Scholes three years ago. When United visited the States back in 2011, Cleverley ran the midfield against European champions Barcelona and was poised to make a big breakthrough. Three years on, it seems like he's having to start from square one again. Scorn: This tweet on Manchester United's official feed was met with a torrent of negative responses . Low point: Cleverley's performances last season epitomised the failings of the Moyes era in the opinion of many United fans . Cleverley, 24, epitomised the frustrations of the David Moyes era at Old Trafford. Overpowered, technically deficient and apparently unable to create anything, he was an easy scapegoat as United slumped to seventh place in the Barclays Premier League. He was abysmal when United crashed 2-0 in Greece against Olympiacos in the Champions League last-16 and embarrassingly hooked at half-time during the 3-0 home loss to champions-elect Man City. He responded to European defeat to Bayern by going out on the town and didn't appear again under the doomed Moyes regime. Indeed, Cleverley was so consistently sub-par he played himself out of contention for the England World Cup squad. Accused of a string of 'inept' displays and 'without possessing any genuine qualities whatsoever', he was even targeted by an online petition calling on Roy Hodgson to ban him. Next big thing: Cleverley celebrates with Michael Owen as United beat Barcelona on their pre-season tour of the United States back in 2011 . National duty: Cleverley is also highly-regarded by England manager Roy Hodgson, who once likened him to Spain's Cesc Fabregas . But van Gaal is willing to wipe the slate clean and give Cleverley, like every other member of the United squad, a fair chance to stake his claim. He played 45 minutes of the 7-0 win over the Los Angeles Galaxy and was given 70 minutes in the 3-2 victory over Roma. Even more encouragingly, the fact van Gaal was willing to toss him the captain's armband against the Serie A side suggests Cleverley, who has been at United since the age of 11, will be given every opportunity to impress. Van Gaal's type of player is dogged, tactically astute and willing to sacrifice everything for the team's cause. There are plenty of United fans who doubt Cleverley has any of these attributes, but it's worth remembering that the criticism has come in the last 12 months. Honour: Cleverley expressed his pride at captaining United, whom he joined at the age of 11, for the first time against Roma . Getting stuck in: Cleverley needs to show all of his battling qualities to win back his place in the United side this season . While graduating from the Old Trafford academy, his spells on loan were a fantastic success. He helped Leicester City win promotion back to the Championship in 2009, was Watford's Player of the Season the following season, and very good for Wigan in the top flight in 2010-2011. The following campaign saw him impress for United and capped for England before suffering an injury set-back that checked his progress. Still, Roy Hodgson believed he could do the same job for England that Cesc Fabregas does for Spain. It hasn't turned out that way yet. His poor performances last season have now left Cleverley having to prove himself all over again, not only to a new manager but the United faithful as well. He should try and recall some of these noteworthy moments in his early career as he strives to re-establish his reputation. The competition: Ander Herrera, signed by United this summer, has already impressed on the pre-season tour of the States . Setback: Midfielder Michael Carrick has been ruled out for the next three months with an ankle injury . He will face stiff competition for a place in the United midfield with Ander Herrera arriving from Athletic Bilbao and already looking impressive. With Michael Carrick ruled out for three months with an ankle injury, further reinforcements could follow and it is well known that van Gaal retains an interest in Roma's Dutch international Kevin Strootman. Cleverley will feel he's turned over a new leaf but without consistent performances from the off it'll be a false dawn. He knows van Gaal - and the fans - will not tolerate anything less.","Cleverley captained United in their 3-2 win over Roma in Denver .

"Nicky Butt has backed Ander Herrera to become a success at Manchester United but admits the Spanish midfielder is not yet at the same level as the likes of Toni Kroos or Paul Pogba. The 24-year-old became new manager Louis van Gaal's first signing after joining from Athletic Bilbao for £28.4million.

"The contents of a Boston time capsule dating to 1901 has been revealed with the box containing letters, photographs, newspaper clippings and the book 'Foreign Relations of the United States, 1896.' The capsule was removed last week from the head of lion statue that has long stood guard over the Old State House. The Bostonian Society, which oversees the historic building, released an inventory of the items Wednesday. Items are stacked inside a shoebox-sized 1901 time capsule in Boston. The capsule contained letters, photographs, newspaper clippings and the book Foreign Relations of the United States, 1986 . A piece of wood with the hand written description: 'Wood removed from the Old Lion age of same 21 years in 1900' is displayed after it was taken from a 1901 time capsule in Boston . The presence of a red hardcover book, with no visible title, surprised the organization because it had not been included on a list discovered by an ancestor of a man who worked on the statue, nor was it referenced in a recently-uncovered 1901 newspaper article about the time capsule. When the book was later opened, it revealed the title 'Foreign Relations of the United States,' followed by the subtitle, 'The Annual Message of the President of the United States,' and transmitted to Congress on Dec. 7, 1896. Grover Cleveland would have been president on that date. Heather Leet, the society's spokeswoman told the Boston Globe that the book was probably just put in to use up space. Portrait photographs of city and state elected officials are displayed  - among those depicted are Boston Mayor Thomas Norton Hart, top left, and Massachusetts Gov. Winthrop Murray Craine, bottom right, who both held office at the time . A nail from Old South Church and a nail from the Old State House are displayed after they were taken from a the time capsule . 'Basically, the secretary of state would publish the book annually.' Elizabeth Roscio, archivist for the Bostonian Society, judged the materials that were tightly packed into the box to be in remarkably good overall condition, which she credited to the capsule being tightly sealed to prevent any deterioration or water damage. Some details will apparently remain under wraps a bit longer, however, including the contents of a letter that was sealed into a plain brown envelope that read: 'A Message to Posterity from the daily newspapers at City Hall.' The letter is believed to be a missive to future generations written by a group of Boston journalists. It was not immediately clear when it might be opened. Among the political campaign buttons listed on the inventory was a William McKinley-Theodore Roosevelt campaign button. Rumors: The society, which manages the Old State House, first learned about the possible existence of the time capsule years ago from the great-great-granddaughter of Samuel Rogers, a craftsman who had worked on building renovations and was believed to have placed the time capsule in the lion's head . A peek at the goods: The men opened the box, which historians said likely contained documents from circa 1901 . Red book: Inside was a red book. The experts on hand declined to even inspect it, citing its fragile condition . McKinley, who won a second term as president in 1900, would be assassinated only months after the time capsule was placed in the lion's head, with Roosevelt, then vice president, succeeding him. Other items in the box included photographs and business cards of local elected and appointed officials along two nails, one from the Old State House and one from another historic Boston building, the Old South Church. The Old State House, the first seat of Massachusetts state government, was an administrative building in colonial times and a focal point of patriotic fervor. British soldiers gunned down five protesters outside the building in 1770, an event that became known as the Boston Massacre. One of Boston's most popular tourist attractions, the Old State House has a storied history. Handover: Shure handed off the century old copper box as the scalped golden lion looked on . No crown jewel: The lion statue was placed atop Boston's Old State House in 1901 and the shoebox-sized metal box placed inside and promptly forgotten . It was once the seat of English rule in the northern colonies, and the original lion statue and an accompanying unicorn statue symbolized the unification of England and Scotland. It was just outside the building that British regulars opened fire on a crowd of protesters in 1770, killing five people in what would become known as the Boston Massacre. In the summer of 1776, the newly-signed Declaration of Independence was read for the first time to Bostonians from a balcony of the building, which would later serve as the first seat of Massachusetts government. The plan is to put a new time capsule in the lion's head, this one made of titanium. The society is currently soliciting suggestions of what to put in it, but said one item will be a medal from the ill-fated 2013 Boston Marathon. Bostonians have whispered about the existence of a time capsule inside the head of the lion statue placed atop the city's Old State House for years. The rumors began when a woman purporting to be the descendant of the statue's sculptor came forward, but the denizens of the Massachusetts town have had to wait until now to know for sure. A 1901 article in the Boston Globe reported on the original placement of the statue, as well as the box inside that has nbw been found: . The work of the coppersmith is completed, and one of the last things he did was to seal a copper box, which is placed in the head of the lion, and which contains contributions from state and city officials, the Boston daily newspapers, the name of the maker of the lion and unicorn, and others, which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence.B .

The 43-year-old Benefits Street star was mobbed by revellers at the Paris Nightclub and The Viper Rooms . The most controversial resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street posed for 'hundreds' of selfies during the Freshers' Week events, her manager said . There were queues of people lining up, waiting for their chance to have their photo taken with the controversial star . Miss Kelly was initially scheduled to spend 30 minutes at each club, charging her £1,500 hourly rate - but the sheer amount of people meant she was there for two-and-a-half hours . But her manager Barry Tomes told MailOnline she was having so much fun that she stayed for more than two-and-a-half hours - and didn't charge a penny in overtime. He said: 'It was absolutely pandemonium. The clubs are opposite each other and it took us at least half an hour to even cross the road from one to the other - that's how many people there were. 'She wanted to stick around and talk to some of the students but we had to just keep rushing people on, because it was so busy. 'It was like she ended up doing two personal appearances in the clubs and a third in the middle of the street.' He added: 'There must have been about 5,000 people there altogether, all there to see White Dee. Some even gave her chocolate. 'She was meant to be there for an hour altogether, but she ended up staying for about two-and-a-half hours. We were having so much fun.

Since she starred in Channel 4's  fly-on-the-wall show in January, Miss Kelly has used her TV profile to rake in fees from a number of public events, meaning she is no relying on state handouts. Her appearance last night was also a far cry from the image she portrayed during the controversial series. She arrived at the clubs donning a black and white floral number, with her hair cut into a stylish bob and her nails newly-manicured. Mr Tomes said she often goes to get her hair and nails done before a public event 'just like any woman would'. He said she had been to the hairdressers in Birmingham and joked that she is 'getting all a bit Bet Lynch on me'.

When she appeared on the documentary her last full-time job had been at Birmingham City Council - from which she was fired in 2007, and narrowly avoided a jail sentence, for stealing £13,000. She was immediately controversial when she was shown swearing repeatedly at her children and having little motivation to search for a job after years of unemployment. In the months after Benefits Street she began cashing in on her notoriety, flying to Magaluf where she downed shots with punters while still claiming sickness benefits. She then stopped claiming state handouts in May, and has since built a career around her status as a TV personality.

The culmination of her unusual new life came on Monday when she appeared at a fringe event at the Tory party conference - and admitted the life she had boasted of living previously was 'unfair'. She said: 'It's not fair that someone works a 40-hour, if not more, week and doesn't have as much to live on as someone who sits at home, doesn't work and is given money from the Government.

Well-known: The resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street shot into the headlines on C4's Benefits Street . 'But that's not that individual's fault, that is the Government's fault. I think the Government also has to look at (the) minimum wage and things like that. Long road travelled: This week she appeared at the Tory conference and has been invited to student debates . 'It's the Government that says how much someone is entitled to to live on, not the individual.' She also laid in to government policy, saying: 'I have experienced some not very nice job centres,. 'You do just go in, you sit down, you are looked down upon.' They just need to understand that, just because you are on benefits does not mean that you are not a real person. Just because you are on benefits doesn't mean that you are not physically looking for a job.' Miss Kelly has still not ruled out standing as an MP next year, despite reports that she no longer wants to because she earns more as a 'celebrity'. 'I've said she should put it on the back burner for ten years because she wouldn't be able to be as outspoken or do as many appearances', Mr Tomes said. 'Why would she want to be an MP on £60,000 when she would be very restricted on what she would be doing?' Almost 900 viewers complained to Ofcom after Benefits Street was aired. Many of them  said the residents had been misrepresented, children were exploited and the show was 'poverty porn' which demonised those on benefits. In a lengthy decision, the regulator  ruled there had been no breach of the broadcasting code.","Deirdre Kelly, 43, visited nightclubs for Freshers' Week events in Sheffield .

"Kabeer Yousaf, pictured in traditional Asian clothing, is accused of extorting money from prostitutes while working as a PCSO in east London. He denies the seven charges against him . A PCSO helped extort money from prostitutes for a violent Romanian pimp and was even seen leaving a brothel in full uniform zipping up his flies, a court has heard. Kabeer Yousaf, 30, a Police Community Support Officer, is alleged to have forced prostitutes to hand over cash or provide sexual services. A court heard that, as part of his police work, he guarded a brothel witnesses had earlier seen him leaving. Yousaf, who is said to have been 'motivated by sex and greed', now faces a string of charges, including rape and blackmail, which were allegedly committed during his time with the Metropolitan Police. He is accused of helping alleged pimp Inout Motroc, 35, his wife, Monut, and his 'enforcer', Bogdan Gherga, run a string of brothels across east London, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Caroline Haughey, prosecuting, told the court: 'Kabeer Yousaf is a Police Community Support Officer, a man who chose his role to support the police and work within and for his community. 'The role is one of responsibility and trustworthiness, something he abused as far as he could - demanding money of prostitutes in order that they would not be arrested, and when that money could not be provided he obtained sexual services in lieu. 'A man so arrogant that he was seen walking away from the brothel in full uniform, in broad daylight, doing his zip up.' She added: 'Instead of reporting Motroc and his associates to his police colleagues, he joined them in their enterprise, trying to force other prostitutes into paying protection money to Motroc and others, using his role as a PCSO and trying to pass them off as police officers. ' Describing how a witness spotted Yousaf guarding one of the brothels Ms Haughey said: 'She had seen a PCSO coming and going out of the address. 'When the investigations were taking place she noticed the same PCSO standing outside the address. 'Kabeer Yousaf had been given the very unfortunate job of guarding the crime scene, in an address where he was participating in criminal activity.' She said the criminal gang 'delighted in exploiting vulnerable women who were working as prostitutes - controlling them, trafficking them and in some cases sexually abusing them, when they did not do as directed'. Mrs Haughey said: 'Ionut Motroc is the main mover in the criminal network, having arrived in the UK from Romania he created an empire controlling prostitutes and brothels in East London and bullying and threatening those that did not comply to his demands.' The pair face trial alongside Ionut Moroc's wife, Monica, 35, of Forest Gate, east London, and his 'enforcer' Bogdan Ghergel, 30, of Stratford, east London. The four defendants face 28 counts between them and deny all the charges. Yousaf is standing trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) alongside alleged pimp Ionut Motroc, his wife Monica Motroc and alleged 'enforcer', Bogdan Gherga . Yousaf, of Ilford, faces three counts of blackmail, one of conspiracy to blackmail, one of rape, one of conspiracy to control prostitution for gain and conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. Ionut Motroc faces one count of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, seven of controlling prostitution, one of sexual assault, two counts of trafficking, one count of conspiracy to blackmail, one count of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office, six counts of rape, one of false imprisonment, one of conspiracy to convert the proceeds of crime and one of conspiracy to remove criminal property from England. Monica Motroc is accused of five counts of controlling prostitution for gain, one of trafficking, one of converting the proceeds of crime and one of conspiracy to remove criminal property. Gherghel is accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, seven counts of controlling prostitution, two counts of trafficking, one count of conspiracy to blackmail, one count of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office one of conspiracy to convert the proceeds of crime and one of conspiracy to remove criminal property from England.

"Christoph Kramer was given his first-ever competitive start for Germany in the World Cup final but the desperately unlucky defensive midfielder had to be taken off after 31 minutes with a head injury. The 23-year-old's full debut was cut short after he violently clashed his head with Argentina centre-back Ezequiel Garay's shoulder 17 minutes in, leaving him requiring treatment. Kramer looked disorientated as he was taken off for Andre Schurrle after playing on for nearly 15 minutes and arguably should have been substituted earlier by Germany manager Joachim Low.

Scroll down for a full analysis of Kramer . It was unfortunate for Kramer, who was only given his first start for Germany after Real Madrid star Sami Khedira was ruled out with a calf injury in the warm up. Kramer's injury came via Garay as the pair challenged for a bouncing ball on the edge of the penalty area. The Borussia Monchengladbach loan player was visibly dazed from the blow and continued to look so as he was substituted. Kramer wasn't selected as part of Low's provisional squad for the World Cup at the beginning of May, but was included as a back up to the likes of Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Spinner: Kramer looked relaxed ahead of the World Cup final as he spun the ball in the tunnel . In the thick of it: Kramer tackles Javier Mascherano during the World Cup final before being substituted . In the space of just a couple of hours, German midfielder Christoph Kramer has endured the full range of emotions, enjoying a stroke of huge personal fortune, as Sami Khedira's niggle in the warm-up to the World Cup final against Argentina handed him a first competitive start on the grandest stage. Then, however, he suffered a cruel twist of fate, as a nasty head collision saw him exit the match after just half-an-hour. Here, Sportsmail provides all you need to know about the unfortunate Kramer.... So tell me a little bit about Christoph Kramer, the poor German who headed off the pitch just half-an-hour into the World Cup Final... The German central midfielder is 23 years old and enjoyed a breakthrough season in the Bundesliga on loan at Borussia Monchengladbach, as his side finished sixth in the top flight. He emerged through the youth team at Bayer Leverkusen, where he will return to next season, and is recognised as one of the standout talents in Germany after a previous impressive loan spell in the second division with Bochum. What kind of player is he? An indefatigable midfielder, who works relentlessly in the central positions for his team. He does much of the unseen work and he is not dissimilar in style to Sami Khedira, who he replaced after the warm up in the World Cup final. So has he been a fixture in the Germany national squad? No, Kramer wasn't even picked in Joachim Low's first provisional squad for the World Cup at the beginning of May. However, the coach soon decided that he required extra midfield bodies as players such as Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger recovered from injury, while Ilkay Gundogan had already been ruled out. Kramer replaced forward Andre Hahn in the squad and then impressed in training to such an extent that he was included in the 23-man pool for Brazil. Has he been called into action at the World Cup? He has barely featured, appearing only as a substitute in the 89th minute against both Algeria and France. The World Cup final on Sunday evening marked his first competitive start for Die Mannschaft. That seems like a brutal induction...? Well, it wasn't planned that way. Khedira pulled up in the warm up and Low handed Kramer the nod. Sadly, though, it was destined to be a short-lived experience. How was he injured? Argentine defender Ezequiel Garay crashed into Kramer as the two challenged a bouncing ball on the edge of the penalty area. It was a really heavy collision and Kramer looked visibly disorientated and was then replaced after just 30 minutes. At 23, we're sure that he will be back for more in future major tournaments.","Christoph Kramer makes first-ever competitive start for Germany .

"Lewis Hamilton's voice came over the radio in a panting rasp as he sat inside the cockpit of his  crippled Mercedes after a 165mph crash that bruised not only knees, ankles and back but his world  championship dream. ‘I put my foot on the pedal and something failed,’ he wheezed, seemingly winded by the impact during qualifying for today’s  German Grand Prix.

"Stewart Parnell, of Peanut Corporation of America, was found guilty in Georgia federal court . The head of a peanut company that distributed salmonella-tainted peanuts that sickened hundreds of people across the U.S. five years ago has been convicted of conspiracy and other charges. Former Peanut Corporation of America owner Stewart Parnell was found guilty Friday during a federal trial in Albany, Georgia. Parnell, his brother, Michael Parnell, and quality assurance manager Mary Wilkerson have been on trial since August 1 on federal charges stemming from a salmonella outbreak in 2008 and 2009 that sickened 714 and was linked to nine deaths. Michael Parnell was also found guilty of conspiracy. The brothers are charged with knowingly shipping contaminated peanut butter to customers and faking lab tests intended to screen for salmonella. Tainted peanut butter from the company's plant in rural Blakely, Georgia, ended up in jars, packaged crackers and other snacks. The outbreak led to one of the largest food recalls in U.S. history. The peanut plant's quality control manager, Mary Wilkerson, is charged along with Stewart Parnell with obstructing justice. Experts say it is the first time food processors have been tried in a federal food-poisoning case. The Peanut Corp. of America was shut down after a massive salmonella outbreak was traced back to its peanut butter plant in Georgia . There was testimony at the trial that people got sick. But attorneys and witnesses never mentioned any of the people who died because the Parnell brothers aren't charged with killing or sickening anybody. Medical tests confirmed people who ate . peanut butter from the Georgia plant were sickened by salmonella. It's . harder to be sure salmonella killed some of them. Instead, prosecutors decided they could build a stronger case charging them with defrauding their customers — food producers including Kellogg's — and selling them tainted goods, said U.S. Attorney Michael Moore of Georgia's Middle District, whose office tried the case. 'We wanted to make sure we kept the jury focused on the conduct that led to these people's sickness, but not let the case get into the medical history of every victim out there' with testimony on individual deaths, Moore said. Defense attorneys have acknowledged the Georgia plant shipped tainted peanut butter and covered up positive salmonella tests, but they say the scheme was carried out behind the backs of the Parnell brothers by two plant managers who pleaded guilty. The three defendants, charged with 71 total counts, still face severe punishment if convicted. Prosecutors have said Stewart Parnell faces a maximum of 754 years in prison and $17 million in fines. And Moore said he intends to present evidence of the deaths during sentencing if there are convictions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracked the outbreak from victims back to the plant, determined 714 people got sick in 43 U.S. states. Three deaths were reported in Minnesota, two in Ohio, two in Virginia, one in Idaho and one in North Carolina. But the CDC hedged when tying fatalities to salmonella. 'The nine deaths reported are linked to the Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak, but were not definitively caused by Salmonella,' the CDC said in a May 2009 report. Marler said all nine who died tended to be older people with other problems that made them vulnerable to severe effects from food poisoning. 'They have cancer, they have diabetes, they have heart disease and their immune systems are compromised,' Marler said. 'There's no question they were infected. It's really about what prompted their deaths.'","CEO Stewart Parnell, of the Peanut Corporation of America, was found guilty of shipping contaminated peanut butter and faking lab tests .

"It was in 1998 that a World Cup quarter-final defeat by Croatia began a round of soul-searching in German football. No, scratch that. It was in 2000, after being eliminated at the group stage in the European Championship; or maybe it was four years later, when the same thing happened. That was when Jurgen Klinsmann and Joachim Low implemented the reform of German football, from the roots up. Yes, but what about 2009 when the Under 21 team won the European Championship? Surely, that was the key to it all? So, how about none of it, or all of it, but in evolutionary stages? How about instead of looking for one Eureka moment that transformed German football - a flash of genius, a bright idea to be copied by England from the wilderness - we acknowledge that what sets them apart is that they are in a constant state of self-evaluation, while never allowing the free pass of treating a World Cup as a dry run. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Thomas Muller and Philipp Lahm talk ahead of the final . Not standing still: Thomas Muller is the result of a Germany system the will never settle for second best . Rebuilding?: The Germans, who dominated Brazil 7-1 in their World Cup semi-final, are ever-evolving . For in the 16 years from 1998 to here, while German football has searched for its way forward, the Nationalmannschaft has also reached two World Cup finals (2002 and 2014), two World Cup semi-finals (2006 and 2010), a European Championship final (2008) and a European Championship semi-final (2012). England, who preciously imagine themselves to be in the same rebuilding stage as Germany once were, have meanwhile dumbed down expectations to a level that just qualifying is considered an achievement. Alex Horne, the Football Association general secretary, said Roy Hodgson had done enough to justify two more years by simply getting to Brazil. That would never happen in Germany. As for Greg Dyke’s wish for  England to be judged in 2022 in Qatar - nine years away when he said it - there must have been  guffaws in the fancy home of the German federation. Why are Germany successful? Because they expect to be successful, they demand success - because their ambition is huge. If there is a problem it is addressed, but never at the expense of a major tournament. Klinsmann and Low revitalised the game in Germany, but they did not do so for the benefit of some distant point a decade away. Not great expectations: For Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard's England, qualifying is considered enough . Launchpad: Davor Suker celebrates scoring Croatia's third goal to knock Germany out of the 1998 World Cup at the quarter-final stage . Low (left) and Klinsmann (right) and keeper Jens Lehmann after Germany won third in the 2006 World Cup . When they began tackling the problems in the German game, issues of identity, style and youth development, they did so with a home World Cup that was two years off in mind. There was, obviously, a longer game involving the identification and production of young talent that has come to fruition, spectacularly, at this World Cup - but Klinsmann’s aims were as much short-term, because he knew his employers, and the country, would not accept that a tournament could be thrown away as a planning exercise. ‘I was always looking long-term but I knew we would be measured by our success at the 2006  World Cup,’ Klinsmann said. ‘I was  basically doubted for the two years I was coach. ‘We lost 4-1 to Italy in a friendly game three months before the tournament and everybody wanted my blood. We had another game three weeks later against the United States, which we won 4-1, and that victory saved my job. ‘The federation had been ready to make a change. They wanted the conservative approach again, not the revolution. But I kept being positive, explaining this was how I wanted us to play. I did not know if we would master it in time for the 2006 World Cup but we would give it a shot. ‘We had the players for four weeks before the tournament and were able to get our thoughts across. They agreed to train the way we wanted them to, and to do extra work. Soon they started to believe in the system.’ So, just to recap: the Germans were prepared to abandon reform because they feared not doing well in a World Cup - and Germany has a different concept of doing well, too, when you consider one of the bouts of introspection was caused by only reaching the quarter-finals. Might this also explain why they are such serial achievers? Imagine if England’s recent World Cup record read final, semi-final, semi-final, final. Would revolution have been in the air? The FA is an organisation that introduced its own awards ceremony on the back of getting out of the group at the European Championship in 2012. Klinsmann’s blueprint involved a very attack-minded style of play, moving the ball from front to back as fast as possible, but on the floor. He talked of giving the national team an identity: dynamic football. Has that been the way Germany have played here? The 7-1 scoreline against Brazil would suggest so, but that isn’t the whole tale. Were Germany dynamic against France in the quarter-final? No, they played a slower, possession-based game, and won from a set-piece goal. Indeed, Germany have scored more goals from  set-pieces than any other team at the World Cup, five by the time Thomas Muller volleyed in the first against Brazil on Tuesday. How so? Enter Herr Flick. Picking battles: While leading a revolution as Germany coach, Jurgen Klinsmann still had to get results . Adaptable: Current Germany boss Joachim Low favours a dynamic style, but knows well when it's not suitable . Young stars: Sami Khedira (right) celebrates captaining Germany to Under-21 European Championship glory . Hans-Dieter Flick has been assistant coach to Low since he succeeded Klinsmann in 2006. For several years now, he has been bemoaning the quality of Germany’s set-piece play. Low did not have the issue high on his agenda. The pair used to have bets about whether the team could even score from a corner, a good-quality bottle of red wine to the winner. Then the head scout Urs Siegenthaler returned from the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil with the news that set-piece play was going to be absolutely vital at the World Cup in 2014. If the conditions were tiring it wouldn’t be possible for Germany to play their normal, high-tempo way in every match. They would have, at times, to play slower, possession football and use the breaks in play to their best advantage. This was what Flick had been waiting to hear. He asked Low for extra sessions geared to set-piece work. Low, moaning and sceptical but trusting of his lieutenant, agreed. One imagines Flick has quite an impressive collection of Rotwein now. The second goal in the 4-0 win against Portugal, the 2-2 equaliser against Ghana, the only goals of the games against the United States and France, and the opener against Brazil. Not a bad run for a team that cannot score from set-pieces. Game, set piece, match: Mats Hummels' headed winner against France is among five for Germany from dead-ball situations, more than any other team in the World Cup . Mastermind: Germany's assistant coach Hans-Dieter Flick championed the importance of set pieces in Brazil . Defected: After England's exit from the World Cup, these fans lent their support to Germany against France . Low has also reset the balance between attack and defence, particularly now the brilliant Philipp Lahm has been restored to his full-back role. Using goalkeeper Manuel Neuer as a glorified sweeper is another innovation that underlines the intellectual ambition of German football. Having as good as invented the role through Franz Beckenbauer in the first place, Germany now drive through the next evolutionary step. And yes, there are also landmarks in the development of this team - Klinsmann’s 2006 side is one, and the 2009 Under 21 champions that his youth development revolution helped forge are another. Against Brazil, the starting line-up only included two players - Muller and Toni Kroos - who were not either members of the squad in 2006 or 2009. Yet innovation and expectation is every bit as important. In 1972, West Germany came to Wembley to play England in a European Nations Cup quarter-final. At that time, both countries had won a single World Cup. Indeed, Germany had only recorded their first win over England in 1968, in a friendly. That night, though, England were played off the park. The match is remembered for a stunning performance by Gunter Netzer, but that wasn’t the half of it. Horst-Dieter Hottges and Paul Breitner, the full backs, kept switching flanks. English football had never seen  anything like it. Even now, it would be considered revolutionary. ‘They seem to have stood still,’ was coach Helmut Schon’s damning verdict on England. And that is the essence of German success. It is not in one movement, one big idea: it is that they never stand still, they always expect, and they never throw a tournament away. Final, semi-final, semi-final, final: and that, remember, was in the rebuilding stage.","Germany has endured a series of set-backs in recent decades that have incited soul-searching within their football ranks .

"If Arsenal need a boost after their pre-season defeat against New York Red Bulls, they'll get it in the shape of Alexis Sanchez this week.

Wenger . started with a strong starting XI, Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta, . Wojciech Szczesny, Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey all selected. With Giroud still on his summer holidays, Wenger's lack of options at centre-forward saw Tomas Rosicky start as a lone striker.

After . an action packed opening, the encounter started to settle down, though . flashes of Henry magic was enough to keep the crowd interested. And the the MLS side took a deserved lead in the 33rd minute through Wright-Phillips. Predictably, . Henry had a hand in the goal, his corner causing havoc in the Gunners . defence before Wright-Phillips nipped in front of Szczesny to toe-poke . home with a finish his dad would have been proud of.

On Tuesday, Stonie takes on the Horseshoe Casino's Pierogi Eating Championship in Chicago. Poutine was created in the province of Quebec some time in the late 1950s - with numerous towns claiming to have created the very first dish. The recipe typically requires fries of a medium cut with a crispy coating topped with bite-sized cheese curds and drenched in a light gravy, usually chicken or turkey. There are numerous variations - in Montreal they offer the dish with chicken, bacon or the city's special smoked meat. In Shawinigan and the surrounding area of Quebec, shredded cabbage replaces the cheese curds. Contestants participate in the Poutine Eating Championship in Toronto, Canada on Saturday .

"Bafétimbi Gomis scored his first goal for Swansea as they stepped up their preparations ahead of the new Premier League season with a 2-0 win at Exeter City. The Swans followed up their 4-0 win over Plymouth on Sunday with a narrow win against the League Two side, as they played the final game of their pre-season tour in Devon. It was the home side that started the brighter with Tom Nichols going close after just nine minutes. Craig Woodman found Nichols in the area but the 20-year-old headed narrowly over. Good start: Bafétimbi Gomis scored his first goal for the Swans . In control: Goalscorer Josh Sheehan looks to advance with the ball for Swansea .

Just a minute later Garry Monk's side went straight up the other end and nearly doubled their advantage. New signing Jefferson Montero found Gomis inside the area, who in turn shot off the post as the Swans went into the interval with a narrow one-goal lead. The hosts, who fielded a comparatively young side, continued to give a good account of themselves in the second period, with crucial interceptions from Dwight Tiendalli thwarting the Grecians from drawing level. The game was settled as a contest with 12 minutes remaining as young Swans midfielder Josh Sheehan fired in from close range after an assist from substitute Wilfried Bony.

"Andy Carrol's injury nightmare at West Ham continued on Thursday night after it emerged that he has torn the ligaments in his left ankle and will be out for at least four months. In a huge blow to West Ham the striker, who cost them £15million last summer, will fly to America on Friday morning to undergo surgery with a specialist. It is then expected that he will not return to action until December at the earliest, missing the crucial start of West Ham's campaign. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andy Carroll in West Ham's new kit video promo . Blow: Andy Carroll is reportedly out for four months after tearing ligaments in his ankle . SEPTEMBER 2012Misses a month after straining a hamstring against Fulham . DECEMBER 2012Twists his knee against Man Utd and is out for two months . MAY 2013Falls awkwardly and damages his heel against Reading and is out for seven months . Carroll said on Thursday: 'Going under the knife and absolutely devastated to be missing the start of the season.' The 25-year-old flew back to England from West Ham's pre-season tour of New Zealand after twisting his ankle badly. He was set to have intensive treatment on it and club officials were hopeful that it was only a minor strain. They were confident he would be fit for their first game of the season against Tottenham on August 16. But after further investigation club doctors discovered that it is far worse than they initially feared and that the ankle required surgery. The England international was unable to play last season until January after injuring his left heel and made only 16 appearances. That injury had completely healed and he was gearing up for the start of the new campaign by heading out to New Zealand for the club's pre-season tour when this fresh injury struck in training. It is understood to be completely unrelated to the one he sustained 14 months ago. In the last game of the 2012/13 season he ruptured the lateral plantar fascia – the tendons that run through the arch of the foot, connecting the heel to the toes – in his right foot leaping for a ball against Reading. Under the knife: Andy Carroll has tweeted his dismay at having to be out for four months . Previous: David Sullivan's son has a history of tweeting West Ham's breaking news . When he was thought to be on the mend, the medial one went and he was out for almost six months of the last campaign. Having been on loan at the club from Liverpool for one season, West Ham pressed ahead to make the transfer permanent last summer in what Sam Allardyce described as a 'calculated risk.' The West Ham manager was initially told that Carroll, who has won nine caps for England, would only be out until September but he ended up missing the entire first half of the season. This was despite owner David Sullivan seeking out a top specialist, Lieven Maesschalck, and he spent time with the physiotherapist in Belgium to help his recovery. It will be hugely frustrating for Allardyce that he will have to start a second successive season without his star striker. Carroll has scored just two goals since he became their record signing and, on around £80,000 per week, their highest-paid player. He has so far cost them £1million per Premier League game. Fans will be hoping that this is the last of his injury problems, with his contract set to run for another five years until 2019.

"A veteran chiropractor has been struck off - for kissing a female patient in his surgery. Jan Blankenstein, 66, who had practised for more than 34 years, planted his lips on the base of the woman's neck. He said she had given him 'a tale of woe' and he kissed her like a parent would a child 'to make it better'. Jan Blankenstien (pictured) has been struck off for kissing a female patient in his surgery in Swindon, Wiltshire . But the woman, who is in her 60s, said she was disturbed and distressed by the kiss, which left her feeling 'dirty'. The General Chiropractic Council ruled his behaviour was in breach of professional standards and was sexually motivated and removed him from the register. Blankenstein has denied it was driven by desire. He said: 'This was a woman in her 60s who had come in for a session with her husband sitting in the waiting room. 'I had been given a tale of woe, and it was just as a parent would say to a child, 'let me kiss that better. 'She was not a new patient and had been coming to see me for more than 18 months. 'I did it out of a sense of sympathy, empathy, care and concern. 'She did not seem at all distressed, and the first I knew about it was her husband coming to see me a few days later.' A panel heard that the kiss happened at the Swindon Chiropractic Clinic (pictured) in August last year . The panel heard that the kiss happened at the Swindon Chiropractic Clinic in August last year. A potential interim suspension hearing at the time found that Blankenstein was not an immediate danger and allowed him to continue practising. But now he has been struck off after a full hearing. A spokesman for the General Chiropractic Council said: 'Mr Blankenstein admitted that he kissed a female patient during treatment without her consent. 'The kiss was between the base of the neck and the point of the shoulder. 'The PCC concluded that such a kiss does not conform to any social convention, was inherently sexual and also sexually motivated. 'It also noted that the patient found the kiss to be disturbing and distressing, and felt ""dirty"" as a result of what had happened. Jan Blankenstein (pictured) said the woman had given him 'a tale of woe' and he kissed her like a parent would a child 'to make it better' 'It found that Mr Blankenstein's behaviour was a particularly serious departure from acceptable standards, and that he displayed a reckless disregard of his professional obligations to maintain clear sexual boundaries with patients and treat them with respect. 'The committee did not accept that he was now unlikely to behave in a similar way again.' Blankenstein said he had been planning to retire next year and would not appeal the decision. He claimed: 'By the time of the hearing I had got together a huge bundle of letters of support from my patients. 'They have been 100 per cent supportive of me throughout the process without exception, as have my colleagues. 'I will always argue the allegation it was sexually motivated is an absurd suggestion. 'Everybody in the profession thought I would be given an admonishment, which would be a considerable tarnish on the record but allow me to keep practising.' The clinic will continue to operate.","Jan Blankenstein, 66, struck off for kissing female patient on the neck .

"A Pirates of the Caribbean captain who vanished along with his British wife on Saturday was found safe and well last night. Sailor Arthur Alleyne, 63, who skippered a ship used in the first of the films, had been missing in the huge area of ocean between St Lucia and Barbados. The yacht he was sailing with wife Sharon had been 'drifting' in the Caribbean sea for almost five days after hitting a storm. Arthur Alleyne, 63, an experienced sailor of 40 years, and his wife Sharon Went-Alleyne, 59, were last seen on Sunday sailing from St Lucia to Barbados, a trip the couple had done 'possibly hundreds of times' But they were rescued following a massive search operation organised by their children, who live in the UK. Daughter Tao Alleyne said: 'They've been found - apart from being hungry and a bit dehydrated they are safe and well.' Mr Alleyne, also known as Captain Sam, headed celebrity ship The Brig Unicorn, which was used in the filming of all three Pirates Of The Caribbean movies, as well as in the television series Roots. The 148ft ship was built in Finland in 1948 and played The Henrietta in The Curse Of The Black Pearl, and The Terrasaw in Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, before it went down off the coast of St Vincent and the Grenadines in May this year. On Saturday, Mr Alleyne had been returning a yacht, called Serenity, to it's owner on Barbados and Mrs Went-Alleyne, 59, went along for the journey to keep him company. Miss Alleyne had last heard from her mum on Friday before they set sail and she said she was 'calm' and looking forward to the trip.

She said: 'In the voicemail, there was the sound of wind whipping and waves crashing, and in the background we could faintly hear the voices of the two people but we couldn't make out what they were saying over the noise.' She also indicated that a severe storm may have damaged communication equipment on Serenity, 47ft sloop. But when her dad was finally found last night the first thing he did was call her to say they were OK. Mr Alleyne had said she had 'every right to want to kill him for worrying her'. His daughter added: 'My dad is an excellent captain and is always calm in an emergency.

Miss Alleyne, a mother of one, said: 'My father didn't speak much about his time with Pirates of the Caribbean. 'I think perhaps it was part of his contract, for the celebrities' protection.

"Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe has announced in a television interview that he is gay.

But speaking to Parkinson on Channel 10, he admitted the actual story is a different one. Scroll down for video . Bold announcent: Ian Thorpe has revealed that he is gay during an interview broadcasted on Sunday . 'I've thought about this for a long time. I'm not straight,' he said. 'And this is only something that very recently - in the past two weeks - I've been comfortable telling the closest people around me exactly that. 'I don't want young people to feel the same way I did. I've wanted to for some time. I couldn't, I didn't feel as though I could. 'The problem was I was asked at such a young age about my sexuality. I went to an all-boys school, so if you're accused of being gay then the first answer is no and you get ready for a fight. 'I didn't know at the stage, I was too young. I carried this. I thought that the lie had become so big that I didn't want people to question my integrity. A little bit of ego comes into this. I didn't want people to question whether I'd lied about everything. 'Yes, I lied about it. I'm comfortable saying I'm a gay man. My parents told me that they love me and that they support me. Part of me didn't know if Australia wanted its champion to be gay.

Thorpe's personal life has been more prominent than his professional one over recent years. In his 2012 autobiography, 'This is me', he wrote of a battle with depression and his reliance on alcohol. He added to Parkinson that only the love of his family had stopped him committing suicide.

Parkinson, . 79, said: 'I think his sexuality is no one's business but his own. But I . think it is one of the best interviews I have ever done.'

"A scrap metal dealer bought memorial plaques stolen from cemeteries and cut them up in to small pieces of valuable metals to sell on. Joseph Collier, 72, from Dulwich, was found guilty on Wednesday of taking in stolen metal from cemeteries  after a six-day trial at Croydon Crown Court. Some of the plaques were still screwed to the stakes used to plant them at cemeteries across south London including Croydon, Teddington, Putney Vale and Beckenham. In order to identify where the plaques had been stolen from, officers from Croydon spent several hours piecing them back together . Joseph Collier, 72, from Dulwich, was found guilty  of taking in stolen metal from cemeteries . And footage shown to the jury during Collier's trial showed some of the plaques were still caked with fresh mud and grass. Police raided Collier's DSM Scrap Metal Yard in Croydon in May 2012 as part of a London-wide crackdown on metal theft. During the raid, they found boxes and bags containing hundreds of metal memorial plaques, as well as a stolen bronze dragon and a statue of Jesus. Many of the plaques had been cut up into small pieces in an attempt to disguise them. In order to identify where the plaques had been stolen from, officers from Croydon spent several hours  piecing them back together. Collier was arrested and charged with offences the following day and was bailed pending his court appearance. But in March 2013, suspicious that Collier was continuing to receive stolen goods, police contacted UK Power Networks, who assisted them with an undercover operation where an officer sold brand-new copper wiring to him, making it obvious to Collier that the goods were stolen as he was accepting it. Sergeant George Shannon, of Croydon police station said: 'I can only describe Collier's attitude throughout this whole process as brazen. 'He tried to deny any knowledge of receiving stolen items, but some of the memorial plaques even had the mud and wall plugs attached where they'd been prized from the graves. 'There was little doubt that he knew they were stolen and he had absolutely no regard for the law. During a police raid, they found hundreds of metal memorial plaques, that had been cut up in to small pieces . The metal plaques taken from London cemeteries were cut up in an attempt to disguise them . Collier used this machine at his scrap yard in Croydon to cut the plaques into the box below . 'His actions, in accepting stolen metal, have fuelled other criminal activity by thieves stealing metal to make a quick profit by selling it to unscrupulous scrap dealers like Collier. 'Metal theft has a huge impact on society - be it through delays on train networks where cabling has been stolen, or the emotional effects associated with the theft of memorial plaques. 'The majority of registered scrap metal dealers are operating correctly, but we will continue to target those who don't and will bring the full force of the law against them. 'Now that he's been found guilty of these offences, we will certainly be considering further action against Collier under the Proceeds of Crime Act to look at confiscating any assets he has gained through his criminal activity.' Collier was found guilty  of three counts of possession of criminal property, one count of disguising criminal property and one count of attempting to receive stolen goods at Croydon Crown Court. He will be sentenced on November 3.","Joseph Collier, 72, was found guilty of taking in stolen metal from cemeteries .

"A couple have revealed how they lost an incredible 280lbs combined, with the motivation of being a positive influence for their four daughters. In 2011, Robert and Jessica Foster, from Boulder, Colorado, had long neglected their health, with Robert weighing 327lbs and Jessica tipping the scales at 287lbs. But in March 2012, just before Jess turned 30, they decided it was finally time to make a change, both for their own well-being and for the sake of their young children. Before...: In 2011, Robert and Jessica Foster, from Boulder, Colorado, tipped the scales at 327lbs and 287lbs respectively (pictured). In 2012, they decided to get healthy for the sake of their four young daughters . ...and after: Today, thanks to a new passion for fitness, a mostly plant-based diet and a much healthier relationship with food, Robert and Jess are almost unrecognizable at 167lbs (pictured) Now, thanks to a new passion for fitness, a mostly plant-based diet and a much healthier relationship with food, Robert and Jess are both down to a much slimmer 167lbs and are almost unrecognizable. And it's all thanks to their children. 'It got to . the point where we realized it didn't matter what we fed them,' Rob explained to CNN. 'If we weren't eating the same way or if we were overeating, they . were going to follow our example.' For Rob and Jess, being obese was a downward spiral; Jess, disheartened by the mean comments she got about her weight, would turn to food for comfort. And Rob was always too exhausted to play with his kids, so he'd lounge around and eat instead. In 2012, after they had had several fruitless conversations over the years about making a change, Jess finally decided that enough was enough. Transformation: Rob began making small changes - like playing tennis and turning down seconds at dinner. (Pictured left, before his weight loss, and right, after completing his first marathon in May) A whole new woman: These days, Jess is down an amazing 120lbs, has shrunk from a size 24 to a size 10 and is happier than ever . 'There was that point I . hated myself so much. I wasn't giving them the full me because I was . disgusted,' she said of her family. 'You have to look in the mirror and say, ""Am I . going to allow this to continue or am I going to stand up and make those . changes?"" A light turned on upstairs.' 'I hated myself so much. I wasn't giving them the full me because I was disgusted' So in 2012, Jess, who works in a bank, enrolled in Zumba classes. Within just weeks, she had dropped 14lbs, and she began exercising even more regularly. Even . though Rob was more averse to the idea of exercise, calling the idea of going for a . run 'unappealing to the point of agony,' he, too, began making small . changes - like taking up tennis and turning down seconds at dinner. Family matters: 'There was that point I hated myself so much,' Jess (pictured with Rob and their daughters) said of her motivation to get healthy. 'I wasn't giving them the full me because I was disgusted' Step by step, the couple and their children began doing more and more physical activities together, taking advantage of the Colorado outdoors with hiking trips and swimming excursions. The parents kept track of their diets with calorie-counting apps, and began cooking meals together rather than ordering or eating out. By December, Rob was ready for his first 5K race. Although he finished way behind his wife, this first experience of physical competition motivated him to make even more changes. Today, the father-of-four has completed a second 5K, a 10K race and a marathon, and he has shed an incredible 160lbs. In it together: In December 2012, the couple ran their first race - a local 5K 'Ugly Sweater Run' (pictured). Jess finished ahead of Rob, but the race motivated both of them to move forward and focus on their health . What a difference a year makes: In December 2013 they ran the same race. Rob, who was down 140lbs by then, improved on the previous year's results by an incredible 14 minutes . Jess, who is down an amazing 120lbs, has shrunk from a size 24 to a size 10 and is happier than ever. 'We realized if we were overeating, our kids were going to follow our example' Not only are they proud to be great role models for their kids, but they have a new appreciation for themselves and each other, too. 'I love myself. I like what I'm seeing in the mirror,' said Jess. 'I know there's some work to still be done, but I'm such a different person than I was before,' she added.","In 2011, parents-of-four Robert and Jessica Foster, from Boulder, Colorado, tipped the scales at 327lbs and 287lbs respectively .

"Click here to see the final leaderboard from Royal Liverpool . Outgoing champion Phil Mickelson will redouble efforts to win next year's Open Championship after handing back the Claret Jug. Mickelson, who memorably came through the field on the final day to win at Muirfield last year, was unable to retain his crown at Royal Liverpool. The left-hander finished strongly with a four-under-par 68 but his five-under aggregate left him well short of the leaders.

Mickelson said: 'It is disappointing but it is also a good motivating factor for me. 'Knowing how great it felt to win this tournament makes me want to work harder and get ready for St Andrews next year. I can't think of a better site, or golf course, to win any tournament ever than St Andrews. 'To have the Open back there is a great opportunity and I will be working hard to try to get it back.' Mickelson arrived at Hoylake having not won a tournament since his success at Muirfield. Under the weather: Mickelson did not do enough over his four rounds to challenge the leaderboard . It has been an unusually lean spell for the 44-year-old but he is confident his touch is returning. He said: 'I thought I played well today. I didn't give any shots away and I shot what I thought I should shoot out there. 'It was a solid round of four under and it was a good way for me to get a little bit of confidence. 'I didn't score as well as I could but I played as well as I could, so my game's not too far off. 'But to win this tournament you need to not only play great golf but have a few breaks and some luck.' All smiles: He has vowed to return better next year for The Open at St Andrews . Mickelson remains outside the automatic qualification places for the United States' Ryder Cup team. Should he not make it most would expect captain Tom Watson to name him as one of his wildcard picks, but Mickelson is determined to win a spot outright. Mickelson, a member of every US team since 1995, said: 'It does matter to me - it has been 19 years now where I have made it on my own. 'It is a record of consistency to play that well, to make it without being a pick, and I'd like to keep that streak going. 'I can't really control the points too much but if I play like I did this week at Akron (Bridgestone Invitational) and the (US) PGA (Championship) I'll be fine, I'll be on it. 'It will be beneficial for both me and Tom if I can do it on my own. 'If I don't get in on my own I don't know if I'll have played well enough this year to deserve a spot.

"Vincenzo Nibali wanted to show he was 'the boss' in winning his fourth stage of the 101st Tour de France on Thursday to all-but seal overall victory. Nibali (Astana) added victory on the 145.5-kilometre 18th stage from Pau to Hautacam to wins in Sheffield, La Planche des Belles Filles and Chamrousse. The Italian - the first yellow jersey holder since Eddy Merckx in 1974 to win four stages outside of time-trials - began the day with an advantage of five minutes 26 seconds and enhanced his lead to a near-unassailable 7mins 10secs with just three stages to go.

Nibali's Astana team boss Alexandre Vinokourov said on letour.com: 'This is a great victory and a show of strength by the whole team. Vincenzo wanted to prove he was the boss. He really wanted to win that stage.' Nibali added on letour.com: 'It's fantastic to have won four stages. I didn't believe I'd do that. 'There aren't many stages till the finish now and my lead is consolidated. I'm pretty serene. 'I've wanted to leave a footprint in the Pyrenees. I wanted to show that I'm the strongest, I wanted the stage win.' Nibali played down his commanding lead. He added: 'If I have a seven minutes lead, it's not because of a great performance one day. 'It's because of seconds I've collected here and there while my adversaries have sometimes gained something and paid the following day for their efforts. 'My lead is so big because I succeeded in my first goal to gain time on the cobble stones (on stage five). It was certainly not easy to get 2:30 there.' The battle to join Nibali on the podium intensified on Thursday, with three riders separated by 15 seconds with one final bid to gain time in Saturday's penultimate day time-trial. Frenchman Thibaut Pinot (FDJ) was second on the stage, 1min 10secs behind, to move up to second place overall. Alejandro Valverde (Movistar), who began the day in second, finished 10th, 1:59 behind, to drop to fourth overall, 7:25 behind Nibali and two seconds behind Jean-Christophe Peraud (Ag2r La Mondiale).

Familiar sight: Nibali, pictured here celebrating his win, is closing in on the Tour de France title . Pinot is second by 13 seconds from Peraud, who was fourth on the stage, with Valverde two seconds further back. Friday's stage is the 208.5km route from Maubourguet Pays du Val d'Adour to Bergerac and expected to suit the sprinters. The podium contenders will have one last chance to gain time in the 54km time-trial from Bergerac to Perigueux, prior to Sunday's ceremonial sprinters' stage on the Champs-Elysees. Peraud said on letour.com: 'Nothing is done, everything remains to be done in the time-trial. With the tiredness in the third week, nobody can rest assured of the second or third place.' A 20-rider breakaway dissolved on the ascent of the day's third categorised climb, the fabled 17.1km Col du Tourmalet, with Mikel Nieve (Team Sky) and Blel Kadri (Ag2r La Mondiale) accelerating to the summit. Valverde attacked the group of overall contenders on the descent of the Tourmalet. Nieve attacked on his own on the lower slopes of the 13.6km finishing ascent of Hautacam, but once again Team Sky's luck was against them as they chased a first stage win of 2014 after two flawless Tours. Chris Horner (Lampre-Merida) attacked and Nibali went with him, before dropping the American. The Italian then passed Nieve before going alone, once again demonstrating he is the supreme rider in the race and one course to become the sixth rider to have won all three of the Grand Tours, of France, Italy and Spain. Valverde was wavering as his fellow podium contenders forged on ahead of him with around 6km to go. Pinot drove on with Tejay van Garderen (BMC) and Peraud on his wheel alongside Rafal Majka (Tinkoff-Saxo), who was bidding for the King of the Mountains title. Pinot followed Majka's burst for the line to take some valuable seconds in his battle for second overall, while Majka confirmed his place in the polka dot jersey. Peraud was five seconds behind Pinot, with Van Garderen on his wheel, while Valverde dug in in an effort to limit his losses. 'I was at my limits today,' Valverde said on letour.com. 'I'm really, really tired but for the time-trial everything depends on the form of the day. 'If I have good legs, I can take the second place back. It's not a dramatic day today. Today, I just had to suffer, hang in there, that's what I did to finish with as much dignity as possible.'","Nibali claimed his fourth stage win in convincing style .

"Brendan Rodgers has vowed to make Liverpool stronger after accepting Luis Suarez had to go. The Liverpool manager signalled Suarez’s departure after Barcelona agreed to pay the striker’s £75million buy-out clause and he will be unveiled next week close to the Nou Camp following a medical.

"An obsessive woman who made her ex-boyfriend's life a living hell after they broke up is facing a lengthy prison sentence for her campaign of terror against him. Tawny Blazejowksi, 41, of St. Augustine, Florida launched a campaign of hate against her former lover Joe Good, 51, turning his life upside down because they had split up. The petite blonde got him arrested three times and fired from his job at an insurance company, where he had worked for over 24 years. In happier times: Tawny Blazejowksi, right, and her former lover Joe Good, left, are pictured here before she turned his life upside down with a string of lies . The pair had dated for three years and shared six children together from previous marriages. But when their relationship ended, she spun a web of lies, falsely accusing him of domestic abuse and then targeting his close friends, colleagues and neighbors. Police finally caught up with her when she was sentenced to nine years in prison last Friday. She faces a string of charges including three counts of threats for extortion, four counts of aggravated stalking and one count of false report of abuse, child neglect or abandonment of 16 people from Florida to Chicago to California according to 20/20 on ABC News. According to Good, Blazejowksi became irate after she was forced to cancel a holiday that the couple had planned together. Then less than an hour later, Good said he received a text message notifying him that his email password had been changed. He claims that Blazejowski had hacked his personal email account and sent pornographic photos of Good to his employer. Notebooks: Detectives found several notebooks in which Tawny Blazejowski had documented all of her crimes . This led to his arrest on October 19, 2012, but his vengeful ex-girlfriend had much more in store for him. She went to the sheriff’s office with a bloody face and accused Good of domestic violence. He told 20/20: ‘I ended up going to jail that night, because here’s the thing: The girl says a guy hit her. Most people think, ‘Wow, the guy hit her.’ They don’t think the girl’s lying.’ Next, Blazejowski called the Florida Abuse Hotline, accusing Good and his teenage son of operating a child pornography ring. ‘It was total harassment,’ he said. ‘I did everything I could to stay away from her. She was one step ahead of me the whole time.’ Blazejowski then turned on his friends and colleagues. Jenny Robor, Good’s former colleague at the insurance company, told ‘20/20: ‘She did a Crimestoppers tip to me, accusing me of allegations against my kids.' 'The things that are on there I can’t even repeat. They’re so horrible.’ Blazejowski anonymously told Crimestoppers that Robor would deliver her young children to Good’s sex ring, none of which was true. Yet, during his ordeal, Good said that he struggled to get investigators and lawyers to believe him, until a lawyer Bryan Shorstein stepped in to help him. Shorstein said he first made sure that Good was actually innocent, then went to the sheriff’s office to convince detectives of the same thing. Over seven months, St. Johns County Sheriff's Office Detectives George Harrigan and Shannon Andrews carried out an investigation into the claims. Andrews told ‘20/20: ‘It was hard to keep up with it, she was stalking faster than we could investigate.’ Family: Blazejowksi, is pictured here with her family in a Facebook photo, and at sentencing, she told the judge, ‘Not only did I hurt my own children, I hurt other children' Soon, Good’s new girlfriend, Mariela Murphy, reported an anonymous letter threatening her then-17-year-old daughter. ‘It said, ‘This is what Erin will look like the next time Mariela sees her if she sees or even talks to Joe Good one more time,’ and attached was a picture of … a girl’s mutilated body,’ she said. Detective Harrigan said: ‘She [Blazejowski] was the stalker at one point, but when this happened, she became the stalked.' They later found that anonymous reports which had been sent to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Cybercrimes came from  Blazejowski’s computer. They used a search warrant to search her home and discovered more than seven full notebooks detailing the dates and times of everything she had done. She was later arrested and charged with making threats to maim and murder. She pleaded no contest to the eight felony counts against her, but her lawyers argued that she has obsessive compulsive disorder and is bipolar, which contributed to her crimes. Judge Michael Traynor, from St. Johns County Criminal Court acknowledged her disorders, but said her clearly thought-out acts could not be ignored. He sentenced her to  nine years in prison, two years of house arrest and 19 years probation. She is now in jail. Blazejowski said at her sentencing: ‘Not only did I hurt my own children, I hurt other children.' ‘I am pleading with you, your honor, to please grant me forgiveness. I ask my victims for forgiveness, and for mercy, and for you to please not take me away from my children who need me.’ However, her victim, Good, still has a criminal record because of her actions. He said: ‘[I] just put one foot in front of the other and keep moving, it’s all you can do.’","Tawny Blazejowksi, 41, launched a campaign of hate against Joe Good, 51 .

"A Danish PhD student has been granted £300,000 to study 'actual relationships' with trolls . The Danish government awarded a £300,000 grant to a study into a study into the existence of trolls - and not the internet hate-mongers. Lars Christian Kofoed Rømer, a PhD candidate who has spent two years studying ghost activity, is now set to delve into the 'actual relationships' between humans and trolls on the Danish island of Bornholm. This does not sit well with the Danes as it follows severe cuts to health and welfare services with is set to see thousands of nurses lose their jobs in the coming year. The island of Bornholm has a flourishing tourism business centred around the fact that it claims to be home to trolls that live underground and come out of night. Kofoed Rømer, who also works as a part-time lecturer at the Department of Anthropology at the University of Copenhagen, will visit the island to, literally, look for trolls. The money, 2.5million Danish kroner, is being paid by the state-funded Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF), which is part of the country's Ministry for Higher Education and Science. Kofoed Rømer has said that will mainly be looking at the relationship between the troll legends and the 'actual relationships' of those living on the island with the trolls. He said: 'I think it is fascinating that the legend of the island's trolls continues to thrive in today's world and I want to look at the creatures' physical manifestations on the island and the way they are interacting with locals.' DFF's chairman of the board, Peter Munk Christiansen, declined to comment on specific projects funded by the council but said that DFF has a wide definition of what constitutes a useful study. 'At DFF we believe that humanistic research should be funded on equal footing with all other research areas and we actually support that area more than we support societal research. 'We profess a pluralism and broad coverage - we don't just pursue things that are the most popular right now.' Island of the supernatural: The myths of trolls has made the island of Bornholm a tourist attraction . The decision to fund the 'troll study' has, unsurprisingly been met with a barrage of criticism from angry Danes. Some have accused the Social Democrat-led coalition government of Helle Thorning-Schmidt of making cuts in health and welfare services, yet sanctioning spending of £300,000 on looking for fictional trolls. DFF has an annual budget of 1.2 billion kroner (£130 million), 22.5 million kroner (£2.3 million) of which goes to PhD projects outside of the university system, like Romer's troll research.","PhD student granted £300,000 to study 'actual relationships' with trolls .

"Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik wanted to capture and decapitate former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland during his shooting massacre on Utoya island, he said. Breivik told his trial he planned to film the beheading and post the video on the internet - as well as kill all 600 people who were at the Labour Party's youth camp on July 22. But Brundtland had already left the area as the far-right fanatic began his shooting spree. Arrogant: Breivik (left) pictured entering court today, later said he wanted to behead Norway's former PM Gro Harlem Brundtland (right) and post footage of it online . Brutal: Breivik said he spent up to 16 hours per day playing the violent Call of Duty video game in preparation for the attacks . The revelation came as Breivik described how he became a deadly marksman by honing his gun skills by playing the violent Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare computer game. The mass killer even bought a special gun sight used on the game - and attached it to the hunting rifle he used for his deadly rampage on a Norwegian island. Details of Breivik's fixation with computer gaming was revealed after he admitted taking a 'sabbatical' for a year during which he also played the fantasy game World of Warcraft. In a further insight to Breivik's warped mind he revealed how he gave his hunting rifle, pistol and 'getaway' vehicle names taken from Norse mythology. The Call Of Duty series, such as the Black Ops game, have often been cited as violent games . Tragic: Breivik also spent hours on the fantasy game World of Warcraft as he set himself up for the massacre . Fictional: Breivik immersed himself in the World of Warcraft so much that prosecutors think he believed he was in a video game during the attack . During cross examination at Oslo District Court the 33-year-old continued to give evidence at a trial where he has admitted killing 77 people in Oslo on July 22, last year. Breivik killed 8 people in the city's Government district after leaving a 950kg van bomb before driving to Utoya island where he shot and killed 69 mainly young people attending a Labour party summer camp. Violent video games can alter the brain in just one week and make players more aggressive, researchers say. An . Indiana University School of Medicine study found key areas in the . brain suffer reduced activity and leave it physically altered. The findings fuelled the debate over the impact violent games have on regular players and links to anti-social behaviour. They . also came as a British teacher said children as young as four were . hitting classmates as they re-enact scenes from violent 18-rated . computer games. She . claimed youngsters were struggling to separate reality from their . experiences in the virtual world and then copied the scenes at school. They . were coming to lessons too tired to learn after staying up late playing . computer games, and were often leading 'solitary lives'. Alison . Sherratt, a reception class teacher at Riddlesden St Mary’s Church of . England Primary in Keighley, West Yorkshire, outlined her concerns at . the Association of Teachers and Lecturers conference earlier this month. She . said pupils regularly discussed playing games such as the Call Of Duty . series, set in various war zones, and Grand Theft Auto – where players . carry out robberies, muggings, killings, drug deals and beat prostitutes . with baseball bats. On . one occasion, she saw pupils throwing themselves from a play car in . slow motion and pretending blood was spurting out of them. Her . warning came after news that 14-year-old Daniel Bartlam killed his . mother with a claw hammer after watching a wide range of violent video . games, films and TV storylines. Breivik was asked about his interest in computer games and revealed that between the Summer of 2006 and December 2007 he took a 'sabbatical' from working and played computer games for around 16 hours a day. Initially he concentrated on playing the 'World of Warcraft' fantasy game online before turning to more violent forms of computer 'entertainment.' 'Some people take a year off playing golf,' he told the court. 'I wanted to take a year off to play World of Warcraft.It is not violent at all. It's just fantasy. It's a strategy game. 'During that year I played perhaps 16 hours a day and played an entire year. I was just playing and sleeping...it was a dream I had. 'Some people like to play golf, some like to sail, I played WOW. It had nothing to do with 22/7.' However Breivik then revealed he then turned to playing Call Of Duty and instead of socialising with any friends he had even spent last New Year's Eve on his computer. The game is described as a 'first person shooter video game' and Breivik admitted by using it he honed his gun and targeting skills. Months later he would use those same 'skills' to kill 69 innocent people on the island of Utoya. On the opening day of the trial prosecutors read the names of the dead on Utoya and revealed the gunshot wounds they received. Most of them had died after taking two or three shots - and sometimes more - directly to the head. Cross examined about the game Breivik told the court: 'The game teaches about target acquisition and you have to practice within a specific time. It's a war simulator that shows you how to shoot at people. It helps you acquire experience of sights and targeting. The game uses a 'holographic sight' similar to the one that Breivik attached to his hunting rifle when he stalked his victims on the island with unerring accuracy. In a chilling admission regarding the efficacy of the controversial computer game he added: ' You could give it your grandmother and she would be able to become a super marksman!' Breivik also admitted visiting an Oslo pistol club 25 time to hone his handgun shooting skills but said the game was a great help to him. ' I used a similar holographic aiming device (sight) at Utoya and the game is such a good war simulator is so good that it is used by armies all around the World.' Route: Breivik is to make the daily trip between Ila prison in Baerum near Oslo, and the courthouse in the Norwegian capital . Carnage: A man lies injured in the road amid wreckage from the Oslo blast as emergency service personnel rush to help him . A holographic weapon sight is a non-magnifying gun attachment allowing the user to look through a glass optical window and see his target image superimposed at a distance. The sight provides a red circle image with a red dot inside the ring identifying the target. The court had heard earlier that Breivik had no military training having managed to 'dodge' his National Service by claiming he was the sole carer for his ageing mother. Breivik also told the court how he gave his weapons and 'getaway' vehicle names from Norse mythology - arguing that many soldiers around the world do the same thing. His hunting rifle was called 'Gungnir' - which means the 'Spear of Odin' - and he had etched the name onto the weapon. His 9mm Glock pistol was similarly marked but took the name of 'Mjolnir' - which means 'Thor's Hammer.' Finally, the Fiat Duplo van he used to escape Oslo after the bombing and drive to Utoya was given the name 'Sleipnir.' This refers to the mythological eight legged horse said to belong to Odin - the major Norse God who was also known as the 'Guide of Souls.' Anders Behring Breivik walks with a gun in hand among bodies on Utoya . 'Etching the names onto weapons is not new,' added Breivik. 'In fact, it is a great European tradition and lots of soldiers do it.' Later Breivik told how his original plan had been to make three bombs and to target Government offices, the Royal Family and the Labour Party's offices. However, he had difficulty making more than one bomb so changed his plans. Breivik also claimed that he planned to capture former Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, 72, on the island and behead her on camera. He took a digital camera with him, he said, along with a knife, bayonet and plastic handcuffs, but changed the plan after finding the camera did not have enough battery life. Breivik also told the court he planned to kill far more than his 69 victims, as he was aware around 564 people were on the island. He hoped many more would have fled into the water and drowned. ‘My goal was to kill them all,’ he said. Thomas Hylland Eriksen, a professor of . social anthropology at the University of Oslo, said such computer games . could put Breivik in a state of delusion. 'When . he went out on Utoya, possibly at some level still believing he was . still paying a computer game and shooting people in real life,' he said . away from the court proceedings. He . added: 'He does not seem to be very successful at distinguishing . between the virtual reality of World of Warcraft and other computer . games and reality.' Breivik's . trial, set to last 10 weeks, turns on the question of his sanity and . thus whether he can be jailed. He has said that an insanity ruling would . be 'worse than death'. Although Breivik has pleaded not guilty, . he admitted the killings, saying his victims were traitors who . supported immigration and multiculturalism, threatening Norwegian ethnic . purity. One court-appointed team of psychiatrists concluded he was psychotic, while a second team found him to be of sound mind. Yesterday he said he should either be executed or acquitted, calling the prospect of a prison sentence 'pathetic'. Breivik has insisted he is a commander in a resistance movement but has acknowledged some of his claims were an exaggeration. He spent much of yesterday defending the claim that it existed at all. In . court, Breivik struggled to defend his claim of being ordained into a . militant-nationalist group called the Knights Templar in London in 2002 . after preliminary contact in 2001, refusing to answer more than 100 . questions on the topic. Today, . the fourth day of the trial, saw Breivik enter the Oslo district court . without the clenched-fist salute he had used in previous hearings. He was reportedly asked to stop the action by the panel of five judges.","Played violent video game Call Of Duty SIXTEEN hours each day .

"Los Angeles Clippers owner and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has revealed that he has banned his players from using Apple products. The businessman, thought to be worth around $20billion, made it clear this week that he would not tolerate his NBA stars using technology produced by his former competitors. With iPhones and iPads now strictly off limits - some players may have to start figuring out how to use devices made by Microsoft. Banned: Steve Ballmer (pictured exhibiting Microsoft smartphones in Las Vegas last year) has insisted that his players at LA Clippers will not be using iPhones or iPads . Mr Ballmer said: 'Most of the Clippers are on Windows, some of the players and coaches are not. Referring to the team coach, Glenn Rivers, he added: 'And Doc kind of knows that's a project. It's one of the first things he said to me - ""We are probably going to get rid of these iPads, aren't we?"" 'And I said, ""Yeah, we probably are."" But I promised we would do it during the off season.' Star man: LA Clippers power forward, Blake Griffin (above), will be banned along with his teammates from using Apple devices . The mobile experience is something Mr Ballmer knows intimately and he acknowledges that under his leadership at Microsoft it was something he did not get right . The 58-year-old left the board last month amid mounting pressure to innovate and compete with Apple and Google's dominance of the mobile phone market. He had been CEO for 14 years and is still the largest individual shareholder, with about four per cent of the company - worth $15.7billion. He added: 'Do I wish a higher percentage of today's mobile devices were ours and we had birthed that category? Yes, of course I do.' This season Microsoft paid $400 million to put its Surface tablets in the hands of every prominent NFL coach and player on the sidelines. The company is now facing a battle to stop people referring to all tablets universally as iPads and wants to educate the NFL's television announcers so that they stop making the mistake. Mr Ballmer bought the LA Clippers for $2billion in August this year and claims his side are ready to bring something different to the NBA this season. He is renowned for his energy and exuberance and has relentlessly spoken about 'the fan experience' in the build up to the new season. He said: 'I think people understand we are a different kind of team. 'We are born in a funny way, and the guys have all had to live through something not only on the court but off the court together that requires a deeper kind of commitment.' Despite his confidence, the man who helped sell personal computing to the masses knows he has to sell a team that has long been overlooked and overshadowed by its more famous L.A. rival, the Lakers. Mr Ballmer promises that whether fans come to the arena, or cheer from the couch, or follow on a smartphone or tablet they 'are going to have the best experience and that is not just the best in L.A'.","58-year-old told coach, Glenn Rivers, that the team iPads would have to go .

"Ben Foster urged me to be more positive about England after my MailOnline column last week. I thought about it for a while, I considered England’s worst ever showing at a World Cup, and realised I didn’t have a clue what he was talking about at all. So I asked him to come on to my radio show and give me the reasons to be positive. It all went quiet from Foster. Funny that. Of course there were positives – Raheem Sterling did well, Ross Barkley showed flashes, Wayne Rooney managed to score at a World Cup (I’m scraping the barrel a bit here…). VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ross Barkley nearly miss the England bus in Brazil . Really? England goalkeeper Ben Foster says critics should look at the positives from England's World Cup campaign . Foster’s plea to me displayed the lack of self-awareness that affects a lot of England players. It’s not qualifying for a World Cup they are judged on, it’s what they do when they get there. I never expected England to win the tournament but I didn’t expect us to go out after two games. How can I be positive about that? For Foster as an individual, the Hodgson connection granted him the incredible fortune to get an England reprieve and he took John Ruddy’s place in Brazil, despite the Norwich keeper turning up for all the qualifiers without a chance of playing. Foster kept a clean sheet in a dead rubber game against a Costa Rica side who, once they realised England weren't intent on flying into challenges full force, barely got out of second gear. Is that what he wants me to be positive about? If so, well done Ben, but that’s not what defines positivity for England at this World Cup. Maybe he was out of the England loop a bit too long and just doesn’t understand. Game over: England crashed out of the World Cup at the group stage . Positives: Both Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley made a good impression in an England shirt . For Foster, England was something he could opt in and out of. But for fans it’s a lifetime commitment, and players should respect that a little bit more. For all the plaudits this World Cup has had - some of us have admired the football played, and the attacking spirit of the games - it was still rubbish for England fans. I was in Rio for most of the tournament, and possibly got caught up in the moment. But upon my return to England I realised that for us to go out and come home so quickly was a total embarrassment, and to miss out on being a bigger part of this fantastic tournament in Brazil is a huge disappointment. Down and out: Steven Gerrard looks dejected as England went out after three games . I could say England played well and the games could have gone either way. But the truth is we had six months to prepare for Andrea Pirlo and Luis Suarez and we couldn’t handle either of them. That’s pitiful. I said before the tournament I was not putting any pressure on the team, I only expected them not to embarrass us as they did in 2010. But going out after two games was an embarrassment. Loyal supporters: England fans who travelled to Brazil will feel let down by the performances . I’m happy to give Hodgson another crack at it though for Euro 2016, I believe he will have learned from his mistakes. And the invitation to Foster to come on my show and tell me all the positives from England’s World Cup is still open. I am happy to be educated by him and I’m disappointed he has so far bottled the chance. And there is a lesson to be learned from Foster’s words – or lack of them. If England are going to turn failure into success, players will need to show courage when rising to a challenge. I hope the rest are made of stronger stuff.","Foster says critics should look at the positives of England's World Cup campaign .

"Aston Villa made it two out of two in pre-season with a 2-0 win over MLS side FC Dallas courtesy of goals from Andreas Weimann and Charles N'Zogbia.

Villa rang the changes in the second-half, and Charles N'Zogbia curled home an unstoppable free-kick past Sanchezto double their lead. Lambert's side looked a fresher outfit in the second-half with a brand new side bar goalkeeper Shay Given, with N'Zogbia going close after a quick break on the right wing. And N'Zogbia nearly scored again in the dying moments, but his point-blank effort was saved by Sanchez. Sandwiched: Enda Stevens (left) and Nathan Baker (right) close down Fabian Castillo .

"Two breeds of dogs from distinct regions of the globe will make their debut at Westminster next February. The rollout of the Coton de Tulear, originating from Madagascar, and the wirehaired vizsla, from Hungary, follows their full recognition from the American Kennel Club earlier this year. The heads of the breeds' American clubs joined Luna and Falko, representative dogs of the breeds, to announce their introduction at Madison Square Garden Tuesday. Recognition: The wirehaired vizsla (left) and the Coton de Tulear (right) were recognized this year by the American Kennel Club . The wirehaired vizsla was a breeding variation on the vizsla that would allow it to cope with the harsh climate of northern Hungary, where they were used to hunt game. True to the breed's relaxed form, Falko lounged on the floor while waiting to make his debut in front of the press. The breed is 'really easygoing to live with,' Wirehaired Vizsla Club of America president Jean Schroeder told the Associated Press by phone from Indiana. Schroeder stress the need for a yard or several miles of walks throughout the day. The United States of America Coton de Tulear Club says the dog, which originated in Madagascar, was first popular among the poor households before being taken into wealthier homes. According to the club, the Coton de Tulear is the 'Royal Dog of Madagascar.' 'They're just very adaptable, and they like everybody' said Luna's West Virginia breeder and co-owner, Adrianne Dering, about the breed. Easygoing: Falko the wirehaired vizsla leaned in for a kiss from Adrianne Dering, who owns Luna the Coton de Tulear . Adaptable: Luna sits surrounded by press for an event at Madison Square Garden announcing dogs for the Westminster Dog Show . Groomed: Luna will compete in the non-sporting group while Falko (not pictured) will be part of the sporting group, as the wirehaired vizslas are known for their hunting prowess . 'I say they're a big dog in a small dog's boots,' Dering added. There were some playful moments, when Falko stretched from under the arm of owner Anton Sagh of Montreal to get a kiss on the nose from Dering. The new class at the American Kennel Club last year included the Chinook, rat terrier and Portuguese Podengo Pequeno. The American Kennel Club requires at least 150 individual dogs to be registered before it recognizes a breed. A fight between Coton de Tulear clubs has taken place over whether to seek recognition, with groups like the American Coton Club and the Coton de Tulear Club of America opposing the American Kennel Club, accusing it of encouraging unsafe commercial breeding.","The Coton de Tulear, of Madagascar, and the wirehaired vizsla, originally bred in Hungary, gained full recognition earlier this year ."
"Chelsea captain John Terry has predicted big things from rival-turned-team-mate Diego Costa after the Spain striker's move to Stamford Bridge was completed. The Blues on Wednesday announced that Brazilian left-back Felipe Luis is set to move from Atletico Madrid following Costa, whose £32million switch was sealed on Tuesday. Brazil-born striker Costa impressed in helping Atletico to a first Primera Division title in 18 years last season and guided Los Rojiblancos into the Champions League final, beating Chelsea in the semi-finals. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Diego Costa: Nutmegged by new Chelsea teammate Azpilicueta . Head to head: John Terry has high hopes for Diego Costa (left), who has signed for Chelsea . Rubber-stamped: Chelsea have agreed a £32m move for the former Atletico Madrid striker . VIDEO Chelsea finally confirm Costa deal . Terry saw Costa, whose World Cup performances were hampered by a hamstring injury as Spain exited in the group stages, in close quarters and was impressed. 'First of all, his movement and his strength are really good - I was really surprised by it,' Terry, who is now in his 20th season at Stamford Bridge, told chelseafc.com. 'I think everyone remembers the square-up we had in the first 10 minutes of the first leg of our semi-final game against Atletico Madrid last season, after which I thought ""fair play"". 'He holds the ball up very well, he has got great movement and he is really physical, but he is very clever with his strength and the way he uses his body. I think he could be a very good signing for us.' Four players who played for Atletico last term could be at Chelsea next season, with Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois back following his three-season loan spell and Costa poised to be joined by Luis, while midfielder Tiago could return to Stamford Bridge. The arrival of Luis is imminent after an agreement with Atletico was reached, with personal terms to be thrashed out. Disappointment: Costa was part of the Spain squad that bombed out of the World Cup in the group stages . Swapping sides: Four players who played for Atletico last term could be at Chelsea next season . A statement published on Chelsea's official website read: 'Chelsea Football Club can confirm an agreement has been reached with Atletico Madrid for the transfer of Filipe Luis.' The 28-year-old has an opportunity to replace Ashley Cole as Chelsea's first-choice left-back in the long-term. After missing much of the 2013-14 season through injury, former England defender Cole left Chelsea on a free transfer in June and has since joined Roma. Natural right-back Cesar Azpilicueta proved an able deputy to Cole as Chelsea finished third in the Barclays Premier League, but Luis' arrival will allow the Spaniard to return to his preferred flank. Luis joined Atletico from Deportiva La Coruna in 2010 and has made 98 appearances in all competitions for the Madrid side, winning the Europa League in 2012 and the Copa del Rey in 2013 before becoming a league champion. He has four Brazil caps and was placed on Luiz Felipe Scolari's standby list for the 2014 World Cup in his homeland. Target: Filipe Luis impressed for Atletico last season and is keen to make the move to Chelsea .

"Much more of this and Louis van Gaal will be asking Manchester United to send his team on long pre-season tours every summer. Just a day after bemoaning the fact that his club's busy schedule here in America was threatening to disrupt his players’ preparations for the new season, the new United manager watched his team stroll through their opening tour game against a lamentable LA Galaxy at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. This is an iconic American stadium, which hosted the 1994 World Cup final, and United produced a clinical performance with which to grace it. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney scoring from the penalty spot . Roo beauty: United forward Rooney is congratulated by Danny Welbeck after his first goal . Man United first-half (3-4-3): De Gea; Smalling, Jones, Evans; Valencia, Fletcher, Herrera, Shaw; Mata; Welbeck, Rooney. Man United second-half (3-4-3): Lindegaard; M Keane, Fletcher, Blackett; Rafael, Cleverley, Herrera, James; Kagawa; Nani, Young. Goals: Welbeck 13, Rooney 41 (pen) and 45, James 62 and 84, Young 88 and 90. LA Galaxy: Penedo; Gargan, Meyer, Leonardo, DeLaGarza; Ishizaki, Sarvas, Juninho, Husidic; Keane, Zardes. Booked: Keane, Leonardo. Referee: Baldomero Toledo . Man of the Match: Ander Herrera . Watching them sweep Galaxy aside, it was hard to believe that it is the American team are in the middle of their season and United who are supposed to be looking for form and fitness under their new manager. In fact the only problem the English side had all night was actually getting to the stadium. Despite the presence of a police escort, United’s team bus took more than two hours to reach Pasadena from their hotel in Beverly Hills, meaning that at one stage the kick-off was in danger of being put back. In the end, though, everything started on time and the night subsequently ran like clockwork for United who eased to victory through two first half goals from Wayne Rooney, one from Danny Welbeck, two goals for half-time substitute Reece James followed by two late strikes from Ashley Young. Flying start: Welbeck celebrates putting United in the lead after just 13 minutes . Jumping for joy: The England World Cup forward celebrates in front of the United fans . With the stadium almost full – there were more than 86,000 here - on a beautiful, warm California night, United perhaps felt compelled to put on a good show. Whatever the case they began well and scored in just the 13th minute. Van Gaal chose to use the 3-4-3 formation he deployed with Holland at the World Cup and it will be interesting to see if he keeps faith in it. More noticeable in the first half, though, was the performance in the centre of midfield by new signing Ander Herrera. The Spaniard was impressive from the start, passing the ball well and helping United to set the rhythm they needed and so often lacked under David Moyes last season. Wing wizard: Antonio Valencia - playing in a right wing back role - crosses for United . Spot on: Rooney beats Jaime Penedo from 12 yards out to double United's advantage . Midfield general: New signing Ander Herrera was outstanding all night for United . You'll have to do more than that to impress me! Van Gaal looks on sternly as United romp to victory . United almost opened the scoring in the fourth minute as Herrera forced Galaxy goalkeeper Jaime Penedo to touch his shot over from 25 yards. Soon after, though, they did break through as Juan Mata bustled through the middle, the ball broke free and Welbeck swept a first time shot past Penedo from the edge of the penalty area. It was a superb, crisp finish from the England player and typical of what United were to go on to produce. Galaxy did threaten briefly after the first United goal as Stefan Ishizaki crossed low for Gyasi Zardes and United goalkeeper David de Gea had to save sharply. That was as good as it got for the American team, though, as United scored twice more before half-time. The . second goal came from the penalty spot after Antonio Valencia’s run and . cross down the right brought a handball from AJ Delagarza. Rooney . stepped up to convert the penalty with his right foot. Thumbs up: Van Gaal watches the game from the bench alongside his assistant Ryan Giggs . Case for the defence: Jonny Evans was part of a back three deployed by United . Then, in first half added time, Rooney profited from a terrible mistake from Galaxy defender Tommy Meyer to lift the ball over the goalkeeper and in to the goal. With the . game won, it was tempting to wonder if United would be able to come out . and play with such intensity in the second half. Van . Gaal made sure there was no slacking off, though, by making nine . half-time changes. Only Herrera and Darren Fletcher remained, with the Scot dropping back to the centre of defence for the second period. Starting role: Spaniard Juan Mata impressed for United playing in behind the strikers . Close call: Shinji Kagawa bends a second-half effort just wide of the post . Midfield maestros: Darren Fletcher and Ander Herrera started together in the middle of the park . New kid on the block: Reece James (second right) is congratulated after scoring his first . Doubling up: James scored two in a matter of minutes to stake his claim for a regular spot . Double salvo: Young scored twice for United in the dying minutes of the match . After the break, things actually got a little surreal. Young . left back James scored twice – from an Young cross shortly after . half-time and then again from 15 yards as he ran on to a loose ball with . six minutes remaining – while Young himself added two of his own in the . last four minutes to complete Galaxy’s humiliation. Both of Young’s passes came from Herrera passes and certainly the Spaniard’s night was an influential one. At . the end of the game, a pitch invader was flattened by a steward in the . centre circle.

"An unidentified man claiming to be a Member of Congress was allowed backstage with President Barack Obama at event last Saturday night, according to an overnight news report. The impostor assumed the identify of New Jersey Congressman Donald Payne, Jr. to get close to Obama, Bloomberg News reports, during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual conference and awards dinner in Washington, D.C., last weekend. The incident is the third time in recent days that someone who should not have had access to the president was allowed to be in the same vicinity. The astonishing set of blunders has led to calls for a top-to-bottom review of the Secret Service, even after the resignation of the agency's director earlier this week. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama arrive on stage for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Phoenix Awards dinner on September 27 in Washington, D.C. The two other known security breaches occurred on September 16 and 19, respectively. The first lapse involved a man armed with a gun being allowed to ride an elevator with the president during his visit to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facility in Atlanta, Georgia. The agents guarding Obama did not know the man, who is allegedly a convicted criminal, was carrying a weapon, until after he was confronted by security officials for acting unprofessionally in the president's presence. The other episode took place at the White House several days later. In that instance, a man with a knife jumped the fence that protects the president's home and evaded security guards inside and outside the White House before being tackled by an off-duty Secret Service agent near the East Room of the building. At last Saturday's event, the man posing as Congressman Payne was able to get backstage by following real Members of Congress through security. He then joined a line of lawmakers waiting to have their photos taken with the president. The man was not caught until a White House staffer realized he was not the New Jersey congressman, a White House official told Bloomberg. Although the man should not have been allowed anywhere near Obama, a spokesman for the Secret Service assured Bloomberg that he had no weapons on him at the time. 'This guy went through security, fully screened,' agency spokesman Brian Leary said. After the man was identified as an impostor, Bloomberg says he was simply asked to leave. No charges were filed nor was he detained. Bloomberg said its source in the White House and another administration official it spoke to were not able to say just how close the fake congressman was able to get to the president and the first lady, who was also at the Sept. 27 event. But he was in the same area as them, which is a strict no-no. An unidentified man was able to get backstage access to the Obamas at the CBCF dinner by pretending to be Rep. Donald Payne Jr. The real New Jersey Congressman is pictured above speaking at a prayer breakfast for the foundation on the same day as his identity was stolen . The disturbing security lapse follows a report from Inside Sources that a Secret Service agent assigned to guarding the president dished about his campaign schedule to a staffer on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign in 2012 in order to woo her. The site, ran by a former Romney staffer, also alleges that the agent gave 'joy rides in a Secret Service vehicle with the lights flashing,' according to two other former Romney staffers with knowledge of the incident. On Friday House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, a Republican, and the committee's ranking member, Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings put their partisan differences aside to pen a joint letter to the Secret Service's parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, demanding that Secretary Jeh Johnson authorize an external review of the security hub as a result of September's security breaches. 'The panel should review not only recent security lapses, but the full range of management, personnel, training, and cultural issues that contribute to the root causes of these security failures,' the duo wrote. The White House acknowledged Wednesday afternoon that DHS would be conducting an internal investigation into those matters over the next few weeks. The report will then be reviewed by an independent counsel of outside experts tasked with making a set of recommendations to the agency, . The panel will also have the opportunity to suggest replacements for former Secret Service Director Julia Pierson, who resigned on Wednesday under pressure from Congress. Former Secret Service agent Joe Clancy is taking a leave of absence from his job in the private sector to manage the important government agency until a permanent replacement for Pierson can be named to the position.","The incident occurred on Sept. 27 at a dinner during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual conference .

"Liverpool owner John Henry claims the time was right to sell Luis Suarez, and he has no doubt Liverpool's attack will be able to cope without him this season. The Uruguayan striker swapped Merseyside for Barcelona in a £75m move after an impressive season in England that saw him scoop the PFA and FWA Player of the Season awards. However, after biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, Suarez received a four-month ban from FIFA and Henry decided it was time to cash in. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers discussing the sale of Luis Suarez . Owner: John Henry at Anfield after their 3-2 defeat of Manchester City last season . The 64-year-old said: 'It was time for Luis and time for the club to make a break. He brought so much to the club but we brought a lot to Luis.' The Chiellini affair was the third biting incident in a career as marred by controversy as it has been blessed by talent. Despite his reputation, though, Luis Suarez never actually received a red card during his time in England. Liverpool have already begun investing the proceeds from the sale of the 27-year-old. Rickie Lambert has re-joined the club he left as a teenager while Loic Remy has signed from QPR. And Henry believes Brendan Rodgers' side will have more than enough potency to succeed next season. He said: 'I think you will still see a very explosive Liverpool offense.' Liverpool will face Olympiacos, Manchester City, AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund in their remaining pre-season games. Their first match of the Premier League season is at home to Southampton - a fixture they lost 1-0 last September.
