A family is mourning the loss of a second twin daughter struck by an allegedly drunk driver who had an Alcoholics Anonymous leaflet on his back seat. Janesah Goheen, 17, passed away on Monday - 11 days after her identical twin, Janeah, was killed in the crash in Oak Hill, Washington as the girls drove with a friend to visit a haunted house. In a heartbreaking twist, it is the third tragedy for the family, who lost another daughter - 23-year-old Jessica Goheen Thorn - in May 2008 to a car wreck. Janesah had been driving their 1993 Acura at 5pm on Halloween when it was hit head-on by a Ford Mustang driven by 53-year-old Ira Blackstock and was rushed to hospital in serious condition.

'One being taken . instantly, one enduring as long as she could. 'As awful as it is, I'm glad they're together right now. There's a beauty to it. A sense there this needed to happen.' Family tragedy: Their deaths come five years after their big sister Jessica, pictured, was killed in a car crash . The family had planned to hold a memorial for Janeah on Saturday and will now be remembering Janesah there too. Troopers said Blackstock had crossed the centerline on Highway 20 in his Mustang and . slammed into their car. Police say Blackstock appears to have been accelerating at the time of impact. The damage was so severe that the girls had to be cut from their vehicle. Janeah, who was seated in the back of car, was killed in the . accident while the twins' close friend Alysha Pickler, 18, was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered a concussion. When authorities arrived on the scene, Blackstock allegedly showed signs of impairment and a blood sample was taken to test his blood alcohol level.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:40 EST, 11 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:16 EST, 11 November 2013 . Journalist Michael Hastings, whose death in a fiery car crash earlier this year has become mired in conspiracy theories, had battled drink and drugs since he was a teenager, sources revealed. Hastings, 33, who was reportedly sober . for more a decade before relapsing shortly before his death, had traces . of amphetamine and marijuana in his blood when he died. Now a detailed look into the tenacious journalist's background reveals that he had struggled for years with his vices and had been unofficially evaluated with bipolar disorder back in his teens, according to a police report. American journalist Michael Hastings reports from the Obama campaign trail in 2012. His death in an LA car crash earlier this year has prompted conspiracy theories after he had told friends they may be interviewed by the FBI . An exposé by New York Magazine this week, which spoke to the writer's family, friends and colleagues, learned that Hastings started experimenting with substances in high school - lifting the drug-fueled antics described by his hero, the journalist Hunter S. Thompson, straight off the page. In his first year at Connecticut College, he partied hard and neglected his studies, drinking heavily, smoking pot, taking Adderall, cocaine and crack, the report says. He was asked to leave in freshman year and moved back in with his parents in Burlington, Vermont while he worked at a local supermarket coffee bar. Around this time, Hastings crashed his car into a pole and when police turned up at his home to inform his parents, his doctor father told the officers that his son 'suffered from mental illness'. During an arrest for . theft a few months later, Dr Hastings told police he had an 'unofficial . evaluation indicating M. Hastings had a Manic Depressive Disorder . (Bipolar)', according to a report seen by nymag.com. However at the age of 19, Hastings cleaned his life up and quit drinking. He transferred to NYU in 2000 and went on to graduate magna cum laude. A post that the award-winning writer wrote on his blog in 2009 confirms that timeline: 'I stopped using when I was nineteen. Good for me.' Conspiracy theories are abound surrounding the death of Rolling Stone writer Michael Hastings with a small shrine being constructed by fans at the site of his fatal car crash in Los Angeles . Michael Hastings tributes at the crash site in LA - suspicions are rife that his death was not accidental . Hastings made his name covering the . wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and effectively forcing the firing of . General Stanley McChrystal. In addition to covering war zones, he . also lost his girlfriend Andi Parhamovich when she was killed in . Baghdad, spurring him to write a book about the experience. Despite his professional success, Hastings himself was aware of the personal toll such terrible events had on him personally. Following a particularly dangerous trip to Afghanistan in 2010, he wrote: 'You never put yourself in these situations, but you always seem to find yourself in them. 'I know it's a risk, I know it's not a healthy lifestyle. I know it's an addiction; I know it's the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.' Despite years of being teetotal, in the months before his death, Hastings appeared to have fallen off the wagon. While on the trail with the Obama campaign in 2012, he drank and took Adderall later saying he had 'a campaign-induced relapse'. He continued to smoke pot having been given a  prescription for . medical marijuana to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in Los Angeles. Clues: Michael Hastings had traces of amphetamine and marijuana in his blood when he died in a car crash . Hastings had also become increasingly jumpy in the weeks leading up to his death, according to friend and colleagues. He . was working on a profile of CIA director John Brennan at the time he . died and had told several close friends that they might be interviewed . by the FBI and that he was going 'off the radar for a bit'. The Los Angeles Times . reported that his family were on their way from New York to California . on the day of the crash because they wanted to have an intervention due . to his relapse. Sadly, at around 4.20am on June 18, Hastings was driving at speed when he flipped his Mercedes and crashed into a palm tree. His body was so badly burned that he had to be identified using a set of his fingerprints that the FBI had on file. A coroner's report revealed in August that Hastings had drugs in his system at the time of his fatal collision. Police found a medical marijuana card in his wallet at the scene of the crash. The . Los Angeles County coroner's report said that the drugs were not the . cause of the fiery crash or his death, as that came due to the massive . blunt force trauma. Inferno: Skeptics came up with conspiracy theories about his death but the Los Angeles Coroner ruled that he died of a blunt force trauma, and died almost immediately after impact in the June 18 crash . Beyond Recognition: Authorities had to use a set of fingerprints on file with the FBI to identify his body . In the know: Relatives were reportedly headed to Los Angeles to have an intervention for Hastings as he had relapsed and started using drugs. His widow, Elise Jordan, says his death was likely just a tragic accident . A number of conspiracy theories surfaced . about his death immediately following the early morning June 18 accident . as he was revealed to be working on a story about the CIA. The agency issued a statement shortly after the fact saying that at no point was he under investigation. His wife, Elise Jordan, spoke out after his death saying that she did not suspect foul play was involved. 'The LAPD still has an active investigation...my gut here is that it was just a really tragic accident and I'm very unlucky and the world is very unlucky,' she said at the time. The Hastings family had no comment to make when contacted by MailOnline today.","Relatives were on their way to Los Angeles to have an intervention for Hastings at the time of his death .

A woman is suing her gynecologist after he mistakenly sprayed her private parts with a dangerous chemical typically used to clean drains. Laura, who doesn’t want her last name revealed, claims she has been left in terrible pain and can’t have further children following the harrowing experience. The incident occurred when she visited her doctor's office at Paragon Health in Summit County, Ohio, to undergo a supposedly routine gynecological exam, known as a colposcopy. A woman named Laura, right, is suing her gynecologist Paragon Health associate Dr. John Black, left, after she claims that he mistakenly sprayed her private parts with a dangerous chemical . Husband Paul has taken to demonstrating outside Paragon's offices with signs alleging that they permanently injured his wife . It is not uncommon for a doctor to use vinegar when examining a woman's private parts, but the liquid sprayed on Laura caused her to feel extreme pain and a burning sensation in her vaginal canal, cervix and surrounding area. ‘It was like an open cut with rubbing alcohol being poured into it,’ she told WKYC. Instead of vinegar, the solution contained potassium hydroxide, a chemical typically used to unclog drains and pipes. ‘It soaks in and continues to soak in and burns from the inside out. It's not meant to go inside anyone's body,’ said Laura’s husband Paul. It is not uncommon for a doctor to use vinegar when examining a woman's private parts, but Laura maintains that the liquid sprayed on her private parts was potassium hydroxide, a chemical typically used to unclog drains and pipes . The couple were hoping to have more children, but now Laura believes she will need a hysterectomy . Since his wife’s ordeal, her husband has taken to demonstrating outside Paragon's offices with signs alleging that they permanently injured his wife. The couple’s lawsuit names Paragon Health associate Dr. John Black and other unnamed employees as defendants. According to the lawsuit, Black suspected something went wrong and attempted to irrigate the burn area with three bottles of saline solution, while also applying a cream to numb the pain. Unfortunately, Black allegedly wasn’t wearing gloves. ‘He puts an ungloved dirty finger inside her and rubs a numbing cream inside her. It's disgusting,’ said Paul. Laura says the doctor told her: 'I hope you're not offended. I just want to let you know I've been married forever, and I don't have any diseases.' The tragic incident occurred when Laura visited her doctor's office at Paragon Health in Summit County, Ohio, to undergo a supposedly routine gynecological exam, known as a colposcopy . Afterward, when she went to the emergency room at Akron General Hospital, doctors found a plastic bottle cap behind Laura’s cervix. Further, when the hospital called to determine the pH level of the liquid, Paragon claimed it was 7.5, basically harmless, though the hospital later discovered it was 12 or higher. But in Paragon's response to the malpractice lawsuit, Black maintains that he used a vinegar solution on Laura. Paragon has denied virtually all other allegations in the lawsuit. According to Laura her injuries have prevented her from having intimate relations with her husband. She said she experiences ongoing, irregular bleeding, and she can't enjoy simple pleasures like swimming with her two children. She and her husband were hoping to have more children, but now believe she will need a hysterectomy. ‘This a scenario that no woman would ever, ever imagine,’ she said.

Criticism: Randi Zuckerberg has landed in hot water for using Veterans Day to promote her new book . The sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has landed in hot water for using Veterans Day to promote her new book. Randi Zuckerberg, 31, who used to work at the social networking site, wrote on her Twitter page: 'In honor of Veterans Day, share how tech helped/complicated life while . serving & get a free signed copy of my book! But her attempt to use the special day as a form of promotion was met with disgust by many on Monday morning. One user @DannyBrown tweeted: 'It's called Veterans Day / Remembrance Day, not ""Get my book day"", @RandiZuckerberg,' While @dangillmor wrote: 'Most tone-deaf book promotion ever?' She also posted the comment on Facebook, where it received 250 likes. But one user Justin Kozuch wrote: 'To use Veterans Day to promote a book that has nothing to do with veterans is just disgusting. I'm not jumping to any conclusions. It's very clear to me what's going on here.' But it appeared following a private discussion with Randi Zuckerberg, he backtracked and wrote on the post: ' So... I mentioned this to Randi privately, but I'll say it publicly because I think it needs to be said. Probably went a bit over the top in another thread (not going to link to it because I'm not exactly proud of it) with a comment I've made. Tweet: Randi Zuckerberg, 31 wrote on her Twitter page: 'In honor of Veterans Day, share how tech helped/complicated life while serving & get a free signed copy of my book!' 'Apologies to Randi for making the comment-that-shall-never-be-spoken-of-again. Also, excited to read her book and give it a review on ye olde blog. So, there's that. Kudos to Randi for the book and helping vets connect to their families through the use of technology.' It is not clear what was written in the post referred to or what exchange the pair had. Last week Randi Zuckerberg defended her decision to publish two children's books encouraging people to stay away from social media - even if it doesn't fit with her brother's business plan. Randi Zuckerberg, 31, worked at Facebook in its formative years, serving as marketing director for six years before leaving in 2011 to strike out on her own. She says her brother is 'supportive' of her latest enterprises. Meet Dot: Randi Zuckerberg, older sister of Facebook founder Mark, has written a children's book about a girl named Dot who needs to learn how to live without technology . Working together: Ms Zuckerberg (left) worked at her little brother Mark's (right) company in it's early years, serving as the director of market development and spokesman for Facebook . Since . leaving Facebook in 2011 she has formed Zuckerberg Media, a media and . production company that so . far has a failed Silicon Valley reality show under its belt, had a . child and produced the two books based on her ruminations on lifestyle . and technology. Given Zuckerberg's familial relations and work . history, it has been noted that it seems disingenuous to take critical stance on a culture that she herself helped create. In . Dot, a picture book illustrated by Joe Berger, a small girl named Dot . who apparently spends all her time on social media - she 'knows how to . tap . . . to swipe . . . to share' - has her iPad taken away from her by . her mother. And in Dot Complicated, Zuckerberg covers how . technology relates to etiquette, privacy, family and career, with tips . and anecdotes interspersed. Among other social media gaffes, Zuckerberg advises against oversharing, which she says 'can rob your partner of intimacy, as well as annoy your friends.' In an interview with SF Gate she said she saw how easy it was to be consumed by silicon valley. 'It's easy, in Silicon Valley, to become absorbed in what we're building. It's important to raise your head and see the big picture. If I hadn't had a son, I'd probably still be there working 90 hours a week on projects, and be happy there.' And writing her books she reveals how she relished the chance to turn off the technology. 'Gradually, over the course of a month, I loved being unreachable,' she told the paper. 'I saw that the world didn't end if I waited to respond to an e-mail in six hours, rather than six minutes.' As . someone who has committed her fair share of social media faux pas, . Zuckerberg feels she's uniquely qualified to write about navigating . technology. New book: Randi Zuckerberg's guide to navigating our increasingly connected world . 'Personally, along with being part of the team that . built Facebook from early on, I also grew up on social media,' she told . CNET. 'If people can learn from my mistakes, or feel more of a . sense of connection with what I’m saying because I’ve shown some . vulnerability, then I think we’re at a better starting point.' Among other suggestions, Zuckerberg writes, in a sentiment many will agree with, 'Just because you can document your every waking moment doesn’t mean you should.'She . told the San Francisco Chronicle that she never intended to be a social . media doyenne, but found that the same questions kept arising . everywhere she went. 'I did a lot of public speaking last . year, and no matter where I went, people always asked the same . questions: how can I better understand what my children are doing . online? How can I ask my significant other not to immediately reach for . their tablet in bed? How can I make sure I don't lose my job to someone . who is younger and more tech-savvy?'She gathered their business cards and launched a newsletter, Dot Complicated, to address those topics. Many of those thoughts have been collected in the book, of which she says her family, including her brother Mark Zuckerberg, approves. 'My . goal with this book is to spark dialogue and inspire people of all ages . to embrace technology and the new sets of norms that come with sharing . content online - something my family has always been supportive of,' she . told CNET.","Randi Zuckerberg tweeted about getting a signed copy of her new book .

What's the absolute worst thing a new partner can do in bed the first time you share one with them and are trying to get to sleep? Surprisingly, most of us would rank being too liberal with the cuddles as more irksome than either having dirty sheets or even breaking wind, according to research. Hogging the duvet and snoring also sat high on the list of biggest turn-offs for first-time mattress mates, and the results have now been developed into a guide to bed-sharing etiquette. Too much cuddling has been voted worse than breaking wind, snoring or having dirty sheets when sharing a bed with someone for the first time . Participants in the study were also asked about the weirdest bed-sharing habits they had ever encountered, which included finding a third party's knickers beneath the sheets, having to share the bed with 30 cuddly toys, and being shown to a yoga mat and sleeping bag instead of a bed. According to research from memory foam mattress specialist Ergoflex, 41 per cent of respondents said excessive cuddling was the biggest turn-off for a first-time sheet-sharer. Second worst was dirty sheets, which 36 per cent of people found the most horrifying thing to encounter in the bedroom of a new partner. And of the 2,003 men and women aged 18 and over from across the UK surveyed, 33 per cent said snoring was the biggest bedtime no-no. Hogging the sheets or duvet rankled 28 per cent of those quizzed, while only 26 per cent said unwelcome bodily functions such as flatulence and burping were their biggest pet peeve with a new bed partner. Snoring was voted the third most irritating thing a new partner could do in bed . Of those who selected too much cuddling as a turn-off when sharing a bed, 61 per cent were female, while the majority of those who found unwanted bodily functions a turn-off (51 per cent) were male respondents. In addition, respondents were asked to name what they felt were the best things a partner could do when sharing a bed with a partner for the first time. The most desired was finding clean sheets (40 per cent), followed by breakfast in bed for 35 per cent. Thirty per cent of respondents also explained they'd like a new partner to give them plenty of personal space when sharing a bed for the first time. Hogging the sheets or duvet was the biggest bugbear of 28 per cent of respondents . People were also asked to share unusual anecdotes they'd encountered when sharing a bed for the first time with a partner.... A 23-year-old man in Newcastle was perturbed when he found that he had to share a bed with a girl's entire cuddly toy collection; totalling over 30 in total. A 30-year-old woman from London said her relationship hit troubled waters when she stayed over at her boyfriend's house for the first time and discovered a pair of ladies' knickers in his bed... which weren't hers. A 28-year-old man from Birmingham said he once stayed the night at a female acquaintance's house, but had to go into the spare room in the middle of the night as her flatulence got too much to bear. A 40-year-old woman from Cardiff said one man slept on yoga mats and a sleeping bad instead of a bed, and a 36-year-old man from Brighton claimed he once suffered a night of no sleep when sharing a bed with a woman who insisted on falling asleep to the Glee soundtrack every night. Ergoflex have used the results of the survey to produce a bed-sharing etiquette guide . Jed MacEwan of Ergoflex UK commented on the findings: 'Good sleep requires a few ingredients, not least a comfortable, quiet and disturbance-free bedroom environment, so it was no surprise to find that the most irritating new partner habits were the ones that disrupted sleep. 'Sleep deprivation as a result of a partner's night-time irritations it can often spell the beginning of the end for a relationship. 'We hope our bed-sharing etiquette guide will help couples avoid this fate, and encourage everyone to be a little more considerate when it comes to bedtime. 'After all, when you both sleep well you're far more likely to have a healthy and happy relationship.'","Excessive cuddling, snoring and dirty sheets are worst habits .

Members of a 'self-defence' patrol took over the main square and town hall yesterday in a village near Tancitaro, in the western state of Michoacan, in a bid to regain control from a drug cartel called the Knights Templar . Vigilantes, some wearing masks and bandanas and brandishing firearms, continued to occupy the square following the clashes. Soldiers and police have been sent to the village in a bid to prevent further violence. Residents in several towns in Michoacan state towns have taken up arms this year in retaliation against the drug cartel, whose members have demanded extortion payments from them. However, authorities have claimed that some of the vigilantes are backed by a rival drug gang from a neighbouring state. The accusations have been denied by the citizens’ patrols. Burned out vehicles stand by the side of the road after clashes erupted. The self-defence movement, which which began at the start of the year in a few town's has been expanding to other towns, kicking out the criminal gangs . Vigilantes, some wearing masks and bandanas and brandishing firearms, continued to occupy the square following the clashes . Many parts of Mexico have been plagued by drug gang-related violence and a government crackdown on organised crime has cost an estimated 70,000 lives over the past seven years. The problem has become so serious that a Roman Catholic bishop, Miguel Patino Velazquez, said last month that Michoacan 'has all the characteristics of a failed state'. His stance has made headlines in Mexico and highlighted the violence in the region, which lies to the west of Mexico City. The bishop said that five of his priests had been murdered by the drug gangs for their support of vigilante forces.","A 'self-defence' patrol took .

A mother says she is convinced that life begins at 40 after dropping six dress sizes and swapping unhealthy habits for a new career as a fitness instructor and personal trainer. Lisa Rennison went from being unfit and inactive to cycling 80 miles and visiting the gym at least five times every week. At her heaviest Miss Rennison, who is 5ft 2in, weighed 12st and wore size 18 clothes. But changes to her diet and a new interest in exercise saw her lose the excess weight in just 12 months. New lease on life: Lisa Rennison, pictured here at a healthy 7st, says she is convinced that life begins at 40 after dropping six dress sizes in 12 months . This year Miss Rennison, a former customer services advisor from Peterborough, fulfilled a dream she never expected to come true when she qualified as a fitness instructor and personal trainer. She now makes a living passing the secrets of her transformation onto others. She said: 'Last September I was working in an office job which I hated. I decided I wanted to take the plunge and change careers, aged 39. 'I was scared going for a career change so late, but I was determined to start my 40s happy with what I was doing in my life. No looking back: At her heaviest Miss Rennison, who is 5ft 2in, weighed 12st and wore size 18 clothes (R) but changes to her diet and a new interest in exercise saw her lose the excess weight in 12 months (L) Dream come true: Having qualified as a personal trainer in June, Miss Rennison now teaches a range of classes and has a sculpted six pack . 'I haven’t looked back. I’ve just gone from strength to strength.' Having qualified as a personal trainer in June, Miss Rennison, who is mother to 15-year-old Ben, now teaches a range of classes including Bodycombat, spin, and circuit training at four gyms. She said: 'I’m very passionate about the classes I teach. The Bodycombat class uses every muscle group in the body. It’s definitely helped me change the shape of my body and get a six pack.' When not teaching classes, she maintains her figure with regular cardio and weight training, yoga, pilates and high intensity interval training. The old her: Lisa still keeps 'fat photos' to remind herself how far she has come and put her off eating . Passion: Lisa says she loves her job and the Bodycombat class uses every muscle group in the body - hence her sick pack . She said: 'I don’t own a car and I cycle everywhere, in all weathers, every single day. Cycling between the gyms probably means I cover 80 miles a week.' Lisa put on weight because she became inactive in the run up to her pregnancy and didn't do any exercise at all, in stark contrast to today. 'I was unhappy with my weight and I did put even more weight on post baby but I had never been a slim person I had always been quite big. I got to the point where I was squeezing in a size 18 and that really upset so I decided to change. I didn't go on any diet as such I just completely changed my eating habits and lifestyle from very unhealthy to healthy. 'I cut out all processed foods, junk food, espacially sweets, cakes and white bread as I ate alot of these. I made changes like going from full fat milk to skimmed and changing from white bread to wholemeal. I dramatically reduced portion sizes as I used to pile my plate up. I lost a stone within a month just with these simple changes,' she said. Over the course of a year she shrank down from size 18 to a size 6 and lost nearly 5st to reach a healthy 7st. She has stayed trim ever since but to stay motivated she still carries reminders of the time when she was overweight and inactive. On her bike: Lisa doesn't own a car and cycles everywhere, in all weathers, every single day . She said: 'I keep my ""fat photos"" on my phone. I look at them all the time to remind myself how far I’ve come and to show my personal training clients that I was once big. 'I think having pictures of me at my biggest is good because it puts me off eating unhealthy things. It makes it easy to say no to bad foods. I never want to look like that again.' Miss Rennison frequently posts fitness and motivation tips on her Facebook page entitled LRFitness and on Twitter. She said: 'I still have to pinch myself to make sure I am not dreaming as I love what I do and it has all happened so quick.

Bullying victim: Emma Bailey, 34, who was repeatedly abused by youths in Stockport, Greater Manchester . Two schoolgirl bullies who waged a hate campaign against a woman with Down's syndrome were spared court action after they said sorry to the victim's mother. The two 15-year-olds told Emma Bailey, 34, to 'go and die' during a campaign of abuse. Emma, who has a mental age of about eight to ten years old, also opened her front door to her supported living accommodation to be confronted by youths hurling foul-mouthed abuse at her on another occasion. The pair would also mimic Emma after spotting her dancing to her favourite CDs inside her home. The victim later told her mother . Eileen: 'They copy me, mum, they copy me. Why me like this mum? Why I . handicapped? I don't like being handicapped.' Police . were called in after one of Emma's three carers who visited her flat in . Stockport, Greater Manchester, compiled a report about bullying. The . two unnamed girls were later spoken to by police and agreed to meet . Emma and her mother to apologise for their behaviour in exchange for not . being prosecuted. The girls attended the meeting with their families under the Government's Restorative justice scheme. Emma . decided at the last minute she was too upset to attend. A teenage boy . who was part of the bullying gang wrote a letter of apology. Ms Bailey, a retired clerk in her sixties, said: 'I told the girls about Emma . repeatedly asking me, ""Why me like this mum? Why I handicapped? I don't . like being handicapped"". They both seemed genuinely sorry for what they . have done. 'Thankfully the torment has all stopped but the teasing had being going on for years.' She added: 'Emma is a very friendly person. She likes to go out into the street talking to the children and their parents. 'But they were swearing at her and it would make her very distressed. They were throwing stones at the window and sticking their fingers up at her. 'Emma would tell me they were teasing her but I didn't realise how serious it was.' 'In June this year it escalated to the . point where three people knocked on Emma's door. There were three . youths stood there and they swore at her using the F word. They called . her a ""f***ing mong"" and told her to ""go and die"". 'Emma . got very angry. They ran off and she ran after them. Staff had to . encourage Emma to come back and she pulled all the recycling bins over . because she was that angry. Anguish: Emma's mother Eileen Bailey told of the abuse that her daughter suffered at the hands of youths in her area. They have avoided prosecution after issuing an apology . 'But it didn't stop there. Emma loves to listen to music. She has her own CDs and she loves to dance to them. They would mimic her dancing. She used to say to me, ""They copy me, mum, they copy me"". Ms Bailey added that the girls had explained they had been drinking when they abused her. She added: 'There were three people involved but one of them moved out of the district and therefore sent a letter of apology to Emma. 'The other two people came to meet me. They were two young ladies both aged 15. One was with her foster mother and one with her grandmother. Two police officers were also present. 'When I went into the room I told the girl how nervous I was. My stomach was churning. I'm sure that they were nervous too. 'We have clear evidence that restorative . justice is keeping more and more - particularly young people - out of . the criminal justice system. They are learning about doing right and . wrong and, most importantly, once they have taken part in restorative . justice they don't offend again' 'It was quite informal and friendly. They told me they had been under the influence of alcohol and they thought it was fun to torment Emma. 'I gave the grandmother and the foster mother a copy of the report that had been written by the staff and told them they really had to realise how upsetting and distressing it was and how it made Emma feel. 'They have both written to Emma. One sent her a card with an apology in and the other one has written a letter with her apology, and Emma was very happy to receive those letters. It has made her a lot happier and to feel confident again.' Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan at Greater Manchester Police said restorative justice allowed victims and crimes to meet up and resolve their problems. 'We try to offer victims the opportunity whenever it is right for them. Victims get closure. They get the opportunity to ask the questions that they don't get to ask in court,' he said. 'They get to face the person who caused them the harm and broke the law. They get to ask, ""Why did you choose me? Why did you break the law?"", and they get to hear answers to all their questions. 'We have clear evidence that restorative justice is keeping more and more - particularly young people - out of the criminal justice system. They are learning about doing right and wrong and, most importantly, once they have taken part in restorative justice they don't offend again. 'Restorative justice mainly deals with first time offenders. It's getting to them whilst they still have an opportunity to make a difference in their lives.'","Emma Bailey, 34, has repeatedly been abused by three youths in Stockport .

The Massachusetts woman who was found murdered alongside her infant twin sons and her estranged husband Monday posted a plea for help on a parenting site weeks before her grisly demise. Mei Kum Jones, 43, wrote on Massachusetts Mothers of Twins Association website on September 30: 'I will soon be a single mom to my twin boys.' Her troubled husband Scott Jones, also 43, hasn't been named as the killer who slashed the throats of Colt and Cameron-who would have turned one this month-- and strangled his wife, but police say they aren't searching for suspects. Scroll down for video . 'I need to find a way to cope': Mei Kum Jones and her twin sons Colt and Cameron (pictured) were found dead at home along with her husband. Jones sought divorce advice on a parenting site in September . What's still unknown is what sort of discord led to such a tragedy. The . discovery of Mei's post asking for advice including where to find a . 'good divorce attorney' is further evidence of their marital strife. Relatives have said that they were in the middle of a 'nasty divorce' and the comments appear to confirm as much. 'It . breaks my heart for the boys to grow up in a divorce family,' she . wrote. 'Their dad will probably not be in their lives either. I need to . find a way to cope.' Unfortunately, any advice she may have gotten did her no good. The . couple, who lived on a quiet street in Arlington were discovered on . Monday afternoon. The cause of Mr. Jones' death wasn't immediately . apparent. The Arlington . Chief of Police added that there is no risk to the public safety and . that police aren't looking for a suspect. They were called to the scene . by another tenant in the building who requested a well-being check. Investigation: Police dress in booties to enter the crime scene where the bodies of two adults and two young children were found this afternoon in Arlington, Massachusetts . Unidentified: The district attorney still hasn't identified the bodies, as they wait to contact the deceased's next of kin . Police had previously been called to the . home on two different occasions before the twins were born last year. In the summer of 2010, they were called to the Arlington home after Scott Jones threatened to kill himself. The Boston Herald reports that the reason for the second call has not been revealed. The Middlesex District Attorney told The Boston Globe . that the deaths were 'very troubling, very tragic situation,' but they . would not reveal any further details about the crime scene except to say . that the family died violently. Neighbors . described Mrs Jones as attentive to her children while Mr Jones has . been portrayed as obsessed with home improvement projects, as some . people saw him pull up flowers that he had just planted before replacing . them all over again. No suspect: In a press conference this afternoon, the chief of police said that they are currently not looking for a suspect in the case and that neighbors need not worry about public safety . 'There were signs of trouble,' said Clare MacFarlane, whose mother is the Jones' next door neighbor. 'He’s just busy — busy, busy, busy, busy. Always fixing something, doing something, digging. He was always working on the house. 'I’m horrified. I’m horrified. Those poor babies.' Scott Jones, a longtime Boston-area paramedic, . had filed a lawsuit accusing his former employer of inflicting severe . emotional distress by firing him when he complained about faulty medical . equipment, the attorney said. Attorney . Timothy Burke, who represents Scott Jones in the lawsuit, filed three . weeks ago against LifeLine Ambulance Services, said Jones appeared happy . with his marriage and family. 'There was no indication that there is a problem internally whatsoever, just the opposite,' Burke said. Court . documents, however, indicate that Jones was distressed that LifeLine . Ambulance had fired him, saying in the lawsuit that he lost his job . after complaining about a faulty medication pump that had endangered the . life of a disabled woman. Jones . noted in the lawsuit that he was a decorated paramedic, having received . the highest award given to emergency medical technicians, the Star of . Life Award, and a letter of recognition from then-U.S. Rep. Ed Markey . for his efforts to save lives when an employee opened fire at an . Internet consulting company in Wakefield, the Boston Globe reported . Tuesday. Seven people were . killed when the assailant, wielding a shotgun and a rifle, shot . colleagues before being subdued by police in December 2000. Tragedy in the suburbs: The bodies were found in Arlington, Massachusetts, a suburb about twenty minutes northwest of Boston . She also told The Herald that Mr Jones had a son and daughter, ages 10 and 12 respectively, from an earlier marriage. That marriage ended badly, it appears. In addition to accusing Jones of having an affair with the neighbor's 18-year-old au pair, his ex-wife sought and won an abuse protection order covering herself and their two children. She cited Jones' 'mental instability' and 'verbal and mental abuse.' Mrs Jones' own brother old local station WBZ-TV that the couple was in the process of splitting up. 'I think he just moved out a couple of days ago, and I think she's going through the motion of the divorce,' Ben Li said. 'Arlington victim's brother tells me his sister was great person, loving mom. He is horrified at what's happened,' Kate Merrill tweeted. She . had been previously married for four years from 2000 to 2004 and her ex . husband, who has not been named, spoke to The Globe about how he was . shocked at the news. 'She was a very sweet, wonderful person. I can't imagine anyone wanting to do her any harm,' the man told the paper. Mrs . Jones worked at a travel and education not-for-profit organization . called Road Scholar and graduated from Bentley University which is near . Arlington. 'Mei was a valued member of our team, and her loss is deeply felt by all of us,' Road Scholar said in a statement. 'As we grieve together, we can only imagine the impossible loss Mei’s family must bear, and our deepest sympathies are with them.' The bodies were found at 45 Newland Road in Arlington, off Summer Street near Peirce Elementary School. Neighbors said that they didn't hear any gunshots last night. A neighbor told WHDH that a couple lived in the bottom apartment where the bodies were found, and that they had twin boys under a year old. The neighbor said that the woman had purchased the condo about five years ago before getting married to her husband three years ago. The tenants of the upper apartments were seen speaking with police outside the house before putting their own small child in their Subaru and driving off. The woman was clearly upset and being consoled by her husband. In the same building: Tenants of the other condo in the building where four bodies were found leave their home this afternoon . So close: According to other neighbors on the street, the couple pictured lived on the upper floor of the building while another couple lived on the bottom floor where the four bodies were found . Out of there: The couple were seen packing up their belongings and speaking with police before leaving the crime scene . Neighbor John Belli was out raking leaves when his daughter came running home, afraid something had happened to him. The police had blocked off traffic on the street four or five houses up from his. He told Boston.com that there was a marked car at the end of one street and an unmarked car at the other and that helicopters were flying above. Mr Belli has lived on the street for 47 years and describes the neighborhood as nice, quiet and kid-friendly. 'I used to leave the doors open, but not anymore,' Mr Belli said. Amy .

Amnesty International last  night called for an independent investigation into claims made today in The Mail on Sunday that British troops tortured terrorist suspects and operated a shoot- to-kill policy in Northern Ireland. Such allegations have been made for decades but now they are confirmed in a book released by a former member of the mysterious Military Reaction Force (MRF). In his new book – extracts of which are printed on these pages –  the ex-soldier describes the secret unit as ‘a deadly ghost squad . . . a shadow troop’. He says the unit had a list of targets they were ordered to ‘shoot on sight’. Allegations: Last year a former British soldier claims he was part of an undercover unit which carried out a secret campaign against the IRA. Pictured is a soldier in Belfast during The Troubles . His claims were first reported  by The Mail on Sunday last year. Last night, Amnesty’s Northern Ireland programme director Patrick Corrigan said the new revelations underlined the need for a full inquiry led by a judge. Uncovered: The revelations came a week after a report into the death of pro-Republican lawyer Pat Finucane in 1989 . He said: ‘The UK Government should establish a new, overarching mechanism to investigate allegations of extra-judicial executions by the security forces and human rights violations. ‘Bereaved family members have a right to truth and justice. Such  a process must focus not just on those who pulled the trigger but also those in positions of authority who pulled the strings.’ In 2005, the Police Service of Northern Ireland established a Historical Enquiries Team (HET) to re-examine 3,260 suspected murders by British troops and paramilitary groups. But Amnesty is calling for HET to be replaced by a legacy commission headed by a judge and with powers to compel witnesses and obtain government documents. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘This is a matter for the Historical Enquiries Team. ‘The . UK has strict rules of engagement which are in accordance with UK Law . and International Humanitarian Law. This applied to operations in . Northern Ireland.’ MP . Bob Stewart, who commanded British troops in Northern Ireland, said: ‘In . 1978, I was an intelligence officer in Londonderry. I . had about 120 people working for me in and out of uniform.

Action: Prince Charles has written in the Mail on Sunday today about his initiative to stop a 'lost generation' of young people . Prince Charles is to mark his 65th birthday with a radical attempt to force the three main party leaders to help him stop a ‘lost generation’ of young people drifting into crime and unemployment. In a highly unusual move, the Prince will be joined this week by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg to try to recruit a ‘community army’ of nearly two million young people. The Prince regards this as the most important event surrounding his landmark birthday. Announcing the initiative in today’s Mail on Sunday, the Prince writes that youngsters will be encouraged to take part in a range of activities – from helping the elderly and disabled to joining the scouts or guides and clearing up the countryside. In return they may be rewarded with better chances of finding work or getting a promotion. The Prince wants concrete recognition for those who have served the community, including that they be put to the front in competition for jobs. Well-placed sources say his Step Up 2 Serve (SU2S) campaign is the product of years of frustration that policies for the young are changed each time one political party replaces another in government. The SU2S project, which will cost £4 million over seven years, is designed to put an end to that through securing the backing of all three leaders of the main parties. The costs will be shared between private business, donors and the taxpayer. The scheme is also a sign of the Prince’s determination to show he is ready to be an active, engaged monarch when he succeeds the Queen. He has previously been accused of ‘meddling’ in political affairs and pressuring Ministers to back his causes. But by getting the support of all three leaders for SU2S, he aims to show he is a unifying political force. He also hosts the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka this weekend, indicating his intention to play a high- profile role in both domestic and foreign affairs. The Prince said he hopes SU2S will reduce the danger that young people join street gangs, and revive the tradition where it was a ‘rite of passage of youth’ to be active on behalf of the community. To make the scheme work he will call for: . Celebrations: Charles, pictured with his birthday cake, recently turned 65 while on tour in India . The Prince says he was moved to act by tragedies such as the brutal killing of 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen in 2008. Jimmy bled to death in the arms of his brother Tommy after Jake Fahri, then 19, hurled a Pyrex dish at him in a bakery. The dish shattered, severing the arteries in his neck. Writing in The Mail on Sunday,  the Prince says: ‘Sitting listening to families whose children have been murdered through street violence,  I found it impossible to ignore their pleas for help in finding solutions to a problem which has blighted too many lives. ‘I often reflect on the bravery and courage of Barry and Margaret Mizen [Jimmy’s parents]. They are convinced – as I have been for the past 40 years – that part of the solution is in providing more structured activities for young people.’ He argues that tragedies such as the murder of Jimmy are ‘the extreme result of too many young people no longer guided through a rite of passage’ – a chance to be involved in the community. It was the Mizens, and others like them, who persuaded him to try to find a lasting remedy. ‘That is why I am joining the leaders of Britain, including David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, together with 50 young people, at Buckingham Palace to launch a pledge campaign (on Twitter), #iwill, through Step Up 2 Serve. Family: Prince Charles meets with Barry and Margaret Mizen during a visit to the Cafe of Good Hope after the death of their son Jimmy . ‘This long-term campaign, supported by all sectors of society  and involving faith and political leaders, education, business, trade unions and the voluntary sector, has a unifying vision.’ That vision is to increase the number of people aged ten to 20 who take part in community or volunteering activities, raising it from  the current estimated 29 per cent to 50 per cent. That would mean an extra 1.7 million young recruits. He has studied similar schemes in parts of the US, such as California, where the figure is already around 50 per cent, and in Canada, where it is nearly 60 per cent. The Prince also wants more older people to step forward to organise activities as,  for example, Scout and Guide  leaders. He writes: ‘I have long believed we are failing to do enough to unlock their talent and unleash their energies to help tackle all sorts of challenges in our society. They are the solution to so much and yet, too frequently, are seen as the problem. ‘All over our country are thousands of lonely old people who need company, younger children who need alternatives to hanging about on the street corner, crucial environmental work that needs doing and local causes that need espousing.’ ‘We must enlist thousands more adults to help support and motivate younger people in their social action and to encourage those who have already been involved to engage and lead others.’ ‘The Confederation of British Industry recently reported that employers needed young people who were optimistic, determined and emotionally intelligent – and research shows that young people who take on challenging volunteering activities increase all those character traits and virtues.’ The Prince sees SU2S as just as important a venture as his highly praised Prince’s Trust scheme, which has helped 160,000 disadvantaged young people gain job skills. Information on how to get involved in the community will be available on the SU2S website.","Prince in radical attempt to stop young people drifting into crime .

In the world of cars it is – usually – the last word in understated elegance and class. But this Rolls-Royce Phantom, with its brash red and chrome paint job, seems rather to have missed the point. The garish car, which sports an Arabic number plate, was spotted last night in Kensington, west London – a traditional night-time haunt of the rich and famous. Not one for traditionalists: This bright red Rolls-Royce Phantom was spotted in upmarket Kensington, but the cars normally appear in reserved shades of black, silver, cream or deep blue . Garish: The car, which sports an Arabic number plate, was spotted in Kensington, west London - a traditional night-time haunt of the rich and famous . The car, which was parked up for the evening, featured blacked-out windows which made it impossible to make out any of the traditionally luxurious interior. Each car is built to the buyer’s specification, so its owner would have been able to request the garish paint job from the beginning. The Phantom is a classic choice of car for the very wealthy, and they are all assembled by hand at the Rolls-Royce factory in Goodwood, West Sussex. A-list celebrities David Beckham, Simon Cowell, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy have all been spotted riding in the car. It is also a favourite of the royal family and heads of state worldwide – an earlier version of the Phantom was presented to the Queen as a gift on her Silver Jubilee. However, the cars almost always appear in reserved shades of black, silver, cream or deep blue. The Phantom, a traditional symbol of wealth and sophistication, is usually seen in subtler colours (right) In marketing literature for the cars, Rolls-Royce invites potential buyers to: ‘discover the genuine authority and rare sense of scale and occasion’ the car offers. They cost around £250,000. But this over-the-top specimen is hardly an isolated site in London, increasingly the destination of choice for the monied Middle-Eastern elite looking for somewhere cooler than home. This summer an especially flashy menagerie of vehicles were seen on the streets of the capital – many parked illegally.

The Metropolitan Police seized a £350,000 ‘glow-in-the-dark’ Lamborghini Aventador after its driver – believed to be a Qatari royal – was caught driving uninsured and without a licence. It was later displayed outside Scotland Yard, covered with police tape reading 'uninsured vehicle seized by police'. At the time a police spokesman said: 'We have had a few Porsches, BMW X5s, and a Ferrari – that one got crushed and in fact the vast majority of them are.' Police are known to have seized dozens of super cars across the capital over the last year on an array of charges including driving with invalid insurance and driving without proper registration plates. Last month, a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador was pictured being towed away after the driver fell foul of the law - he was found to be driving without correct insurance. And a member of Qatar's Al-Thani dynasty has had two supercars towed away by police.

Carer Sussanah Carr tied up a lady, who suffers from dementia, because she did not want her wandering around the care home . A care home assistant used a dressing gown cord to tie an  88-year-old woman with dementia to a chair while she went outside to smoke a cigarette. A court was told that Sussanah Carr, 43, restrained the pensioner because she had been wandering around the care home. She told a colleague what she had done and was reported to police, but denied it when interviewed by officers. However, she later went back to the police station to admit her crime after being questioned by care home bosses at an internal inquiry. When she was finally brought before a court, she pleaded guilty to a charge of ill-treating and wilfully neglecting a  person without capacity. Carr was spared a jail sentence, however, when Judge Michael Addison gave her a 12-month supervision order. When the offence came to light, she was dismissed from her job at Sutton Lodge, a Bupa care home in Weybridge, Surrey, where she had worked for about ten years. Guildford Crown Court was told the victim had been repeatedly getting out of bed and walking around when Carr arrived during an overnight shift earlier this year. Prosecutor Flora Page said the incident was over ‘in a matter of minutes’. Miss Page added: ‘The victim had been wandering around . . . and Miss Carr  had been chasing after her and following her around. However, a time came when she sat her down in her chair and, using the cord of her dressing gown, tied it on  the chair.’ Summing up later, Judge Addison said a key detail was the fact that it was secured around her waist in such a way that the woman would have been able to untie herself. He told Carr, of Shepperton, Surrey: ‘You were in charge of  looking after an old lady suffering  from dementia. ‘She was sat in the chair and you put the dressing gown cord around her waist. It was tied in a bow. She could have undone it. ‘I sentence you on the basis that she was only tied to the chair for a number of minutes. ‘It is a serious matter to ill-treat someone who lacks mental capacity in a home, but it does seem that this offence is right at the bottom of the scale.’ The court heard the carer, who suffers from schizophrenia, was dismissed from her role at Sutton Lodge, a Bupa care home in Weybridge, Surrey, after an internal review into the ill-treatment of the woman . Judge Addison said there was no evidence that the woman suffered any distress and he did not understand why the case had not been dealt with at an earlier hearing at North Surrey Magistrates’ Court in Staines. Elaine Stapleton, defending, said Carr had lost her livelihood and record of previous good character because of one incident in many years of caring for people with dementia. Miss Stapleton said: ‘She has a long history of caring for vulnerable people in that home. What happened means she has stopped taking her medication. She has had a number of difficulties with her health.’ In a statement after sentencing, Graham Brittain, of Bupa Care Services UK, said: ‘The behaviour of Sussanah Carr was clearly unacceptable. ‘We immediately suspended her and reported her to the appropriate authorities to ensure that vulnerable older people are protected. The court has now taken appropriate action.’","Sussanah Carr tied up dementia sufferer because she did not want her wandering around care home while she was working .

NHS consultants should work on weekends because it is ‘wrong’ for patients to be at greater risk on Saturdays and Sundays, a report has said. The Academy of Royal Colleges says drastic changes should be made to the running of hospitals so that senior staff, emergency tests and urgent surgery are quickly accessible each day. It suggests that patients should be checked by consultants daily because it is ‘ethically unjustifiable’ that patients should face greater risks on public holidays and weekends - when less experienced staff take over. NHS consultants should work on weekends because it is 'wrong' for patients to be at greater risk on Saturdays and Sundays, a report has said . ‘It is wrong that a patient in hospital can suffer more because their stay includes a weekend and/or a bank holiday,’ the report said. At present junior doctors are expected to staff hospitals at weekends and to rely on consultants who are ‘on call’ for emergencies. And some patients are currently made to wait up to four days to see a consultant because they do not work weekends, research from the 20 organisations which represent senior doctors showed. But it is ‘ethically unjustifiable to provide a lower standard of care to patient at weekends than weekdays,’ the document stated. As well as better access to consultants the colleges recommended that emergency surgery, diagnostic tests and results of those tests should be made more accessible on weekends. Patients should expect laboratory services, X-ray, ultrasound and MRI scanning, emergency surgery, anaestheisa, physiotherapy, pharmacy and patient transport to work on a seven-day basis, the report said. At present junior doctors are expected to staff hospitals at weekends and to rely on consultants who are 'on call' for emergencies . Research which emerged earlier this year showed that patients were 44 per cent more likely to die following planned surgery on a Friday than those who had the same operations on a Monday. Other studies have found 16 per higher mortality among those admitted to hospital on Sundays, compared with patients who fall ill during the week. Professor Norman Williams, Steering Group Chairman for the academy, and President of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ‘What we want to see is a health service that can truly meet the demands of the 21st century. 'It is not acceptable that over weekends and bank holidays, patients receive a lower standard of care than they would during the week.’ He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Using the findings of this report, we must work together to re-shape hospital services in a way that strengthens the quality of care given to patients regardless of when they are admitted.’ The report predicts that changes will increase NHS costs in the short-term, but that the improvements in care could reduce costs in the long run. The colleges said hospitals will have to be centralised on fewer sites, to ensure there are enough specialists working in the right places.","Academy of Royal Colleges: 'Drastic changes needed to hospital running'

I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here contestants Joey Essex and Matthew Wright tucked into pig's brain, camel toe and even an ostrich penis during the dreaded Bushtucker Trial last night. But while most of us watch, cringing, from between our fingers, while they scoff the jungle delicacies, one London restaurant believes people will actually pay to experience it themselves. Gilgamesh, a pan-Asian haunt frequented by the likes of Girls Aloud and Frank Bruno, has unveiled a menu packed with creepy crawlies and gory pig's brain in honour of the show's Bushtucker Trial. The Asian-inspired Bushtucker Trial Menu serves up scorpion and ant tempura served with Amarillo chilli dressing (£15), fish eye maki sushi rolls (£9) and ginseng Chinese fish head and eyeball soup (£14) - and that's just for starters. Tuck in! Joey Essex (R) and Matthew Wright (L) battled it out on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here by eating ostrich testicles and creepy crawlies - and now you can do the same . For the more daring foodie there's the £14 bull and duck tongue stir fry mixed with Ho Fun noodles, choy sum and peashoots or the meaty pig brain served in a bun with tomato relish and salad garnish for £12. If that wasn't enough to whet your appetite, there's an £8 selection of Asian vomit fruit sorbets including durian fruit - which a writer on travel blog gadling.com described as 'smelling like road kill wrapped in sweaty socks and having the texture of rotten bananas' - for dessert. Does it look appetizing? Gilgamesh, a high-end pan Asian, are offering a selection of gruesome meals such as fish eye maki sushi rolls (£9) Tasty tongue: Diners can enjoy the £14 bull and duck tongue stir-fry mixed with Ho Fun noodles, choy sum and peashoots . On a plus note, Gilgamesh claim that those brave enough to take on the challenge are in for a health boost. They say crickets, which are one of the more common insects eaten (or at least tried) in the West, are a rich source of protein and high in calcium, while bull tongue is apparently high in protein and vitamin B-12, which boosts the production of red blood cells. The durian vomit fruit apparently has euphoric effect when eaten as a dessert and is packed full of oestrogen which is thought to make women more fertile. Not your average Big Mac: Diners can sample the meaty pig brain served in a bun with tomato relish and salad garnish for £12 . Sign away: Diners have to sign a disclaimer before they tuck into the culinary delights, such as these battered scorpions and ants . Devilish diners can sample the menu only after signing a disclaimer agreeing that they are happy to do so. The disclaimer will state that Gilgamesh cannot be held responsible for any consequences diners may suffer during or after eating the dishes. The dishes can be ordered separately or as a three-course set menu priced at £32.50. Those that manage to munch their way through the entire set menu won’t pay a penny and will receive a certificate for their daredevil efforts. Shona Wilkinson at The Nutri Centre said: 'Eating insects is certainly popular in countries such as Thailand where you can buy them from supermarkets and pick them up from road-side stalls. 'They are a great source of protein and naturally low in fat, as well as essential vitamins such as B1 and B2. And while it's not something I could ever eat, they are thought to soon become the new super trendy food due to their nutrient value. There are certainly worse, more unhealthy things you could eat.'

A fearless young woman who tricked a murderer into leaving DNA evidence on a cigarette butt after he tried to strangle her has been nominated for a national bravery award. Jessica Price was attacked by Carl Powell in an alley in Nottingham in 2011 after he pounced on her while she walked home from a night-out with friends. But the 23-year-old's bravery meant police were able to use the discarded cigarette to charge him, with the evidence also tying him to a brutal murder just a month earlier. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Brave: Jessica Price, 23 (left) kept her head during a sex attack and managed to trap murderer Carl Powell (right) with DNA which he left on a cigarette butt . She has now been nominated for the Cosmo Ultimate Survivor category of the Cosmopolitan Ultimate Women of the Year Awards because of her actions. On the night last year, evil Powell wrapped his hands around her neck . after jumping her from behind and started choking her before dragging . her through the gates of a college and pushing her onto the ground. Chilling CCTV images show the moment Powell dragged Jessica by the arm on a deserted street moments before he forced her hand down his pants. But, despite her terrifying ordeal, Miss Price managed to remain calm and persuaded Powell to let her go and even pretended to like him so he would let his guard down. Incredibly, Miss Price, who waived her anonymity, managed to charm Powell by pretending she liked him. She managed to persuade him to smoke a cigarette which she knew would contain his DNA. After he dropped the butt on the ground, Miss Price made a mental note where it was. As the pair were getting closer to Miss Price's parent’s home in Carlton, Nottinghamshire, Powell was distracted by a phone call and he said he had to leave. Attack: Miss Price (right) is captured on CCTV being dragged away by Powell . Drag: The murderer tries to pull Miss Price further towards him and away from the street . When the attacker disappeared she called police and told them where to find Powell’s cigarette butt. The DNA matched that of Powell and he was arrested and charged three days later. Not only did the police charge Powell for the attack on Miss Price but also of the murder of Caroline Coyne, in Thorneywood, Nottinghamshire, whose body was found in an alley a month earlier. The 28-year-old care worker had been strangled then bludgeoned and left to die from head injuries. As a result of Miss Price's brave actions, last October Powell was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years after being convicted at Nottingham Crown Court. Darkness: Powell pounced on her when she was walking home from a night out in Nottingham . He was also jailed for a total of five-and-a-half years for the false imprisonment and sexual assault on Miss Price, a sentence which will run concurrently with his life term. Miss Price who now teaches full-time in Italy, recalled the attack after she was nominated for a national bravery award. She said: 'I couldn’t breathe - I thought he was going to kill me. 'But something told me I had to be calm and reach out on a human level. 'I managed to get his hands from my throat and said, ‘I promise I won’t scream, just let me catch my breath’. 'I think he was so shocked by my reaction that he let me go. I reassured him I wouldn’t make a sound. He took a step back and I knew my plan was working. Trapped: Powell continued trying to talk to Miss Price as she tried to get away . Quick-thinking: While Powell grabbed her Miss Price managed to charm the attacker by persuading him she liked him . 'Inside, I was terrified I asked him how his night had been and said, ""You’re heading in the same direction as me. Let’s walk together"".' She said: 'At the time, I just reacted. Nobody knows what they are going to do in that situation. It is really amazing to be nominated. 'It is a really nice feeling and it would be so nice to be the winner. It would make me feel better about the situation. 'People have said that I was brave and that I did really well to stay calm. Attempts: Miss Price's wise words eventually worked and Powell let her go, allowing him to smoke a cigarette . 'Hopefully, it will make people think twice about how they react, and mainly just make them think about staying calm.' Detective Chief Inspector Tony Heydon, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'Jessica is simply an astonishing young lady. She had periods where the events of that night caused her real issues. 'To have the strength of character to put that to one side and give valuable evidence at court is nothing less than inspirational. 'Add to that what she did to probably save her own life, words are hard to find to describe how much I admire her.' The winner will be announced at the Cosmopolitan Ultimate Women of the Year Awards 2014 on December 5 at the London Victoria and Albert Museum.","Jessica Price was attacked by Carl Powell after a night out in Nottingham .

The BBC was at the centre of a new controversy over Jimmy Savile last night after it emerged that a planned Panorama investigation on the scandal may be delayed. Staff on the BBC1 current affairs show confirmed yesterday that they had previously been told that the ‘quick-turnaround’ programme would be going out on Monday. Contributors were also informed that the investigation was going to air the night before BBC director-general George Entwistle’s appearance in front of the culture, media and sport select committee on Tuesday. New controversy: The airing of a Panorama investigation into the allegations surrounding Sir Jimmy Savile, pictured at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 2003, may be delayed . Timely: Any delay would mean the show is aired after BBC director-general George Entwistle appears before MPs over the Savile allegations on Tuesday . But now it has emerged that the BBC could move the show to later in the week, blaming the fact that it might not be ready for Monday. This would mean any damaging revelations would air after the BBC chief had appeared in front of MPs. Tom Giles, editor of Panorama, said yesterday that his team were ‘working very hard’ to get the show on air as soon as they could. Panorama editor Tom Giles said his team are working 'very hard' to get the show aired as soon as possible . But one MP said it would be ‘extraordinary’ if it did not go out on Monday, while another said there would ‘need to be a very good reason why not’. Former Newsnight political editor Michael Crick, now at Channel 4 News, described the fact that Panorama was set to go out the night before Mr Entwistle’s appearance as a ‘huge problem’ for him. The programme is in part expected to probe what role executives including Mr Entwistle and director of news Helen Boaden had in the decision to drop a Newsnight investigation into Savile’s activities. Critics have suggested that the programme was dropped to protect the corporation’s reputation, but the BBC has repeatedly denied that any pressure was put on Newsnight editor Peter Rippon to pull the investigation. The suggestion that the Panorama programme could be moved back has raised new questions about the BBC’s handling of the issue. Conservative MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the committee which will be interviewing Mr Entwistle, said: ‘Given that one of the major issues is the suggestion that the BBC has been trying to suppress an investigation into this issue, if it were not transmitted on Monday there would need to be a very good reason.’ Liberal Democrat MP Adrian Sanders, who also sits on the  committee, said of the potential Panorama delay: ‘I find that extraordinary and would expect Entwistle to give a full explanation when he comes before the committee.’ Yesterday the BBC was asked by women’s groups to investigate whether ‘institutional sexism’  was partly to blame for the alleged abuse by Savile. Apology: The director-general of the BBC George Entwistle has previously issued a 'profound and heartfelt apology' to Jimmy Savile's victims .

If you're bored of pizza and not in the mood for curry, how about trying a restaurant specialising in dishes made of insects? Honey caterpillar canapes, consomme of grasshopper dumpling with locust jus, and burnt bee larvae are all on the menu at Eat Ento, a pop-up restaurant which starts a three-night run in south London tonight. The ambitious menu is the brainchild of four graduates who describe themselves as 'iconoclasts of taste', and say they who want to make creepy-crawlies a regular part of the Western diet. Scroll down for video . Feeling peckish? A new pop-up restaurant in London has grasshoppers, locusts and worms on the menu . Delicious: The Eat Ento team say insects are a valuable source of food for the world's expanding population . Aran Dasan, 26, Jonathan Fraser, 26, Julene Aguirre, 27, and Jacky Chung, 25, say edible insects (not all of them are) are a 'healthy, tasty and sustainable source of protein'. They plan firstly to get people to enjoy eating them, and then to open a permanent restaurant.  Their ultimate goal is to get insects onto our supermarket shelves within seven years. 'With your interest and lots of cooking . and farming, we believe insect dishes could be a regular sight in your . local supermarket by 2020,' said Miss Aguirre. The students, who came up with the idea as part of their design, innovation and engineering course at London's Royal College Of Art, hope their restaurant will 'gently challenge our cultural taboo' about ingesting bugs. Part of this involves telling people how good they are for us. Mr Fraser said: 'We think people should know that insects aren’t only more space and energy efficient than traditional livestock, but also high in protein and nutrients like omega-3 while remaining low in fat and cholesterol.' They say the animals like to be packed closely together, and eat less food than, for example cattle or sheep, so raise fewer ethical farming dilemmas. Packed full of protein, zinc, calcium and iron, edible insects are already eaten by millions of people worldwide . Insects are said to pose a smaller risk of passing infection on to humans compared with other mammals, and on a more pressing theme, food production will have to double to keep our rapidly-growing population fed over the next few decades. But the most important part in persuading people to eat bugs is to make what the students call insect cuisine appetising. Thus one of the dishes on offer at Eat Ento tonight is grasshopper and honey caterpillar medallion, in which honey caterpillars are blended and fried into a thin crepe that is rolled around fresh carrot, radish and cucumber sticks to create a canape not entirely dissimilar to a spring roll. Watermelon with caterpillar risotto and ground-up cricket is another dish, while fans of Chinese food might enjoy consomme of grasshopper dumpling, scorched tofu and locust jus. 'People assume the strength of the taboo is going to be reflected in the taste of the food, but it's not.' - Eat Ento founder Jonathan Fraser . Mr Fraser told The Times: 'People assume the strength of the taboo is going to be reflected in the taste of the food, but it's not.' Eat Ento is not the only restaurant offering insects in London today. Pest control firm Rentokil is also launching a pop-up 'pestaurant' in the City, offering dishes such as salt and vinegar crickets, chocolate-dipped ant and, slightly less frighteningly, sweet chilli pigeon burgers. The food will be free and diners can ask the pest-control experts on hand any questions they have on the matter. A spokesman for Rentokil saids: 'Edible insects have recently been identified by a number of different bodies, including the UN’s Food & Agriculture Organisation, as a potentially valuable source of food for the world’s rapidly growing population. 'Many insects are rich in protein, zinc, calcium and iron whilst also being low in fat, and they have a high ‘feed conversion rate’, meaning that they can be farmed using relatively little land, water and energy compared to livestock.' Pigeons, meanwhile, despite being a nuisance for many, are a well-recognised delicacy and wood pigeon can be found on Michelin-starred menus across the world. Proponents of insect cuisine hope to follow the lead of sushi, once considered beyond the pale by Westerners and now a staple of British office workers.","Eat Ento restaurant opens in south London tonight for three nights .

Car manufacturer Jaguar is to announce more than 1,700 new jobs and £1.5billion of investment to build a new family of small luxury cars including its first ever 4X4. The investment is set to create up to 7,000 further jobs with UK suppliers making nearly 9,000 jobs in total to create a new generation of hi-tech lightweight but sporty aluminium cars. Parent company Jaguar Land Rover chose the Frankfurt Motor Show to make the announcement to signal its intent to compete ‘aggressively’ with German rivals such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Investment: Jaguar will create thousands of jobs by investing in a family of small cars including the firm's first ever 4X4, pictured . Employment boost: The new range will create 1,700 jobs at Jaguar but as many as 7,000 jobs among suppliers . And with a former BMW boss at its head in Dr Ralph Speth, it claims it now knows exactly what is needed to beat the Germans in the market they dominate. Business minister Michael Fallon said it was a clear case of putting ‘British towels on German sun-loungers.’ The boost was also welcomed by Prime Minister David Cameron as another strong sign of a growing economy. The 1,700 new direct jobs will be at Jaguar Land Rover’s Advanced Manufacturing Facility at Solihull near Birmingham where the new cars will be built. But JLR said it will also ‘significantly increase’ spending with suppliers, sparking more jobs. Jaguar says its radical new ‘crossover’ will be just one of a brand new ‘family’ of  smaller and more affordable luxury cars that will give German rivals a real run for their money as the firm significantly ramps up production. Boost: Prime Minister David Cameron described the investment as another sign of a growing economy . The new Jaguar sports utility vehicle is to be built in the UK using a radical new all-aluminium flexible manufacturing system. Jaguar says its dramatic leap into new segments will allow it to massively increase production by creating a new series of smaller and medium sized spin-off cars designed to take on German rivals such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Experts say it will put parent company Jaguar Land Rover on track to more than double production  from around 360,000 a year today to around 750,000 by 2020 with some even suggesting a million over a decade. The company itself declines to predict volumes. But Jaguar Land Rover chief Executive officer Dr. Ralf Speth said: ’Today’s announcement signals Jaguar Land Rover’s ambitions to push the boundaries and redefine premium car ownership. 'At Jaguar Land Rover we place the customer at the heart of everything we do and the introduction of a world class all-new aluminium vehicle architecture means we will be more competitive, flexible and efficient delivering exciting new products for our customers around the world.’ He added: ‘Jaguar Land Rover is a business driven by design, technology and innovation and this investment and level of job creation is yet further evidence of our commitment to advancing the capability of the UK automotive sector and its supply chain.’ The 1,700 new jobs at the Solihull site in the Midlands will bring the total number of UK manufacturing jobs announced by Jaguar Land Rover over the last three years to almost 11,000. Business Minister Michael Fallon, who is attending the Frankfurt show, welcomed the Jaguar Land Rover announcement. He said: ‘It’s a great boost for jobs, investment and new models. British car-makers are flying the flag in Germany. We have our British towels on their sun-loungers.’ Growing: The 1,700 new jobs at the Solihull site in the Midlands will bring the total number of UK manufacturing jobs announced by Jaguar Land Rover over the last three years to almost 11,000 . Business Secretary Vince Cable added: 'Jaguar Land Rover has been experiencing great success over the last couple of years but this ground-breaking project takes Jaguar onto the next level. 'This all aluminium architecture project typifies the type of innovative and high value research and development that the UK excels in and Government is supporting through the automotive industrial strategy.’ A prototype of the new four-door Jaguar SUV - codenamed C-X17 was unveiled on the eve of the Frankfurt motor show in Germany and will be just one of a new line of cars – all based around the same hi-tech all-aluminium lightweight chassis, almost all of it from recycled metal. However, the very first model off the line using the new flexible chassis  ‘architecture’ will be a high volume ‘baby Jaguar saloon car built at its Solihull factory in Birmingham from 2015 to take on BMW’s top selling 3-series. The sports utility vehicle being shown at Frankfurt is set to follow two years later.","The investment will create 1,700 jobs at the manufacturer's Solihull plant .

James Sanders, who was handed a pair of citations amounting to $720 for speeding and refusing to identify himself to police, has paid off his two tickets - in 70,000 pennies. The defiant man took his haul of pennies to Clinton County Courthouse in Indiana . The defiant motorist, who claims to be a 'sovereign citizen' - a movement which recognises common law and do not accept federal, state or municipal law - had protested the charges since being handed them in August last year. 'As far as I’m concerned, they are stealing this money from me,” Sanders said. “If they want it, this is how they are going to get it,' he told JC Online. He used pennies, quarters and nickels, Sanders hauled his fine in to Clinton County Courthouse, Indiana, using buckets and a hand cart. His fine was taken to a nearby bank, where it was counted and converted into cash, 10 News reported. Sanders has paid off his two tickets - in 72,000 pennies . He said he did not believe he had committed a crime, and wanted to make those who had fined him earn the financial penalty they had imposed on him. 'I believe in obeying the law. I don't make up my own laws. I read the law and I follow it. That's it,' he told 10 News. Mr Sanders is not the only citizen who has decided to seek revenge through unusual methods of paying. In 2011 a Californian man took clearing his debts to a new level after he tried to clear a $6,500 debt with 650,000 pennies. Thirry Chahez, who runs a cake shop, loaded the crates of coins in to the back of his van and drove to a local Chase Bank in an attempt to pay his credit card bill that was due on Monday. But despite his best efforts, the bank refused to accept the payment and asked Mr Chahez to package them into more manageable individual coin rolls. Accepting the request, Mr Chahez was shocked when the bank would not accept the re-packaged payment either. Eventually Mr Chahez  managed to deposit the money and pay off his debt after being sent to a branch with a bigger vault. Mr Chahez says he undertook the drastic measure as he was upset with his bank over a refinance he could not get and other charges and fees on his credit card. And when one woman was faced with a court order to pay her ex-husband $50.12 as part of a divorce settlement, she decided to settle her debts and punish her ex. The aggrieved spouse, believed to be Nebraska, paid up the money in pennies delivered in Tupperware filled with rice and beans last month. She handed over forty seven dollars and twelve cents in pennies, and the other three dollars paid for the containers that she used, she wrote in an angry note to him.","'Sovereign citizen' James Sanders paid $720 fine to court in 70,000 pennies .

Guilty: Phillip Challis was today jailed after he pleaded guilty to 17 sex offences at Kingston Crown Court . A former priest who raped and molested two boys for almost two decades has been jailed for 13 years. Phillip Challis, 52, admitted 17 sexual offences carried out between 1991 and 2009 while he was a priest in Merton, southwest London. He pleaded guilty to crimes including raping a child, indecent assault, attempted rape and taking indecent photographs. Challis was caught by child abuse investigators in January after a 17-year-old boy came forward to say he had been abused by Challis since he was eight. Police later found out that Challis had also abused a second male victim, who is now 29, since he was seven years old. But a senior officer in the Metropolitan police today said it was 'entirely possible' that Challis abused more than two people. He urged any further victims to speak to police in the hope of receiving justice. Challis initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, but changed his plea after he was made aware of the evidence against him. He was handed the prison sentence today at Kingston Crown Court in London. Detective Superintendent Tariq Farooqi of the Metropolitan Police said: 'We are committed to investigating serious offences of this nature and ensuring dangerous offenders like Challis are brought to justice for their crimes. 'I am pleased that the weight of evidence forced Challis to change his plea, saving the victims from recounting their distressing experiences in court.

With its girlish gossiping about handsome men and parties, it is a classic example of an exchange between young women. The writer talks of her heart ‘fluttering’ at the sight of a ‘devastatingly attractive young giant’ of an officer, and her embarrassment at busybodies listening in on her chat at parties. But the signature at the bottom, ‘Lilibet’, gives a clue that it was not written by any ordinary young woman. Carefree: A series of items, including Royal letters written by a young Princess Elizabeth, have been released. Left, Princess Elizabeth dances with a friend in 1946. Right, the Princess in a lemon gown, with diamonds in her ears and around her neck, dances with Commander S Either at the Phoenicia Hotel in Malta in 1951 . The author was none other than Princess Elizabeth, writing at the tender age of 19 in the months following the end of the Second World War – only seven years before she would become queen. The carefree tone of the note, to her ‘darling’ cousin Diana Bowes-Lyon, is in stark contrast to the gravity of the role fate was preparing for Elizabeth. Lilibet – then her pet name among the family – writes excitably about dances, weddings and men, saying she has not been ‘doing badly in the way of fun’ and has been ‘greedily’ taking opportunities to socialise at Balmoral. Inner thoughts: The signature at the bottom of the letter 'Lilibet' reveal the identity of its author . She reveals that one of the Royal family’s protection officers is ‘a devastatingly attractive young giant (with fair hair and blue eyes, of course) from Skye called Roddy Macleod!’ She adds: ‘He caused my Margaret’s (her sister) heart to flutter a bit, I think (mine too, a bit).’ To her cousin, who was in Germany working with the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry for the Army when Elizabeth wrote the letter in November 1945, she notes that ‘you must have fun with all your Generals’ and have ‘made the acquaintance of a good many of the species’. The letter, on six sides of Buckingham Palace-headed notepaper, has come to light as part of a sale of about 400 items related to Europe’s Royal children, to commemorate the birth of Prince George, called Two Centuries of Royal Children. Elizabeth also gossips about the wedding between Johnny, 4th Earl of Kimberley and Diana Legh, saying it was ‘a tremendous affair'. ‘There must have been at least 500 people. It became so packed that one couldn’t move without some horrid old lady listening to what one said to every man one met!’ At the time, the young princess had already fallen for Philip, whom she would marry two years later. But she seemed to still have half an eye on plenty of other young men. Taking a more serious tone, Elizabeth says that with her cousin in ‘a place like Germany, one is grateful for any small thing, and when one thinks of how much one grumbles back here, then we all ought to be ashamed of ourselves’. She also bemoans the fact her friends keep being posted overseas: ‘It’s a great pity so many people who one just got to know have all departed for Palestine or Germany, so one has got to begin all over again.’ Sombre: Appearances suggest not all of the young princess' encounters were an emotional roller coaster.

Charming: Left, Princess Elizabeth and her dancing partner Earl Mountbatten of Burma in 1951. Right, Princess Elizabeth dancing with Lord Leveson at the Flower Ball at the Savoy Hotel . The sale also features two earlier letters from an even younger Princess Elizabeth. One, written after her 10th birthday, tells a friend: ‘My pony, Snowball jumps beautifully.’ The third, written when she was just eight, is a birthday note to her ‘Darling Grannie’, Queen Mary, wife of George V. The letters and rare photographs are being sold for between £1,750 and £5,750 by Royal manuscripts expert Sophie Dupre, who has featured regularly on the Antiques Roadshow.

He was a brilliant Army surgeon who helped save the lives of hundreds of soldiers horrifically wounded on the Afghan battlefield. Lieutenant Colonel Mike McErlain was part of a team of highly-skilled medics toiling to treat harrowing injuries in the operating theatre at Camp Bastion. His dedication ensured young servicemen and women, including those with arms and legs blown off by roadside bombs, received a second chance. Heartbroken: Joanna McErlain has praised her surgeon husband Mike who collapsed and died just minutes into the 44-mile D-Day run . Lieutenant Colonel McErlain, a father-of-three, had an undiagnosed degenerative heart disease . He was so determined to help warzone amputees that he co-founded a charity run which has raised more than £100,000 for the victims. The annual D-Day 44 Run aimed to increase awareness of the sacrifices made by Allied soldiers along the Normandy coast on June 6, 1944, and collect money for BLESMA, the British Limbless Ex-Service Men's Association. But in a tragic twist Lt Col McErlain, a married father-of-three, collapsed and died just minutes into this year's 44-mile run. The seemingly healthy 45-year-old had an undiagnosed degenerative heart disease. Army surgeon: Lt Col McErlain was part of a team of highly-skilled medics toiling to treat harrowing injuries in the operating theatre at Camp Bastion . Now his heartbroken wife Joanna has spoken for the first time about her hero - and vowed to continue organising the D-Day 44 Run in his memory. She said: 'He was a wonderful man, husband and father and a talented surgeon. Everyone loved him. He was so humble. 'He was always as fit as a fiddle. It is such a terrible irony that he died doing that run because he loved it. He was humbled by the sacrifice of those who fell on D-Day. 'All those fallen heroes on the Normandy beaches and now there has just been another one. 'He was incredibly passionate about it. He used to say, ""If it wasn't for the bravery of the people who fought at Normandy we would not be living in freedom today"". Dedication: Pictured here working with a colleague, Lt Col McErlain was so determined to help warzone amputees that he co-founded a charity run. This photo has been doctored to show a partial colouring . 'I take some comfort in thinking that about Mike. If it were not for his work as a surgeon, a lot of people would not be here today.' Lt Col McErlain studied medicine at the University of Aberdeen, specialising in spinal surgery. He also studied trauma surgery in Melbourne, Australia. He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) as a medical cadet in 1990 and the Parachute Regiment in 1996. 'He was humbled by the sacrifice of those who fell on D-Day. All those fallen heroes on the Normandy beaches and now there has just been another one' Joanna McErlain . He served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked at the Role 3 Hospital in Camp Bastion. He worked in the operating theatre at the facility, widely acknowledged as the best in the world. A staggering 98 per cent of those who make it through the door still breathing do not die. Horrendously-wounded troops' chances of surviving to recuperate at home with their families, or becoming another number on the UK's grim death toll in the war against the Taliban, rest in the hands of the 250 professional medics. In 2011, Lt Col McErlain wrote a diary for a newspaper of his stint in Camp Bastion. He spoke of having 'one of the hardest days of my life', when the medical staff saved the lives of three soldiers who had legs blown off by improvised explosive devices (IEDs). 'All three had what should be non-survivable injuries but we pulled them through,' he said. Work: Lt Col McErlain served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked at the Role 3 Hospital in Camp Bastion . Mrs McErlain, from Hindhead, Surrey, said: 'I remember saying to him ""What's it like out there?"" and he replied, ""If you think of the worst case scenario and multiply it by 100, it's that"". ‘He was so humbled by the guys who had arms and legs blown off and their determination to keep going. He never boasted about his own achievements. But helping to save so many lives was so incredible. 'You hear about guys in Afghanistan who get killed or have their limbs blown off and Mike and his team were the ones who saved them and they don't always get recognised. 'They are in the background yet without them the number of deaths would be greater.' Lt Col McErlain worked at the Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit Frimley Park and volunteered to run clinics at Headley Court, the armed forces rehabilitation centre near Dorking, Surrey. A keen skier and mountaineer, the surgeon also loved distance running and cycling. He ran the 156-mile Marathon des Sables through the Sahara - dubbed the toughest footrace on earth - and cycled 1,000 miles back to the United Kingdom from Bosnia in 1995. His passion for running - and determination to raise money for BLESMA - inspired him to plot the D-Day 44 Run with brother-in-law Giles Barnes. It is a 44-mile run through Normandy, following the cliff tops, war graves and cemeteries and ending up at Pegasus Bridge, where the Paras landed in 1944. He was one of around 30 people who took part in the event this year. But two miles into the run, tragedy struck. Treatment: Casualties are brought into a hospital at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan in 2009 (file picture) Mrs McErlain, an interior designer who was in the support car with food, drinks and medical equipment, said: 'He had been running for about two miles with a U.S. firefighter. 'He was running along the cliffs which the U.S. Rangers climbed under fire in 1944 when he suddenly collapsed. The firefighter said he tried to resuscitate him but he was unsuccessful.' 'I wonder if it happened for a reason in Normandy. He could have been in the back garden playing football but he died in a place that was special to him. 'When I found out he'd died a lady came up and put her arms around me. I was crying my eyes out and it was the daughter of General Patten. 'She spoke to me softly and said, ""Mike's being lifted up by all those fallen heroes and now he's one of them. None of them had wives, mothers, daughters with them. You are weeping for all of them."" It was so comforting.' Lt Col McErlain and his wife had three children - Paris, 10, Venezia, nine, and Lucius, eight. His popularity was underlined when more than 1,000 people attended his funeral at Sandhurst Royal Military Academy. Lieutenant Colonel AJ Day, commanding officer at the MoD Hospital Unit Frimley Park, said: 'Mike was a thoroughly professional dedicated military consultant. 'He was instrumental in pioneering new equipment and techniques for his field. Mike has left a legacy in his work contributing widely to his specialist field to benefit the Defence Medical Services. 'To die during an event he felt so passionate about is testament to his character and all he stood for. He will be greatly missed.'","Lt Col Mike McErlain was part of a team of highly-skilled medics .

A man who shot dead his wife before posting grisly photos of her corpse on Facebook may use Florida's 'stand your ground' defense, with new photos taken after the shoot-out showing bruises on his arm. Derek Medina, 31, claimed he shot Jennifer Alfonso, 26, after she viciously attacked him at their South Miami home on August 8. He then posted a picture of her dead body online to notify family members. Now Medina's attorney said his client may use Florida's 'stand your ground' self-defense law, with new photos taken eight days after the shooting showing small bruises on his arm. Scroll down for video . Self-defense: Photos taken eight days after the shooting show yellow bruises on Derek Medina's arm, which he claims proves he acted in self-defense . Victim? Derek Medina claims he killed his wife only after years of violence and abuse . These photos show a shirtless Medina with small, yellow-colored bruises on his arm . The photos  from the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office show a shirtless Medina with small, yellow-colored bruises on his upper-left arm, but no other noticeable injuries, WPLG reported. A court last week denied Medina's request for bail. He has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder with a firearm. Medina's attorney, Saam Zanganeh, told the court his client may have feared bodily harm, even without having life threatening injuries. He said Florida's 'stand your ground' self-defense law and the Castle Doctrine, which permits force to be met with force inside a person's home, could apply in his client's case. 'She's the aggressor,' Zanganeh said, according to WPLG, during closing arguments. 'Her level of anger and distress and stewing in her own venom, it didn't get better, it got worse.' Derek Medina claims he fatally shot his wife in self defense and posted photos of his dead wife on Facebook to notify family members about what had happened . Prosecutors have also released a chilling 911 call made on the day of the shooting from the Gables Club Condominiums, where Medina worked. 'He (Medina) just shot his girlfriend 16 times, and he's on his way to the police department,' the caller - reportedly Medina's boss - said, according to audio broadcast by NBC Miami. 'He just said that it was too many years of abuse, and she started to hit him and I guess he snapped and shot her.' 'I need just a follow up that he is in . custody. If this guy has lost his marbles, I don't want him coming here . and going postal, you know what I mean? Medina later turned himself into a South Miami police station. Gruesome: Derek Medina was arrested after admitting to killing his wife on Facebook and posting a grisly photo of her body lying on the kitchen floor . While Medina has maintained he acted in self-defense, a police detective testifying on Tuesday said Alfonso was likely cowering and trying to defend herself . before she was killed. In . his hearing testimony, Detective Jonathan Grossman said an autopsy and . the position of Alonso's body indicates she was on her knees with one . arm raised in front of her face when she was shot on during an . argument. The trajectories of the 380-caliber bullets indicate they were fired from above her, he added. 'The . victim was very low to the ground at the time she was shot,' Grossman . testified. 'The victim appeared to be in a cowering position.' Grossman also said friends and family members told him that Medina had vowed to kill his wife if she ever cheated on him or attempted to leave him. Medina himself told police in his sworn statement that Alonso had threatened to leave that day and that she had told a friend the same thing earlier. The testimony came at a bail hearing for Medina, who sat silently in the courtroom wearing a red jail jumpsuit and a full, dark beard. Medina's attorney, Zanganeh, brought up several pieces of evidence indicating that Alonso could have been the aggressor in their fight. Medina claimed that he killed his wife in self-defense after she threatened him with a knife, following many previous abusive episodes . Her diary, which she titled 'The Diary of the Insane Women,' had several violence-laced entries, including one in which she said she thought about ripping Medina's eyes out because he looked at other women. 'The diary chronicles her thoughts and buttresses our position that she had violent thoughts against Mr. Medina,' Zanganeh said. Grossman testified under cross-examination that police had no previous domestic violence reports from the home. But he also said Medina had trained briefly at a mixed martial arts center and had boxed with the center's veteran instructor after challenging him. Assistant State Attorney J. Scott Dunn asked the detective whether, with Medina's apparent fighting abilities, it seemed plausible that he feared violence from his wife enough to fatally shoot her in self-defense. 'That's what he indicated. According to his statement, she was punching him,' Grossman replied.

When hairdresser Dianah Kendall began to lose her sight, she thought her job was for the chop. But despite her vision being massively impaired, the hairdresser still manages to cut hair so well her loyal customers pledged to stand by her. Ms Kendall, 56, lost her vision after suffering a brain injury last year - and was classed as too blind to drive. The mother-of-two was at work when she started suffering a headache and was rushed into hospital the next day with bleeding on the brain . Her customers at Just Cuts in Pencoed, near Bridgend, South Wales, keep on coming back . The mother-of-two was at work when she started suffering a headache and was rushed into hospital the next day with bleeding on the brain. She had suffered an intracerebral hematoma, meaning a pool of blood gathered in her brain and killed all the nerves that it touched. She was left with impaired peripheral vision - which means she has a limited frame of vision - and was warned she might never work again. But her customers at Just Cuts in Pencoed, near Bridgend, South Wales, kept on coming back after she returned three months following the diagnosis. She said: 'They tease me about my eyesight - saying ""who'd have a cut from a blind hairdresser?"". 'But I don't mind. Losing some of my sight and surviving is better than the other option. 'My customers were all so supportive and were pleased when I returned to work after three months off.' The inspirational mother-of-two keeps wielding the scissors despite her vision being massively impaired . 'I couldn't see my hand in front of my face. I was told my sight would come back slowly but it's been over a year now and it's worse if anything.' But after 40 years of cutting hair the brave hairdresser was determined to continue serving her loyal customers. She said: 'Accepting my limitations has been difficult. I've had to learn that I'm not super woman. Now that my condition has settled down it only affects my peripheral vision. 'So I trip up and can't judge distances very well at all but if a head of hair is in front of me I can see well enough to give my usual great standard of cut.' Shopkeeper Sara Allan, 34, said: 'My husband teases me about going to a blind hairdresser but she's the best. 'I wouldn't go anywhere else - she never fails. I've never left with a cut I didn't like. She knows what I like so well that she could do it with her eyes close anyway.' Dianah is even looking forward to expanding her hairdressing and barber shop franchise in the future - and will recruit more staff to keep up with demand. She said: 'I tell people that nothing should stand in your way - even if you can't even see your way ahead.' New customer Michelle Davies, 24, said: 'I would never have known Dianah had problems seeing. She is so comfortable with the scissors in her hand.

Making light of it: Dr Samadi joked that he was going to be extra thorough by checking with 2 fingers . Horror: From left to right, fellow hosts Natalie Morales, Savannah Guthrie and Tamron Hall react to the tests . If . prostate cancer is detected early, it is one of the most treatable. But many cases remain undetected . because of the perceived embarrassment surrounding the prostate examination; each year . it claims around 29,000 lives and it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. While undergoing a rectal examination does not seem like the most comfortable prospect, the seconds-long check could potentially save your life. The procedure involves a manual . digital examination of the prostate gland to see whether it is a normal . size and shape. If doctors feel any nodules on the prostate, which is usually a spongey consistency, further . blood checks are required. Another test that men undergo to detect prostate cancer is a PSA blood test, which checks for elevated levels of protein in the blood. One . in six men can expect to be diagnosed with the cancer in his lifetime . and the average age of diagnosis is 67. Lauer added: 'I think a lot of guys are also concerned about the embarrassment factor of it, so my advice would be find a doctor you're very comfortable with. That embarrassment factor is not going to be an issue.' Dr Samadi said that the prostates felt normal, adding of Roker's: 'It's a little enlarged, but it's not terrible.' He said that if he had felt any problems, he would have given the men antibiotics in case it was simply an infection, before carrying out blood work. Both of the men had already undergone the first part of the test to detect any prostate issues - a 'PSA' blood test, which checks for elevated levels of protein in the blood. Lauer said that he had been having regular blood checks with Dr Samadi for the past five years because he has a family history of prostate issues. But the doctor said his PSA had stayed steady. Dr Samadi suggested that men should start having the test after the age of 40. Lauer and Roker have also been growing beards since the start of the month for 'No Shave November' - joining other men across the country in a bid to raise awareness of male cancers. Before the check, the hosts said they . were undergoing the procedure to dispel the myths around it and to show . just how easy it is. 'We're . trying to raise awareness, trying to get men of a certain age to go to . the doctors to raise some of these issues,' Lauer said. 'A lot of people . have fears or concerns. We're going to show you just how quick this . procedure is.' Checks: As well as carrying out the prostate exam, doctors take a PSA blood test to detect the levels of protein in the blood, which can be an indicator of issues. Here, Roker receives the blood test . Pre-test nerves: Al Roker looked concerned before he had the test, as co-hosts Natalie Morales and Savannah Guthrie posed wearing gloves.

Ahead of the tests, Natalie Morales and Savannah Guthrie posed on set wearing gloves while a concerned Al Roker looked on. The Today show hasn't shied away from more grisly health checks in the past.

He was a keen volunteer who once donated at £3,000 prize to a charity he worked with . The sixth cyclist killed in London in the last two weeks was an 'real hero' who worked as a volunteer for a mental health charity, colleagues said today. Richard Muzira, father of two and volunteer filmmaker at CoolTan Arts, died after being dragged under the wheels of a tipper truck at a busy junction on Camberwell Road in South London just after noon on Monday. His name was released as new measures were announced to combat the recent spate of cyclist deaths on the capital's roads. Specialist traffic officers will be out in force on every major street, especially notorious junctions like the Bow roundabout where a cyclist died last week. From Monday, they will be on the lookout for motorists using mobile phones, drivers stopping in 'bike boxes' at traffic lights and cyclists riding on the inside of HGVs. The decision was taken at a meeting between the Metropolitan Police Service and City Hall last night. Speaking this afternoon Michelle Baharier, the chief executive at CoolTan Arts, said the vulnerable people the group works with had been hit hard by the loss of Mr Muzira. She said: 'It's absolutely, one million per cent devastating. It really, really is, he was a real hero, he was fantastic, such wonderful human being, he was just one of the best and we had worked together for a long time. 'He was really caring, really supportive, he was very helpful to everyone, he was very passionate, he had a great sense of humour and we shared a lot of laughs together. 'We are a MAD organisation, which stands for Mental Health and Disability, and it has really affected us a lot.' A cyclist in his early 60s has died after a collision with a lorry in south London. Pictured are police officers standing next to the lorry involved in the incident . She added: 'It has been a hard year for CoolTan. We had three people take their own lives and two die from self-neglect, we are all distraught, it's going to be very difficult for the people we work with to come to terms with this. 'When anybody dies it affects a lot of people, but Richard's death will impact a big group of people who will struggle with it, they are too upset.' Mr Muzira, a Zimbabwean in his 60s who lived in London for decades and worked for the organisation for seven years, was a keen cyclist. Ms Baharier added: 'The Government will not make segregated cycle lanes so cars and lorries drive into people on bikes and kill them, it's that simple. 'He loved to cycle, he had his house burgled earlier this year and his bike was stolen so we made a collection to help him save up for a new one.' The mangled remains of the victim's bike trapped in the wheels of the lorry . She added: 'He regularly volunteered at the centre and won a £3,000 prize from the Bank of America in recognition for his work. 'He . was a unique, special, beautiful person. You just cant imagine a . more beautiful, selfless, human being, he was a big part of the team. 'We are gutted, it's such a shock and such a sad tragedy.' As the new safety measures were announced, London Mayor Boris Johnson said he thought cyclists using headphones while riding on London's streets are an 'absolute scourge' and he would not be against banning them. He said: 'I'm very alarmed about cyclists wearing headphones,' he told BBC London 94.9 today. 'I would not be against a prohibition or ban on cyclists wearing headphones. 'Call me illiberal but it makes me absolutely terrified to see them bowling along unable to hear the traffic.' Police officers remove the bike, which was been twisted in the accident . Authorities pushed through the new policing measure despite previously saying real progress on safety would come with a £35 million scheme for segregated lanes to be built next year. But the Mayor’s cycling commissioner, Andrew Gilligan, told the Evening Standard the actions are a must if the startling spate of deaths is to be halted. He said: 'This is a new zero-tolerance approach with a police officer on every main road in central London from Monday which is a huge escalation to the checks we are doing already. 'They will be stopping lorries and cars and where there is unsafe driving they will be taken off the road. We will also target unsafe cyclists. It is a short-term measure but the Mayor and the police feel we must act as a result of the recent spate of appalling accidents.' A police tent next to the lorry involved in the incident. The death brings the number of cyclists killed in London to six in just two weeks . One witness, a man who declined to be named, saw the aftermath of the accident that killed Mr Murza. He said: 'I came past and saw people panicking around the side of the lorry. 'He was trapped under the wheels at the back of the truck, people were screaming, there was nothing that they could do. 'The lorry looks like it was turning left and he just went straight under. 'The paramedics came but he was crushed under the wheels, there wasn't much they could do.' What was left of his twisted road bike could be seen caught under the driver's cab. A cyclist receives emergency medical treatment after being involved in an accident with a lorry in Camden, north London yesterday . An eyewitness described seeing 'white chinos' sticking out from underneath the cab. James, who refused to give his surname, was travelling home to Dulwich on the bus when he saw the aftermath of the accident. He said: 'There were a lot of buses queued up, people were looking the windows as the paramedics worked on him. 'We didn't know if he was dead or alive, all we could see was his white chinos. The paramedics were working on him as shocked people just stood and watched. 'When you think you're having a bad day and you see that on the way home it makes you think.' The Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) has called on Mr Johnson to take 'urgent action' to make cyclists safer .

Another eyewitness, who gave his name as Dave, said: 'The first I heard of it was a woman making a wailing noise. She was very near to the junction and there was loads of screaming. I looked out and saw the lorry. 'There were sirens everywhere and someone said a cyclist was trapped under the lorry. It's still out there now. 'A lot of police vehicles were there and then they were putting up a tent so that people didn't see the cyclist. 'They've closed a lot of roads down and I think they're trying to get the cyclist out from underneath. 'The ambulance seems to have disappeared, but there are still a load of police around. 'Cycling is so dangerous in London, people just don't see you,' added Dave, who used to cycle but is now a regular motorcyclist. 'Cyclists are much more vulnerable because they go quite slow, but turning left is always risky.' Collision: Roger William De Klerk, 43, an IT consultant and courier, of Forest Hill, south east London was killed in Croydon on Tuesday when he was hit by a bus while cycling on tramways . The death takes the number of to be killed in London to six in just 14 days. On November 5th hospital porter Brian Holt, 62, died on Mile End Road in east London as he cycled along Cycle Superhighway 2. He was crushed by a tipper lorry as it moved off from stationary during the evening rush hour.

That . evening a 21 year old man from St John's Wood was hit by a bus at . 11.30pm in Aldgate, near the Cycle Superhighway 2. He died the following . morning. The latest death means 14 cyclists have died on London's roads so far this year. In 2012, there were 14 cyclists' deaths, while in 2011 a total of 16 cyclists were killed.

Candle-lit: Cyclists showed their support for the victims of London's dangerous road network . Last week the Mayor of London was accused of shirking his responsibility and insensitivity after saying cyclists should 'think of the laws of the road' after a spate of deaths involving cyclists in the capital. Speaking just hours after the fifth cyclist died as a result of a crash on London's roads in just nine days, Boris Johnson appeared to blame cyclists, saying their 'hasty, rash decisions' were 'endangering' their lives. The mayor's comments came hours after a man died after being hit by a double-decker bus in Whitechapel, east London, the second casualty on London's roads in less than 24 hours.

A Department of Homeland Security employee who was unmasked in August as a radical black nationalist who publicly called for an all-out war against with the white race still has not been let go. Ayo Kimathi, an acquisitions officer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement who deals with small businesses, was placed on administrative leave three months ago after it was revealed that he has been using his website, WarOnTheHorizon.com, to advocate for the mass murder of Caucasians. The site includes descriptions of an 'unavoidable, inevitable clash with the white race.' Kimathi is black. Chameleon: Ayo Kimathi, an acquisitions officer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was suspended with pay after it was discovered that he has been moonlighting as an advocate for a race war . Hate speech: Kimathi, who is black, operates the website War on the Horizon, which includes descriptions of an 'unavoidable, inevitable clash with the white race' DHS spokesperson Gillian Christensen told National Journal that Kimathi's status has not changed since August, and that he is still listed as an employee of the agency. Kimathi has been with the department since 2009, and last year he drew an annual salary of more than $115,000. He has been suspended with pay for the past three months. Josh Glasstetter, of The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors hate groups, said that Kimathi's continued . employment by the DHS is unacceptable, and that the federal agency . ought to be 'tracking' him rather then paying him wages. His website criticizes whites, gays, those of mixed race, and blacks who integrate with whites. In his lectures and speeches, some of them available on YouTube, the federal employee heaped abuse on President Obama for his support of gay rights, calling him a ‘goddamn f***** mulatto.’ The SPLC in August reported on Kimathi's role in running the site. Hostile: A former manager at DHS said that 'everybody in the office is afraid' of Kimatha . 'At this point in history, whites worldwide are threatening the existence of every Black man, woman, and child on Earth,' one passage on the site read. 'Since we are the most valuable people . alive and there is no need for this planet’s existence without us, it . is time for us to prepare for the international war for Black survival.' Kimathi, . who calls himself 'the irritated Genie,' received permission to launch . the site after falsely telling his supervisors at the DHS that War on the . Horizon was set up to sell concert and lecture videos. Author: Kimathi wrote a book under the pen name the Irritated Genie of Soufees on the subject of the effeminization of the black male by whites, which retails on Amazon for more than $756 . ‘He called it simply WOH, never saying that WOH stood for War on the Horizon,’ the report stated. DHS spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said in a written statement that the agency ‘does not condone any type of hateful rhetoric or advocacy of violence of any kind against anyone.’ The Alabama-based SPLC said in its report that Kimathi's site declares: ‘in order for Black people to survive the 21st century, we are going to have to kill a lot of whites – more than our Christian hearts can possibly count.' A former manager at DHS reportedly told SPLC that 'everybody in the office is afraid of him,' adding that his co-workers have expressed concerns that one day, Kimathi would bring a gun 'and go postal.' His hate-filled rhetoric aside, however, Kimathi’s ex-supervisor described him as a ‘suave’ professional with a ‘commanding presence’ who excelled at his job advocating for small business owners. The radical activist appears to have a long list of enemies, among them Rev. Al Sharpton, Lil Wayne, Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, dubbed by him ‘Colon,’ and the long-deceased FBI director ‘Gay Edgar Hoover.’ Besides preparing members of the black . race for war on whites, Kimathi also has been going after gays and . lesbians, while accusing the US government of pursuing a secret agenda . of trying to ‘effeminize’ the black male as a way of destroying the race. In a lengthy blog post that was uploaded on the radical site November 1, the writer accused the Obama administration of pressuring Lincoln University and other historically black colleges to promote homosexuality to student body - or risk losing their funding. In September, another post addressed the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin. The author of the foul-mouthed communique referred to the defendant as a 'zionist smallhat' while calling the victim 'Brother Trayvon.' Firebrand: Besides running the website, Kimathi also has been giving lectures and speeches advocating for a war of whites and homosexuals . Anti-gay: Lomathi lambasted President Obama for his support of LGBT community in 2009 speech . Harsh words: Kimathi said he was disillusioned with Michelle Obama for wearing a 'lingerie'-style dress on the cover of People magazine . A book on the subject titled ‘War on the Horizon: Black Resistance to the white-sex Assault,’ which was apparently written by Kimathi under the pen name the Irritated Genie of Soufees, retails on Amazon for more than $756, the Huffington Post reported. In a particularly incendiary video from August 2009 posted on his YouTube page, which was unearthed by the site Mediate, Kimathi delivered a racially charged and homophobic speech blasting President Obama as a' goddamn f***** mullato' for his efforts to extend rights to members of the LGBT community. Dressed in a gold-colored African garb with an amulet around his neck, Kimathi raged against Obama, whom he repeatedly called 'f**' and 'miserable, low-life, scum-dwelling product of the Europeans’ for his decision to designate June 2009 as National LGBT Pride Month. List of enemies: Rev. Al Sharpton (left), Oprah Winfrey (center) and Colin Powell(right) are among the black leaders that Kimathi considers traitors to their race . Kimathi also did not spare the first . lady, saying that he had started out admiring Michelle Obama as an . articulate black woman, but was later disillusioned with her after . seeing the cover of People magazine that featured the mother of two . sporting a pink lacy dress with a V-neck, which he labelled 'lingerie.' ‘Damn, these crackers got us! They got a f***** and a sister who's out of control, and they're embarrassing us around the world,' he cried.","Ayo Kimathi has worked as acquisition officer for DHS dealing with small businesses since 2009 .

Warning: Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo has said Spain is no longer considered a 'friendly nation' Spanish vessels entering British territory near Gibraltar may come under fire as they are not identified as being from ‘a friendly nation,’ its chief minister said today. Fabian Picardo has warned that Spanish boats ‘may find themselves shot at’ if they continue to disregard Gibraltar’s marine borders. Mr Picardo also called for more senior assets from the British Royal Navy to be moved to the area. Warning that the Spanish ships could be seen as ‘terrorists’ he accused the country of ‘needling away at the United Kingdom and Gibraltar by taking such action’ in an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. This came as several Tories demanded a show of force against Spain yesterday after a Spanish vessel made a ‘provocative incursion’ into Gibraltar’s territorial waters. Britain summoned the Spanish ambassador for a dressing down after the ocean survey vessel spent 20 hours defying the Royal Navy’s demands that it depart, escalating the diplomatic tensions over the Rock. The incident was denounced in Britain as the ship withdrew last night. But Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, who . was the British United Nations  commander during the Bosnian war, said . that if the Government is serious about defending Gibraltar’s . sovereignty it should send major combat units to deter Spanish . grandstanding. Former . Tory MP Louise Mensch added: ‘The next time a Spanish ship enters . Gibraltarian waters and refuses to leave after Royal Navy warnings we . should fire on them.’ The . long-standing dispute between Britain and Spain has flared up over the . past two years. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has blocked the . Spanish-Gibraltarian border and staged numerous incursions into . Gibraltarian waters. The . latest crisis occurred when a research vessel belonging to the Spanish . state, the RV Ramon Margalef, undertook significant surveying activity . in Gibraltar’s territorial waters. A . Royal Navy fast patrol boat was  dispatched to order it to leave. A . video that appeared on Sky News showed the Spanish survey ship being . flanked by small inflatable Navy boats. Scroll down for video . Royal Navy patrol boat HMS Sabre (pictured) intercepted a Spanish survey ship and asked it to leave British Gibraltar waters, but it refused. The Spanish ambassador has now been summoned to explain . An audio recording that was also broadcast starts with the captain of the Ramon Margalef saying: ‘We have the permission of the Spanish authorities.’ An officer in one of the British boats . replies: ‘You are in British Gibraltar territorial waters. I consider . you to be violating the United Nations Convention on  the Law of the . Sea, article one nine,  governing the rights of passage. Your activities . are being recorded and reported via the national authorities. ‘You are to cease your ongoing activities and to leave British Gibraltar territorial waters immediately. Acknowledge.’ The . captain of the Spanish boat then responds: ‘Good afternoon, sir. We are . carrying out our survey work. We will continue with our work. We have . got the necessary permits from Spain to perform such work. Thank you.’ The . boat withdrew only after Spanish ambassador Federico Trillo was . summoned by Matthew Rycroft, Acting Permanent Under Secretary at the . Foreign Office – the third time he has been summoned over Gibraltar . since the current Spanish government took office in December 2011. Tensions have been high in the region since the summer when Spain imposed border checks on every car causing up to six hours of delays . Europe Minister David Lidington said: ‘I strongly condemn this  provocative incursion and urge the Spanish government to ensure that it is not repeated. We stand ready to do whatever is required to protect Gibraltar’s sovereignty, economy and security.’ Mr Lidington said Spain has increased the number of its incursions into British territorial waters from around five per month to around 40 per month. The event comes two weeks after a Spanish boat made dangerous manoeuvres near Royal Navy  vessels in British waters, putting lives at risk and resulting in a minor collision. A Foreign Office source described relations with Spain as ‘well past the asking nicely stage’. But Conservatives expressed frustration that the Government has not taken a firmer line against Spanish provocation. David Cameron did not protest last week when the European Commission  refused to condemn Spain for blocking the Spanish-Gibraltar border over the summer. Colonel Stewart called for troops to be sent to the Rock: ‘I am afraid the Government has got to be stronger. ‘For goodness sake, can we get a stronger response to what’s happening to our people in Gibraltar? Why doesn’t the British Government make more use of the defence facilities in Gibraltar, by sending down more often an infantry company to be based in Gibraltar for perhaps six weeks at a time to exercise there, rather than sending it to somewhere  like Kenya.’ Foreign Office Minister Mark Simmonds responded: ‘We must strike a balance between being forceful, strong, determined to ensure the Spanish understand the UK Government’s position. ‘But we must also find mechanisms to de-escalate the situation, which is why we must get back to discussing solutions – without negotiating Gibraltarian sovereignty.’","Spain is not considered 'a friendly nation' say Gibraltar minister .

A lorry driver has been jailed after it was discovered he illegally claimed £32,000 in disability benefits. Philip Carter received the cash over a 12-year period while claiming he could barely walk, but undercover footage shows him carrying heavy steel. He said he had such crippling pain in his knees that it took him ten minutes to walk just 20 metres, and he needed help at all times when outdoors. The 66-year-old also claimed he had trouble getting in and out of bed and washing, needed help daily with shopping and taking the dog out, couldn’t bend down to put anything in the oven and was unable to get hold a knife to cut up his food. Exposed: Benefits cheat Philip Carter received more than £32,000 in disability handouts after claiming he could barely walk, yet had been secretly working for a steel firm . Surveillance: Investigators from the DWP secretly filmed Carter working at the firm, and saw him climbing on and off the back of a wagon and in and out of his cab without any problems . However, he was unmasked as a fraud after Department For Work and Pensions (DWP) investigators secretly filmed working at a steel firm in Rossendale, Lancashire, climbing on and off the back of a wagon and in and out of his cab without any problems. He was seen constantly bending down to pick things up and it took him less than 10 seconds to walk the length of his lorry. Inquiries revealed Carter - an HGV driver for 40 years - had passed a Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) medical every three years in order to keep his licence. Within months of making his claim for disability benefits, he was working 39 hours a week in a 'physical job' loading and unloading plates and rods, manually or with lifting equipment. His bosses at K Steels knew nothing of any disabilities. He had even managed to get himself a Motability car courtesy of the taxpayer. At Burnley Crown Court, Carter, from Bacup, hobbled into the dock using a walking stick and admitted dishonestly failing to notify a change of circumstances to the DWP, between April 2002 and April 2012. He was jailed for 24 weeks. Part of the DWP footage was shown to Judge Beverley Lunt who said: 'A picture paints a thousand words. You persisted in these lies for 12 years. That is a very, very significant period of time. Healthy: Carter - an HGV driver for 40 years - had passed a DVLA medical every three years in order to keep his licence . 'I accept you have had and do have health issues, but so do many people of this age and none of them actually entitled you to steal over £32,000 of taxpayers’ money. 'There are genuinely disabled people who need that money. It was just greed on your part.' The court was told Carter had been receiving Disability Living Allowance, including a high rate mobility allowance and a lower rate care allowance. After making his claim for benefits in September 2001, he had been assessed by the DWP as 'virtually unable to walk.' Prosecutor Richard Archer said when Carter made the DLA claim in 2001, he stated he had bad knees, could only walk 20 metres before he felt severe discomfort and that it took him 10 minutes to walk that far, if he clung to his wife and children. Spotted: Carter was seen constantly bending down to pick things up and it took him less than 10 seconds to walk the length of his lorry . Carter also claimed that he needed someone with him seven days a week when he was outdoors, had dizzy spells, would fall or stumble three or four times a week, had problems getting in and out of bed and with washing, getting dressed and undressed and couldn’t get hold of his food knife. His wife made a statement, indicating Carter got pains in his chest and legs when he walked and could not pick up his tablets. Mr Archer said: 'She said she had seen him change from an active man into a slow, tired man in the three years before the claim and he was now dependent on other people.' In April 2002, just months after Carter was assessed by the DWP, he secretly started work for the steel firm. The claim for DLA was kept under review and in May 2003, Carter completed a similar form, saying he could walk 10 to 15 metres before feeling severe discomfort, needed someone with him all the time outdoors, would fall or stumble, his asthma had got worse over the past five years and things took twice or three times as long as they used to. His wife also made a similar statement in support, saying he had was getting slower and had to be reminded to do things. In the dark: A fleet manager stated the he had never seen Carter stop to catch his breath, never seen any physical difficulties when he was working and had never seen him limp . Mr Archer said Carter did not report any improvement in his condition. Had he been honest about the true extent of his mobility and care needs, no benefit at all would have been paid to him. The prosecutor said at the start of 2012, the DWP started surveillance and Carter was caught on film delivering, unstrapping, uncovering and unloading steel repeatedly. Inquiries were made with K Steels and they told the DWP he had started working for them as a HGV driver on April 15, 2002, he was contracted to work 39 hours a week and they were not aware Carter had any disability or health condition when he started work. A fleet manager stated the he had never seen the defendant stop to catch his breath, never seen any physical difficulties when he was working and had never seen him limp, using walking aids or have any support when he was walking. Mr Archer said the defendant received more than £32,000 he was not entitled to. He was interviewed by the DWP and said he had used the higher rate mobility allowance to get a car because of his walking problems. He confirmed he didn’t have anybody with him at all times and claimed he didn’t use a walking stick at K Steels as it would have got in the way. The prosecutor added: 'He struggled to justify why he had made these disclosures. The defendant is now making repayments out of his retirement pension and £29,891.28 is outstanding.' Unaware: Bosses at K-Steels in Rossendale, Lancashire knew nothing of Carter's disabilities . Employed: In April 2002, just months after Carter was assessed by the DWP, he secretly started work for the steel firm . Philip Holden, mitigating, said Carter had very many health problems which had persisted throughout the time of the fraud, including osteoarthritis, asthma and sleep apnoea. 'There came a time when his condition improved to a degree,' said Mr Holden. 'He ought to have contacted the benefits agency.' Mr Holden said Carter had been a HGV driver for over 40 years and had been a hard working, industrious taxpayer. He told the court Carter was paying back the money at the same rate he had taken it, and that as Mrs Carter also had significant health problems the couple still received assistance from the state. Mr Holden continued: 'This is a man who will almost certainly never come before any court again. 'I take the view that to imprison a man with all his health problems will be very difficult for him and very difficult for the state.'","Philip Carter, 66, was secretly filmed working by DWP investigators .

City banking giants will rake in nearly £17million in fees from the flotation of Royal Mail, despite accusations yesterday of having failed the taxpayer. Six top bankers were grilled by MPs on the Business Select Committee over whether they set too low a share price for the sell-off in October. One senior Tory MP told them they had got it 'sizeably wrong.' Sell-off: Ministers have come under fire for the sharp rise in the share price of Royal Mail since the privatisation last month . Grilling: (From left to right) John Mayne, Managing Director, UK Client Coverage at JP Morgan; Ben Storey, Head of UK Investment Banking and Broking at Citibank; James Robertson, managing director at UBS; Richard Cormack, managing director, Co-Head of Equity Capital Markets at Goldman Sachs; Gert Zonneveld, managing director, Co-Head of Research at Panmure Gordon and James Agnew, chairman of UK Corporate Broking, Deutsche Bank . Brian Binley said: 'I just wonder . whether the taxpayer has the right to think that, for all the money you . are paid, you weren't very clever at your job.' However, around £12.7million has . already been paid in fees to the seven banks involved in the . privatisation. But MPs and unions said an extra 'discretionary' sum of . £4.2million, which is due to be paid within the next few months, should . be blocked. Banks, such as UBS and Goldman Sachs, . decided to price Royal Mail shares at £3.30 each, but they instantly . rocketed in value and have remained high ever since. Last night, the shares closed at . £5.50. The Government raised £1.7billion from the sale, but would have . raised £2.9billion if the shares had been sold at last night's closing . price. Mr Binley said to the bankers: 'I'm . hearing an awful lot of sales speak. I'm hearing an awful lot of stuff . from you to tell us how wonderful you are... and what great expertise . you have. 'You have all come together like you . are a professional body to defend each other. Can I as a taxpayer assume . that all of this is the cult of the high priest? 'Meant to be exclusive, meant to keep . other people out, meant to say that you are much better at your job than . you are, and you failed the taxpayer.' The six banks at yesterday's hearing . were UBS and Goldman Sachs, who advised the Government, and four banks, . JP Morgan, Citibank, Deutsche and Panmure Gordon, who did not. Last night, the Department for . Business said no decision has been made about the extra payment. It will . be made by Vince Cable, the Business Secretary but not for several . months. The sale was hugely popular with both . small shareholders and City investors. For example, City firms applied . for more than 20 times the number of shares which were available. UBS and Goldman Sachs bosses were challenged by MPs over their advice to sell Royal Mail shares at £3.30 . Advice: James Robertson, managing director at UBS, (left) and Richard Cormack, managing director, Co-Head of Equity Capital Markets at Goldman Sachs, defended their work for ministers . Mr Binley told the bankers: 'I was in the business of selling beer years and years ago. Anybody can sell cheap beer.' But Richard Cormack, managing director . of Goldman Sachs, one of the key banks involved in the sale, said: 'I . think, in the  context, this was a well-executed transaction.' It emerged yesterday that UBS had . considered increasing the price at which the shares would be offered . from £3.30 to £3.50 just days before the flotation. Tory MP Brian Binley (left) accused the company bosses, including Richard Cormack of Goldman Sachs (right)   of failing to get a good deal for the taxpayer . But it decided the move was too risky, and advised Mr Cable against such a move, advice which he accepted. On the first day of trading on Friday 11 October, the shares jumped instantly from £3.30 to £4.50. William Bain, a Labour MP on the . committee, asked the bankers whether they thought an extra £4.2million . would be appropriate given the poor deal for the taxpayers. He asked: 'Do you think that is a decision that taxpayers will be likely to accept with open arms?' James Robertson, managing director of . UBS, said: 'I think that is for the Secretary of State [Vince Cable] to . decide. It is in his gift.' After yesterday's  hearing, Billy . Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers' Union, which . represents postal workers, said: 'At the very least the institutions . which advised the Government should not receive any further payments, . which are discretionary.' At the hearing, the bankers tried to . lay the most blame for the low price of the shares on the CWU's threat . of industrial action at the time of the sale.","Shares sold by government at £3.30 now worth more than £5.60 .

Butterball apparently has a big mystery on its hands: The company says it doesn't know why some of its turkeys wouldn't plump up in time for Thanksgiving this year. CEO Rod Brenneman says it's the first time it has happened and that the company is investigating what went wrong. Butterball announced last week that it will have a limited supply of large, fresh turkeys that are 16 pounds or heavier for the holidays. 'No answer': Butterball, which produces fresh and frozen turkeys, says it has no clue why their turkeys are not gaining weight. The company produces one out of every five turkeys eaten on Thanksgiving . ‘It's a really good question. We . don't have an answer yet,’ Brenneman said when asked about the cause. But he noted that turkeys are ‘biological creatures’ subject to a . variety of factors. ‘For whatever reason, they just didn't gain quite as well this year,’ he said. Like . many other turkey producers, Butterball feeds its birds antibiotics to . prevent and treat illnesses, which can occur from living in cramped . quarters. The . use of antibiotics, which also promote growth in livestock, has been . the subject of concern that it could lead to antibiotic-resistant germs. Butterball, a . privately held company based in Garner, North Carolina, declined to say . whether it made any changes to its feed this year. But the problem seems . to have come up rather recently. For much of the year, Butterball produces turkeys that are frozen and stored until they're ready to be sold for the holidays. 'Mystery': Butterball says it is the first time its turkeys wouldn't plump up in time for Thanksgiving this year . Stocks cut in half: Supermarket chain Big Y said it had been notified by Butterball that orders for fresh Thanksgiving turkeys across the country were cut by 50 per cent . But then in October and November, it shifts into production for fresh turkeys. And that's when the company ran into problems with the turkeys not gaining enough weight, Brenneman said. Butterball declined to say whether the issue has been resolved or provide details on the extent of its shortage. But Big Y, a supermarket chain based in Springfield, Massachusetts, said it had been notified by the company that orders across the country were cut by 50 per cent. Mark Kastel, founder of The Cornucopia Institute, a Wisconsin-based group that advocates for organic farming, noted that major poultry producers tightly control production factors, making Butterball's shortage unusual. ‘I thought that was very mysterious. I could not think of a rational explanation,’ Kastel said, suggesting that a change in the feed formula may have been to blame. Butterball's shortage shouldn't be a problem for most, since fresh turkeys only account for about 15 per cent of sales, with frozen turkeys making up the rest. Butterball produces one out of every five turkeys eaten on Thanksgiving. Over at Cargill, spokesman Michael Martin says in an email that the company has never had a problem where its birds didn't put on enough weight to produce an adequate supply of large turkeys.","Company says it has limited supply of large, fresh turkeys that are 16 pounds or heavier for the holidays .

A team of Spanish and Portuguese researchers made alcohol that was 80-proof - the equivalent of 40 per cent alcohol -  making it the same strength as vodka and tequila. In a study, published in LWT – Food Science and Technology, they explained how they made the drink from ‘spent ground coffee’. Scientists have found a way of creating alcohol from used coffee grounds. The spirit is said to smell and taste of coffee but some tasters say it tastes 'bitter and pungent' The scientists say that the spirit is ‘pleasant’ and that it both smells and tastes of coffee, The Huffington Post reports. The creators used dried coffee grounds from a roasting company in Portugal to make the drink. They heated the coffee in water at 162.8ºC for 45 minutes. They then added sugar and yeast to the mixture before allowing it to ferment. This raised the alcohol content. However, in the process of making the drink alcoholic, most of the caffeine was removed. The alcohol is 80-proof, the equivalent of 40 per cent alcohol - this is the same as vodka and tequila . Once the drink was ready for consumption, the scientists employed eight trained testers to try it out. However, many said that it had a ‘bitter and pungent’ taste.

Katherine Gregory (pictured) stole £37,000 from a fund for a woman she was supposed to be caring for . A carer stole a £37,000 fund that was meant to fund a life-changing operation for a woman who cannot speak. Cerebral palsy victim Tania Crowie was hoping to speak for the first time in 37 years after saving enough cash for ground-breaking therapy in the U.S. But her carer Katherine Gregory, 31, was secretly draining her bank account to spend on luxuries - including a three-week holiday to the U.S. Gregory has now been jailed for two years after she was convicted of theft at Bristol Crown Court. After the case heartbroken Tania, 44, told of her 'hatred' for the carer and how her dream of speaking is now in tatters. In a hand-written note she said: 'I feel hatred for her. I am angry, very angry, because it could have given me a life. I want to work, I don’t want to sponge off the government all my life. 'I wanted to work with disadvantaged kids, kids for whom society has got no time, because I have got so much love in my heart to give. 'I have empathy and compassion, which in my view is lacking in this horrible world today. I wanted to change lives if I could, because I know what it feels like as I’ve been in that position all my life. 'I want to do things, I want to raise money by doing a parachute jump or a wing walk.' Tania, of Yate, Bristol, was left unable to speak at the age of seven as the debilitating condition took hold. Through inheritance and carefully managing her budget, she had saved £37,000 towards the £100,000 she needed for a course of life-changing speech therapy in America. She met Gregory in 2008 when she was an agency worker sent to care for her. The two women became close and Gregory suggested the advantages of online banking, but their professional relationship ended when Gregory moved to Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. In autumn 2010 Gregory got back in touch with Tania offering her services again as a carer, telling her she had set up her own agency. Tania welcomed her back and Gregory quickly raised the issue of online banking once more. She took her advice and agreed for Gregory and her husband to set up four accounts in her name. Tania Crowie was going to use the money towards a £100,000 fund for surgery that would give her the ability to speak . Within days of setting up the banking Gregory began to transfer large sums into her own account, taking a total of £37,500 over 14 months. The pair’s relationship ended around November 2011, but Gregory 'bombarded' Tania with texts and calls and continued to take her money. Tania eventually realised her money was being stolen and complained to police but Gregory tried to claim the cash was ‘a gift’. After the case, Tania wrote: 'What she did played with my mind, and I don’t think two years was enough. But it is court, so anything is better than nothing, I guess. 'It wasn’t just the 30-odd grand from my account, it was the stealing of my personal goods as well, which all adds up. 'It was the loads of money in old notes, and all that I bought her from Ideal World and QVC off the TV. She really did hurt me, big time.' A hearing to establish and confiscate Gregory’s proceeds of crime was set for March 28.","Tania Crowie lost her voice when she was seven due to her cerebral palsy .

The racist hazing of a Massachusetts high school football player prompted school officials on Monday to forfeit the remainder of their season, but now some locals are up in arms and demanding that the team should play on, while others have accused the victim’s family of being ‘trouble makers.’ At the center of the whole unpleasant affair is Isaac Phillips, 13, who is in the eighth grade and plays on the Lunenburg High School football team, who are nicknamed the Blue Knights. On Friday morning, he and his family awoke to find that someone had painted a racial slur - ‘Knights don’t need n******’ - on the side of their home. Isaac Phillips, 13, has been the victim of racist hazing which he and his family believe has been carried out by some of his teammates on the Lunenburg High School football team . ‘I don't really understand why someone would even do something like this,’ Phillips told WCVB-TV. ‘I have two younger brothers and another sister. This is our house, this is where we live. Eventually, they're going to see it.’ The teenager's mother is white and his father is half black. According to the boy’s parents, this isn’t the first instance of their son Phillips being a victim of hazing by some of his teammates, in the past his cleats have been thrown in the trash and the tires on his bicycle slashed. At a team meeting on Friday the players were given an opportunity to come forward with information about the graffiti incident, but chose not to. Isaac's parents, Anthony Phillips and Andrea Brazier, claim they are being treated as trouble makers because they have spoken out about their son being bullied . As a consequence Friday night’s match was postponed and on Monday, Lunenburg Public Schools Superintendent Loxi Jo Calmes announced that the remainder of the school's football season would be forfeited. That decision prompted an angry reaction from some locals including a former coach who launched a petition to get the remaining games reinstated, including the popular Thanksgiving game. ‘I was so angry - this is so unfair to a lot of those kids,’ Matthew Roderick told Telegram.com. On Monday night he set up a petition ‘Loxi Jo Calmes: Let Them Play!’ on change.org. ‘I grew up here and mentored a lot of those kids. The whole team shouldn't be punished with no facts. I was disgusted that innocent kids were being punished and the majority did not do anything.’ Unfortunately some locals have chosen to blame the Phillips family for Ms Calmes’ decision to cancel the rest of the football season. Isaac’s father Anthony Phillips, who owns a local construction company, has said he was listening to a local radio call-in about the incident when one of the callers blamed his family for causing all the problems. On Friday morning, Isaac Phillips and his family awoke to find that someone had painted a racial slur ¿ 'Knights don¿t need n******' - on the side of their home . ‘We did nothing wrong - it has been turned around like we did something wrong and we're the victims,’ he said. ‘We didn't want any of this stuff. I couldn't sleep last night because I felt awful. Everything happened so fast. We only expected a little bit of local attention after it happened. We're not vicious parents out to ruin the town. I'm hoping in the next few days someone steps forward.’ The graffiti, which is being investigated by the FBI as a hate crime, is just the latest accusation of racism that the team is facing. In two different games earlier this month, referees reported players using racial epithets against opposing players. In the weeks prior to the graffiti incident, Anthony Phillips said he spoke to the coaches about his son's treatment but they told him that they doubted any players were involved. He believes that if a senior playing on the team is responsible for the graffiti and the remaining games are reinstated then it sets a bad example. Isaac and his father attended a vigil on Monday night from townsfolk who wanted to show their support for them, but others have labelled the family trouble makers . ‘If he plays that game and it never comes out and he is not held accountable and goes off to college, an extreme bigot is released into society,’ he said. Anthony Phillips has said that the unfortunate incident means his son no longer wants to attend Lunenburg High because of the harassment. ‘He doesn't want to go to the school anymore. He's beyond upset about the whole situation,’ he said.Police issued a statement on Saturday saying the incident was under investigation by both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Worcester District Attorney’s Office. ‘As a community we offer our deepest support to the player and his family, and want to emphasize that Lunenburg is an inclusive, supportive community and this is not the sort of behavior we foster or tolerate. The nature of this crime has deeply impacted the team, the school and the entire community,’ the statement read.","Isaac Phillips, 13, and his family awoke on Friday to find racial slurs sprayed on their home .

The noses come in a beige colour as well as clear for those who enjoy the voyeuristic experience of nose picking and make a 'suction-pop noise' at the end of a session, Medical Daily reported. The four shapes include 'regular', 'wild nose', 'beauty nose' and 'idols nose' with one model including a 'rare secret' of fake nasal mucus for users to extract. It is not known why the company has chosen to roll out the bizarre product, but a previous scientific study has reported that the act as rhinotillexis (or nose picking) is good for humans.

Here a woman is shown 'wearing' the nose keyring in front of her own . Some researchers believe humans pick their noses several times a day but that the ingestion of nasal mucus could actually boost the immune system, which means a fake nose cannot replace the benefits. In a bid to unpick the health benefits of rhinotillexis, Professor Scott Napper asked pupils to eat their mucus after picking in a bid to understand the immune system. The Canadian academic believes eating mucous in the nose - which contains a cocktail of antiseptic enzymes - may boost the immune system by introducing small and harmless amounts of germs back into the body.

His theory follows others that suggest improved hygiene has led to an increase in allergies and auto-immune disorders. The associate professor of biochemistry at the University of Saskatchewan is a firm believer in the powers of picking your nose. He said: ‘Nature pushes us to do different things because it is to our advantage to have certain behaviours, to consume different types of foods.

Some researchers believe humans pick their noses several times a day but that the ingestion of nasal mucus could actually boost the immune system, which means a fake nose cannot replace the benefits . The immune system works by developing a 'memory' and making a note of how to fight each bug it has ever encountered. When a bug is encountered a second time, the immune system reaches into its 'memory' and releases weapons — called memory lymphocytes — that know how to kill it.","The hojirerun desu is sold in Japanese vending machines by Bandai .

The . boy- who has not been identified due to his age- wasn't in the . courtroom but his attorney objected to an assessment done on the boy, . prompting the second evaluation, the Star Tribune reported. Last . month, the court ordered individual and family therapy while the boy's . mother and father receive parenting training and evaluations. Both parents are allowed to visit and call their son. The boy's mother, who has legal custody, also is working with his school to have him assessed for special education services. Support: V.J. Smith, right, of anti-violence group MAD DADS sat next to the distraught father, left . Destination: Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, with the 'Strip' in the background. The nine-year-old flew here from Minneapolis without a ticket . 'She's done everything that has been asked of her,' said attorney Bob Paule, who represented the boy's mother. 'This has been a very difficult time for her with her son out of the home.' The next hearing will be December 20. The . boy's father previously spoke out when the story of his stowaway son . broke, saying that he had been pleading with officials to help him due . to his son's history of disruptive behavior. 'I've . been asking for help... Somebody please help me. Please,' the father . said, his shoulders shaking and his sobs clearly audible under his . hoodie. The man said authorities refused to help with the child's . behavioral problems because he was a minor. Troubled youth: It has emerged that the boy stole this truck and crashed it after a short police chase . String of dramas: The truck incident happened just two days before the boy boarded the flight to Las Vegas . The 9-year-old went to take out the . trash and when he didn't return, the father assumed he had gone to a . friend's house. 'I'm a parent. I'm not perfect,' he said. V.J. Smith of . anti-violence group MAD DADS sat next to the distraught father during . the emotionally charged briefing and read a statement from the boy's . mother. 'I love my son, I . miss my son. I want my son home,' the mother said in the statement. 'I . feel people are pushing me about what my son did.' Smith . went on to say that the mother 'realizes he's done some things that are . wrong but she doesn't want to see her son hurt and she has been asking . for help with her son but no one was willing to help.' Smith . said the latest incident - which has made international news headlines - . will see the child get the help he needs, adding that he and the . parents had already been in contact with their county's social services . programs.","The boy from Minneapolis boarded Delta flight to Las Vegas in October .

The disturbing moment a trooper shot a stunned deer in the head at point-blank range because it wouldn't move has been captured on camera.

Stand-off: Video shows the moment an allegedly injured deer appears to be frozen in the headlights of a Michigan State Trooper's squad car before he is shot dead for not moving . The most recent clip, posted on YouTube on Tuesday, shows a deer standing on a roadside, frozen in the headlights of a Michigan State Trooper's squad car. It is not clear when the incident occurred. The troopers attempted to scare off the gentle creaure, who they claimed was injured, by sounding the siren and flashing the lights. The cruiser then crawled forward and nudged the scared animal, which still didn't move. A man filming said: 'He ain't goin' nowhere dude.' Another man shouted: 'Want me to grab that [expletive] and drag it across the road?' A trooper then held a gun just inches from the deer's head and shot it. It is not clear if the deer died because its legs were visibly shaking. 'Man down,' said a voice behind the camera, after making the noise of a tree falling. 'That's better than huntin'.' MSP spokesperson Lt. Mike Shaw defended the officers, saying it did not appear their actions were unlawful. However, he told Fox 2 the incident was being investigated. He said the deer was injured and could have darted out into the roadway, causing a traffic accident. Michigan State Police are also investigating a separate incident in which footage of  Grosse Pointe Park police belittling African Americans was released. The clips seem to show an African American, mentally-disabled man being provoked to sing like a chimp. The videos were allegedly recorded by at least one police officer.

'And to then release it on 3D printed vinyl – that’s just brilliant! 'I’m so glad that Kele has chosen to work with me; it’s increasingly difficult to break through in this industry and it’s great to have that opportunity.' The bespoke 3D printing has been developed by technologist Amanda Ghassaei who came up with a programme for converting digital audio files into 3D-printable records. She said: 'I designed this project as a way to explore the limits of these 3D printers. 'They can print a highly complex fractal in the same amount of time as it would take to print a solid cube.

Every year on Strictly Come Dancing, the stars taking part reveal how they dropped pounds thanks to rehearsing and performing and they leave the show the fittest they've ever been. Now Strictly professional dancers Natalie Lowe and Ian Waite, along with former contestant Mark Foster, want to help the show-loving public get the same results by launching a dance workout called FitSteps. The 45 minute class is similar to Zumba - so you don't need a partner - and it includes moves from Latin and ballroom dances. Scroll down for video . Workout: Former Strictly contestant Mark Foster, left, and professional dancers Natalie Lowe and Ian Waite want to get the nation fit one step at a time . No need for a partner: Natalie leads a class demonstrating the dance moves for participants to follow . It provides an all-body workout with energetic moves from the Jive, Cha Cha and Samba included to raise the heart . rate. Meanwhile, a range of slower movements and postures from the . Waltz and the Rumba use muscular strength to tone the torso, arms . and legs. Natalie, 33, told the MailOnline: 'It's an intense workout but because you're concentrating on learning the steps and having fun dancing, you don't notice how hard you're working.' She added: 'What's also exciting about it is . you're learning a skill as we teach the basic foundation of ballroom and Latin American dancing. You don't even need to try and convince . your reluctant partner to join you, as you'll be working out alongside a . whole class of like-minded people. You'll get fit, boost your . confidence, make friends and have a great time doing so.' Join in: The classes are operating at 700 venues around the country . Natalie has been dancing since she was three-years-old and she said the classes are suitable for adults of all ages (they're working on launching a separate FitSteps class for children). She said participants can burn up to 600 calories a session and those already taking part in the classes around the country have been seeing the results. Nesta Lopez, who attends classes in Dagenham, Essex, said: 'It's the best thing I've done in years. The support, the atmosphere, drive and fun keep me coming back. The first time I tried it I thought to myself, ""this is something I will never get right"", but class after class, the steps got easier and more achievable. 'I'm enjoying myself and best of all my body is getting firmer. so I've said ""goodbye love handles"" and my bum is lifted like never before. I am feeling much more confident in my own skin.' Many celebrities who have taken part in the BBC show also attest that they've slimmed down thanks to dancing. Convert: Olympic swimmer Mark, right, said he loved learning to dance and lost weight when he appeared on Strictly. He joined forces with Ian and Natalie to help other people have the experience he enjoyed . The Strictly effect: This year's contestant Susanna Reid, left, has already lost 7lb, while John Sergeant dropped two stone when he took part in 2008 . One contestant this year, Susanna Reid, has admitted she's lost 7Ib so far and in previous series, actor Ricky Groves and presenter John Sergeant shed more than two stone each. And it's not just their waistlines that benefit from taking part, many of them also come away with a newfound love of dancing thanks to being taught by a professional. It's something Olympic swimmer Mark Foster experienced after his appearance on the show in 2008. 'I had a great time when I was on the . show but when I realised how . much weight I'd lost, I wanted to explore the concept of getting fit . through stepping,' he said. 'After speaking to some professional fitness colleagues and then . reaching out to Natalie, it turned out that Ian had already been . working on a similar concept, so after much discussion and development . we joined forces and FitSteps was born.' Ian added: 'The great thing about FitSteps is that . it’s varied. Because of the differences in techniques and . tempo of the dances, the postures are grouped together to create . different effects on the body and achieve the results you want. There's . absolutely no way you’ll have as much fun pounding the treadmill as you . will learning to Jive.' Dance into shape: Up to 600 calories can be burnt per class as moves from Latin and ballroom routines are learnt . Natalie said the classes teach the same basic dance moves that the celebrities learn when they first sign up for Strictly. It's only when they've started to master these that their professional partner will teach them the choreographed routines. The Australian dancer - whose biggest success on Strictly came when she reached the final with Hollyoaks actor Ricky Whittle in 2009 - said it's rewarding to be able to reach so many people through FitSteps. She explained: 'I love dancing, it's good for the heart, the soul and the mind. Dancing is in my blood and I love teaching the celebrities I've worked with on Strictly. But you are only teaching one person. These classes allow us to reach thousands of people and help them get fit while having fun.' FitSteps classes are being run in 700 locations around the country in gyms and community centres as well as at Champneys health spas and . Rosemary Conley Clubs. But of course Natalie, Ian and Mark can't teach all the classes themselves so 1,200 licenced instructors have been trained in order to deliver the workout. Missing the show: Natalie Lowe on last year's Strictly with cricketer Michael Vaughan. She's had to sit out this year as she recovers from a foot injury . Looking head, Natalie said they plan to launch the children's classes as well as aqua FitSteps (the workout in water) and 'golden era' FitSteps - a class at a slower pace focusing on ballroom dancing to music from the 30s and 40s. Natalie has been unable to take part in this year's Strictly after suffering from a foot injury and so has been a keen - if not a little jealous - viewer instead. She said: 'I'm gutted I couldn't take part in this year's series after getting two stress fractures in my foot. I've been resting and recovering so there's a chance I might be able to take part in the group numbers towards the end of the series. But I will have to see how I am, I want to make sure I'm recovered so I'm definitely back next year.' When it comes to who'll make the final this year, she thinks it's too close to call. 'The competition is heating up,' she exclaimed. 'The girls like Abbey and Susanna have been great from the start but now the boys are upping the ante as Patrick and Ashley are improving every week. I couldn't pick a winner.' To find a FitSteps class near you, visit www.fitsteps.co.uk .","Natalie Lowe and Ian Waite have launched FitSteps with Mark Foster .

It's the start of a $671 million space mission that will take almost two years to complete - but the results are expected to show how Mars, the planet most like earth in the solar system, lost all its water. The latest in NASA's Mars probes, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission - MAVEN - officially kicked off this morning as an unnamed Atlas 5 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The first phase, which will take 10 months, is for MAVEN - a satellite tucked inside the rocket under protective layers - to reach the Mars orbit in space. Once there, MAVEN will fire off its braking rocket and be launched into orbit around Mars, allowing it to dip down and get as close to the planet as 65 miles from the ground in order to gather air samples for analysis. It will monitor Mars for one year. Scroll down for video . Launch mission: An Atlas 5 rocket lifts off from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station carrying NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft in Cape Canaveral, Florida on November 18, 2013 . Ready: The rocket preapres to launch for Mars. MAVEN is the first spacecraft devoted to exploring and understanding the planet's Martian upper atmosphere . This November 18, 2013 video image provided by NASA TV shows the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with NASAs Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft onboard at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station . She's off: The unmanned rocket blasts off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Monday, sending a Mars orbiter on its way to study how the planet most like Earth in the solar system lost its water . But unlike previous Mars probes, MAVEN will not land. Instead it will scan the remains of the dusty, thin atmosphere and watch in real-time how it is peeled away by killer solar radiation. At its highest point, MAVEN will be about 3,728 miles from the surface of Mars, a vantage point for measuring how much and what types of radiation are sweeping past the planet from the sun and cosmic sources. The point of the project is to determine how much of the atmosphere is being lost to space today and extrapolate back in time to figure out what was happening in Mars' past. In the 49 years since NASA's Mariner 4 spacecraft flew by Mars for the first time, an increasingly more sophisticated series of orbiters, landers and rovers have amassed solid evidence that the fourth planet from the sun was once much more like Earth, with oceans, rivers, rain and snow. 'We see a lot of evidence for liquid water having flowed over the surface in ancient times,' said lead scientist Bruce Jakosky from the University of Colorado. The plan: This artists impression, devised by ABC Action News, shows what NASA have planned for MAVEN to do once it reaches Mars (pictured) and breaks away from its rocket shell. It will orbit the planet for one year . MAVEN (center right) is fitted inside the spaceship before take off . 'We see river channels, features that look like there have been lakes inside of impact craters. 'We see minerals that form only in the presence of liquid water. 'All of these suggest that there has been water on the planet early in time and today of course we see a cold, dry, desert-like planet.' Figuring out what happened to Mars' climate hinges on learning what happened to the planet's water and the once-thick atmosphere needed to keep Mars warm enough for surface water. The information is also expected to help scientists home in on when in Mars' history it may have been most suitable for life to evolve. NASA's ongoing Curiosity rover mission is scouting for potential habitats that could have supported microbial life. 'Water is a requirement for life and if we understand where the water has been and why it's not there anymore we can learn more about what the history of the potential for life has been,' Jakosky said. There are two options for where the planet's missing water and atmosphere went: down into the ground or up into space. Scientists know some of the planet's carbon dioxide ended up on the surface and joined with minerals in the crust. Unique: Unlike previous Mars probes, MAVEN will not land on the barren planet, but take samples and analysis from above . Fire up: MAVEN, is the first spacecraft devoted to exploring and understanding the Martian upper atmosphere . But so far, the ground inventory is not large enough to account for the early, thick atmosphere Mars would have needed to support water on its surface. MAVEN is designed to explore the other option, that the water and atmosphere were lost into space, a process that began about 4 billion years ago when the planet's protective magnetic field mysteriously turned off. 'The sun, the solar wind can drive processes that remove gas from the top of the atmosphere,' Jakosky said. 'We want to understand whether the sun was able to remove gas from the top of the atmosphere and how much.' MAVEN is due to reach Mars on September 22, 2014 - two days before India's Mars Orbiter Mission, which launched on November 5. India's probe has been raising its orbit around Earth and should be in position on December 1 to begin the journey to Mars.","Phase one of the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission - MAVEN - was launched Monday at Cape Canaveral in Florida .

More than 850 Britons are currently locked up in overseas prisons for drug-related offences and face potential jail sentences of up to 39 years or the death penalty. Offences that may carry cautions in the UK are often punished with long prison sentences overseas - and travellers don't realise it. Drugs crimes often carry the most severe sentences, and in 33 countries around the world they carry the death penalty. Foreign drug penalties: Michaella Connolly and Melissa Reid are facing a long spell behind bars in Peru after admitting smuggling £1.5million worth of cocaine . Drug mules Michaella Connolly and Melissa Reid are facing a lengthy spell behind bars in Peru after admitting trying to smuggle £1.5million worth of cocaine out of the country. Grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, 57, is facing the death sentence in Bali after being found guilty of smuggling cocaine. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the charity Prisoners Abroad are launching a campaign to show the consequences of drug use and smuggling around the world. Facing the death penalty: Lindsay Saniford, 57, a British grandmother who is being held in a prison cell in Bali . Thailand - Possession of even very small quantities of drugs can lead to imprisonment. If you are found guilty of being in possession of a small quantity of marijuana you are risking a prison sentence and a heavy fine. If you are found guilty of being in possession of in excess of 20 grams of a Class A drug you would be deemed as a trafficker and could potentially be sentenced to death. United Arab Emirates - Sentences for drug trafficking for possession of even the smallest amount of illegal drugs can lead to a minimum four-year jail sentence. The Emirati authorities count the presence of drugs in the blood stream as possession. Peru - More than 30 British nationals are currently in prison in Peru for drugs offences. Drug smugglers face long terms of imprisonment. Indonesia - Possession, trafficking and manufacture of any illegal drugs are serious offences in Indonesia. The Indonesian authorities have a zero-tolerance policy and those caught face lengthy prison sentences or the death penalty, usually after a protracted and expensive legal process. The FCO said the zero-tolerance . approach of some countries often results in strict penalties which can . come as a shock to British travellers. Prisoners Abroad is currently supporting 80 Britons between the ages of 18 and 30 held in foreign countries for drugs offences. Two thirds of these are still awaiting trial while others are serving sentences from a year to nearly 39 years. Consular affairs minister Mark Simmonds said: 'People continue to be astonished at some of the penalties handed down for certain crimes overseas. In some countries possessing small amounts of marijuana can lead to decades in prison. 'In the last year alone consular staff handled over 650 drug-related cases. We want to reduce this number significantly.' He went on: 'Laws, penalties and sentences vary considerably around the world for the use, possession and trafficking of all types of drugs. When it comes to drugs our message is clear - don't take risks, the consequences are simply not worth it.' Prisoners Abroad chief executive Pauline Crowe said: 'In many countries, men and women find themselves without access to food, clean water and the most basic of medical care. 'We urge people to consider the unsanitary conditions, overcrowded cells and the constant threat of disease before they get involved in drugs. They may have to live through these conditions for many, many years.'","British citizens facing up to 39 years behind bars for drugs offences .

An incredibly rare camera discovered 12 years ago on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow is expected to sell for a world record price of more than £1.7million . The only surviving model of a Leica Luxus II camera is gold-plated and encased in lizard skin and was one of just four special edition versions made in 1932. The camera has the serial number 88840 and comes with a 50mm Elmar lens, which features a bell-push release. One of a kind: The incredibly rare Leica Luxis II gold-plated camera without its case . The model is now thought to be the rarest camera in existance as the whereabouts of the other three is unknown. It is also being sold with an original crocodile camera case, the first time one has ever come to light. The Luxus II was gifted to a British enthusiast after World War Two, used avidly for several decades and then put away somewhere until the owner took it to Antiques Roadshow for a look-see in 2001. Marc Allum, antiques expert and a presenter on the show, said it has the potential to be the 'most valuable find ever'. The camera is being sold with an original crocodile camera case, the first time one has ever come to light . 'It was a strange experience at the . time,' Antiques Roadshow presenter Mr Allum told the Telegraph. 'It was . put in front of me and I looked at it in complete disbelief. 'I never expected to see a camera like that.' Despite having an estimate of £800,000, . it is thought that the camera could fetch a seven figure sum after a . Leica 0 series sold for almost £2million last year. Antiques expert Marc Allum (pictured) discovered the camera during an episode of Antiques Roadshow . Leica, formerly known as Ernst Leitz GmbH, made their first camera in 1913 which were designed for landscape photography. The . brand went on to become one of the most iconic camera manufacturers . because of their small, compact models in contrast to the large versions . available at the time. Jon Baddely, camera specialist at . auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Leica is a legendary name among cameras and . has always had a reputation for cutting edge technology. 'It looked modern and its appeal was . based very much on its portability and the fact that such a compact . camera could produce negatives that could be enlarged. 'This was in contrast to large formula box camera which were unwieldy by comparison. 'By the early 1930s it was firmly established as the camera of choice for photographers and the press and was a key factor in the development of photojournalism.' Andrew Currie, a spokesperson from Bonhams, said: 'There were 52,000 models made of the ordinary Leica IIs, but there were only ever four made of these Luxus Leica IIs. 'It was a luxury version of the ordinary camera, and the whereabouts of the other three is unknown so this is extremely rare. 'There may have only been such a small number made as a way of making it seem more desirable by the company, or they could have been made to order. 'Every time Leica introduced a new model it was an improvement on the one before so the features on the Leica II were an advance on the Leica I. 'I think the key point about the Luxus versions is that they were gold plated and the body work was encased in lizard leather. 'I also believe this is the first time the crocodile Leica case has come to light.' The camera will go up for sale at Bonhams in Hong Kong on November 22.","The Luxus II was one of just four special edition versions made in 1932 .

For oil workers confined to a boat for weeks at a time, it can be hard to fill the long hours spent far away from friends and family. But one creative contractor put his free time to good use - marshalling all his colleagues together to create this epic karaoke video. The hilarious clip features dozens of workers miming along to the 1980s hit Africa, by Toto, with the ship's equipment standing in for musical instruments. Hilarious: A group of oil workers have teamed up to create a karaoke video to the tune of Africa by Toto . Creative: The 'musicians' used objects found on board such as barrels to stand in for musical instruments . Jokey: Percussion instruments used in the YouTube clip included metal fixtures on the ship . The video was the brainchild of Darren Flynn, a British remote-vehicle pilot based on board the Bourbon Peridot in Equatorial Guinea. He frequently films everyday life on the boat to give his friends and family an idea of how he spends his time at work - but recently decided to take on a more ambitious project. The 33-year-old and his co-workers from Subsea 7, a marine services firm, decided to make a music video set to the song Africa, in homage to the continent where they work. 'A couple of other guys on the boat thought it was good so they also wanted in,' Mr Flynn told MailOnline. 'As the thing progress, more and more people wanted in, from the captain to the company representative - the rest is history!' Epic: The video took four weeks to make, with the workers getting together in their time off . Thrifty: A row of spanners was used to fill in for the xylophone section of the 1982 hit . The finished video opens with the song's African-influenced intro, which is mimed by workers with oil canisters standing in for drums, spanners for the xylophone and bottles of bug spray for the synthesizer. Once the vocals come in, the camera takes a tour of the vessel, with each line 'sung' by a different person on board. Mr Flynn and his colleagues filmed one scene a day over a four-week period - although some took rather longer than others to complete. 'I had to do the scenes a few times and edit out a lot of rubbish,' he said. 'Clearly none of us are actual actors! Hard at work: But director Darren Flynn, 33, spent two hours a day editing the video . Surreal: One worker was enlisted to provide backing vocals via a ghostly cut-in . Tasty: When the action moves to the kitchen, a chef improvises by banging on a fish with his sharp knives . 'Some of the guys were getting slagged off for taking so many attempts to get it right, but others managed in a couple. 'Two of the guys had bragging rights for a couple of weeks, because they got it spot-on in their very first take.' After every day of filming, Mr Flynn spent a couple of hours editing the footage to get it to near-professional quality. While tough naval workers may not seem like natural fans of musical performance, many of the 'actors' enjoyed the experience so much they are badgering the director to make another video. Protection: Workers were sure to stay safe even while having fun making the karaoke video . Top of the world: This scene was filmed in the cabin of a crane high above the deck of the ship . At sea: The clip was filmed on board the Bourbon Peridot, a multi-purpose service ship . 'Everyone was keen to get involved and the ideas were always flying around the rec rooms in the evenings,' Mr Flynn said. 'Everyone on the boat has been humming the tune for the last month too.' Mr Flynn lives in London but spends four out of every eight weeks on board the Bourbon Peridot piloting remotely operated underwater vehicles and supervising other workers. He says he has always been keen on filmmaking, and enjoys capturing videos of his friends while snowboarding or attending festivals.","British oil worker makes karaoke video with his colleagues on board ship .

Though it has been standing empty for years, an eerie presence of days gone by lurks the halls of this derelict care home. Stacks of filthy mattresses, discarded wheelchairs and old bikes are just some of the reminders of those who once roamed the now silenced corridors. The south Derbyshire building and its haunting contents were captured by urban explorer photographer, Toby Batchelor, who considers the images a reflection of hard times ahead. Souvenirs of the past: Bowling pins and buckets of paint are among the many signs of life that haunt the derelict care home in south Derbyshire . Plastic canisters of petrol and fuel stand untouched alongside paint buckets on a rickety shelving unit in the building . Rusty bedside commodes and rotting pipes are a reminder of the frail and needy who would once have received care in the now forgotten building . 'These photographs capture the effects of budget cuts, over population and a struggling system. 'The building was once a facility to care for the elderly, which has now been left to rot until someone steps in and buys the property.' The 34-year-old, whose fascination with forgotten buildings led him to pursue urban exploration, said: 'I am always so intrigued at what gets left behind. 'It's fascinating to think about what it would have once looked like.' Peeling and chipped walls still bear warnings of health and safety, though an emergency fire alarm is blackened by rot and mould . Dust ridden mattresses are stacked high beside old-fashioned metal headboards while a dated appliance lies rusting among others in a room perhaps once used as a laundry . Dirtied chairs and discarded bedding are tossed beneath rusted window frames. The number of stacked cushions pose a reminder of the many elderly who may have sat in the now squalid room . Mr Batcelor who has also captured a forgotten country cottage, added: 'I think it's sad how buildings like this get knocked down and are remoulded to suit a different purpose. 'I was shocked by the fact that this old people's home is empty when I'm sure there are plenty of people who need this sort of care. 'It seems such a shame that all the old wheel chairs and kitchen equipment are lying there unused. A dusty and broken radio with frayed wires is dumped in rooms it would once have filled with music . Discarded bicycles with baskets and satchels attached are some of the items within the home photographer Toby Batchelor feels are going to waste . Leaky ceilings and paint-chipped brick walls form a the many corridors once filled with nurses tasked with providing comfort and care to those who lived there . 'It's very interesting to me to see what's left behind; I can imagine it would have been a lovely home in its day.' In a bid to preserve its historic condition, the photographer wasn't inclined to reveal the building's exact location. His somber photographs are featured on picture sharing website, Flickr. His other works include profiles of abandoned hospitals and schools, some of which are due to face demolition. Urban exploration is a hobby revolving around the exploration of man-made structures. Abandoned buildings and city ruins are popular focus points, with photography, documentation and film-making playing a significant part in the interest too. Often involving trespassing and imposing on privacy, urban exploration does pose the risk of arrest as well as one of physical harm. There are six acknowledged 'targets' for urban exploration: . 1. Abandonments . These are the sites most frequently visited by urban explorers and include abandoned buildings or derelict sites such as the care home photographed above. 2. Active buildings . The exploration of in-use or 'active' buildings is another principle of the hobby, though this poses more risk of arrest if the buildings are private. Exploration of active buildings is also referred to as infiltration. 3. Catacombs . Catacombs such as those found in Paris, Rome, Odessa and Naples have been investigated by enthusiasts who call themselves Catapahiles. The Mines of Paris, comprising much of the underground tunnels that are not open to public tourism like the catacombs, have been considered the 'Holy Grail' by some due to their extensive nature and history. 4. Sewers and storm drains . Entry into storm drains or 'draining' is an increasingly popular branch of urban exploration, with devoted groups forming across the world. Poor weather conditions prevent the activity though, as heavy rainfall could trap explorers in drains causing them to drown. 5. Railway tunnels . Exploring active and abandoned subway and underground railway tunnels, bores and stations is often considered to be trespassing and can therefore result in arrest. As a result this type of exploration is rarely publicised. 6. Utility tunnels . Steam and utility tunnels in hospitals, universities and large buildings used to carry superheated steam are a favourite of some. Though a considerably more dangerous branch of urban exploration, exploring steam tunnels has been made safer in recent years due to high levels concern for health and safety in institutional buildings.","Wheelchairs, bicycles, beds and bowling pins among signs of life scattered throughout now ruined building .

An 11-year-old boy found chained to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck is no 'sweet innocent kid' and likely harmed the bird to provoke the bizarre punishment, his foster brother said today. The 20-year-old, who didn't want to be named, said his adopted parents Wanda Larson and Dorian Harper provided a 'loving and caring home' but the boy has severe psychological issues, including a history of being cruel to animals. He said his parents' punishment, though he didn't condone it, was a last ditch attempt to control the child's behavior and protect the rest of the household. Scroll down for video . Loving home: The 20-year-old son of Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper said on Tuesday that his parents provided a 'loving and caring home,' pictured . 'Everyone says this is some sweet innocent kid when in actuality, he is not. He has been to counseling, he is on numerous heavy medications, but nothing has worked,' the brother told KHOU. Harper, an emergency room nurse, . and Wanda Larson, a social worker, have been charged with . intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment . and animal cruelty. The couple have been jailed and, at a brief court appearance Monday, their bond was set at $500,000 each. The brother said he believes the chicken around the neck was supposed to 'shame the child.' 'There has to be something going on, between that child and that chicken,' he said. 'He either, one, didn't feed it and it died, or two, either he was out there harassing the chicken. He may have killed the chicken. This child has been known to be cruel to animals.' He said the controversial discipline was his father's doing, as his mother, who would have put a stop to it, wasn't home at the time. The brother explained the 11-year-old, who had lived at the home since he was six, was a problem child who was underweight because of a health problem, not because he was being mistreated. 'He would sneak out into the garage take raw meat out of the freezer, let it thaw overnight and next day go out there and eat it raw,' the man, who moved out of the home two years ago, when he turned 18, told KHOU. 'He has severe psychological issues.' Charged: Wanda Sue Larson was arrested and charged Friday after a sheriff happened to stumble across the boy on the porch . 'He was not allowed to carry his own lunch box because would eat what food is in his lunch and then, throw the lunch box away and say he didn't have lunch for the day.' Union County Sheriff deputies plan to interview the other four children to get a clearer view of their living environment. But the brother insisted his parents cared for the children, all of whom are adopted except for the 11-year-old. 'Everyone assumed all five children in the home have been abused, that is not accurate. You ask all four of the children, they will say they lived in a loving and caring home,' he said. The account contradicts claims from the 11-year-old's relatives who say they have tried for years to get DSS to look into the allegations of abuse. Union County Sheriff Animal Services were at the house early this week gathering the property's remaining animals, including an estimated 75 fowl (chicken, ducks, guineas and peacock) three horses, three donkeys, two llamas, eight dogs and a hog. The news comes after it was revealed the boy was routinely handcuffed to a piece of steel inside the farm house in Union Country by his foster parents, who were preventing him from running away. Police in North Carolina have released more information on the shocking case - including how the smell of the feces-covered house would 'take your breath away' - as neighbors come forward describing how the boy would beg them for food and, at one point, was 'purple with cold' and 'looked pitiful'. Alleged abuse: Dorian Lee Harper, pictured, was also arrested and charged with numerous offenses of abuse . Steve Mills lives on land adjacent to . that of the child's foster parents. The pair also have four adopted . children aged from eight to 14. All five have been placed in care . outside Union County because Larson is a child protective services . supervisor for that county's Department of Social Services. She has received extra charges of willful failure to discharge her duty. Neighbor . Mr Mills said in late July or early August a boy came running to his . home 'crying and panicking and said ''Mister, can I have something to . eat?''' As Mr Mills' wife went to fix a sandwich, the other boys arrived. 'They told me he was the newest one (and) said they were going to take him back,' Mr Mills told Charlotte Observer. This boy 'was real small'. 'He . looked the smallest one out of the bunch. ... We just assumed he was . kind of scared, (being in a) new house, new area, new siblings,' said Mr . Mills. Joyce Bigham, who . lives across the street, told ABC News the five children 'dress like . orphans' and that the 11-year-old boy 'looked pitiful'. Another . neighbor, who asked not to be named, said a boy appeared on her porch . in May 2012 'purple with cold, with no coat, saying he was hungry'. 'When asked, he said he had no mother or father and didn't know where he lived,' she said. The woman brought him inside and fed him a sandwich. Dead: This lifeless chicken was found around the neck of the foster child who was handcuffed to the porch of his home in Union County, North Carolia, on Friday . 'It didn’t take him 10 seconds to eat it,' she said. He . told her he was 10-years-old and that he had slept in her barn, behind . her house, the night before. When she told him she would take him home, . she said, he answered: 'No. I want to stay here.' Her . daughter called 911 and a sheriff's deputy came out, spoke with the . boy, made a phone call, then told him she'd take him home. 'He didn't refuse. He just went with her.' The . neighbor said the deputy let her know she had returned him to his . foster parents and said the man insisted the boy hadn't been missing . more than 30 minutes. The neighbor believes it was the Harper-Larson home. 'I know that’s where she took him (although) you can’t see the house from the road.' Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said said the condition of the house was 'terrible'. 'It was filthy, feces on the floor, holes in the wall,'  he said. 'The . bathroom, you could see from outside of the hall into the bathroom. Sink was trashed. No running water. The smell took your breath away.' All . the children appeared to be suffering from malnutrition and Cathey said . that the first thing law enforcement did for them was buy them pizza. Squalor: Authorities have described the Union City house as 'terrible', covered in feces, urine and garbage, and something 'you wouldn't want to walk through, much less live in' Disturbing: Larson, a child services worker, lives at this property with four adopted children and the 11-year-old who was the only foster child . Authorities . stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was . responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, . saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to the porch. He . approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for . Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was . handcuffed to the porch. According . to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several . large dogs who attacked the deputy. By the time he had the dogs under . control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead . chicken on a barrel in front of the house. Other . officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal . investigation was opened. 'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday. 'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.' It is unclear what prompted the use of the dead chicken and handcuffs on the boy. Whitaker said he could not disclose details from police interviews conducted as part of the investigation.","Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper have been charged with multiple counts of intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment and animal cruelty .

Rotting food, no working toilet and feces splattered all over the walls - those were some of the deplorable conditions inside of the Tennessee home of a woman accused of killing her two young children by locking them in the back seat of a car on a hot day in August of 2012, as she went and took a nap, according to a recently released report. When authorities found the bodies of the two children - 2-year-old Daniel and 3-year-old Savannah Marise - the thermometers used to measure their body temperatures maxed out at 107 degrees. Additionally, the report states, 25-year-old Samantha Harper knew the car in which she locked the children didn't even work, which has investigators doubting her claim that the children's death was just a tragic accident. Monster: Samantha Harper had her children living in filth before allegedly killing them by leaving them locked in a hot car . Tragedy: Harper's daughter, Savannah, 3, cooked to death after she was left in the back of a hot car with her brother, Daniel, 2 . Filth: Crime scene photos show piles of filth strewn about Samantha Harper's home . Harper has since been been charged with two counts each of murder and aggravated child abuse in the August, 2012 deaths of her two children. She awaits a five-day trial expected to take place in February. The Tennessee Department of Child Services recently released thousands of pages of child death records, including 44 pages about the deaths of the Marise children. The names of children were redacted from the reports, but the Tennessean was able to independently confirm the pages related to the deaths of the Marise children. The records paint a grisly picture of life for the children in their mother's home, which was later condemned due to its dreadful condition. 'The children did not have beds and the walls in the room had food and . feces smeared and splattered on them,' records state. 'When the children . were found deceased they were found to have cuts on their hands and . they were filthy.' Gross: Authorities say Harper's home was without a working toilet . Neglect: Amongst the mounds of filth, authorities found piles of soiled diapers inside the home . Records and photographs of the home taken after the deaths of the two children show mounds of garbage, rotting food, fast food bags, piles of soda cans, used diapers and cigarette burns on the walls and floors. Additionally, investigators discovered that the home had no working toilet. But the investigation into the deaths wasn't the first time authorities paid a visit to Harper's house of filth - in both October of 2010 and October of 2011, DCS sent child neglect investigators to the home to follow up on allegations of environmental neglect and lack of supervision after neighbors found the children wandering around outside as Harper was sleeping. In each case DCS investigators determined that there were 'no services needed.' On the day of the alleged murders, paramedics rushed to Harper's home after she called 9-1-1 from a neighbors house to report that she found the children unresponsive in the car. Stars and bars: Investigators say they found feces smeared all over the walls in Harper's home . Yuck: Rotting food was amongst the many filthy attributes found in Harper's decaying home . Dropped the ball: CPS officials were called to Harper's home at least twice but took no action in either case . Temperatures outside were about 99 degrees the day the children were locked into their car seats in the back of Harper's inoperable vehicle, and investigators estimate that the temperature inside the car was upwards of 140 degrees. Initially, Harper told police that she strapped the children into their car seats and then went inside and fell asleep. But Harper's story repeatedly changed - after first admitting to putting the kids in the car, Harper later told police 'she does remember putting them in the car.' Additionally, a relative of Harper's told authorities that the car didn't work and that she 'never drove it.'

Doctors believe paracetamol is the best treatment to keep on top of coughs, colds and sore throats. New research suggests paracetamol - contained in many over the counter remedies - is superior to ibuprofen, or a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen. The widely used practice of inhaling steam to ease symptoms also offers little comfort to sufferers, according to researchers from the University of Southampton. Bless you: New research suggests paracetamol is superior to ibuprofen, or a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen when it comes to keeping on top of colds . In addition, one in 50 people ends up with mild scalding to add to their woes. Professor Paul Little, who led the study, said 'Paracetamol, ibuprofen or a combination of both are the most common courses of treatment for respiratory tract infections. 'Clinicians should probably not advise patients to use steam inhalation in daily practice as it does not provide symptomatic benefit for acute respiratory infections and a few individuals are likely to experience mild thermal injury. Similarly, routinely advising ibuprofen or ibuprofen and paracetamol together than just paracetamol is also not likely to be effective. 'However our research has shown that ibuprofen is likely to help children, and those with chest infections.' The randomised control trial recruited 899 patients who went to their GP with respiratory tract infection symptoms such as sore throat, runny nose and a cough. They received different treatment types; paracetamol, ibuprofen or a combination of both. Patients . were then told to either take it as needed or at regular intervals of . four times a day and some were also told to take steam inhalation. Little ones: The research did show that ibuprofen is likely to help children, and those with chest infections . The research showed that patients were more likely to come back within a month with worsening symptoms or new symptoms if they were prescribed with ibuprofen or ibuprofen with paracetamol. Between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of participants in the study who were prescribed ibuprofen or ibuprofen with paracetamol came back, says a report in the British Medical Journal (must credit). In addition to sales of paracetamol tablets, the drug is available to buy in many cold and flu remedies and can be obtained on NHS prescription. Effective: Paracetamol works by blocking an enzyme in the brain and spinal cord involved in the transmission of pain . The NHS spent £61 million on paracetamol in 2011 for GPs' patients, with £20.6m going on prescriptions for ibuprofen. The two drugs work in different, but complementary ways. Ibuprofen blocks the production of various chemicals in the body, including prostaglandins which are produced in response to injury or disease and cause inflammation. Paracetamol blocks a different enzyme in the brain and spinal cord involved in the transmission of pain. Ibuprofen taken as pills or in liquid form numbs the site of pain and reduces inflammation, and is widely used for arthritic pain. It has a relatively low level of side effects, although it can cause stomach bleeding, kidney damage, allergic reactions. It should not be taken by people who are allergic to aspirin. Professor Little admitted the research findings were surprising and may mean that treatment with ibuprofen contributes to the progression of the illness. He said 'This may have something to do with the fact the ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory. 'It is possible that the drug is interfering with an important part of the immune response and leads to prolonged symptoms or the progression of symptoms in some individuals. 'Although we have to be a bit cautious since these were surprise findings, for the moment I would personally not advise most patients to use ibuprofen for symptom control for coughs colds and sore throat.' The study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research programme.","Researchers say inhaling steam offers little comfort to cold suffers .

Four children who were rescued from a Texas 'swingers club' have been removed from their new foster parents after saying they were being abused there as well. A 13-year-old girl, a 14-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy who are siblings, plus a 17-year-old boy have been placed in the temporary custody of child protective services by a Wood County, Texas judge. The siblings had been living with John and Margaret Cantrell since 2005 and the 17-year-old boy had been adopted by the couple. A Wood County Judge has ordered that four children be placed in the temporary custody of Child Protective Services following allegations of abuse . Fox News reported that Mrs Cantrell was the person who first alerted authorities to the plight of the children at a Mineola 'swingers club' in 2004. Patrick Kelly received a life sentence for his role in the Mineola 'swingers club' in 2004 . The three siblings had been among the victims of a 'kindergarten' at the club, where children were drugged and learned to dance provocatively. Seven people were convicted in the case. The Cantrells have now lost custody of the children after a physical altercation between the 16-year-old girl and Mrs Cantrell. Shari Pulliam, of the state's Child Protective Services, told Fox News: 'We were called by the Cantrells to pick up that 16-year-old. 'They were refusing to parent that child any longer'. After the incident the agency interviewed all of the children living at the address. According to court documents the 16-year-old girl said that she had been slapped across the face and 'popped in the mouth' by Mrs Cantrell. Another child was allegedly beaten with a wooden backscratcher until it broke. In 2008 Mr Cantrell faced charges of a lewd act with a child, but the prosecution was later dropped.","Children aged between 13 and 17 cared for by John and Margaret Cantrell .

Chinese tourists avoid the UK because of a complicated visa system, the head of China's biggest travel agency said yesterday. Tour operators and travelling agencies . are deterred from bringing groups from China because entrance to . Britain requires a separate document to the rest of the EU. As Chinese travellers spend £65bn per year while abroad, this means British companies are potentially losing out on millions. Tough journey: Chinese tourists are the highest spending in the world, but only a small proportion visit the UK because of the complicated visa system . Yu Ning Ning, president of China International Travel Service, told The Telegraph she only brings 10,000 of her 3.23million customer base to the UK. According to Ms Yu, Chinese tourists want to visit at least two countries while in Europe, and find it easier to apply for just a Schengen visa. ‘The UK is not a cheap visa, it’s a more expensive visa,’ she told the paper. ‘If I want to send 1,000 people, I have to send buses [to a visa processing centre]. ‘This is really causing problems. Every minute you are losing business.’ Last year tourists from the booming Asian economy were named the world’s highest spending tourists, paying out £65bn while travelling abroad. Low numbers: UK businesses are potentially losing out on millions in revenues from Chinese tourists who are more likely to stay within the Schengen area when visiting Europe . As Chinese tourists can enter most of Europe on a Schengen visa, they are less likely to go through a second process just to apply for a UK visa. According to Financial Times report in May, France has at least 25 per cent more Chinese tourists per year than Britain. The Home Office told the Telegraph China is one of the UK’s ‘top priorities’ in terms of attracting business and tourism, but improvements announced last year appears to have made little difference. In 2012, only 179,000 Chinese nationals visited the UK, the lowest number of any European country. The 1995 Schengen Agreement led to the creation of a 'borderless Europe' where those living in the 26 member countries can move freely without having to produce a passport or identification when crossing a border. Out of all EU member states, only Ireland and the UK are outside Schengen, and new members are required to join under EU law.","Chinese are the highest-spending tourists in the world with £65bn .

A 92-year-old war veteran has finally met the child whose life he saved when he selflessly threw himself in the path of a runaway racehorse to protect a five-year-old girl. John Shear was seriously injured at Santa Anita Park in California three years ago, but he says he didn't give a second thought to his safety when he saw little Roxy Key was about to get crushed. 'I'm 90-years-old. I have had a life. She hasn't had a life,' he said. 'You got to save that life.' Scroll down for video . Reunion: John Shear, left, finally got to meet Roxy nearly three years after saving her life . Stalwart: 92-year-old John, who was injured in the Second World War, has worked at Santa Anita Park racetrack for more than 50 years . Roxy's father, Michael Key, told ABC News that if Mr Shear, who fought in the Second World War, hadn't been there to shield his daughter, she would have died. 'She would have been dead. It would have crushed her, and I would have had, I would have been holding my dead baby in my arms,' he said. Mr Key and Roxy had been standing by the paddock watching the horses before they raced when one spooked and broke free from its handler in March 2011. Mr Shear, who has worked at the track for 51 years, was holding a rope across a gap in the paddock when he saw the thoroughbred horse come charging towards him. As he shouted at the spectators to clear the way he turned to see Roxy standing directly in the path of danger. 'I knew I was going to get hit. I thought there was a possibility I was going to die but you . cannot stop and think should I or shouldn’t I. There is a five-year-old . girl,' he said. Hero: John Shear, pictured in a white shirt, dived in front of the escaped horse . Selfless: Moments before the horse reaches him, John can be seen pushing Roxy, left, out of harms way . The incident happened so quickly that Roxy's father said he didn't even have time to react. 'Before I could even think to even move, here comes Mr Shear he said. The horse barreled straight into the elderly track attendant, knocking him and Roxy to the ground. 'She got up and I was shaking. I was in . shock,' Mr Key said. 'And she’s like, ""I’m fine, papa, I’m fine"", . and then she looked over and saw Mr Shear on the ground and there was . blood hemorrhaging and she lost it.' The force of being hit by a horse put Mr Shear in hospital for more than a month. He had multiple pelvic fractures, a fractured cheekbone and cuts on his face and arm. 'Could have been worse. Something could have happened to the little girl,' he told the Los Angeles Times a couple of weeks after the accident. 'There's no question I would do it again.' It took seven months before Mr Shear was well enough to return his beloved job at the race track, and nearly three years before he would meet the girl he saved. 'I have always wanted to meet her and I was so sad that I never got the chance to meet her when I got better,' Mr Shear said. The 92-year-old, whose dreams of becoming a jockey were shattered after he was injured in the Second World War, was finally able to meet Roxy in July.

'I was on pins and needles waiting to see her.  And when I finally see her come out and dance, it felt so exhilarating I can hardly explain,' Mr Shear said.

A lawyer defending a bouncer who was convicted of raping a 20-year-old woman told his client's victim that she should have 'closed her legs' to avoid being attacked. Defence lawyer Keith Jefferies made the remarks when summing up at the trial of his client at Wellington District Court on Wednesday, the Dominion Post reported. The newspaper said the 20-year-old woman was drunk in the central business district when the bouncer, George Pule, approached her and told her that he could get her into a nightclub where her friends were socialising. Outrage: Victims' rights advocates in New Zealand on Thursday condemned a defence lawyer who told a rape victim she should have 'closed her legs' if she wanted to avoid having sex . Instead he led her down an alley and raped her, although Jefferies said the victim did not struggle or cry out. According to the newspaper he told the court: 'All she would have had to do was to close her legs? it's as simple as that.' 'Why didn't she do that? The reason she didn't do that was because the sex was consensual, as easy as that.' But his comments have sparked outrage among victims rights groups. Natalie Gousmett from the Wellington Rape Crisis Centre described the remarks as 'horrific' and an attempt to shift the blame for sexual assault onto the victim. She said the case, and the so-called 'Roastbusters' controversy -- which involved a group of Auckland youths boasting online about having group sex with underage girls -- had thrown a spotlight on attitudes to sexual assault in New Zealand. Natalie Gousmett from the Wellington Rape Crisis Centre said that the Roastbusters case, featuring a group of Auckland youths (pictured) had already put attitudes to rape in the spotlight . 'It is an example of victim-blaming comments and rape culture, which we've seen all too much in the last week and a half,' she said. 'It's very offensive obviously, and harmful for the victim and her family.' Jefferies admitted making the comments but said they came while defending his client and did not reflect his personal views. He told a New Zealand radio station that he was quoted out of context and that for anyone to fully understand what he meant they would have had to have attended the entire trial, which involved complex issues of consent. He said: 'If there had been anything unduly wrong with what I said I would've been reprimanded by the judge and also the crown lawyer would have complained.' 'It was relative to the facts of this particular case.' The Dominion Post said prosecutor Geraldine Kelly told the court that the victim, who was not identified, did not fight back because she was petrified of her attacker. She said: 'No, she didn't fight back, she didn't scream her head off, she didn't go running into the street screaming? Rape!' 'But this isn't an American TV show, this is real life. She was scared, and she didn't want to make the situation worse.' Pule is awaiting sentencing on the rape conviction.","Keith Jefferies made the remarks during summing up of case in Wellington .

A Canadian teen got a little too close for comfort to a lion she was helping care for in a South African rehabilitation facility when the beast tried to drag her into its cage by the legs. Lauren Fagen, 18, was volunteering at the Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre when she leaned in to kiss the beast's fur. The Montreal girl was then pulled into the animal's cage, her legs gnawed and gashed by the lion and its mate, before she was finally dragged away by a lifesaving fellow volunteer. Worth it: Lauren Fagen plays with some lion cubs at Moholoholo Wildlife Centre in South Africa where she was later badly mauled. Before the attack, she wrote on Facebook that the hard work at the refuge was worth it . A-OK: Lauren Fagen was kissing the fur of a 5-year-old lion she was volunteering with in South Africa and it badly mauled her legs . It began as a dream. Fagen was all set to attend McGill University in the fall and wanted to indulge a lifelong passion for animals. She travelled to the Limpopo province of South Africa to work with the animals at Moholoholo, a center established in 1991 for the rehabilitation of wild African animals like rhinos and honey badgers. They give a home to injured and poisoned animals that can no longer live in the wild. Fagen’s job was to clean cages. Only trained professionals are allowed to feed the lions. ¿I didn¿t realize he could stick his paws through': Fagen thought she was safe behind the fence of the lion cage . Docile? A male lion, like the one that attacked Fagen, basks in the sun at South Africa's Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. Fagen said the lion was being very docile before the attack . Savage: Fagen suffered 10 gash wounds once fellow students pulled her from the animals' grip. She is now recovering from 'huge rips' in her flesh . But Fagen wasn’t feeding 5-year-old Duma, a male, when the attack occurred. She was leaning in to kiss its fur, reports the Canadian Globe and Mail. ‘I didn’t realize he could stick his paws through,’ Fagen said of the powerful feline. The lion grabbed her and dragged her legs into the cage, where it began tearing at them . Its mate joined in, as well, by pouncing on the girl’s feet. Cuddly? Two lion cubs play at Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre neat Pretoria, South Africa . Passionate: Fagen, 18, was volunteering at the Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre to indulge a lifelong passion for animals before starting college in the fall . Unfazed: Fagen said she will continue to love animals despite the terrifying experience that has left her physically, but not emotionally, scarred . First time for everything: The Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in South Africa takes in injured and poisoned animals. Fagen's was the first attack since it was founded in 1991 . ‘I should have died or lost a leg. It was a miracle that I survived,’ she said. Fagen said the big cat was being ‘very, very friendly’ before the attack hinting she may have been lulled into a false sense of safety. And she told ABC News via Skype from a Pretoria hospital that she still thinks the lion meant no real harm to her. Hearing her screams, some fellow volunteers came running. One of them, a veterinary nurse from Britain, managed to beat the the lion and lioness off of Fagen with a broom. ‘Both her knees were injured and she had puncture wounds in the calf and huge gouges out of her thigh,' said 24-year-old lifesaver Natalie Bennett.

There isn’t any permanent damage to Fagen’s love of animals, either. She said she signed a waiver when she arrived at the center and knew the risks. It was the first attack at the 20-year-old center and, according to Moholoholo founder Brian Jones, things could have been much worse. ‘This is quite mild – it’s a miracle it wasn’t worse,’ he said. ‘She came here telling people that she wanted to hug an animal.’ Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.",Lauren Fagen was volunteering at the Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in South Africa .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:26 EST, 21 November 2013 . A teen in California who managed to survive two deadly plane crashes that took the lives of his entire family spoke publicly Wednesday for the first time since his impossibly tragic tale became national news in 2011. Former high school basketball star Austin Hatch spent the past two years re-learning how to breathe, eat, walk and live after surviving a plane crash that killed his father and stepmother in Charlevoix, Michigan that year. A 2003 crash had already killed Austin’s mother, brother, and sister. Despite the emotional torture that has marked most of his childhood, Hatch maintained a remarkably upbeat attitude and announced two years after he was originally offered a spot on the team that he would indeed be fulfilling his dream of joining the University of Michigan’s basketball team. Speaking out: For the first time since he experience his short life's second deadly plane crash, Austin Hatch spoke publicly about losing his entire family one tragedy at a time . Although Hatch knows he'll never be the same person or the same basketball player after living through the second crash of his young life, he's pursuing his recovery with a scholarship to the university. ‘It has been a goal of mine since I can remember,’ Hatch said at a Los Angeles media event Wednesday. 'It was kind of surreal to actually sign.' Hatch is now living with an uncle in California and attending a Pasadena high school after deciding to leave his home town of Fort Wayne, Indiana as part of his recovery. Bitter fate: Just 10 days before the 2011 plane crash that killed Hatch's last remaining parent and left his with a serious brain injury, the standout high school basketball star had been offered a spot on the University of Michigan basketball team . 'On scholarship no matter what': Hatch spoke at a Wednesday news conference in part to announce that after years of arduous recovery, he would finally be joining the Michigan basketball team, though it what capacity remained unclear . Backup: Hatch, who now lives with his uncle Michael (left) hasn't played a competitive game since his crash and will likely play a backup role as a Wolverine when he joins the team next year. At right is his Pasadena high school coach Jamal Adams . 'Basketball has always given me something to shoot for': Throughout his 10 month recovery from serious brain trauma and other injuries, Hatch remained intent on playing college basketball . ‘I was dealing with the loss of my best friend, my coach, my teacher, my mentor and my No. 1 fan -- that same man was also my father, Dr. Stephen Hatch,’ he told reporters. Austin’s father had remarried and was adamant that he stick with his passion for flying despite the earlier trauma of losing most of his family. June 24, 2011, Austin, his father, his stepmother, and the family dog Brady smashed into a garage of the Charlevoix, Michigan airport. Only Austin and Brady made it out alive. Just 10 days before the crash, Austin—then the standout star of Canterbury High School’s team—had made agreed to play for the University of Michigan upon his graduation. During his arduous 10 month recovery from a brain trauma and other injuries, Austin kept his focus on his dream of playing college basketball. ‘Basketball has always given me something to shoot for,’ he said Wednesday. Despite all odds, Austin’s dream will come true. Michigan coach John Beilein named Austin last week as part of the 2014 recruiting class and he will attend on a scholarship. It is unclear in what capacity Austin—who hasn’t played basketball even once outside of practices since the crash—will play on the team. But he’s still determined to play a role. ‘[Beilein] told me that he wouldn't offer me a scholarship if he didn't think I had a role on the team that would help them win,’ Austin said. ‘He said, 'Austin, whatever you are able to do, whether it be a manager or a practice player or whatever, you're on scholarship no matter what.’ In addition to his sports-related announcement, Austin touched on his life’s tragedies at the news conference. ‘Aside from the physical trauma that I suffered in the accident,’ he said. ‘The emotional pain will never fully subside.’ Lighting strikes again: Austin's physician father Michael was at the helm of this single engine plane when it crashed into a garage, killing him and his wife and sparing only 17-year-old Austin . Unthinkable: The wreckage of Dr Hatch's plane after it crashed into a garage in Charlevoix, Michigan on June 24, 2011. Just a few years before, a similar crash left Austin's mother, brother, and sister dead . Terrible twist: Dr Stephen Hatch died in a plane crash in 2011 - eight years after he survived a deadly smash that killed his wife and two children . Earlier crash: Austin and his father survived . another crash in 2003 that killed the boy’s mother, Julie, left, and his . two siblings, Lindsay, 11, centre and Ian, 5, right . Austin, who was eight years old at the time, only survived the 2003 crash when his father flung him out of the burning plane. Austin was given a small measure of . comfort after the crash when his dog, a labradoodle named Brady, was found . wandering near the crash site in the days following the accident. Dead in the crash were Austin’s 38-year-old mother Julie, his 11-year-old sister Lindsay and 5-year-old brother Ian. Best friends: Austin Patch and his labradoodle Brady were the only survivors of the horrific plane crash in 2011 that killed his doctor father and stepmother . Clinging to what's left: Here Austin poses with his uncle Michael Hatch, one of his few remaining living relatives. Austin moved to Pasadena from Indiana following the 2011 crash in order to facilitate his healing . In a terrible twist of fate, the family was returning from their summer home on Walloon Lake when they crashed in 2003. This . was the same place they were flying when their single-engine plane flew . into a garage near the Charlevoix Municipal Airport. Pilot error was named as the cause of the 2011 crash. As he awaits the fall semester at Michigan, Austin hopes to play for Loyola High School at some point this winter. ‘I feel like God has his hand on me,’ he said. ‘I feel like there's a plan for my life.’ 'The Way I Cope With My Loss Is Going To Change': In addition to his basketball news, Austin discussed what he's been through emotionally since the crash that took away what was left of his family .

A new study reveals that 46.5 million Americans, including children, are living in poverty amounting to one in ever seven people across the country. The alarming figures, released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday, is nothing new. It marks the sixth year in a row that the statistic has failed to improve. Remaining stagnant at 15 per cent, the nation's poverty rate is not statistically different from the number of impoverished in 2011. A Los Angeles woman sleeping on a bench at a bus stop in August. The nation's poverty figures have not dropped in the past six years . The median household income was $51,017, . unchanged from the previous year, following two consecutive annual . declines. The share of people without health insurance declined . slightly, from 15.7 per cent to 15.4 per cent. The last significant decline in the poverty rate came in 2006, during the Bush administration and before the housing bubble burst. In 2011, the poverty rate dipped to 15 per cent from 15.1 per cent, but census officials said that change was statistically insignificant. A new report from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals that despite the end of . the recession, the nation's poverty levels have remained largely . unchanged across race and ethnic groups: . For the last year, the official poverty line was an annual income of $23,492 for a family of four. The latest poverty numbers present unwelcome news for President Obama as he seeks credit for an economic turnaround after the 2007-2009 recession. He said on Monday that congressional Republicans would reverse recent economic gains if they took uncompromising stands in connection with looming budget deadlines. The Census Bureau's annual report offers a snapshot of the economic well-being of U.S. households for 2012, when the unemployment rate averaged 8.1 per cent after reaching an average high of 9.6 per cent in 2010. Typically, the poverty rate tends to move in a similar direction as the unemployment rate, so many analysts had been expecting a modest decline in poverty. The latest census data show that the gap between rich and poor was largely unchanged over the last year, after increasing steadily since 1993. Poverty rates by age range from 1959-2012. People 65 and older were at 9.1 per cent in 2012, after hitting a record low of 8.9 percent in 2009. GOP conservatives have been demanding a delay of Obama's new health care law as the price for supporting continued federal government spending. The House is also expected to consider a bill this week that would cut food stamps for the poor by an estimated $4 billion annually — 10 times the size of cuts passed by the Democratic Senate — and allow states to put broad new work requirements in place for recipients. 'This lack of improvement in poverty is disappointing and discouraging,' said John Iceland, a former Census Bureau chief of the poverty and health statistics branch who is now a Penn State sociology professor. 'This lack of progress in poverty indicates that these small improvements in the economy are not yet being equally shared by all.' Ron Haskins, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in poverty, agreed. 'Everything's on hold, but at a bad level: poverty and income did not change much in 2012,' he said. 'So child poverty is still too high and family income is still too low. The recession may be over, but try to tell that to these struggling families. Don't expect things to change until the American economy begins to generate more jobs.' Broken down by state, Mississippi had the highest share of poor people, at 22 percent, according to rough calculations by the Census Bureau. It was followed by Louisiana, New Mexico and Arkansas. On the other end of the scale, New Hampshire had the lowest share, at 8.1 per cent. Poverty percentages were higher for women than men in all age ranges during 2012. Over nine million children are currently living in poverty. The official poverty level is based on a government calculation that includes only income before tax deductions. It excludes capital gains or accumulated wealth, such as home ownership. As a result, the official poverty rate takes into account the effects of some government benefits, such as unemployment compensation. It does not factor in noncash government aid such as tax credits and food stamps. David Johnson, the chief of the Census Bureau's household economics division, estimated that unemployment benefits helped keep 1.7 million people out of poverty. If non-cash government aid were counted in the official formula, the earned income tax credit would have lifted another 5.5 million people above the poverty threshold. Food stamps would have boosted 4 million people, lowering the poverty rate to 13.7 per cent. The slight dip in Americans without health coverage meant 48 million people were without insurance. The drop was due mostly to increases in government coverage, such as Medicaid and Medicare. The number of people covered by employer-provided health insurance remained flat. The decline was modest compared to a bigger drop in 2011, which occurred due to increased coverage for young adults under the new health care law. Because the main provisions of the Affordable Care Act don't take effect until 2014, the latest census numbers offer a baseline number of uninsured by which increased coverage and effectiveness of the law will be measured. Many conservative Republicans remain committed to repealing it. Starting next year, the government will offer tax credits for people without access to job-based health insurance to buy private coverage through new markets, called exchanges, in each state. Open enrollment starts Oct 1. The new health care law also expands Medicaid to cover millions more low-income people, but so far only 24 states plus Washington, D.C., have gone along with the expansion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by next year, the health law will reduce the number of uninsured in the U.S. by about 25 per cent. By 2017, it is projected that 92 per cent of eligible Americans will have health insurance, a 10 percentage point increase from today's level.","46.5million people in the U.S. were living in poverty last year .

On the big screen: Russell and Carl drag the house behind them through 'Paradise Falls' which was inspired by the Tepuyes of Venezuela, in 2009 film Up . The team from the CEFE-CNRS . institute in France assessed 21,500 endangered species living in 173,000 . nature reserves and came up with the list of ‘irreplaceable’ areas. The analysis compares the contribution each protected area makes to the long-term survival of species. The isolated plateaus of the Tepuyes have seen unique species evolve, including the saffron-breasted redstart bird, the Sapito Rojo Del Yapacana frog and Fernandez's sword-nosed bat which is on the brink of extinction. This landed the area among the top ten most vulnerable nature reserves in the study by the French scientists . Like no other: Areas like Gran Sabana, 'Great Savanna' located on top of one of the Tepuys in Venezuela are home to species which cannot be found anywhere else on the planet . Animal kingdom: The isolated Tepuys plateaus' fauna include the saffron-breasted redstart bird and the near-extinct Fernandez's sword-nosed bat . Needing protection: The Canaima waterfalls in the Venezuelan rainforests . The Tepuyes, a name which means 'house . of the gods' in the native tongue of the local Pemon people, inspired . Up director Pete Docter to create the film’s Paradise Falls. The . animation team even travelled out to the table-top mountains and spent . three days and nights painting and sketching to perfect the place where . the Academy Award winning film it set. The Formaciones de Tepuyes is also thought to have inspired Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic novel The Lost World.

It was one ice cream truck versus another in a kick-off to the warmer months befitting a spaghetti Western. ‘This is my town,’ Joshua Malatino reportedly yelled at the driver of a Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck, as the out of town franchise, he believed, began to encroach on his Gloversville, New York territory. Malatino, 34, owns a fanchise called Sno Cone Joe in the town near Albany, and that town was apparently not big enough for both Malatino’s company and Mr. Ding-A-Ling, reports the Times Union. Feud: Cops say Joshua Malatino began harassing the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck as soon as it hit the streets of Gloversville, New York in April . The 53-year-old driver Phil Hollister went to police and said Malatino was making threats last month, including yelling things like, ‘You don’t have a chance' as he innocently plied his trade. Hollister claimed Malatino, along with his girlfriend Amanda Scott, 21, also tried to intimidate him by stalking him around town in their own ice cream truck, blasting their music loudly when near him, and yelling ‘Free ice cream!’ when they saw someone approaching the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck. ‘I own this town,’ Malatino allegedly yelled in a phone call to Mr. Ding-A-Ling headquarters where he claimed Gloversville as his ice cream turf and nobody else’s. Ice cream: Something went sour this spring season when Sno Kone Joe, AKA Joshua Malatino, allegedly began driving his rival out of town with threats and harassment . Threats: Joshua Malatino, left, owner of Sno Cone Joe ice cream trucks, was charged with harassing and stalking a rival company's driver along with girlfriend Amanda Scott, right . On April 19, police say business really turned sour. That’s when police in the small New York State town say they witnessed Malatino’s harassment while on patrol. An officer saw a Sno Cone Joe truck tailgating a Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck at a red light. ‘In the past, Malatino has been warned for this type of behavior,’ said Gloversville Police Capt. John Sira. Sira said Matatino had been warned about his behavior as recently as this spring, after making similar threats last summer before muscling another ice cream truck out of town. ‘We warned him before that this type of . behavior would not be tolerated,’ Sira said. ‘This is a pretty open . market here in Gloversville as long as you have a permit.’ Enough: Phil Hollister, pictured, driver of the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck went ot police after he says hewas fed up with Malatino's antics . Police investigated the matter and on  Tuesday, Malatino and Scott were arrested on charges of harassment and misdemeanor stalking on three separate dates in April. As shocking as this unlikely turf war may be to some, Mr. Ding-A-Ling owner Brian Collis remained unmoved. ‘Every year,’ Collis said, ‘he calls up and says “Who do you think you are, putting another truck in this town?”’ Collis said his driver in Gloversville continues to travel all his routes. If convicted,  Malatino and Scott could get three months in jail. Sweet deal: Hollister, pictured, said Malatino even offered free ice cream to people who approached the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck .

"By . Anne Shooter . PUBLISHED: . 17:05 EST, 15 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:53 EST, 15 November 2013 . Aldi is certainly enjoying its moment in the spotlight. UK profits are up almost 32 per cent year-on-year. It has just opened its 500th store in Britain and has promised another 50 are on their way. What’s more, its products are being heaped with praise. Aldi’s Christmas pud recently beat the best that Harrods and Heston had to offer in blind-taste tests by the Good Housekeeping Institute. And there’s huge publicity surrounding its £540 luxury Christmas hamper — again said to rival Harrods’ offering, which costs a rather more eye-watering £20,000 — not to mention the 1973 Vintage Napoleon Brandy (normal price £77) that it is selling for £29.99. No wonder, then, that almost one in three households now visits Aldi at least once a month, according to research agency Nielsen. And of those, one in five customers is now middle class or upper middle class — up from one in eight a year ago. It’s a telling sign of how audaciously this German bargain store has taken on the established supermarkets. It’s been a clever evolution, beginning with Aldi’s move into more affluent areas such as Winchester, in Hampshire, and Knutsford, Cheshire. It also began selling smarter products, from lobster tails and Parma ham to Belgian chocolates. Other developments to tempt loyal Waitrose and Sainsbury’s shoppers include its proud proclamation that 45 per cent of its goods are produced in Britain by the same people who supply leading brands. But group managing director Roman Heini puts Aldi’s success down to one factor: cost. ‘We believe growth is down to one thing — customers demanding true value,’ he says. Aldi manages to achieve such cost-cutting by stocking virtually all own-branded goods. It means they don’t have to split profits with brand manufacturers. And as you can see from these pictures, in a slightly naughty marketing sleight-of-hand, Aldi’s own-brand products look astonishingly like brands we all know and love — but at a fraction of the price. It’s a clever trick. To further cut costs, they sell far fewer lines than most supermarkets. While a large Tesco store will stock 40,000 lines, Aldi stocks just 1,350. Edward Garner from retail analysts Kantar Worldwide says: ‘There might be 20 pasta sauces in Tesco but at Aldi they might have two or three. 'Because they buy those few lines in such large quantities, they can negotiate very good prices for buying in bulk.’ Aldi’s shops also follow a no-frills model and — gasp — you can’t pay by credit card. Aldi stands for Albrecht Discount after the two brothers, Theo and Karl Albrecht, who established the chain just after World War II. They expanded the store first set up by their mother in Essen, Germany, in 1913, to support the family when her husband, a miner, became ill. The brothers opened 13 more outlets selling goods with basic packaging, stored on pallets. Theo is now dead but Karl, 93, is the richest person in Germany with a net worth of £14 billion. Group annual turnover is £50 billion in the 17 countries where it operates — partly thanks to the marketing of their cheeky lookalike products. Such imitations arouse the curiosity of consumers as to whether they really are similar to the brands they ape. But how does Aldi get away with, for instance, that monkey on the Choco Rice which looks very like Kellogg’s Coco Pops? Intellectual property partner Jeremy Hertzog, of law firm Mishcon de Reya, says: ‘Brands are cautious about taking legal action in situations like this. The brand would need to prove that the copycat product is deliberately out to confuse the buyer into believing that the similar-looking product is actually connected economically to the original in some way.’ So, how do Aldi’s lookalikes fare in a taste test? Can they really compete with the best of the brands?","Sales for supermarket up 32 per cent year on year and 500th store in Britain now open - with another 50 on their way, many in affluent areas .

"PUBLISHED: . 08:48 EST, 11 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:49 EST, 11 November 2013 . We all have memories of twisting pipe cleaners together as children to make stick-figure animals. However one woman has taken the hobby to a whole new level by turning the fuzzy sticks into extremely detailed models. Lauren Ryan, an artist from California, has managed to make life-like animals using nothing but pipe cleaners, felt-tip pens and a few plastic buttons. These incredibly detailed animals are made by Lauren Ryan using only pipe cleaners and strictly no glue, as she considers it cheating. The wolf mask (left), which she made for Halloween, has a mouth that moves when the wearer talks while the red fox (right) has realistic fur thanks to the pipe cleaners' texture . This is an Okapi, a deer-like mammal from central Africa, which was made only using the cleaners, including the stripes around the legs . Her most impressive creation is a full-sized wolf mask she made for Halloween with a moving mouth. Lauren Ryan, from California, makes the pipe cleaner animals in her workshop and has been practicing since she was 12 . Ryan said: 'I gave it complete whiskers and made the jaw able to move when the wearer talks. Unfortunately, I put off sewing and colouring the faux fur until the very end, so it ended up a bit sloppy. But the neighbors' reactions were priceless.' In fact several of her works are able to move about thanks to special hinges woven into their bodies, and the flexible material they are made from. Ryan has a passion for animals, and uses her hobby to make sculptures of some of her favourite exotic and endangered species. She has woven animals from Okapi, . deer-like mammals found in central Africa, to a Thylacine, the world's . largest carnivorous marsupial which is thought to be extinct, though . sightings are still reported across Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea. She has even made Amaterasu, the wolf-like incarnation of ancient Japanese sun goddess Shinto from the video game Okami. Writing . on her blog about one of her wolf sculptures, she says: 'I never use . glue (to me that is like cheating), and only occasionally use scissors. A . little bit of marker colors the eyes, mouth, and paw pads.' Ryan builds a basic skeleton from . chenille stems, the technical name for pipe cleaners, before gradually . building up the layers by weaving others on top to create the full sized . sculptures. Wolves are a favourite subject fro Ryan, from California, and this starved creature is just one example . This miniature of a wildcat has whiskers made from stripped-down wire and looks especially life-like while perched among this ivy . Ryan constructs skeletons made either from pipe cleaners, for the smaller pieces, or wire, for the larger pieces such as the wolf mask (bottom left) and then builds layers of the furry brushes on top . Because of . their furry texture, the cleaners make an ideal material for weaving . animals as it gives their coats a realistic texture. She . also uses stripped down wires to make whiskers, with projects lasting . for anything from a few hours for small, basic animals, all the way up . to several months for the larger beasts. Discussing . her technique when making a model of a Fennec, a nocturnal fox found in . North Africa, she said: 'It’s mostly hollow, just the legs, head, and . tail tip are solid. While Ryan says she sometimes uses beads for the eyes and felt pens for the markings, she refuses to use glue and considers it cheating . The animal enthusiast enjoys making exotic an endangered animals including these two fennecs, a type of nocturnal fox from North Africa . Ryan holds herself to a very high standard and says she was 'no pleased' with this sculpture because of his ruffled fur . 'Usually the more detail required, the tighter an area becomes. 'I generally use the most common pipecleaner size, around 6mm wide, 12 inches long, found in most stores. 'I sort of just smooth them down with my fingers so the wires don't show, and they are tightly woven together.'","Lauren Ryan, from California, weaves animals out of pipe cleaners .

'Sordid': Rachel Speed, 41, arrives at Cwmbran Magistrates Court for a hearing earlier in the year. She has now been sentenced to two years in jail . A woman teacher was jailed for two years today for having a 'years-long' secret lesbian relationship with one of her pupils. Rachel Speed, 41, started the ‘sexual relationship’ after kissing the girl in a school stationery cupboard when she was just 14. Speed would pick up the girl in her car and drive her to her house where they had ‘sleepovers’ several times a week. Prosecutor Christopher Rees told her: ‘You abused her trust while she was 14. ‘You did not want her parents to know because then they would know your sordid little secret. ‘You were clearly obsessed with her - even when she went to university.’ Speed, wearing jeans and a heavy sweater, had already been warned by Judge Wynn Morgan that she was going to prison. Sentencing Speed to two years jail, Judge Morgan told her: ‘You were in a position of trust in relation to the girl - you were her teacher. ‘Teachers are not allowed to have sex with their pupils. Everybody knows that. ‘You were a mature person while she was an impressionable and vulnerable child who was unpopular at school. ‘She was bound to respond to the attentions of a popular teacher.’ The court heard the girl was bullied at school and Speed started texting the girl and sending her online messages before inviting her for a sleepover. Speed, who had taught science at Fairview High School in Cwmbran, south Wales, for 15 years, carried on the relationship until the girl went to university. The pair would share a bed, shower together and perform ‘sex acts’ on each other several times a week. The court heard how the relationship was uncovered when the girl's mother found an 'inappropriate' letter from Speed. Speed promised the victim's parents to stop their relationship, but continued it anyway until she was dumped . When they found out about the sleepovers, they went to Speed's house to collect items belonging to the victim. The court heard Speed  told them: 'You're not going to like it but I love your daughter.' The parents made Speed sign a contract in exchange for not going to the school or the police. She agreed she would end the relationship until the girl was 21 or after she finished full-time education - but she broke her promise. The girl’s mum said: ‘I felt sick and angry. My daughter was a child. How could she have her sleep over at her house?’ Speed, of Hengoed in the Rhymney Valley, South Wales, gave the girl an engagement ring and a car when she went to university. But the court heard how the pupil dumped her teacher by text after she met someone new. She then reported Speed, who was accused of indecent assault and sexual activity while in a position of trust.

Speed’s lawyer Peter Harding-Roberts told the court: ‘The situation sprung from an initial act of kindness from the defendant. ‘The relationship continued until the girl was 20 - it was a genuine loving relationship. Speed, who was found guilty after denying the charges, has lost her job at Fairwater High School in Cwmbran, near Newport. She was placed on the sexual offences register for ten years and under, a sexual offences prevention order, was ordered not to have unsupervised contact with a child under the age of 18.

According to the auctioneer, the Pink Star was mined by De Beers in Africa in 1999 but the country remains a secret. The diamond was sold privately in 2007 but neither the buyer nor the price is on public record. ‘It’s really extraordinarily rare,’ said Mr Bennett. ‘Very, very few of these stones have ever appeared at auction.

A Saudi diplomat has been accused of keeping two trafficked women as domestic help in his home, racially discriminating against them, and denying them wages.

Ash in the stove of a Romanian woman may hold the clue to the fate of stolen paintings said to be worth around £100million, saddened art experts revealed today. Some paint pigments recovered from the stove of the mother of a man charged with stealing seven paintings contain chemicals from colours often used in the 19th and 20th century - but not anymore. Forensic scientists at Romania's National History Museum examined ash from the stove of Olga Dogaru, whose son is the chief suspect in last year's theft of paintings in the Netherlands. Sadness: Ernest Oberlander-Tarnoveanu (left), manager of Romania's National History Museum and Gheorghe Niculescu (right), head of a team of investigative experts, at a news conference in Bucharest . Burial: The local cemetary, presumably the place where stolen paintings were allegedly buried before being destroyed, by Olga Dogaru, mother of a Romanian art theft suspect, is pictured in Carcaliu village, Romania . Location: A general view of Carcaliu village. Local resident Olga Dogaru - mother of suspect Radu Dogarus, accused of stealing seven masterpieces from Monet, Picasso and Gauguin - said she burned the artworks . Mrs Dogaru initially admitted burning the paintings - which include a Matisse, a Picasso and a Monet - to protect her son, but later denied doing so, authorities said. Museum boss Ernest Oberlander-Tarnoveanu said a probe found traces of ‘very old’ yellow arsenic, which painters said has not been in common use since the Second World War because of its toxicity. Prosecutors claim that Mrs Dogaru feared for her son Radu when he was arrested in January following the early morning raid last October. Mrs Dogaru had allegedly said that she buried the art in an abandoned house and dug them up a month later before burning them when detectives began searching the village for them. Stolen: 'Reading Girl in White and Yellow' by Henri Matisse, left, and 'Harlequin Head' by Pablo Picasso, right, were two of the seven paintings stolen from the Kunsthal gallery in Rotterdam last October . Destroyed? Charing Cross Bridge, London by Claude Monet is one of the more famous works that Ms Dogaru claims to have burned .

A five-year-old boy from Long Island, is only 600 miles away from becoming the youngest-ever hiker to complete the Appalachian Trail. Christian Thomas, also known as Buddy Backpacker, started the 2,180 mile trail, which stretches from Maine to Georgia, on April 27, and hopes to complete it on New Year's Eve. Buddy is traveling with his parents Dion Pagonis and Andrea Rego, who gave up life behind a desk to give the five-year-old a taste of adventure. On track: Five-year-old Buddy Backpacker could become the youngest hiker to complete the Appalachian Trail . Journey: Buddy is walking the 2,180-mile trail with his parents Dion and Andrea . The family camp along the route or stay in hostels, and Buddy Backpacker - Christian's trail name -  learns to count, spell and do math along the way. 'I don't think we knew that he was setting the record officially until after we started,' Miss Rego told WCYB 5. At 2,180 miles long, the Appalachian Trial is one of the longest continuous footpaths in the world. It covers 14 states between Maine and Georgia, with the largest section, of about 400 miles, in Virginia. About 2,000 'thru-hikers' - those completing it in one journey - start the trail each year but only one in four make it to the end. The total elevation of the mountainous trail is the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest 16 times. On average, a hiker burns up 6,000 calories a day on the trail. Most thru hikers start in Georgia in the spring, making the best of the weather before reaching Maine in fall. The first person to ever complete the route was Myron Avery, when he plotted its path in 1936. Many hikers following the route use trail names, which is how five-year-old Christian came to be known as Buddy Backpacker. When they started their journey at . the Appalachian Conservancy Center in West Virginia, they were told that . the youngest person to ever complete the trail was a six-year-old who . hiked it in 1980. The couple hadn't set out to break any records. On their website, where they post updates about Buddy's . progress, the hikers describe themselves as: 'A couple in . our late twenties trying to figure out how it is you raise another . human being'. The group travels light, with the main luxury item being an iPad Mini that they use to plot their route and find shelters along the way. They also have a Jeep to get them to the trail heads each day, a tent that has sheltered them through all kinds of weather, and a Marmot rain jacket to protect Buddy on windy trails. Instead of going to school Buddy has the outside world as his classroom and listens to educational CDs. 'He hikes with educational music, he's . learning French, he's learning to count, spell, add and subtract while . he hikes without the distraction of other kids or being in the . classroom,' Miss Rego said. The couple added that unlike other 'thru-hikers' Buddy's age gives him the advantage of unlimited energy. High life: While other children are at school, Buddy has his lessons at the top of mountains . Pit stop: Buddy stops for lunch. On average hikers consume up to 6,000 calories a day on the Appalachian Trail . 'He never hurts the next morning like most . thru-hikers do. His regeneration is overnight. He's had it easier than . most hikers,' Mr Pagonis, a graphic designer, said. The couple's positive experience hiking with their young son inspired them to create the Hikes for Tykes fundraising page, to provide equipment and funding for other families wanting to follow in their footsteps. Since starting in spring the family, who had to weather Hurricane Irene in their tent, have made good progress. The government shutdown forced them to detour last month, but they have not been deterred from their goal. Top of the world: Dion and Andrea with Buddy Backpacker. They hope to complete their journey on New Year's Eve . Homeward bound: The family have only 600 more miles to go along the Appalachian Trail . Resilient: Buddy's father says the five-year-old's boundless energy makes the trail easier for him than older hikers . Home: The family camp along the trail in their tent or stay in hostels . Tough: Buddy Backpacker and his father Dion on a snowy trail . Record breaker: The five-year-old has only 600 miles more to travel before becoming the youngest hiker to complete the trail . Buddy said: 'We started in Harpers Ferry. We went . to Maine, then to Baxter State Park to Katahdin, and then to Rockfish . Gap, but the Shenandoah was closed.' The adventures of the youngster, who has scaled mountains, camped in snow and met wild horses, will be turned into a children's books once he has completed the last 600 miles.","Youngster started 2,180-mile trek with his parents in April .

Code breaker: Mavis Batey, who has died aged 92, was the last survivor of the Bletchley Park 'break in' experts . One of the leading female codebreakers at Bletchley Park who helped to crack the Axis powers' Enigma code died on Armistice Day at the age of 92. Mavis Batey was the last surviving of Bletchley's 'break in' experts - codebreakers who worked to crack new ciphers that had never been broken before. Her achievements included cracking the Italian Navy's Enigma cipher, leading to an emphatic British victory at Matapan, the Royal Navy's first fleet action since Trafalgar. And she crucially found a way into the Enigma code used by the German secret service, a break which enabled the Double Cross deception that ensured the success of the D-Day landings. Mavis Lillian Lever was born on May 5, 1921, in Dulwich, South London. She was studying German at University College, London, when the war broke out. She patriotically decided to break off her studies and enlist as a nurse to help the war effort, but was told that she would be more use to Britain as a German linguist. Initially she hoped to be a Mata Hari-esque spy, adventuring into occupied Europe to seduce German officers. But she was disappointed. 'I don't think either my legs or my German were good enough because they sent me to the Government Code & Cipher School,' she was quoted as saying by The Times. After showing promise during a short stint working in London, checking the personal columns in the papers for coded message, she was sent to Bletchley to work on with Dilly Knox, whose research unit led the way in breaking Enigma. After his initial success with Enigma, Knox, a classic British eccentric, was working on new and as yet uncracked variants. Nineteen-year-old Mavis was thrust straight in at the deep end, working on the updated Italian Naval Enigma machine. After months of hard work, in late March 1941, she had a breakthrough. She deciphered a message outlining a large-scale Italian assault on a Royal Navy convoy carrying supplies from Cairo to Greece, which contained the full details of the plan of attack. 'How many cruisers there were, and how many submarines were to be there and where they were to be at such and such a time, absolutely incredible that they should spell it all out,' she recalled. The message was passed on via the Navy's top brass to Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet, giving him the intelligence he needed to pull a fast one on the Italians. He tricked the Japanese consul in Alexandria, who was passing on information on the fleet's movements to the Germans, into thinking he was having the weekend off to play golf. Then, under cover of darkness, and with detailed information of the Italian navy's positions, he took the battle to them with a massive fleet action. Over March 27 and 28, Admiral Cunningham's forces staged a series of surprise attacks on the Italians, sinking three cruisers and two destroyers, actions that cost them 3,000 sailors. The Italians never again dared to sail close to Royal Navy until Admiral Cunningham accepted their surrender in 1943. War effort: As a 19-year-old Mavis was thrust straight in at the deep end, working on the updated Italian Naval Enigma machine. After months of hard work, in late March 1941, she had a breakthrough . But Mavis's most crucial contribution came in collaboration with Knox and another of his assistants, Margaret Rock, with the cracking of the Enigma code used by the Abwehr, the German secret service. Britain's own spies had been able to capture most of the agents sent to the UK, and those in the neutral capitals of Lisbon and Madrid, and were using them to feed back false information to Germany. But no-one knew whether this so-called Double Cross system was working, whether Germany's commanders had been convinced by the fake intelligence sent back. The Abwehr Enigma was far more complex than the standard version, with its machines using four rotors, rather than the usual three, which rotated randomly with no predictable pattern. Mavis worked with Knox and Rock to test out every possibility and, on December 8, 1941, she broke a message on the link between Berlin and Belgrade, making it possible to reconstruct one of the rotors. That was the clue they needed and, within days, Knox's team had broken the Abwehr Enigma. Shortly afterwards, Mavis cracked a second Abwehr cipher, allowing the agents to finally confirm that the Germans believed the phoney intelligence coming from the Double Cross operation. Love: Mavis pictured with her husband Keith, also a Bletchley Park code breaker, in 1942 . Now the time was right for one of the war's most audacious tricks. British agents fed a stream of messages to German commanders informing them that a U.S. Army group was forming in East Anglia and Kent. As a result, Hitler believed that D-Day's main invasion force was to land on the Pas-de-Calais rather than Normandy, leading him to hold two key armoured divisions in that area. Field Marshal Montgomery's head of intelligence, Brigadier Bill Williams, later said that without that key deception, the Normandy invasion may well have been a disaster. War effort: Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, where code breakers worked throughout the Second World War . Mavis met her husband, Keith Batey, himself a codebreaker while working at Bletchley Park. After the war she spent some time with the diplomatic service, and then brought up three two daughters and a son. She has published a number of books on garden history, as well as some relating to Bletchley Park, and has served as President of the Garden History Society, of which she became the secretary in 1971. She was awarded the Veitch Memorial Medal in 1985, and made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1987, in both cases for her work on preservation and conservation of gardens.","Mavis Batey worked throughout the war on cracking Axis Enigma codes .

France was yesterday rocked by the news that its troubled economy slammed into reverse over the summer. Official figures showed output fell by 0.1 per cent between July and September - leaving the country on the brink of another recession. The dismal news came just a week after Standard & Poor’s cut France’s credit rating by a further notch to AA in a humiliating setback for President Francois Hollande. Humiliating: Official figures showed output fell by 0.1 per cent between July and September in another set back for Francois Hollande . The performance in the rest of the eurozone was little better with output in the single currency bloc growing by just 0.1pc in the third quarter down from 0.3pc in the previous three months. The German economy slowed from 0.7 per cent to just 0.3 per cent. Figures from Italy showed its economy shrank by 0.1pc following a 0.3pc contraction in the second quarter. But Spain notched up growth of 0.1 per cent  - its first quarter of expansion since early 2011. The disappointing figures from the across the region were a stark reminder that the eurozone crisis is far from over and fuelled fears of a long and painful recovery. It was also in stark contrast to the UK where the economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the third quarter of the year. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney this week said the ‘glass is half full’ in Britain and hailed ‘one of the strongest recoveries in the advanced world’. Optimism: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney this week said the 'glass is half full' in Britain and hailed 'one of the strongest recoveries in the advanced world' It came as figures showed unemployment in the UK has fallen to 7.6 per cent and a record of nearly 30m people are in work. Unemployment in the eurozone is at a record high of over 12 per cent and more than half of Spanish and Greek youngsters who want a job cannot find work. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘The near-stagnation of the eurozone economy in the third quarter underlines the fragility of the recovery and the growing dangers of a damaging bout of deflation in the region.’ The European Central Bank last week cut interest rates from 0.5 per cent to a new record low of 0.25 per cent in a desperate bid to stave of deflation and inject life into the economy. But with Germany, the eurozone’s biggest economy, slowing and France, the second biggest, in decline, experts fear the move was too little too late. Analysts said the renewed slump in France, following growth of 0.5 per cent in the second quarter, is particularly alarming and piles pressure on Hollande and his Socialist government. It also made a mockery of Hollande’s claim in August that ‘the recovery is here’. In a devastating analysis last week, S&P highlighted the risks to the French economy posed by weak economic growth, high unemployment, the rising national debt and ‘elevated’ levels of tax and spending. The latest downgrade – which could push up French borrowing costs as investors worry about the country’s credit-worthiness – came less than two years after France was stripped of its top-notch AAA rating and sparked fears of fresh turmoil across the eurozone. French unemployment is at a record high of 11.1 per cent or 3.3m in September and more than a quarter of under-25s who want a job cannot find work.","Figures showed output fell by 0.1 per cent between July and September .

A Camden County Georgia deputy sheriff has been suspended without pay after photos surfaced of him dressed not only in blackface but as a black prisoner in a striped jail uniform ‘picking cotton' at a Halloween party. Sheriff Jim Proctor has suspended Deputy Sheriff Chad Palmer without pay and said while Palmer's costume was ‘extremely insensitive,’ he doesn't believe that Palmer is racist. Proctor says Palmer has been placed on probation for a year and the department's deputy sheriffs are now required to participate in sensitivity training — which begins next week. But some angry residents in the south Georgia county say that’s not enough. Suspended: Camden County Georgia Deputy Sheriff Chad Palmer has been punished but not fired for wearing this costume to a Halloween party where he stopped to the floor while 'picking cotton' The Camden County sheriff Jim made the announcement in front of a room packed with community members, local church leaders and representatives from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on Wednesday. ‘Today, we are here because of someone's inappropriate, insensitive actions. Extremely insensitive, is what it is. I do not believe Chad Palmer is a racist. I have had to take action,’ said Proctor. Proctor said Palmer will be suspended until he thinks the deputy sheriff is ready to come back to work. According to First Coast News, Palmer referred to himself to other revelers at the party as a ‘Camden County inmate' who was 'picking cotton.' Red-faced: County Sheriff Jim Proctor announces Wednesday that Palmer has been suspended and placed on probation for his 'offensive' act, but said the deputy is not a racist . Enough? Proctor said members of his force will now be required to take racial sensitivity training beginning next week . ‘There's been a lot of thought, a lot of prayer in to this decision,’ Proctor said. ‘I thought about firing him but decided against it.’ Meanwhile, some members of the coastal county’s community say he should have. ‘To me, it was like a slap in the face,’ Pastor Mack Knight said of the pictures. ‘Out of all of the characters that this police officer could have chosen, he chose to go as a slave, an inmate, picking cotton.’ Community member Shelia Blake agreed. 'Like a slap in the face': Local pastor Mack Knight said he knows Palmer and originally asked he be fired but has since decided it should be a learning experience for the deputy . ‘That is bad. For this to be a deputy doing something like this,’ she told First Coast News. ‘This isn't causing anything but a war in Camden County. It's not good for Camden County.’ In light of the revelations and their racist implications, some residents have asked for an investigation into the possibility that Palmer’s previous arrests have been racially motivated. Proctor said he analyzed the deputy’s record while weighing the decision and found no evidence of prejudice.","Camden County Deputy Chad Palmer has been suspended without pay and put on probation for a year after photos emerged of him in the offensive costume .

Locked up: GP Gousul Islam on the day he was jailed for 11 years in December 2012 for the indecent assault of a number of his female patients . Seven victims of a GP who subjected vulnerable patients to degrading sexual abuse in his surgery were today stripped of their compensation payouts by appeal judges. The women had been awarded cash sums totalling £38,500 from their abuser, 71-year-old Dr Gousul Islam, from Doncaster, following his conviction last year. Islam was jailed for 11 years in December after he was found guilty at Sheffield Crown Court of numerous counts of indecent assault against the victims, six of whom were patients. But he appealed and today saw the compensation orders quashed by top judges, Lord Justice Davis, Mr Justice Nicol and Judge Elgan Edwards QC, at the Court of Appeal. Lord Justice Davis said no evidence had been put before the crown court on which the judge could reliably say the women had been mentally damaged by the abuse. He said: 'Looking at the evidence overall, the judge was not in a position to make a finding that substantial psychological problems had been caused by the appellant’s conduct.' 'This could only properly be established by the appropriate psychiatric evidence and other inquiries. 'We don’t think the judge was entitled to form his own judgment on issues such as these. 'This necessitated careful and expert psychiatric assessment, based on interviews and discreet investigation and inquiry. It was not capable of assessment by a trial judge in the context of a court assessment.' The court heard Islam was the sole GP at a surgery in Stainforth, near Doncaster, when he took advantage of some of those who came to see him for help in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. He questioned them on their sex lives, performed unnecessary intimate examinations and, in one case, put his penis into a patient’s mouth and called her a hypochondriac. Sick: Over three decades Dr Islam assaulted several patients, he questioned them on their sex lives, performed unnecessary intimate examinations and, in one case, put his penis into a patient¿s mouth and called her a hypochondriac . Another of the victims became so . accustomed to being unnecessarily examined that she automatically took . off her top during a routine visit to another doctor later in her life. The one victim who was not a patient told how he had suggested that they have an affair and then put his hand up her skirt. The crown court judge, Judge Simon Lawler, said it was the worst case of its kind by a professional man which he had seen during his career in law. He said expert evidence was not required to know that the victims had suffered psychological trauma, which justified the compensation awards. Three women received £10,000 each from Islam and another got £5,000, while the remaining three got £1,500, £1,000 and £750. But Lord Justice Davis said the judge should not have made the awards, he said: 'We do feel constrained to say that the judge erred in this regard.' 'We have great sympathy for the complainants - even the judge said himself how sympathetic he was to them. 'But we do not think this should permit departing from well-established principles relating to compensation orders, in particular the need for a sound evidential basis for making appropriate findings.' Islam, who watched proceedings via a video link from prison, was not so lucky in his appeal against the 11-year sentence, which the judges said was tough, but not overly so. Ruling to uphold the sentence the judge said: 'Whilst this sentence was, particularly given the strong mitigation, a severe one, and perhaps even a very severe one, we are not able to say that it was manifestly excessive.'","Dr Gousul Islam, 71, was jailed for 11 years last winter for assaulting a string of patients over three decades .

The Mormon Utah doctor convicted of murdering his wife by drowning her in a bathtub is due back in court to answer to sexual abuse charges brought against him by his daughter. Martin MacNeill, 57, was found guilty last Saturday of drugging and killing his wife, Michele, six years ago. He faces 15 years to life for first-degree murder when he is sentenced on January 7. He also was found guilty of obstruction of justice, which could add one to 15 years. More legal trouble: Alexis Somers (left) has accused her father, convicted killer Martin MacNeill (right), of sexually abusing her on two occasions in the months after her mother's murder . In the course of the high-profile trial, MacNeill's daughters Alexis and Rachel testified against the father of eight and were relieved when the jury found him guilty. Alexis Somers, 30, who was the prosecution’s star witness, has accused the 57-year-old former physician of molesting her in the months after her mother's slaying. MailOnline usually does not name victims of possible sexual abuse, but Miss Somers has publicly addressed the allegations against her father. MacNeill has been charged with second-degree forcible sex abuse and third-degree tempering with a witness, Desert News reported. Oral arguments on a motion to continue will be presented in a Provo court Monday, followed by a two-day jury trial that will begin December 3. MacNeill's attorney Randall Spencer, who represented him in the murder trial, will also handle the defense in the sex abuse case. Killer's grin: Martin MacNeill smiles as he thanks his defense team after he was found guilty of murder and obstruction of justice Saturday .

United in grief: Family members, among them Alexis Somers (second right) hold up photos of Michele MacNeill facing Martin MacNeill as he enters the court room in Provo, Utah, last year . Prosecutor David Sturgill said he is willing to negotiate a plea deal with MacNeill in the case. In September 2007, then-24-year-old Alexis Somers filed a police report claiming that her father had abused her on two occasions in the three months after her mother's death. According to the charging documents, in May 2007, Alexis was asleep in her parents' bed when she was awakened by her father fondling her and kissing her hand. He was supposed to be sleeping on the couch. Alexis demanded to know what her father was doing, to which he allegedly replied, 'I'm sorry, I thought you were your mother.' A similar incident reportedly took place two months later while the family were vacationing in California. Happy family? Martin MacNeill, second from right, stands accused of murder in the 2007 death of his wife and the mother of his eight children . Loss: Michele MacNeill, right, was found unconscious in a bathtub in 2007. Prosecutors claim that her husband, left, left her there to die after giving her a lethal cocktail of prescription drugs . In a recorded phone conversation, MacNeill allegedly told Alexis that he 'was asleep' when he assaulted her. When confronted with allegations of sex abuse while being questioned by police, MacNeill stated that a person cannot be held accountable for his actions while he's asleep, according to court documents. Bed-mate: During the trial, MacNeill's daughter Sabrina testified that their 'nanny' Gypsy Willis spent every night in the doctor's bedroom after their mother's death . According to a police report, the Mormon doctor told his daughters that 'even though his wife is dead, he is still a sexual person and has desires that need to be met.' Alexis Somers and her sisters had spent years dogging the authorities to open a murder investigation, and were instrumental in bringing their father to account for their mother's slaying. The young women claimed that the seemingly respectable doctor and a former bishop in his local congregation of . The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was, in fact, a monster and philandered who led a double life and killed his wife so he could be with his mistress, Gypsy Willis. It wasn't until MacNeill's release in July 2012 from a federal prison in Texas on charges of fraud that Utah prosecutors moved to file charges of murder and obstruction of justice. During the trial, MacNeill's daughter Sabrina testified that Willis, who was hired as their nanny, spent every night in the doctor's bedroom after their mother's death. MacNeill is now planning to appeal his murder conviction, but it will not be handled by Spencer since the disgraced 57-year-old medic has no money to pay attorney's fees.","Alexis Somers accused her father, Martin MacNeill, of sexually abusing her twice in three months after her mother's death in 2007 .

Pop down to Camden Market in north London and you'll probably find somewhere you can buy spanners and knives... but you'll also find them at the bottom of its famous canal. These were just some of the items discovered this week when Camden Lock was drained for maintenance as part of a £45million countrywide project to keep the country's canal system in good working order. And the many tourists and students who visit the area this weekend are in for a treat as they will get the chance to venture to the bottom of the drained chamber of the Regent's Canal. As part of the £130,000 refurbishment work at the site - also known as Hampstead Road Lock - engineers are replacing both sets of lock gates, as well as carrying out brickwork repairs, repointing and timberwork. Scroll down for video . A maintenance worker sweeps away silt as Camden Lock in north London is drained as part of a restoration programme .

People who visit Camden Market this weekend are in for a treat as they will get the chance to venture to the bottom of the drained chamber on the Regent's Canal . A spokesman for the Canal & River Trust, which is overseeing the project, said: 'This programme will kick-start our . series of open days and you'll be able to visit this works site, meet . our experts and even take a tour into the bottom of the drained lock . chamber. 'The free . family-friendly event offers you a rare chance to see an incredible feat . of engineering from a totally new perspective.

Around 2,000 miles of canals and rivers across England and Wales are cared for by the Trust, whose scheme will involve the restoration of hundreds of historic waterways. The Camden project is one of 14 open day events happening across the UK. The locks in Camden were constructed between 1818 and 1820 by James Morgan and it is the only twin lock remaining on the canal.

The bottom set of lock gates are being replaced as they are old and worn, having been there for 25 years . The locks were constructed between 1818 and 1820 by James Morgan. It is the only twin-lock remaining on the canal. The current locks are Grade II-listed and replaced an innovative, but unsuccessful, lock system designed by William Congreve to try to conserve water. The lock is to the west of the Camden High Street road bridge. The yard and former warehouses, an area known as Camden Lock, are on the north side of the canal, at the junction with Chalk Farm Road. This area is adjacent to a canal basin and holds Camden Lock Market, one of the group of markets known as Camden Market. Many of the projects are carried out during winter to minimise the impact on waterway users. Richard . Parry, chief executive of Trust, told the Evening Standard: 'By . showcasing this work to the public we can give them a glimpse of the . craftsmanship of the waterways’ original 18th century design and the . scale of the work we do to care for it.' As one of the most popular free attractions in London, the Camden Lock area will no doubt have heavy footfall tomorrow and Sunday, especially in the run-up to Christmas. The event is expected to be very popular and entry to the locks will be limited. Therefore, you will be required to book onto a tour when you arrive, and will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis. Graham Smith, construction supervisor at the site, said: 'We're replacing the bottom set of lock gates on lock 1 bay. It's old and worn, and has been . there 25 years. They leak and need to retain water. 'We're drilling so that we can take out the drop pot, which is like the hinge for a door. It  takes the weight of the water, thousands of tonnes of it. 'The process involves putting a timber dam in place and overpumping the water to allow for the removal of the lock gates, before replacing them. 'The refurbishment is important to keep canal traffic moving.'

Allowances: Idreez Popoola, 34, should have been deported in 2006 after his temporary UK visa expired but he was allowed to continue living and working in Britain . An illegal immigrant who was twice spared deportation went on to rape a woman just months after using human rights legislation to remain in the UK. Idreez Popoola, 34, will finally be sent back to his home country of Nigeria when he is released from a seven-year jail term imposed after the attack in the victim’s home. Last night an MP said the case highlighted Britain’s ‘dysfunctional’ border controls. A court heard that Popoola came to the UK on a 12-month visa in 2005, but when it expired he was given permission to remain on a temporary basis. But when Popoola was arrested by Northamptonshire Police in December 2011 over an allegation of assault he was found to be an ‘overstayer’ – an immigrant who had not left the country by an agreed date. Although no charges followed the alleged assault, Popoola – by now married with a child – was told he would be deported. However, he successfully appealed the ruling, arguing that the Human Rights Act provided him with the right to a family life. Northampton Crown Court heard that Popoola, who worked as a nightclub bouncer, was granted temporary leave to remain in the UK again in January last year, after his family circumstances were taken into account. But 11 months later he went on to brutally rape a woman in her own home. Bouncer: The court heard Popoola met his victim while working as an agency-employed bouncer outside Bar So in Northampton town centre . Popoola, who sold mobile phone top-up . cards in Nigeria before moving to the UK, is thought to have lived in . Oxford before settling in Thornton Heath, South London, where he trained . as a bouncer and gained work with an agency which supplied a . Northampton nightclub. Judges granted Popoola the temporary right to stay in the UK because he had family just days before he raped a woman in her home . Gordon . Aspden, prosecuting, said Popoola met his victim at a McDonald’s . restaurant in the town. After going back to her home he attacked her, . then forced her to drive him to a train station. Popoola was sentenced to seven years after being found guilty of rape following a four-day trial. Judge . Lynn Tayton told him: ‘It was a serious aggravating factor that the . rape took place in the victim’s own home, as this was an abuse of the . trust placed in you by the victim and has undermined her feelings of . safety in her own space.’ Michael Ellis, Tory MP for Northampton North, said: ‘This is an example of the dysfunctional border control in the UK. ‘Although . there has been considerable improvement since this government took . over, the previous regime was completely not fit for purpose. ‘Here . is another example of someone who has gone on to commit a serious and . unforgivable act when they shouldn’t have even been in the country at . all.’ Alp Mehmet, deputy chairman of the Migration Watch UK pressure . group, said: ‘The sensible course of action, in respect of anyone . without a right to be here, is to remove them as speedily as possible.’ A . Home Office spokesman said: ‘We have introduced tough new rules to . protect the public from those who try to stay here through abuse of the . Human Rights Act.

Until now, impotence drugs, such as Viagra, have been big business for pharmaceutical companies but premature ejaculation treatment has been comparatively ignored. Promescent, an FDA-approved medication to prevent premature ejaculation, is revolutionising treatment for the condition which affects one in three men at some time in their lives . Now, however, competition is increasing to find treatments for the condition, CNBC reports. Jeff Abraham, CEO of a four-year-old pharmaceutical company called Absorption Pharmaceuticals, makes Promescent – a spray which can be bought over-the-counter. He is amazed that none of the big pharmaceutical companies have yet come up with a rival product. He said to CNBC: ‘How can these billion dollar companies in the ED space not come up with a product?’ Promescent uses lidocaine, a pain medication, to reduce a man’s sensitivity so he can perform for longer. This year it is believed that sales of the drug will reach $1.5 million and that next year, they will hit $4 million. It is thought that the drug is now also being used by people who do not suffer from premature ejaculation. Mr Abraham told CNBC: ‘There is a tremendous recreational component.’ Until now, impotence drugs, such as Viagra (pictured), have been big business for pharmaceutical companies but premature ejaculation treatment has been comparatively ignored . A rival product, Tempe, is soon to hit the European market. It was made by Dr Mike Wyllie who created Viagra. Mr Abraham believes the market for premature ejaculation treatments could soon become bigger than the one for erectile dysfunction treatments – he recently turned down an offer of $30 million for his company believing it will soon be worth much more. John Dean, one of Britain’s leading experts on male sexual problems and a past president of the International Society for Sexual Medicine, said: ‘Whilst premature ejaculation is not a life-threatening condition, its consequences can be serious. ‘This is a chronic, debilitating problem, affecting both men and their partners.’","Promescent is a spray which reduces sensitivity so a man can perform for longer - it is available over-the-counter and is approved by the FDA .

Ms Norman, from Plymouth, believes she would not be here now if it had not been for him. Claire Norman, 41, was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer after her partner, Francis, nagged her to see her GP when her nipple became inverted . She told MailOnline: ‘If I hadn’t gone to that appointment I wouldn’t be here now. ‘I nag all the time, about everything, but Francis never nags – it was out of character.’ ‘I wouldn’t have gone to the GP for a while and by then I would have been very poorly.

I didn’t think it would be cancer – I didn’t think it would happen to me at that age. I was only 38.’ While Ms Norman wasn't too concerned, Francis felt differently and for three weeks he nagged her to go to the doctor.

She referred her to Derriford Hospital, in Plymouth, where she had a mammogram and a biopsy before being diagnosed with ER positive breast cancer and being found to have a large tumour. Ms Norman, who has two daughters – Jodie, 18, and Nicole, 16 - said: ‘I was devastated when I was diagnosed.

South Leeds Academy is seeking two 'unqualified' teachers for the subject, for which it says the minimum requirement is four GCSEs at A* to C grade. The criteria - which teachers have said will 'shock' parents whose children attend the school - means that successful applicants could be less qualified than the Government's minimum education standards for school leavers. The academy has said that one of the four GCSE passes must be in maths 'in order to ensure the highest possible standards of student achievement'. Lax: The advertisement prominently states that applicants only need four GCSEs to apply . Special measure: Ofsted has branded teaching at South Leeds Academy 'inadequate' But while the advert says that a degree in mathematics would be desirable for the job, it makes clear that further training is not essential. The academy school, which has 1,163 pupils, has been in special measures following an Ofsted inspection which found the quality of teaching there 'inadequate'. A teaching union has branded the advert 'utterly inappropriate', claiming parents at the school will be 'absolutely shocked'.

It lists as essential qualifications at least 4 GCSE’s (A*-C) or equivalent, including English and Maths, being 'an excellent classroom practitioner' and having an understanding of health and safety issues. Earlier this month the academy - The School Partnership Trust Academies, an educational charity - was issued with a warning letter from a Government minister about the 'unacceptably low standards of performance of pupils'. All change: 29 members of staff have left the school since June . This followed the latest Ofsted inspection, which found 'serious weaknesses' over the achievement of pupils and the quality of teaching which was judged 'inadequate'. Since then, 29 teachers, assistants and other staff have left the academy, as have two senior managers. Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: 'Parents will absolutely shocked to think that any child of theirs would be taught by someone with four GCSEs. 'The Government talks continually about standards. Four GCSEs do not measure up to the five A*-C they expect the majority of pupils to be achieving at present. 'It gives a lie to Michael Gove’s claims that his policy is to allow top professionals such as engineers to become teachers and shows it is about teaching on the cheap. 'This travesty is a direct result of the coalition Government’s decision to allow unqualified teachers into our classrooms. 'This policy needs to be reversed before we see any more of this utterly inappropriate employment practice being put into action.' The School Partnership Trust Academies sponsors a chain of 40 academies including secondary, primary, infant and junior schools and claims 'a proven track record of securing transformational change and sustainable school improvement'. It is led by Sir Paul Edwards, who has acted as an adviser to the Department for Education.","South Leeds Academy advertised for the two post .

A jilted air stewardess has admitted smashing a glass into the face of a pilot who ended their love affair by text message. Senior British Airways cabin crew member Frances Smith, 36, flew into a rage when the divorced pilot ended their 18-month relationship, smashing a wine glass as they were out drinking near Cardiff Airport, a court heard. She then drove the jagged glass into his face leaving him with a three-inch deep wound to his jaw which needed internal and external stitches. British Airways stewardess Frances Smith, 36, glassed her pilot lover when he ended their affair (file image) Divorcee Smith and the pilot were out drinking in a series of nightspots near Cardiff Airport when they began arguing in a bar. Prosecutor David Pugh said: 'The couple had a disagreement and a verbal argument, which passed. 'There were then text messages between them and he said: ""Leave me alone, we're finished"". The court heard Smith, of Horley, Surrey, claimed she had become pregnant twice during the affair - she later told police the pilot had asked to have a termination both times. The prosecutor said: 'She became intoxicated and emotional. At about 9.30pm they were in the bar and she said to him: ""Why didn't you tell your family I'm pregnant?"" 'Miss Smith threw her drink into his face and, when he turned to the bar, she struck him with a broken glass to the face. The pair had been drinking in several bars in Barry, near Cardiff Airport, when they started having a row . 'The wound bled profusely and she ran from the premises and was detained by an off-duty police officer.' Cardiff Crown Court heard Smith later confessed to police saying: 'I did it, I'm really sorry, I've done a stupid thing.' Smith told officers she had not come to terms with two pregnancy terminations which were allegedly carried out at the pilot's request, but was not pregnant on the night of the assault, during which she and the pilot drank at the Premier Inn, Wetherspoons, and Finnegan's Bar in Barry, south Wales. Smith admitted wounding and was . sentenced to a year's imprisonment suspended for two years.  She was . given a one-year supervision order and told to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work. 'Had that injury been lower, the consequences would have been utterly dreadful.' - Judge Tom Crowther, QC . Scottish-born Smith, who had no previous convictions, was also ordered to pay costs of £535 and a victim surcharge of £100. Tracey Lloyd-Nesling, defending, started to give the court Smith's mitigation but Judge Tom Crowther told her: 'You don't need to, I'm not sending this woman to prison.' Judge Tom Crowther QC told Smith: 'Had that injury been lower, the consequences would have been utterly dreadful. 'You made early admissions and you have shown remorse.' After the case, the divorced pilot, who asked not to be named, said: 'This has been a terrible experience which I just want to put behind me. 'I'm still scarred by what went on. I've learned a very bitter lesson. 'It was completely untrue about the pregnancies. This was not a big affair but a work relationship which went on too long.' A spokesman for British Airways said Smith no longer worked for the airline.","Frances Smith, 36, flew into rage when lover texted saying 'We're finished'

This is the nation’s dream wedding dress as designed by the experts – that is, thousands of British brides. The women were asked to come up with their perfect gown, picking every detail from dress shape and length to sleeve style, fabric and embellishment. And here is the result – brought to life over ten days by top bridal designer Stephanie Allin, who makes all her gowns by hand at her workshop in Wales. 3,000 brides picked every detail of the dress, which goes on display at the Brides The Show event in London . The catch? Anyone who wants to walk down the aisle in this one will have to pay £15,000 for the privilege. Around 3,000 readers of Brides magazine provided their views about what made the perfect dress. The result is a charming mix of the fashionable and the traditional. Lace – brought back into popularity two years ago with the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress – was the favoured fabric for almost half of women and appears on most of the dress, including the sleeves and veil. The style of sleeve picked by 44 per cent is surprising, however. The cap sleeve is the cruelest sort, serving to emphasise broad shoulders and cut the arm off at its widest point. Here comes the brides: Everything from tricky cap sleeves to crystal embellishments were chosen by women around the country, with the most popular ideas incorporated into the finished £15,000 product . More flattering is the sweetheart neckline, chosen by 39 per cent and shown by the likes of Lanvin, Prada and Gucci on their autumn/winter 2013 catwalks. Designed to add femininity to a dress, the sweetheart works to emphasise the bust – whatever your size – without being revealing, and balances out those tricky cap sleeves. Together with a waist-cinching embellishment and on-trend fishtail skirt, this hourglass-enhancing dress is truly something that will flatter any figure. Mrs Allin, who has been  designing wedding dresses for 22 years and has a store in Marylebone, Central London, said: ‘It is made from French Chantilly lace, with silk crepe and silk chiffon underskirts, which give it a beautiful swishing feeling.’ ‘Brides The Show is taking place from Friday 11th to Sunday 13th October at Battersea Evolution, Battersea Park, London.  For a further information please go to www.bridestheshow.co.uk .","Dazzling gown will go on display at London wedding show on Friday .

The condition can also develop if the valve is damaged by a bacterial infection. Symptoms include pulsing neck veins, fatigue, swelling of the abdomen and weakness. If the condition is not causing many symptoms, no treatment is necessarily required. In more severe cases, surgery is required to repair or replace the valve.

PUBLISHED: . 18:13 EST, 15 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:13 EST, 15 November 2013 . As Bigg Boss season 7 enters its 60th day, loyal fans have identified their favourites on the basis of temper and filthy drama. The show has always been about muck, outbursts and ugly behaviour, and the latest season has certainly offered the best in smutty drama. Housemates comprising a mixed bag of C-list celebrities from films, sports and the TV world have by now acquired a comfort level and adjusted to the fact that low-brow drama sells huge, grabbing maximum footage. With only 30 days to go before the final winner walks away with the grand prize of Rs 50 lakh, it is best to follow the formula that has worked on the popular show. The housemates have accepted that Bigg Boss sells huge, grabbing maximum footage . Host Salman Khan, despite being attacked on social networking sites for being partial to Tanisha and Armaan, has joked about how strong reactions and fights are the biggest draw of the show. ""Aap ladoge nahi toh audience ko mazaa aayega nahi (if you guys don't fight, the audience won't have fun),""he joked in one episode. Salman has anchored the show over the past three years and he too realises the pulse of the audience. His active participation in the resolving the petty quarrels, he knows, is much appreciated, too. The show opened at 7,711 TVTs on its premiere night and has been drawing a decent rating ranging between 5,080 and 6,000 TVTs during weekdays since then. This only goes on to prove the audience is pretty much hooked to inane fights over trivial issues. The average viewership ranges from 4.3 million to 4.6 million and the show is one of the top three on Colors channel after Balika Vadhu and Comedy Nights With Kapil. ""Prying into a neighbour's house is a common habit and the juicier the gossip, the better it is. It is a tradition all over the world to derive pleasure out of bad things happening to others. People fighting or getting involved in vicarious controversies give pleasure to the audience and this tendency works in the favour of Bigg Boss,"" says ad-filmmaker and image consultant Prahlad Kakkar. Every season, a few housemates rise to prominence for their low-brow antics. In the past, we have had contestants such as Kamal R. Khan, Dolly Bindra, Pooja Missra, Veena Malik, and Rajev Paul who shot to fame thanks to their brazen behaviour. Their outbursts however pale in front of the current housemates who have been liberally showcasing temper and bad manners to gain mileage. WHO'S THAT GIRL: Elli is a Swedish model and actor who made her Bollywood debut recently in the comedy film Mickey Virus. DEFINING TRAIT: Elli's happy-go-lucky bimbette avatar is her biggest USP. Her inability to fluently converse in Hindi has worked in her favour, giving her a cute edge. To be in the show for long, she has been expressing her views strongly without getting into ugly fights with anyone. She has been smartly underplaying her presence, which has made her a neutral and non-controversial contestant. WHO'S THAT GUY: A wrestler by profession, Sangram won several prestigious championships and also won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Wrestling Championship. He shot to prominence when he posed nude with girlfriend Payal Rohatgi. DEFINING TRAIT: Sangram's rustic mannerism has been a big draw on the show. Although he handles most situations patiently, his seething anger comes to fore when the situation goes out of control. Sticking by the house rules, Sangram's outburst was seen when Armaan and other housemates dragged him into controversies and attacked him for the heck of it. WHO'S THAT GUY: Andy is a UKborn veejay-anchor, who was known for his sarcastic comments on celebrities on his TV shows. He shot to prominence as an anchor of What's With Indian Women. DEFINING TRAIT: Salman was quick to spot Andy's attention-seeking streak and compared him to ex-Bigg Boss contestant Imam Siddiqui. Andy can go to any extent to prove his point and has had a fight with every contestant in the house. His ability to cry led to Kushal's exit. His knack at gossiping has made him a popular contestant. WHO'S THAT GUY: Armaan is the son of veteran film producer Rajkumar Kohli and former actress Nishi. He worked in a few duds in late '90s and early 2000s his dad produced. DEFINING TRAIT: Armaan is the most abusive housemate. Well-known for his short temper, he was involved in a hit-and-run case and once allegedly beat up his girlfriend. On the show, he passed personal remarks at Kamya Punjabi but later apologised. He has found a buddy in Tanisha.","When out-of-work actress Tanisha, one of the most active Bigg Boss contestants this season, furiously pushed TV actor Kushal Tandon during a task, most viewers decided to finish dinner before the show subsequent episodes onwards, eager not to miss what would be in store .

Charged: Folk musician Roy Harper has been accused of molesting a 12-year-old girl in the 1970s . Celebrated folk musician Roy Harper is to be charged with nine child sex offences over claims he abused a 12-year-old girl in the 1970s. The 72-year-old singer-songwriter was questioned by police at Heathrow in February, and now faces charges of indecent assault and gross indecency. He will appear in court on Monday to be formally charged. Harper, who lives in Ireland, has released more than 30 folk rock albums, performed with Pink Floyd and had a Led Zeppelin song named after him. He is alleged to have molested a pre-pubescent girl in Herefordshire multiple times between 1975 and 1977, when he was at the height of his fame. West Mercia Police said in a statement: 'Roy Harper, of Rossmore, Clonakilty, County Cork, has been summonsed before Hereford Magistrates on 18 November to face nine sexual offences charges. 'The summons was issued to the musician on 16 October after he was voluntarily interviewed by police at Heathrow airport on 22 February. 'The summons relates to two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, three counts of indecent assault on a girl under 14 and four counts of gross indecency with a girl under 14.' Harper is the latest celebrity to be accused of historic sex offences, following the revelations about disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile. However, the charges against him are not related to Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police investigation set up in the wake of the scandal. Veteran: Harper, pictured in 1965, has been an influential figure in the world of folk rock . Album: Harper, 72, released Man & Myth in September; he has made more than 30 records . He has continued to perform since his the claims emerged, playing sold out shows in London, Manchester and Bristol last month, and released a new album in September. The singer's influence on the world of folk rock was recognised by MOJO magazine in 2005 when they awarded him a 'Hero Award'. Harper has been closely associated with a number of leading musicians and bands during his 50-year career. He sang lead vocals on Have a Cigar by Pink Floyd in 1975, and inspired a 1970 song by Led Zeppelin, Hats Off to (Roy) Harper. Other celebrities to have been charged with historic sex offences this year include entertainer Rolf Harris, publicist Max Clifford and DJ Dave Lee Travis.

Media mogul and multimillionaire Simon Cowell was today condemned as 'irresponsible and stupid' by the UK government after telling students not to bother with an education and just 'get lucky'. Mr Cowell, who is worth more than £200 million from his record labels and talent shows like the X Factor, said he was 'useless' at school but it did not matter. But his remarks have been heavily criticised by Education Secretary Michael Gove, who told MailOnline the media tycoon should promote hard work at school 'not rubbish it'. 'Useless': Simon Cowell (pictured here with girlfriend Lauren Silverman) said he didn't work hard at school . Speaking to US radio station z100, Mr Cowell . said he did not work at school but upped his game when he left. Being in the right place at the right time was often the key to . success, he claimed. He said: 'I didn't work hard when I was at school. I left at 16 and I didn't have any qualifications. 'I was useless. The secret is to be useless at school and then get lucky.' But at a time when young people are being accused of lacking ambition, the X Factor boss became embroiled in a row with government ministers for failing to encourage the need to get good qualifications . Mr Gove, the Education Secretary, told MailOnline: 'This is an irresponsible and stupid thing to say. 'Teachers strive every day to ensure children understand the importance of learning, hard work and discipline. Simon Cowell’s comments undermine their efforts. 'The truth is that only a tiny fraction of people get lucky.  For everybody else, it’s all about hard work and that starts with hard work at school. Education Secretary Michael Gove . 'Celebrities like Mr Cowell should encourage education, not rubbish it.' However, a spokesman for Mr Cowell later insisted: 'This was quite clearly a joke made in a humorous radio interview and has been taken completely out of context.' Mr Cowell attended the private Dover College and then went on to Windsor Technical College. The 54-year-old, who is expecting his first child with girlfriend Lauren Silverman, said he made a lot of mistakes when he was first starting out and even had to move back to his parent's home. But he says he has learned from his failures and it has made him a better businessman. 'You make a ton of mistakes in the beginning and just hope you learn from them.' But politicians lined up to say education is important and slammed programmes like the X Factor for leading a generation of children to believe fame and fortune comes easily. Criticism: Education Secretary Michael Gove condemned Simon Cowell's remarks as 'irresponsible and stupid' The culture of finding fame fast . promoted by Mr Cowell has been linked to a reluctance among some young . people to commit themselves to achieving more at school. Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of . the influential education select committee, said: ‘For every Simon . Cowell and brilliant entrepreneur like Richard Branson who leave school . without qualifications, there are hundreds or thousands of young people . who are not achieving good English and Maths GSCEs who are condemning . themselves to a life of low aspirations and low wages. ‘X . Factor has already sent the wrong message to many young people that it . is all too easy to get rich quick on the back of  couple of hours’ worth . of performance. ‘The . reality of life is that careers take years of graft and that includes . having a strong education, particularly for those from deprived . backgrounds.’ Success: The X Factor brand turned Mr Cowell into a global success with shows being made in America and the UK . Earlier this month a study claimed companies choose to hire foreign . workers because young Brits have been taught by shows . like X Factor that they can start in high paid roles just because they . ‘want it’. Migrants . work harder and are better qualified for many jobs than those born in . the UK, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research found. By . comparison, many young people in Britain leave school without good . maths grades but think they are ‘too good’ for manual work because . reality TV talent contests have made them think they can be bypass hard graft. One respondent told the NIESR: . 'We . have a generation coming through who look very much at, we are going to . start at the top, it’s that X Factor, we can be famous in five . minutes.' From mail room to media mogul: Simon Cowell says a bit of luck got him to where he is today . After leaving school, Mr Cowell took up a few menial jobs before his father got him a job in the mail room at his record label - EMI. His real rise to fame came in 2004, when he created the X Factor using his production company SyCo. The runaway success of the series propelled him into the spotlight and made him a household name. X Factor branched out to America in 2011 and there are now editions of the show worldwide. Following on from the global triumphs of X Factor, Mr Cowell launched America's Got Talent in 2006 and a year later he appeared as a judge on Britain's Got Talent for the launch series with fellow stars Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan. Ratings may well have taken a tumble over recent years, but Simon Cowell is understood to have negotiated a new £150 million deal that will see The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent run until 2016.

A fraudster who stole £130,000 from the taxman by lying about his business expenses has escaped prison because he says his crimes were caused by bipolar disorder. Andrew Mottershead, an IT consultant, was awarded an income tax rebate after filing fraudulent self-assessment returns in which he exaggerated the size of his expenses. The 40-year-old spent the money on a sports car with a personalised number plate, golf holidays in Spain and £13,000 worth of jewellery for his wife. Fraud: Andrew Mottershead cheated the taxman out of £130,000 with fraudulent expenses claims . Officials at Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs found out about Mottershead's scam, but did not prosecute him after he promised to repay the £130,000. However, the fraudster, from Trafford in Greater Manchester, then attempted to steal another £260,000 from the taxman. Between May 2011 and September last year, he filed five false claims, Manchester Crown Court heard. Mottershead claimed that he committed his crimes while in the 'manic' phrase of bipolar II disorder, which causes extreme mood swings. The court heard that he is now being treated at the Priory, a private hospital which is favoured by celebrities. Couple: Mottershead spent £13,000 of his ill-gotten gains on buying jewellery for his wife . Bipolar II disorder is a mental illness which manifests itself as a less extreme form of manic depression. Sufferers tend to go through periods of depression coupled with episodes of 'hypomania', which is similar to mania but less intense. The symptoms include a lack of energy, suicidal thoughts, overactivity and a loss of inhibition. The causes of the illness are unknown, but are thought to be genetic and related to abnormal brain structure. It can be treated by lithium and other antidepressants, but is not curable. Mottershead pleaded guilty to cheating HMRC, and was given a two-year suspended sentence. Judge Robert Atherton told the defendant that he was a 'greedy man', but said that he would be lenient because of Mottershead's mental illness. 'Where the balance lies between bipolar disorder and greed is very difficult to assess, and I'm not equipped to do it,' the judge said. 'But I can't ignore the medical condition.' The court heard that telecoms company ShoreTel, where Mottershead worked for £50,000 a year, has kept the fraudster's job open for him. Earlier this year, another bipolar sufferer walked free from court after blaming his condition for making him throw a bottle at Usain Bolt during the London Olympics. Ashley Gill-Webb was convicted of public disorder for harassing the sprinting champion, but was only given a community order after a court heard that he was undergoing psychiatric treatment.","Andrew Mottershead, 40, filed false claims for business expenses .

With its classic shape and yellow-and-green pattern, it would not look out of place filled with flowers in a quiet home. And that is exactly where a priceless porcelain vase remained for decades - until it sold for nearly £3 million. The mystery owner of the 16-inch Chinese artefact had no idea of its staggering value when she inherited it from a family member. Instead she put flowers in it and placed it on a chest of drawers. Priceless: The 300-year-old vase is 16 inches high and depicts eight bats flying around clouds and flowers . Its true worth was only revealed when valuers from auction house Christie's visited the home to examine other Chinese ceramics. The family member who left the vase behind had bought it in New York from a well-known dealer in Chinese art, but it is thought its true value was underestimated. Pedram Rasti, an expert in Chinese art . at the auction house, said: The previous owners had inherited it and didn't really know a great deal about the vase other than that it was Chinese. 'They didn't quite understand the potential value of what they had. 'In . fact, when we arrived at their house to have a look at it and a few . other items it was sat on top of a cupboard with flowers in it. 'When my colleague saw the vase and realised what it was he was taken aback.' For decades the £3m vase was filled with flowers on top of a chest of drawers, its huge value unknown . The vase carries the mark of the Yongzheng emperor, who reigned from 1722 to 1735 at a landmark time for Chinese art. For the first time designers could use enamel made in China rather than importing it from Europe. That freed them to leave behind traditional blue and white porcelain and adorn their vases with bright colours. Ceramics were reserved for the richest homes and depicted natural scenes and floral patterns. They were made in Imperial kilns controlled by the government - destroying some smaller businesses. The kilns boasted some of the most advanced technology in the . world. The vase is made from porcelain with green and yellow enamel and depicts eight bats flying among clouds and flowers. The vase was auctioned to an Asian art trader for £2.65 million, bringing the total including a buyer's premium to £3 million. It completely outstripped its £200,000 estimate, to the shock of the auctioneers. Mr Rasti added: 'Chinese ceramics is a very strong market but it has gone up another notch in recent years. 'A vase from this period in this shape and colour scheme is almost unheard of. 'On top of that, demand for quality Imperial ceramics is very, very high. 'Even . back then the vase would have been a very important piece that would . have featured in the house of an equally important Chinese figure.'","Mystery owner inherited vase bought in 1961 - and she filled it with flowers .

The two cubs were named at 100 days old, in keeping with Chinese tradition which recognises that a large number of panda cubs die when they are very young . Giant Pandas are notoriously difficult to breed as they have naturally low sex drives and can accidentally crush their young shortly after birth because the cubs are so small . The 15-year-old female panda was artificially inseminated using sperm from her partner, Yang Yang, who was born with her at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. The pair are on loan to Zoo Atlanta, in Georgia, along with three others, The attraction pays yearly rent to China to keep them there and has alos donated $10million to panda conservation. There are thought to be jut 1,600 wild panda left, living on hilly mountain ranges in central China. The animals are notoriously difficult to breed, often lacking a sex drive, and sometimes accidentally crushing small cubs shortly after birth, leading to falling numbers in the wild. The 15-year-old Lun Lun was artificially inseminated using sperm from her partner Yang Yang who was born at the same centre as her in China . Lun Lun and Yang Yang are two of the five pandas at Zoo Atlanta which they rent from China for an annual fee . The pandas are endangered due to low breeding rate, and deforestation of bamboo forests which is all they eat . They also depend on bamboo forests for their sole food source, which have been decimated by human deforestation. A quirk of evolution means that the natural meat-eater has come to feed solely on plants, and its digestive system extracts precious little energy from the stalks it eats. As a result pandas must eat 23 to 36lb (12 to 15 kg) of bamboo each day which takes them an astonishing 12 hours, meaning they are particularly vulnerable if food starts to disappear.","Mother Lun Lun, 15, has been given both twins to look after .

A builder was hospitalised for four days and underwent two operations after he was bitten by a false widow spider. Steve Davies needed 12 stitches and almost lost his thumb when his hand swelled to twice its normal size as venom spread up his arm. Plastic surgeons had to peel back the skin from his thumb to remove the poison after the 45-year-old was bitten for the second time in a year. Bite: Steve Davies in hospital after being bitten on his thumb by a false widow spider . Agony: The builder's thumb swelled up immediately, left, and he required 12 stitches, right . 'My hand just swelled up with all the poison and it was incredibly painful and double the size,' Mr Davies said. 'It honestly felt like it was going to explode. 'The plastic surgeons said I was lucky not to lose the thumb because the poison had gone into the muscle. 'They had to knock me out to slice it open in a huge zig-zag shape and peel back the skin like a banana to get to all of the poison. 'But they had to leave it all open so they could get back in the next day to check for more, and I was in hospital for four days. 'All that for a tiny spider bite - I couldn't believe it.' Contrast: Mr Davies' hands after he was first bitten by a false widow on his right hand last year . In hospital: The 45-year-old had to have two operations to drain the venom from his arm in August . Mr Davies, from Muswell Hill in North London, received his first false widow bite on his finger in August last year while working in a garden. He went to hospital when his hand swelled up and was given intravenous antibiotics to fight the infection, which was cured within a few days. In August this year, he was again bitten on his right thumb while clearing out a shed. 'I felt it this time straight away and I knew what it was this time - it was very painful,' he said. Swelling: The first time Mr Davies was bitten, right, his hand recovered within a few days, but the second bite, right, had more serious consequences . Danger: This year has apparently seen an epidemic of bites from the false widow spider (file photo) Doctors gave him antibiotics, but his hand turned red and doubled in size, and eventually the venom spread up his arm, turning the whole limb red. He returned to A&E three days after being bitten, and was sent to see specialist surgeons at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead. Mr Davies was put under general anaesthetic as doctors removed the toxic poison and after 12 stitches, four days on the ward and a further two weeks off work he was back on the building site. But the bite was so severe he thinks he could need further surgery. 'I still wake up every day with a very stiff thumb and all my fingers,' he said. 'They think the poison has spread into the fingers, and obviously they didn't actually clear those out.'

Brave: James Fletcher, eight, lost a testicle on his birthday after bullies kicked him at school . Police are investigating after an eight-year-old schoolboy lost a testicle after bullies kicked him between the legs on his birthday. James Fletcher was rushed to hospital and needed emergency surgery after his parents found him writhing in pain because he had been too embarrassed to tell anyone what had happened. Mother and father Anne-Marie and Daniel Fletcher were outraged and immediately tried to pull him out of Landau Forte Academy Moorhead, Alvaston, Derby. But brave James, who was set upon during break-time, has vowed not to be beaten by bullies and has returned to school. 'I feel sad about what happened but I wanted to go back to school,' the schoolboy said. Surgeons had to rush to save James' other testicle after it was damaged by the kick on his eighth birthday on October 18. His parents have now spoken to both the school and the police, with both having launched investigations. But almost a month after the attack, nothing has been done, insists his mother. Mrs Fletcher, 28, said: 'I feel angry and annoyed that whoever did this has not been dealt with yet. 'I wanted to take James out of the school while the investigation took place and I looked at putting him in another school. 'But James turned to me and his dad and said 'No-one is scaring me. I want to go back to school' which I thought showed amazing bravery on his part after all he has been through.' James was playing with a friend when he said he was approached by a boy who kicked him between the legs. Unhappy: James parents Anne-Marie and Daniel offered their son the chance to go to a new school but the student has vowed to face the bullies and has gone back . He carried on his day in agony, even refusing to tell his parents until 2am the following day when they heard him screaming in pain. His parents, who also have sons Daniel, 11 and Joshua, 14 months, rushed him to the nearest NHS walk-in centre and medics referred him to the Royal Derby Hospital, where he underwent a scan. Mrs Fletcher added: 'It revealed that one of his testicles was hugely swollen. 'He had keyhole surgery to remove one of them as doctors told us it had died and the other one had to be repaired.' Probe: The head of Landau Forte Academy Moorhead (pictured) said it is investigating what happened and the police are also involved . James' father Daniel, 31, a burglar alarm engineer, said his was making an excellent recovery but that he was worried how his son might be affected in the future. 'The injuries were horrific and only time will tell what the future brings for him. We just don't know,' he said. 'We want something done with the lad that did this because not only has he caused this to our son - but what if he feels he has the right to do this to other children at the school? 'Their injuries might be even worse than the one James has suffered.' A Derbyshire Police spokesman said the incident had been reported to them. The spokesman said: 'Officers have spoken to the alleged victim and to the school and the investigation is on-going.' Sally Greenbank, principal for the juniors site of Landau Forte Academy Moorhead, said: 'A full internal investigation has been conducted and the appropriate authorities informed'. Yesterday an inquest heard how a 14-year-old boy who dyed his hair brown in an effort to stop bullies attacking him for being ginger was found hanged by his father. Simon Walters - who was a pupil at Heath Park School in Wolverhampton, West Midlands - was discovered dead in his bedroom by his 42-year-old father Nigel, with whom he lived alone.","Police investigating after James Fletcher was attacked on his birthday .

Spain has been cleared by European officials for increasing security along the Gibraltan border and causing up to six hours of delays. The European Commisssion ruled that Spain hasn't broken any EU laws by imposing the stringent checks. Instead it recommended that Britain works with its European neighbour to bring down tobacco smuggling and other border crime, reasons given by Spain for upping security. Border queues have been causing diplomatic tensions as Gibraltar citizens claim they are in retaliation for trying to build an artificial reef in disputed waters . However, it did say that the crossing point is 'challenging, . in view of the heavy traffic volumes in a relatively confined space and . the increase in tobacco smuggling into Spain'. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We welcome the commission's recommendations that the Spanish government should take measures to ensure that the Gibraltar-Spain border functions efficiently, and the commission's commitment to review progress against their recommendations in six months.' Gibraltar has long believed that the checks were put in place after it decided to build an artificial reef in contested waters off the island. The ensuing diplomatic row saw the Rock's chief minister Fabian Picardo . brand the Spanish government 'neanderthal' after likening its actions to North Korea. However Spanish officials says they are necessary to stop smuggling and have nothing to do with disputes over Gibraltar's sovereignty . The allegations were made after Spain's foreign minister Jose Manuel . Garcia-Margallo threatened to charge motorists £43 a time to cross. Gibraltar also . accused Spain of flying military jets across the island, sailing boats . into British waters, and even claimed the military shot at a jet-skier as he rode waves near the coast. Up to 10,000 vehicles a day were individually checked in 30 degree heat at the peak of the crisis in July, leading to six hour queues to leave the territory. In August Britain sent ten warships, including aircraft carrier Illustrious, to take part in military exercises in British waters, with three ships, including HMS Westminster, stopping at a base on the island. Despite the move following just days after Gibraltar's chief minister asked for more ships, British officials said the exercise was routine.","European Commission says Spain isn't breaking law with border checks .

A group of veteran bellringers - including their 90-year-old leader - were forced to flee their church tower after a bell broke loose and crashed through two floors towards them. The eight admitted today that when the 50kg instrument plunged . down through the 600-year-old church tower it 'scared the living daylights out of them'. One parishioner tripped and fell in the rush to leave St Peter & St Paul Church in Kilmersdon, Somerset, but luckily nobody was seriously injured because the bell got stuck 30ft above their heads. It tolls for thee: The huge bell which crashed through the ceiling of a church in Kilmersdon, Somerset, after a group of bellringers aged up to 90 gave it a hefty tug. Another of the bells is said to be 'hanging by a thread' Saved from the bell: John Fowler and his fellow bellringers Steve Beck, Sid Johnson, Pat Rich, Barry Langan, Chris Harvey and Dennis Taylor, who were forced to flee when a 50kg instrument crashed down during practice . It has caused so much structural damage that the church has now been sealed off and emergency works started in case the five other bells also fall down. Veteran bellringer Sid Johnson, 79, who first started there as a 14 year-old, said: 'The bell came adrift and jammed between two beams which is incredibly lucky really. Terrifying: The distance fallen by the 50kg bell through the church tower as bellringers fled below . 'No one is allowed back in there at the moment because it is so dangerous. I believe the hundredweight bell is just hanging on by a thread.' The drama happened on November 5 after one of the group noticed the tenor bell was proving difficult to ring during their regular Tuesday practice session. They gave a hefty tug on their rope - and the main axis spindle of the bells broke and sent one plunging down the church tower. The bell smashed into the timber beams in the clock chamber floor and scattered timberwork and debris. Emergency engineers were called in and they immediately closed the church, which remains shut. The engineers have temporarily secured the remaining five bells to stop them from falling and causing any further damage. Church vicar Sue Greatorex said: 'The bell which has fallen down is the fifth - if it had been the tenor bell there could have been very serious consequences. 'It has caused significant damage but we hope that it can be swiftly repaired and we can hold services at the church again within the week. 'The bell ringers are very shaken but thankfully managed to escape without serious injury, although one person suffered bruising as they fell down the stairs.' The bellringers are from the local Radstock group who practice at the church between 7.30pm and 9pm every Tuesday. They are led by the oldest bell ringer in the Bath and Wells Diocese, 90-year-old John Fowler, who first began bell ringing as a 12-year-old in 1933. Dangerous: The village church in Kilmersdon, Somerset, is shut and clergy are investigating. Vicar Sue Greatorex said: 'If it had been the tenor bell there could have been very serious consequences' The bell ringing community have responded in shock and amazement at the 'very rare' incident. Michael Hansford, from Bishops Lydeard, Somerset, said: 'I have never heard of anything like this in my 42 years of ringing. 'What happened in Kilmersdon was a freak and very rare accident and I'd be surprised if I hear of another incident like this in my lifetime.' The Bath and Wells diocese is now carrying out an investigation. Andy Piggott, Archdeacon of Bath, said: 'We are very grateful to God that no one was seriously injured. 'The fallen bells have now been secured by experts and we've been assured that they're now completely safe. 'It must have come as quite a shock to the bell ringers below. 'The PCC at Kilmersdon is working with engineers to investigate what could have caused this to happen. 'Every church in the diocese is thoroughly inspected by a qualified architect every five years. The church insurers also inspect churches on a regular basis.'","Bellringers scrambled to flee 600-year-old church in Kilmersdon, Somerset .

A 'person of interest' has been found in the unsolved murder of a young couple who were tortured and strangled on their way home from a Valentine's dance 42 years ago. Cold case investigators refuse to name the man that they have pinpointed in the brutal killings of Jesse McBane, 19, and 20-year-old Patricia Mann who were found murdered at a 'lover's lane' in Orange County, North Carolina in 1971. Dubbed the 'Valentine's Day killings' the bodies were found 13 days after they had left a dance at the hospital in Durham where Miss Mann was training to be a nurse. Jesse McBane, 19, and 20-year-old Patricia Mann, were killed in 1971 after attending a Valentine's Day dance. There bodies were found tied up and strangled. No one has ever been charged with their killings . The couple's bodies were found tied to a tree in this secluded woodland in Orange County, North Carolina . The couple were last seen at around 11.30pm leaving the building and heading for the secluded spot. Orange County sheriff's investigator Dawn Hunter told WRAL: 'They were probably approached by someone who made them get out of the . car.' Police believe that the couple, who had planned to get married, were sadistically tortured. Investigator Tim Horne Horne told the station: 'Evidence from the autopsy and at the scene tended to indicate that they were strangled over a period of time. 'It wasn’t one continuous pulling tight of a rope around their neck to strangle them to death. 'It appeared to be a situation where the rope was tightened, then they let it go, let them regain their breath, regain consciousness, possibly, and then they were strangled again.' The young couple were last seen leaving this building which used to be Watts Hospital in Durham, North Carolina following a Valentine's Day dance in 1971 . Miss Mann and Mr McBane's bodies were discovered fully clothed and tied up. They were missing for almost two weeks when a land surveyor spotted their bodies tied to the base of a tree. An autopsy report revealed that they had tight, knotted ropes around their wrists and necks, with another rope tying their bodies together. A medical examiner said that the couple had puncture wounds to the chest but those were probably inflicted post-mortem. The trainee nurse also had a half-inch tear in her liver which may have been caused by being punched in the stomach, according to an autopsy report. Rumors swirled as the small community came to terms with the shocking deaths with one report that the killer could be a doctor at the local hospital. It has long been suspected that the person who committed the brutal murders knew the remote area well. Now police have identified a 'person of interest' in the area, who is still alive. They refused to reveal further details.","Jesse McBane, 19, and 20-year-old Patricia Mann last seen leaving a Valentine's dance in 1971 .

Ella Hysom, 15, who disappeared during treatment for depression, was brought back safe and well to her family after a member of the public recognised her from an appeal in the Daily Mail. Yesterday her mother Alison, 43, said the family was beginning the long journey of convincing Ella she is beautiful. Hopefu: Alison Hysom, 43 (left) the mother of 15-year-old Ella Hysom (right) who disappeared last week, said her family is now beginning the long journey to make the schoolgirl believe she is beautiful . Mrs Hysom said: ‘I have gone from being really, really worried to being delighted and relieved that she was found, and found safe. ‘When we saw her I wanted to hold her, hug her and never let her go. I have been through every emotion in the last 24 hours. I still cannot sleep, I still cannot register that we have got her back safely.’ Mrs Hysom, who runs a training company, said she now wants her ‘beautiful’ and ‘intelligent’ daughter to realise her potential. ‘What is important to understand is that she does have a mental illness and she is very depressed and she still needs to receive treatment for that to get better,’ she said. ‘The thing with depression is that it is not an illness that heals in the same way that a wound does. We have got a long way to go to ensure Ella is mentally fit and healthy. ‘We are going to spend a lot of  time with her and the next step is to focus on her treatment so she can have a positive future as every 15-year-old deserves.’ Ella was deputy head girl at her school in Colchester, Essex, and a keen rower. ‘Before she became ill she was incredibly driven, she has a phenomenal amount of potential,’ Mrs Hysom said. ‘She was predicted As for her GCSEs and had won all these cups for rowing. ‘She has so much potential and we now need to help her to see that, but it will take a while I think. Returned: The 15-year-old was brought back home safe and well to her family after a member of the public recognised her from the appeal in the Daily Mail . ‘As part of her depressive illness  she had very low self-esteem, so whilst we on the outside can see she is stunningly beautiful, 5ft 10in, slim  and gorgeous, she is not able to see that herself.’ Ella went missing around 1pm on Monday close to a residential clinic in Ilford, East London, where she had been treated for six weeks. She had written a number of emotional messages on Twitter and Facebook that suggested she had split from a boyfriend who had found a new love. ‘The higher I get, the lower I sink. I can’t drown my demons, they know how to swim,’ she wrote. ‘I long for that feeling to not feel at all.’ Hours before she vanished she wrote online: ‘I just want to die and hopefully that will happen so I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning.’ Ella was found at lunchtime on Thursday when a shopper, who had seen her face on the front page of the Daily Mail recognised her as she walked around Ilford town centre. Her mother and father Tim, 43, found out their daughter was safe and well in a phone call from police. Mrs Hysom said: ‘We received a phone from our family liaison officer and I had to ask her to say it three times before it sank in because it was really, really emotional. I don’t know, it took a while to register.’ Ella was reunited with her parents at a police station in east London. Relieved: Mrs Hysom, pictured with her husband Ian, says she cannot sleep and still cannot register properly that they have got her back . ‘It was emotional,’ said Mrs Hysom. ‘Until then I had been holding it together and been focused on finding her. But then we had her, we could see her and touch her. All of our emotions came out. I’ve cried a lot. ‘I told her, “I am so glad that we found you and that you are safe”. I was so pleased to see her I just kept telling her that. ‘We just wanted to spend time with her, be with her, and make sure she felt secure and safe by the time the evening came. We were able to say good night to her and hold her.’ Ella has now returned to the clinic where she was receiving treatment and was yesterday spending time with her parents, 11-year-old sister and nine-year-old brother. During her three days away, Ella, who only had a small amount of money with her, had managed to find somewhere to sleep and enough food to survive. Mrs Hysom said she thought she may never see her daughter again, adding: ‘I’ve been sick with worry, I haven’t been able to sleep or eat. I have been living on coffee and the odd bit of chocolate since Monday. ‘It is the most distressing experience I have ever been through … I tried to stay hopeful the whole time and not think about all the worst possibilities.

Children’s medicines are a sickly pink, Ferraris are red, apple juice comes in green cartons and wine is red and white – or rose. However, a new orange or amber wine has arrived on shelves from Georgia, an eastern European country not universally known as a producer of fine vintages. No ordinary plonk: The new wine called Tblvino Quevris is from Kakheti in Georgia . In fact the Tblvino Quevris wine, which comes from Kakheti, Georgia, has a long and intriguing history. Georgia lays claim to being the birth place of viticulture and this wine is made from Rkatsiteli grapes, which are one of the oldest known varieties in the world. The evidence comes from the fact the seeds have been found in Georgian clay vessels that date back to 3000BC. The production method involves leaving the skins in contact with the juice for longer than usual period during fermentation, which results in the unique colour and complex taste. Following the 8,000 year old Georgian winemaking tradition, it is fermented and aged in traditional clay amphora, or ‘Qvevri’. Mid-range: The 'complex' wine is being sold for £8.99 per bottle at the retailer . Importantly, this is no cheap plonk, for the wine is being sold by Marks & Spencer at £8.99 a bottle. Wine expert from M&S, Jeneve Williams, said: ‘Most ‘normal’ white wines are produced by quickly separating the juice from the seeds and skins, keeping a pale colour. ‘Orange wines, or amber wines as they are often called are actually white wines produced more like reds – with prolonged contact with the crushed grape skins and seeds, resulting in a deeper colour from the pigments found in grape skins. ‘When visiting Georgia earlier this year to blend new wines, we were excited to try the style – and were impressed with the complexity of the wines. ‘Rather than being orange, they are actually more a deep amber or tawny colour and on the palate possess the texture, body and tannins of red wines with the fruit and minerality of white wines. ‘Increasingly our customers are becoming more adventurous and on the search for something a bit different. I think people will need to be open minded, but they will be rewarded with something unique.’","The wine called Tblvino Quevris has come from Kakheti in Georgia, .

Law enforcement officials in Ohio have issued a warrant for the arrest of a local couple who have returned their adopted son to the state after raising him for nearly a decade. Cleveland Cox, 49, and wife Lisa, 52, face a misdemeanor charge of recklessly abandoning the 9-year-old boy, whose name has not been released, after leaving him at Butler County Children Services last month. On Thursday, sheriff’s deputies made an attempt to arrest the parents, but they were not home. The Ohio couple also reportedly have taken their other two kids from school citing a family emergency. Adolf Olivas, an attorney appointed by the court to protect the child's legal interests, told the Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News that the parents said the boy behaved aggressively and would not agree to get help. In August, Mrs Cox filed a report with the local sheriff’s office claiming that her adoptive son suffers from mental issues, and that he threatened to kill everyone in the house with a knife. ‘According to Mrs. Cox [the boy] has outbursts every day but nothing this severe,’ the report stated. ‘Mrs. Cox explained that [the boy] has been hospitalized for these disorders and has been to Children's Hospital in Cincinnati on several occasions.’ The document went on to say that Lisa Cox wanted to take the 9-year-old to a hospital in Dayton and have him evaluated over a period of 72 hours, Dayton Daily News reported.

Festive fight: Heston Blumenthal and Nigella Lawson are at loggerheads over how to make the best roasties . Blumenthal, better known for his bizarre creations than traditional tastes, said: ‘Goose fat might make them crispy, but using beef dripping to cook them will give your roasties an unbeatable flavour that will make sure your festive feast is talked about well into the new year. ‘I use beef dripping every time – it beats goose fat hands down.’ Domestic Goddess Nigella, however, has been hailing goose fat as the must-have Christmas ingredient for years. Supermarket sales of the product more than doubled after she sang its praises in 2006. She favours it over other fats because its high smoking point – the point at which the oil burns – produces rich potatoes that stay crisp long after roasting. The heat of the fat is ‘crucial’, she has said, because ‘if it’s not searingly hot, you don’t stand a chance, and since goose fat has a very high smoking point and tastes good, it is my annual choice.’ Pro-goose: GBBO's Mary Berry says she uses goose fat for her potatoes . Mary Berry is another to have publicly backed goose fat. ‘It makes all the difference to the flavour of roast potatoes. ‘Don’t use too much, though, as this will simply make the potatoes go soggy,’ the Great British Bake Off star has said. Gordon Ramsay also swears by goose fat, having included it in his roast potato recipe on his Channel 4 show  Gordon’s Christmas Cookalong Live. Three-Michelin starred Fat Duck chef Blumenthal’s ardent backing of beef dripping may come as something of a surprise to those who follow his pronouncements closely. In the past he has taken a far more relaxed view to his choice of cooking fats and oils. Last year he said: ‘Personally, I’d use beef dripping if I was serving the potatoes with roast beef, and duck fat if I was serving them with duck, but as an all-round one, go for olive oil.’ That view put him in tune with Delia Smith, who also advocates using the fat from whatever meat is being roasted, or lard if there is nothing else. The 72-year-old was the face of Waitrose for three years along with Blumenthal until she was dropped ‘by mutual agreement’ from the store’s adverts earlier this year. Waitrose’s executive chef Jonathan Moore recently backed Heston’s support for dripping. He said: ‘Christmas is the time of year to showcase culinary skills... and beef dripping is a vital ingredient in creating something extraordinary.’ Battle: Heston insists that beef dripping is 'a vital ingredient' that will give potatoes the best flavour .","Heston Blumenthal says beef dripping makes the best roast potatoes .

A council has ordered a couple to rip up flowers outside their home over health and safety fears. Mary and William Geidt planted the roses, irises and other flowers ten years ago to brighten up a patch of grass outside their home. The couple, who live in the village of Great Cransley, Northamptonshire, claim a highways officer advised them to plant shrubs and flowers to reduce further damage to their property following two devastating floods. 'Petty': Mr and Mrs Geidt say they planted the flowers to brighten up the verge . Over the past decade the beauty of the flower bed has become renowned in the area with people stopping to take pictures of the displays. But Mrs Geidt, 62, and Mr Geidt, 69, were stunned when they received a letter from Northamptonshire County Council ordering them to dig up the flowers or face legal action. The couple believe it was reported after a council officer went to a neighbouring property in connection with a planning application and noticed the flower bed. Council bosses claim the flowers obstruct pedestrians view of the kerb which could cause them to stumble into the road. But Mr and Mrs Geidt say they have not received a single complaint in a decade and only receive compliments that the flowers brighten up the quiet road. Mrs Gedit, who is a full-time carer for her 91-year-old mother Margaret, said: 'It does not make any sense, because there is a perfectly good footpath on the opposite side of the road. Village: Mr and Mrs Geidt are being ordered to remove the flowerbed outside their home in Great Cransley, Northamptonshire . 'It seems petty and heavy handed and we feel like we're being singled out.' Mrs Geidt said she wanted to come to a compromise. 'Our cottage is set below the road, so our ground floor windows are at the same level as the road. 'The verge is steeply sloped. The lane is not cleared of snow or gritted and there were two minor accidents last winter. 'From our own experience we know it is difficult to see the edge of the road in snow and there is a real possibility of a serious accident if drivers skid down the bank into our cottage. 'The flower bed helps to make it very obvious were the edge of the road is.' she continued, 'We spend hours tending to the border and planting it each year, we spend money on buying the plants as well. 'It is tragic to think we might have to pull it all up, we are willing to compromise but a sensible compromise.' In a letter to the couple last month, the council said: 'It is occasionally possible to grant a licence to cultivate the public highway . 'It is unlikely a licence would be granted for the shrubs in situ, as some species are not encouraged because of their growth nature and form.' Mr Geidt, who runs his own utilities consultancy, added; 'The border is very narrow, probably only 18 inches and there is footpath just the other side of the road where there is street lighting. 'There are only a few houses and a footpath at the end of the cul-de-sac so there usually more walkers along here than cars. 'To me, this decision is quite literally blooming petty. There is no other way to describe it.' The council stood by their ruling. A spokesman for Northamptonshire County Council said: 'Regrettably, highways law, which the county council has to comply with, is very strict when it comes to safety regulations regarding roads. 'In this instance the flower beds and shrubs interfere with visibility and so we have asked for the vegetation to be removed.' Upset: The couple say they have spent time and money making the verge look pretty and want to come to a compromise with the council . 'Interfere with visibility': The council says it wants the vegetation to be removed .

With its snow-white coat and bright pink ears, this albino kangaroo stands out in stark contrast to its grey-coloured relatives. The rare animal, believed to be two years old, was spotted roaming bushland near Canberra, Australia. It has stunned wildlife experts - with albino kangaroos usually expected to die very young. Rare sighting: The albino kangaroo was spotted by a ranger at Namadgi National Park near Canberra, Australia . The marsupials' startling white coats are believed to attract a higher number of predators, including wild foxes, dogs and even eagles. Meanwhile, albino kangaroos are also more likely to develop skin cancer and sunburn, as well as having a genetic predisposition towards sight and hearing difficulties, according to The Canberra Times. The adorable animal, believed to be an eastern grey kangaroo, was spotted by a ranger at Namadgi National Park, 25 miles southwest of Canberra, last weekend. It is believed to be female, and has been nicknamed 'Renee' by staff at the 106,000-hectare park. Variant: The adorable animal, nicknamed 'Renee', differs in appearance from typical eastern greys, right . Ranger Brett McNamara told The Canberra Times he was surprised the albino kangaroo had survived for so long in the wild. 'Grey kangaroos are grey for a reason — they blend in with the rest of the environment,' he said. However, he said the animal’s close proximity to its family may have helped to protect it from potential dangers - adding: 'They do form very close-knit mobs within that valley'. Park rangers have refused to disclose the kangaroo's exact location - fearing that illegal hunters might view the rare creature as a prize souvenir. 'We are concerned about its ongoing welfare because of some illegal hunting activities that do occur in the park,' said Mr McNamara. Albinism - characterised by a lack of the pigment melanin - is extremely rare within the kangaroo species, similar to other species.","Kangaroo spotted at Namadgi National Park near Canberra, Australia .

Micheal Yarwood, 42, contracted flesh-eating bacteria after the animal stabbed him with its poisonous barb while swimming in he sea with his two children. Micheal and his daughter Holly, 14, and son Callum, 17, were watching dolphins swimming at the time of the accident. Micheal Yarwood was attacked by a stingray while on holiday in Florida with his son Callum, 17, daughter Holly, 14, and wife Natalie, 41 . He initially went back to his hotel but when the foot swelled to double its normal size he went to see medics who gave him a tetanus shot and antibiotics . The family were wading in water up to their waist near St Petersburg when Michael felt a sharp stabbing pain in his right foot.A stingray and lanced him, causing a 4in deep wound. He made it back to shore where his wife Natalie, 41, poured water over the heavily bleeding wound before wrapping it in a towel. The electrical engineer, from Middleton, Greater Manchester, drove back to his hotel but by the next morning his foot was double its normal size. Medics initially gave him a tetanus shot and antibiotics, but after he came down with a fever and started uncontrollably shaking he went to hospital. There doctors told him he had contracted a potentially deadly flesh-eating bacteria, which thrives in saltwater has already killed 10 people in Florida this year, and warned him he could lose his foot. However, after five days in hospital on an IV drip, Micheal recovered and was able to travel home, though he still need a stick to walk. When he developed a fever and started uncontrollably shaking, he went to hospital where doctors told him he had contracted a flesh-eating bacteria and warned him he could lose his foot . The Vibrio vulnificus bacteria has already killed 10 people in Florida this year but Michael recovered after five days on antibiotics . He said: 'It's a lot better now. I'm pottering about, even though it's still painful. It's nowhere near as bad as it was. 'If it had been one of my children - who were two feet away from me - it could have been a different story.' The £5,000 holiday had been a treat for son Callum ahead of his 18th birthday, and they had driven out from their Bahama Bay resort to North Beach as it is regarded as the most beautiful in the US. Mr Yarwood is now warning holidaymakers going to Florida to be wary of the sea and says he is thankful the insurance he took out covered his $20,000 medical bill. In 2006 TV's famous 'crocodile hunter' Steve Irwin was killed by a stingray while diving off Australia. The Vibrio vulnificus bacteria is transmitted via open wounds and lives in warm, salty water. When it comes in contact with damaged skin, it can cause lesions. High-risk individuals, such as those with liver disease or cancer, have a 50% fatality rate. About half of all infections require dead tissue to be removed, or a body part to be amputated. Illness usually begins within one to three days of exposure, but can take up to a week. Symptoms include fever, swelling and redness of skin on arms or legs, with blood-tinged blisters, low blood pressure and shock. Florida averages 50 cases, 45 hospitalizations and 16 deaths annually, the most in the Gulf Coast region, according to the state Department of Health. Across the US about 95 cases, 85 hospitalizations and 35 deaths happen every year.","Micheal Yarwood, 42, was on holiday with his family in Florida .

It is alleged that Thexton was involved in a series of robberies where homeowners would be tied up and forced to disclose alarm codes and safe combinations. An officer then walked over to the car to speak to the driver and reached into the vehicle to remove the keys from the ignition, a Lancashire Police spokesman said. 'At this point the car was driven away, trapping the officer's arm and dragging him a short distance down the road. 'Fortunately, the officer freed himself before he was seriously injured. The car was then driven away at speed, mounting the kerb, narrowly missing pedestrians,' they added. It was found a short time later having been set on fire on Fernham Carr Lane. Detective Inspector Bev Foster said: 'Following the incident, we have set up a team of officers dedicated to tracking this person down and we are liaising with a number of other forces across England as well as the National Crime Agency.

Mr Cameron is pressing the Sri Lankan regime to do more to improve conditions for the minority Tamil population still suffering the effects of a 26-year civil war which ended in 2009. Yesterday he visited families still unable to return to their homes after spending 20 years in refugee camps, in the first visit by a foreign leader to the region since 1948. In what he described as 'frank' talks with president Mahinda Rajapaksa the PM said he would press for an international investigation of alleged war crimes if the regime failed to hold a credible one by March.

They were there to talk about the sportsman's initiative to bring together youngsters from Tamil and other communities through cricket as part of post-war reconciliation efforts. But asked about the politician's calls for more action from the government of Mr Rajapaksa - which has been criticised internationally over human rights abuses - Muralitharan, a Tamil, said Mr Cameron was underestimating the improvements already made. 'I'm a sportsman and we don't think about politics,' he told reporters. 'My opinion is, there were problems in the last 30 years in those areas. Mr Cameron later admitted the retired star may have gone a little easy on him . 'Nobody could move there. In wartime I went with the UN, I saw the place, how it was. Now I regularly go and I see the place and it is about a 1,000 per cent improvement in facilities. 'Cricket is the main game to narrow the bridge between the people. But facilities-wise, schools are built, roads are built. Businesses are started. So many things have happened. It is improving. 'Thanks to the Sri Lankan army, they are putting a lot of effort there. This country is 20-odd million people. In the north there are only one million people. They are getting more attention than the south at the moment.' Mr Cameron later tweeted this picture and said: 'He went easy on me - but at least I can say Murali didn't get me out...' Gloves off: David Cameron speaks with Sri Lankan spin bowler Muttaiah Muralitharan (left) after trying his hand at batting . Asked about Mr Cameron's stance, Muralitharan said: 'He must have been misled by other people. 'People speak without going and seeing the things there. I go on and off. I see from my eyes there is improvement. 'I can't say the Prime Minister is wrong or not. He's from England, he hasn't seen the site, he hasn't gone and visited these places - yesterday only. 'But other than that, the political side ... basically what we want is food, shelter, education, happiness in the family.' Mr Cameron said it was an 'enormous pleasure' to meet the bowler - who took a record 800 Test wickets. Asked about Muralitharan's comments at a press conference, the Prime Minister said: 'I think he acknowledged that I was right to come and right to visit.

'Of course I was told all sorts of things yesterday in the north and there are very strong views in this country, strong differing views on some of the issues. 'I would say what matters is not everything I was told but what I myself have said, and I think I've given a fair reflection of some of the things that need to happen in terms of reconciliation, in terms of progress, in terms of human rights, free speech, and I think it's important to raise these issues.' Mr Cameron made clear he backed the March deadline for a new 'credible, transparent and independent' war crimes probe set by UN human rights chief Navi PIllai to coincide with her next report on Sri Lanka.

MrCameron sits with other heads of state as Sri Lanka remained defiant against calls for an independent inquiry into alleged atrocities committed during its 27-year civil war . She has warned the country is heading in an increasingly authoritarian direction. 'If that investigation is not completed by March then I will use our position on the UN Human Rights Council to work with the UN Human Rights Commissioner and call for a full, credible and independent international inquiry,' Mr Cameron told reporters. He said he had urged Mr Rajapaksa to act to provide homes for refugees, end the intimidation and beating of journalists and work with newly elected Tamil regional leaders. 'I accept it takes time but what matters is being on the right pathway, getting on the right track,' he said. While Mr Cameron has attended, the Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, and Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Signh have confirmed they will not attend . 'It was a frank meeting. Of course not . everything I said was accepted. But I sensed that they do want to make . progress on these issues and it will help, frankly, by having . international pressure.' Mr Cameron has come under fire from campaigners for not joining the leaders of Canada, India and Mauritius in boycotting the summit in protest over human rights. But he insisted that his visit justified his judgment that he could achieve more by attending and using the occasion to highlight issues and raise them directly. 'Britain has shown that we will stand up for our values and do all we can to advance them, Of course, you can only do that by being here.' Mr Cameron had another short meeting before leaving the summit with Mr Rajapaksa at the request of the Sri Lankan leader - which he hailed as a sign that progress could be made. 'We discussed more of the issues we discussed yesterday,' he said. 'I think that demonstrates really two things: first of all you can have frank and clear conversations but an ongoing dialogue. 'Secondly these issues are not solved by one visit, this is not a flash in the pan, it's a dialogue, a conversation, pressure that we need to keep up over the longer term and I'm committed to doing that.' He was speaking as he arrived in Dubai to press the case for British firms seeking orders for aircraft at its airshow, which starts tomorrow. The Government is optimistic of securing a deal with the United Arab Emirates to buy Eurofighter Typhoon military aircraft over a French rival.

World-renowned professional poker player Archie Karas, has been arrested on charges of cheating and defrauding a casino after authorities say he was caught marking cards at a California blackjack table. Karas, 62, best known for reputedly building a beginning stake of $50 into a $40 million fortune during a record three-year winning streak, was taken into custody on Tuesday at his Las Vegas home, the San Diego County District Attorney's Office said on Friday. He will be extradited to San Diego to face a criminal complaint filed last week charging him with burglary, winning by fraudulent means and cheating, the prosecutor's office said. Caught: World-renowned professional poker player Archie Karas, has been arrested on charges of cheating and defrauding a casino after authorities say he was caught marking cards at a California blackjack table . Early days: Archie Karas pictured as a young gambler . Caught: Karas is best known for reputedly building a beginning stake of $50 into a $40 million fortune during a record three-year winning streak . If convicted, Karas, whose real name is Anargyros Karabourniotis, faces a maximum penalty of three years in prison. ‘This defendant's luck ran out thanks to extraordinary cooperation between several different law enforcement agencies who worked together to investigate and prosecute this case,’ said county District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis. According to prosecutors, Karas was spotted by surveillance cameras marking cards - using tiny smudges of dye secretly wiped onto the backs of jacks, queens, kings and aces - while playing blackjack in July at the Indian-owned Barona Resort and Casino in Lakeside, California. The marks gave Karas an unfair advantage by helping him identify the value of cards before they were dealt as he chose whether to take another card, or hold, in an effort to reach the winning value of 21 without going over, prosecutors said. California cheating: Archie Karas was caught on a Barona Casino surveillance camera marking cards. Authorities say he cheated the casino of $8,000 . Technique: Authorities haven't specified how Karas marked the cards but professionals have suggested ways in which it could be done . The scheme worked so well that he managed to cheat the casino out of more than $8,000 before he was caught, district attorney's office spokesman Steve Walker said. California Justice Department spokeswoman Michelle Gregory said Karas was doing the marking with dye inserted into a hollowed-out gambling chip that he would inconspicuously swipe over the cards while playing through a deck. A search warrant executed on Karas's home turned up hollowed-out chips from other casinos, but so far no other gambling establishments have lodged complaints against him, Gregory said. But authorities said Karas has been accused of cheating before. ‘The Nevada Gaming Control Board has investigated Karas on multiple occasions resulting in four arrests,’ said Karl Bennison, that agency's enforcement chief, said in a statement. ‘Karas has been a threat to the gaming industry in many jurisdictions.’ Everyone's a winner: Karas lost only one game from 1992 to 1995, winning around $40 million in a streak known as ""The Run"". But friends say that by 1996, he had lost most of his winnings . Karas set the record for the largest and longest documented winning streak in gambling history from 1992 to 1995, arriving in Las Vegas with $50 in his pocket and going on to amass $40 million from high-stakes poker. He subsequently lost most of those winnings at baccarat and dice games in three weeks, according to Tom Sexton, who publishes the online gambling magazine Poker News. Karas returned to the poker table many times, often with backers, and cleaned out many of the best players in the world, according to Sexton. He is considered by many to have been the greatest gambler of all time and often has been compared with Nick ‘the Greek’ Dandolos, another high-stakes gambler and high roller who died in 1966. San Diego County has 19 federally recognized Indian tribes and 10 Indian casinos, more than any other county in the United States. Industry experts estimate that casinos nationwide lose tens of millions of dollars a year in various cheating scams.","Archie Karas turned $50 into $40 million over a three-year streak .

Jacksonville Jaguars defender Jason Babin came out of a pileup in a Sunday game against the Arizona Cardinals with a fistful of hair . Babin, 33, held the hair aloft for a moment like a trophy. Then, perhaps realizing that hair doesn't bronze well, defiantly chucked it all to the ground. The hair-raising tackle has occurred in the past--to such tress-sporting players as Troy Polamalu--but not in recent memory has the player lost the hair. Ouch: Andre Ellington, a Cardinals running back (pictured here during his years at Clemson) is now short several dreadlocks . Write caption here . Limp victory: After the pride subsided, or perhaps after he realized hair doesn't make a great trophy, Babin tossed the locks to the ground . Now 24-year-old Ellington has little to be do short of waiting for it to grow back. He wore his hair outside his helmet at his own peril. According to NFL rules, yanking exposed hair is fair play. The rule, implemented in 2003, says that it is legal to grab a player's hair because it's deemed part of the uniform. Ellinton may have gotten the last laugh, though. His Arizona Cardinals trounced Babin's Jaguars 27-14. Cold comfort: Ellington can do little but lick his wounds and wait for his hair to grow back.

This is JJ Forsyth-Johnson, Sir Bruce Forsyth’s only child with third wife Wilnelia Merced, pictured for the first time with his heavy metal band JunkCake. JJ Forsyth plays bass in his band Junk Cake at the Dublin Castle in Camden, London. He is Sir Bruce Forsyth's only child with third wife Wilnelia Merced . Given that his 85-year-old father is known for his wholesome brand of light family entertainment, it may come as something of a shock to learn that the 25-year-old was thrashing out something altogether more edgy in a dingy London pub. While Sir Bruce will command an audience of millions this evening when he hosts Strictly Come Dancing, on this occasion JJ managed a smattering of just 12 onlookers, most of whom were decked out in leather and spikes. Educated at £33,000-a-year Charterhouse School, one of the country’s foremost public schools, the musician took to the stage wearing  a dress shirt and smart trousers while his bandmates were all in jeans and T-shirts. His performance at the Dublin Castle pub in Camden, north London, is a far cry from his cultured upbringing listening to his father’s jazz records and mother’s favourite salsa songs at the family’s £5m mansion in Surrey. JJ, real name Jonathan Joseph,  said: ‘My dad has really inspired me. I grew up with jazz, lots and lots of jazz and my mum is into salsa because she is from Puerto Rico, so that was a big part of my childhood. It’s definitely in the blood. ‘I have been playing music for 10 years. It’s always been a hobby. All my family are into music. We are just gigging, we’ve been playing for two years now, just for ourselves. Now we’re looking to the future. We haven’t got any management and we can’t really do it ourselves. We need a bit of guidance.

He knows what we’re up to. ‘It’s not the sort of stuff he’s used to but he supports us in everything we do, he’s great like that. We’re recording and gigging but we’re all doing a lot of different things, so it’s hard to get it going. ‘We’re all busy, but we have massive inspiration.’ The band have told fans on their Facebook page that they model themselves after punk rockers Rage Against the Machine and heavy metal band Metallica. Earlier this year it was revealed that Sir Bruce’s 32-year-old grandson Luke Purdie is a tattooed, hair-flicking, head-banging lead singer of a heavy metal band called Voodoo Six. Sir Bruce recently braved an Iron Maiden concert just to see the band at London’s O2 Arena, where they were supporting the US rockers. Mr Purdie, from Ramsgate, Kent, is the son of Sir Bruce’s second daughter, 55-year-old Julie Forsyth. He said recently: ‘To him Voodoo is all noise. I thought he would get some bits but he just sees it as a bit too full-on for him. I get his stuff but he doesn’t really get my stuff.’ Mr Purdie’s sister Sophie, 22, has followed in her grandfather’s footsteps, duetting with him on an album Sir Bruce released  in 2011. Sir Bruce currently commands more than 10m viewers each week on Strictly Come Dancing and also performed to a packed crowd at this year’s Glastonbury Festival. Last year he entered the Guinness book of World Records for having the longest career as a male TV entertainer. He was recognised for a career that has spanned more than 70 years. He added recently: ‘Everybody says what a charming young man JJ is.

Over 10,000 people were initially feared killed by Haiyan, more than 3,000 have been confirmed dead by Philippine officials as of Friday. Hundreds of thousands more are displaced or without food, water or electricity. Don't forget their plight: The Empire State Building was illuminated Friday in the colors of the Philippine flag .

Breakthrough: Engineers say the speed which steam is funnelled through the spout is why a kettle whistles . When you finally get home after a hard day’s work, the whistle of a stove-top kettle can be a truly comforting sound. Until now, scientists have been unable to explain what makes the noise. But a group of Cambridge University researchers say they have found the reason – and it’s to do with the speed steam is funnelled through the spout when you’re making that all-important brew. They explained that as a kettle boils, the air moves faster and wobbles when it travels through the narrowest part of the spout. Then as the steam escapes it creates tiny ‘vortices’ – whirlwind-like eddies that can produce sound at certain frequencies. Although the finding might sound trivial, it could help solve other problems. Researcher Ross Henrywood said: ‘Pipes and vehicle exhausts are classic examples. ‘Once we know where the whistle is coming from, we can potentially get rid of it.’ Results show that as the kettle starts to boil, the whistle behaves like a Helmholtz resonator - the same mechanism that causes an empty bottle to hum when you blow over the neck. However, above a particular flow speed, the sound is instead produced by small vortices - regions of swirling flow - which, at certain frequencies, can produce noise. The study tested a series of simplified kettle whistles in an apparatus by forcing air through them at various speeds. The resulting sound produced by rushing air was recorded, the frequency and amplitude data of the sound were plotted, then analysed to identify trends. A two-microphone technique was also used to determine frequency inside the spout. Vortex production starts as steam comes up the kettle’s spout and meets a hole at the start of the whistle, which is much narrower than the spout itself. This contracts the flow of steam as it enters the whistle and creates a jet of steam passing through it. Revelation: Researchers at Cambridge University said the finding could solve problems with exhausts .","The speed steam is funnelled through the spout is why it makes a sound .

A paedophile has been jailed for 19 years after a school dinner lady overheard one of his victims talking about the abuse. Martin Thomas lured five girls into his home by offering to teach them about wildlife in his garden pond. But once they were there the 63-year-old retired trawlerman then forced them to take part in sex acts with him, Exeter Crown Court heard today. A child abuser has been jailed Exeter Crown Court (pictured) for 19 years after an alert school dinner lady overheard a young victim talking about her ordeal . Thomas was trapped after a dinner lady overheard a six-year-old girl talking . about male genitalia and suspected something was wrong. A police inquiry found Thomas had been preying on girls aged six to ten for almost a decade without any of his young victims summoning the courage to report what he had done. Thomas lived in Brixham, South Devon and targeted girls living nearby. Some of the victims came forward after learning of Thomas's initial court appearance in their local paper. He denied having touched any of the children but was found guilty after three of the girls gave almost identical accounts of being abused. Thomas, Brixham, denied a series of sexual offences but was found guilty of the rape of three girls, and indecency offences against two others. He was jailed for 19 years with a six year extended licence by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, at Exeter Crown Court. He told him: 'The level of depravity was exceptional and was your willingness to disregard the risk of detection. That adds to the dangerousness I attribute to you. 'The victims... were allowed to go to your house because you were trusted by their parents. 'When the opportunity arose you abused them. At the time they did not realise what was happening and they were unable to prevent you committing these offences. 'They know now what you did and the level of distress and pain they showed when reliving their experience was very apparent for all to see. Martin Thomas lived in Brixham, South Devon and targeted girls living nearby or who were friends of his own young son . 'Part of your excitement seems to have been derived from the fact you were running enormous risks. 'It was part of your pattern of depravity that you took as many risks as you could. It seems to be there is such a risk of future offending that you are a very dangerous man indeed.' During a week long trial all five girls gave evidence by video link or behind screens and told how they were abused at his home. A school dinner lady testified how she overheard a six-year-old girl talking with friends . She was so alarmed by what she heard she reported it to the head. The girl's mother was called in and initially could not believe what had happened but then went to the police. The victims all told similar stories of abuse and all remembered Thomas by his distinctive accent, which they thought to be Australian, even though he actually came from New Zealand. Thomas denied all the allegations and said he had only been alone with children on very rare occasions and that his wife was home most of the time. He said: 'All I have ever shown to those girls is kindness'.","Martin Thomas lured girls into home, offering to teach them about wildlife .

The grieving mother of one of the 19 wildland 'hotshots' killed in north-central Arizona has filed a $36 million claim against authorities, saying their negligence led to the death of her firefighter son. Marcia McKee, from Costa Mesa in California, filed a notice of claim on Friday accusing the state, Yavapai County and the city of Prescott of failing to follow proper firefighting procedures. McKee's 21-year-old son, Grant McKee, died in the Yarnell Hill Fire on June 30. Grieving: Marcia McKee, 49 (right) has accused the state of Arizona, Yavapai County and the city of Prescott of failing to follow proper firefighting procedures leading to the death of her son Grant, 19 (left) McKee is seeking $12 million apiece from the state, Yavapai County and Prescott. But she said she'll settle for $12 million within the next 60 days. In the claim, a precursor to a lawsuit, the single mom said she suffered tremendously when her 'best friend' and only son was taken away. It is the first claim from a family member of the 19 fallen members of the Prescott-run crew. 'It's . not supposed to be like this,' the 49-year-old wrote. 'No more Mother's Day cards . or phone calls. Nor will I ever get to see him walk down the aisle or be . called grandma. My life was also taken that day because he was my . life.' McKee, who works as a caretaker for an elderly person, recalled in her claim the last phone call she shared with her son in which she told him to be careful. According to the claim, Grant told her: 'What are the odds of me dying in a fire? Think about it, Mom.' Her attorney, Craig Knapp, wrote: 'The loss of his companionship, affection and love fully support the damages that she has requested in this notice of claim.' An investigative report by a team of national experts released in September found proper procedure was followed in the worst firefighting tragedy since September 11, 2001. The report, however, found communications lapses, including a 33-minute gap in radio traffic from the Hotshot crew in the hour before the men died. It did not determine if the tragedy was avoidable. Single mom: Marcia McKee (left) said her son Grant (right) was her 'life' Knapp called the report a whitewash with a goal of avoiding blame. He said any 'trusting, uninformed person reading the Yarnell Hill Fire report uncritically would think that the death of 19 men was just bad luck and no one's fault, which is false.' Spokesmen for Prescott and Gov. Jan Brewer declined comment Friday. Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo claimed the 122-page report was a thorough analysis of the operations, training, equipment and firefighting protocols used that day. He told The Arizona Republic he didn't know what McKee was trying to achieve with the claim. 'I don’t know what she’s trying to accomplish by it. Just on the surface - and, of course, this is just an opinion on my part - I can’t see this thing going anywhere,' he said. McKee told The Arizona Republic she filed the claim to learn the truth about what happened in the fire. 'There . is no good answer right now,' McKee said. 'Nobody should have to go . through this. No family should have to go through this. But it’s the . only way to get answers.' Devastating: Grant McKee was among 19 'hotshot' firefighters killed in the June 30 blaze at Yarnell, Arizona . Jack Fields, chief civil deputy Yavapai County attorney, said the county is reviewing the claim and would make appropriate decisions once that's done. He declined to comment further. The claim names 13 entities or individuals, including Gov. Jan Brewer; Arizona State Forester Scott Hunt; Prescott Wildland Division Chief Darrell Willis, who oversaw the crew; Prescott Mayor Marlin Kuykendall; the Yavapai County Board of Supervisors; the state Department of Public Safety; and the Arizona Incident Management Team. The governments could settle or allow the case to be resolved in court. Grant McKee was training to be an emergency medical technician and had intended to work with the Granite Mountain Hotshots only for the summer. He was engaged to be married.","Mother of firefighter killed in Arizona blaze on June 30 seeking $36 million  from the state, Yavapai County and the city of Prescott .

Thousands of workers blacklisted by construction firms are to receive up to £100,000 each in compensation, it emerged today. More than 3,200 names, mainly of building workers, were kept on the list, drawn up by a shadowy organisation called The Consulting Association. Workers launched legal action after finding they were denied work, often after raising concerns about health and safety on building sites. Thousands of construction workers were blacklisted by companies after raising concerns about safety (file picture) Last month eight firms announced that they are working together to develop a scheme to compensate construction workers whose names were on database. Now it has emerged that initial offers range from £1,000 to as much as £100,000 per worker, according to the Financial Times. The revelation comes amid a coalition row over plans to investigate separate reports of union intimidation linked to the Grangemouth oil refinery dispute in Falkirk. The Tories said the QC-led inquiry would focus on the Unite’s tactic of sending mobs of demonstrators to protest outside the homes of company directors. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted it would look at all rogue practices, by unions and employers alike. The Lib Dem leader said: ‘This is a short independent inquiry looking at irresponsible behaviour of both trade unions and businesses. ‘I'm a huge supporter of the way in which responsible trade unions and responsible businesses have actually maintained strikingly good... industrial relations during the recent years. But there are some irresponsible trade unions... and there are some irresponsible business practices, unacceptable ones such as blacklisting. ‘And this inquiry, run independently of government, will look at it in the round.’ Eight firms have set up a compensation fund to recompense more than 3,200 people who were unable to get work . News of the first offers to workers who were blacklisted comes ahead of a TUC day of action on Wednesday against the practice. The Consulting Association was closed down following a raid on its West Midlands offices by the Information Commissioner’s Office. But unions said workers continued to be discriminated against if their names were on the list. A total of 44 firms were found to be using the blacklist. The names of a number of environmental activists were also included. The Construction Workers Compensation Scheme was launched by eight companies: Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O’Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and VINCI PLC. In a statement last month they said: ‘The companies all apologise for their involvement with TCA and the impact that its database may have had on any individual construction worker. 'The companies have joined together to establish the Construction Workers Compensation Scheme. 'The scheme is intended to make it as simple as possible for any worker with a legitimate claim to access compensation. 'The companies have invited workers’ representatives to enter into a period of engagement to ensure that the proposed terms of the scheme are fair and effective. The group is also engaging with other interested parties.’","More than 3,200 names, mainly of .

'It was beautiful and all that remains now is a dust-filled swimming pool. Attracted by the year-round sunshine and low property prices, thousands of retired expats have swapped Britain for Spain.

'I was told a pathologist's report found that one more blow possibly would have killed me,' said Miss Callaghan, who has been forced to have metal plates implanted into her jaw and cheeks. 'I was also told the type of injuries they found on me would normally be found on someone who was dead. 'But I don't think he meant to . hurt me in the way he did. I don't think he meant to kill me or break or . the bones that he broke. Jailed: Day, who is 26 stone and almost 6ft tall, has been jailed for nine years and four months . 'I didn't think he was capable of doing what he did. He's not a monster.' Day, who is almost 6ft tall, was initially arrested by police on suspicion of attempted murder - to which he said: 'If I wanted her dead, I would have killed her.' He . was later jailed for nine years and four months for causing grievous . bodily harm and common assault at Manchester Crown Court. Miss Callaghan, from Wythenshawe, Manchester, has revealed how 39-year-old . Day was about 16 stone when they met. He became more controlling . and jealous as he gradually gained weight throughout the course of their . relationship, she said. 'He was unhappy because of his weight, it made him so depressed,' she said. 'I didn't care what weight he was, it didn't make any difference to me, but it was a big problem for him. 'He was terrified that I would leave him, and he wanted to know where I was and who I was with because of his insecurities. 'He thought I was seeing somebody else but I wasn't. The text messages he saw didn't mean anything.' Miss Callaghan said she had been lying in . bed at home when Day had started to batter her tiny frame - causing her to pass out in a pool of her own blood. Horrific: Miss Callaghan, pictured left with her 10-year-old son Thomas, has been forced to have metal plates implanted into her jaw and cheeks. Surgeons had to rely on old photographs to reconstruct her face . 'He's not a monster': Despite the brutal attack, the 28-year-old has claimed her ex-boyfriend 'didn't mean' to hurt her so badly. 'I don't think he meant to kill me or break or the bones that he broke,' she said . 'There was blood everywhere - it was all over the place,' she said. 'My eye was swollen and closed up. My face didn't look symmetrical anymore. I looked like I'd been in a boxing ring.' The couple's two children Thomas, 10, and Lillie, . seven, walked into the bedroom moments after the attack to find their father standing over their bloodied mother. They ran hysterically from the house and into the arms of concerned . neighbours. The court heard that two weeks before the brutal beating, . Day, from Fallowfield, had attacked Miss Callaghan for the first time in their 12-year . relationship after a row on June 16 - Father's Day - scratching her face with a knife. 'Jealousy is the most dangerous of emotions': Day pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm and common assault at Manchester Crown Court, pictured . A week later, on June 23, he went on a . rampage in the Withington bar where Miss Callaghan worked - smashing . pool cues and threatening to kill one of her colleagues. The final and most vicious attack came on June 30 after Day went through her phone while she was asleep. Fallowfield pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, . common assault and affray. He also admitted affray and importing £1,000 worth of cannabis into the UK . from India. Sentencing Day to nine years and four months in prison, Judge Michael Henshell told him: 'Jealousy is the most potent and dangerous of emotions and it causes untold harm. Meaningful: Since the attack, Miss Callaghan has had a tattoo printed on her back below a previous inking of Day's name. It reads: 'What doesn't kill you, Makes you stronger' 'The injuries were extensive and . almost fatal. They are the most appalling of injuries. 'This was an . incredibly vicious and forceful attack on a woman, by you, in the home . where she was living, while two children were in the house.' Speaking after the court case, the couple's son Thomas said he had started to forgive his father. 'At the start I was really angry with my dad because of what he did to my mum and her face,' he said. 'But now I've spoken to him and seen him in prison, I'm not as angry. 'I wish he hadn't done what he did because a lot of people hate him now, but that's the first thing he has ever done wrong. I really miss him. I will forgive him and I love him very much.' Since the attack, Miss Callaghan has had a tattoo printed on her back, below a previous inking of Day's name, reading, 'What doesn't kill you, Makes you stronger'.","Helen Callaghan was beaten and throttled by Thomas Day in fit of jealousy .

When David Neeleman founded JetBlue airlines in 1999, he sought to ‘bring humanity back to travel’ with a classless seating structure. But now the airline seems to be going against it’s mission by unveiling today the new 'Mint' class – a first-class section set to debut next year on flights between New York and Los Angeles and New York and San Francisco. The  new section will feature lie-back seats, customized amentities kits and a tapas-style inflight menu in an attempt to attract a higher-paying clientele who wouldn't normally fly the budget airline cross-country. Scroll down for video . New class: JetBlue announced today the new 'Mint' class which will be offered on flights from New York to Los Angeles and New York to San Francisco . But airline experts some question whether or not this move will alienate the company’s core customer. ‘This is seismic because now…JetBlue is saying some passengers are going to be more important that others,’ Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Hudson Crossing, told USA Today. ‘This move is not one that comes with guaranteed success, nor is it one that comes without risk to the brand. There is a chance that some customers may look at this and say JetBlue is selling out.’ But the company defends it’s position to shake up the seating structure. JetBlue CEO Dave Barger says Mint was . a response to the customers they were losing to American, United, Delta . and Virgin America – airlines that offer premium cabin experiences. Coming soon: The move has come as a surprise to some industry experts, since the brand prides itself on treating passengers equally . Barger is confident the new class won’t be re-creating the brand since coach will be getting upgrades as well. The first flight with the new Mint section will take off from John F Kennedy International Airport on June 15, 2014 en route to Los Angeles. The new section will feature ‘suites’ with lie-flat suites which have their own door for privacy. The new seats will be the longest and widest on domestic flights. Before take-off, those in Mint will be offered a drink and once in the air, they can have a cocktail and hors d'oeuvre. From there, passengers may choose to watch TV from their own personal 15-inch flatscreen, or perhaps take a nap. There’s a button they can press to notify flight attendants if they want to be awakened for a meal. Perfect for snoozing: The new 'Mint' class will have lie-back seats for passengers to take a nap on the long cross-country flight . The meal itself will be a tapas-style menu, and passengers can choose from three of the five available plates. Other features include an in-flight amenities box by Birchbox, with different boxes for male and female passengers. Products can be used in-flight, but some of the gifts are meant to be taken home like lotion and shampoo samples. Perhaps to make up  for the massive upgrades in first-class, those flying in coach will also be getting an upgrade next year. ‘We wanted to make sure everyone on the airplane got an upgrade,’ said Martin St George, JetBlue’s senior vice president of marketing and commercial strategy. ‘We wanted to make sure our core customer didn’t think we were walking away from them. Privacy: Mint passengers have their own door they can close for privacy and a button that signals flight attendants they want to be awakened for a meal . So coach will get a whole lot comfier with softer and roomier seats, even though the airline already offers more room in coach than any other domestic airline. On the flights with the new Mint class, those in coach will be able to help themselves to a new self-service snack bar where they can get free soft drinks and munchies. Other upgrades include power outlets at every seat, an increase from 36 to 100 channels of live TV, and free inflight WIFI. While not every passenger will be equal on JetBlue flights next year, Jami Counter of SeatGuru  thinks customers will respond well to the improvements. ‘It’s certainly not a revolution. It’s only limited to these routes. I think they’re very aware of what they stand for and are very true to their brand, so in no way does this in my mind take away from the experience in the back.'","New 'Mint' class will be offered on the New York to Los Angeles and New York to San Francisco routes early next summer .

Jailed: Valerie Bell, pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court, hit an 89-year-old patient with slippers, forced a can of deodorant in her mouth, and called her a 'flithy animal' A care home worker has been jailed after it was discovered she hit a patient with slippers and forced a can of deodorant into her mouth. Valerie Bell also sprayed her victim, who has dementia, in the face and called her a 'filthy animal' when she was meant to be caring for her. The 51-year-old's campaign of abuse was eventually stopped when two other carers who worked for Bell blew the whistle on their boss. Bell was sentenced to nine months in prison after she was convicted of four counts of ill-treatment or neglect, relating to two residents at Sutherland Court Care Home, in Fenham. Judge John Milford, at Newcastle Crown Court, told her: 'The serious . aspect of this sort of offending is the victims can’t protect . themselves, they are entirely dependant on the care of those who are . charged with looking after them.' Bell was accused of offences against nine elderly residents at . Sutherland Court but was only convicted with regard to two of them. She worked a permanent night shift at the care home and was in charge of a floor where elderly dementia suffers were housed. Bell had worked in the industry for 18 years and was regarded as a senior figure at Sutherland Court. However, . two other care workers, Victoria Rooks and Melanie Ledger, were . appalled at how Bell treated residents and eventually revealed all. Judge Milford said the abuse had not been reported straight away because the two other carers were afraid of the consequences. The women told how, on August 19 last year, an 89-year-old woman was heard screaming in her room at around 5am. Bell . and Mrs Rooks went to the woman's room and found she had wet the bed. She was lifted out of bed and wheeled into a shower, where water was . sprayed onto her chest without Bell testing it’s temperature and she . complained it was too hot. Bell then placed the shower head against the resident’s bottom lip, as the elderly woman screamed. The woman was then wheeled back to her room where the defendant struck her three times round the face with a slipper. Mrs Rooks told the court that the attack had hurt the pensioner and described it as a 'full-blown whack' which left a red mark. Mrs Rooks recorded audio from part of the incident on her phone and the pensioner could be heard screaming and crying. Judge . Milford said: 'The recording makes chilling listening, it’s clear you . lost your temper with her and she was manhandled back into bed.' Mrs Rooks said Bell made it clear she did not like the victim, saying she was 'not one of my favourites'. The . court was told that Bell also subjected the 89-year-old to another . ordeal, spraying deodorant in her face and calling her a 'filthy . animal'. On that  occasion, last spring, she went to the . pensioner’s room after she wet the bed, and as she put her on the . commode the pensioner spat at her. Care: Helen McArdle Care, which operates Sutherland Court, said Bell's behaviour was not tolerated and that 'justice has prevailed' for residents and their families . Bell called her a 'filthy . animal', slapped her arm and sprayed deodorant in her face, the court . heard. The  woman was screaming loudly and Bell pushed the can into her . mouth sideways three times as a gag. Bell was convicted of three counts of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks capacity with regard to the 89-year-old. She was also found guilty of the same offence against another resident, an 84-year-old woman described as 'frail'. The court heard that one morning, at around 5.30 or 6am, the 84-year-old had been woken up by Bell and ordered to hurry up. She was then put in a wheelchair and banged her head when Bell tipped her backwards. After a trial Bell was cleared of two counts of assault against two other residents and acquitted of five further counts of ill-treatment against other residents. Tom Finch, defending, said: 'She had worked in the care industry for 18 years with an unblemished character and committed many many years to caring for the elderly and vulnerable. 'What happened was a momentary lapse of patience and tolerance at times when the circumstances were particularly stressful.' A spokesperson for Helen McArdle Care, which operates the home, said: 'We do not tolerate behaviour of this kind in our care homes and justice has prevailed for our residents and their families.'","Valerie Bell sentenced to nine months in prison for ill-treatment .

Sharon Osbourne made a spectacular return to her post as an X factor judge on Saturday night as the new season of the reality show kicked off. The 60-year-old's refreshing tell-it-like-it-is attitude and warm humour has made her a firm favorite across the nation, and she has become a fashion icon for older women. Though she has never been shy about her various cosmetic surgery procedures, fans were shocked at Sharon's appearance on Saturday night, with her slightly 'stretched' look causing some to question whether she has gone too far. Sharon's face seemed puffy and swollen at times during the first two X factor episodes of the new season . Sharon returned to the X factor judging panel, much to the delight of her fans, but her face was noticeably different than the last time she sat alongside Gary and Louis . Sharon attracted attention when she was pictured leaving her New York hotel on August 6 this year looking swollen . In 2012, the talent show judge vowed not to undergo any further cosmetic surgery following numerous health issues, including a double mastectomy . Sharon, who appeared alongside other judges Louis Walsh, 61, Gary Barlow, 42 and Nicole Scherzinger, 35, appeared puffy and her eyes had taken on a slightly cat-like look. Last year, Sharon spoke about how she had taken the decision to not have anymore cosmetic surgery after recovering from colon cancer and undergoing a double mastectomy. Speaking on US chat show The Talk in 2012, Sharon said: 'No more, because I have been looking at pictures of myself recently since I started to lose weight. 'And in a lot of shots, my face looks plastic and at certain angles I was like, 'Oh, dear. Oh, I should never have done that. Oh, that's a bad one.' So I'm like, 'No more. No more abuse.'' Sharon with friend Elton John at the 18th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2010 . Sharon with rocker husband Ozzy Osbourne and daughter Kelly at Earls Court in 2008 for the Brit awards . In 2007, a very glamorous looking Sharon released her second book 'Survivor' after the success of her first autobiography 'Extreme' Sharon looked youthful but fairly natural as she posed with daughter Kelly in 2006 . Sharon Osbourne 2005 (right) and 2006 (left) The media personality and wife of Ozzy Osbourne has previously admitted having spent an eye-watering £300,000 on plastic surgery, including a gastric band (which resulted in her dropping over 100lbs), eye lift, facelift, tummy tuck, Botox, a full facelift, abdominoplasty, and breast lift. On her own chat show in 2006, Sharon introduced her plastic surgeon Dr. Leslie Stevens to talk about her various procedures, and even had Boxtox injected live in front of the studio audience. 'I think that Botox is one of the best things to be created in plastic surgery,' Sharon gushed. Despite admitting that she had to have all the procedures she had undergone listed off camera because they were too numerous to remember, Sharon even booked in for another breast lift and upper arm procedure while on air. After surviving colon cancer in 2004, the reality show The Osbourne's was becoming a huge success and Sharon was winning over the hearts of women the world over for her no-nonsense attitude . A less glamorous Sharon Osbourne attended the 'Little Nicky' film premiere in 2000 . Sharon and Ozzy posed in Elton John's famous glasses in 1997 . Sharon and Ozzy in 1992 when Sharon was managing Ozzy's solo career after he left the band Black Sabbath . Back in 1991, Sharon is almost unrecognisable - very different from the woman we know today . Black Sabbath rock star Ozzy Osbourne married Sharon Arden in Hawaii in 1982, with Sharon looking markedly different to how she does now . The proud cosmetic surgery aficionado says: 'I'm the only person, who goes to the cosmetic surgeons for surgery, who comes out and I don't have a scarf over their face when the paparazzi are there. I'm like ""Hi!""' As we age, our faces begin to show the effects of gravity, sun exposure and years of facial muscle movement, such as smiling, chewing and squinting. The underlying tissues that keep our skin looking youthful and plumped up begin to break down, often leaving laugh lines, smile lines, crow’s feet or facial creases over the areas where this muscle movement occurs. Soft-tissue fillers can help fill in these lines and creases, temporarily restoring a smoother, more youthful-looking appearance. When injected beneath the skin, these fillers plump up creased and sunken areas of the face. They can also be used for lip enhancement and to add fullness to the cheeks and for a chin implant. Injectable fillers are primarily used to improve the appearance of the skin’s texture. They can help fill out deep facial wrinkles, creases and furrows, “sunken” cheeks, skin depressions and some types of scars. They can also be used to add a fuller, more sensuous look to the lips and for lip enhancement. Dr. Roberto Viel of the London Centre of Aesthetic Surgery . While many have applauded her openness around cosmetic surgery, Sharon's recent appearance indicated she may have gone too far. Dr. Roberto Viel of the London Centre of Aesthetic Surgery said: 'I think this puffiness and slight lopsided facial expression comes from the excess use of filler to plump the face and fill out the lips. 'The lips especially have been overfilled - something Sharon hasn't tampered with too much in the past and which - in my opinion - is a mistake here. 'However this is a non-permanent procedure so should go down in the next few weeks. 'Filler can be highly effective when used subtly to restore some loss of volume to the face, correcting hollow sunken cheeks and restoring a more youthful radiance; something I felt Sharon understood and kept well balanced in the past. 'However, fillers can also look dreadful when used in excess, needing to be administered by an expert who knows how to balance the natural contours of the face. 'Surgery, both invasive and non invasive, is an art form, and should be used only to enhance one’s natural features.'","Sharon has been open about her cosmetic procedures .

A family laid flowers at someone else’s grave for 13 years after a headstone was placed on the wrong plot. The heartbreaking mistake only came to light after Eileen Vermiglio’s mother died last month at the age of 82, and arrangements were made for her to be interred with her husband Thomas Whelan in the family plot. Mr Whelan was buried at Liverpool’s Kirkdale Cemetery after his death at the age of 70 in October 2000. For the next 13 years Mrs Vermiglio, along with his widow Kathleen, regularly attended the grave. Mourning: Eileen Vermiglio, who discovered that her late father's headstone had been placed on the wrong grave - an error that only came to light 13 years later when her mum died . But, unknown to them, Mr Whelan was buried in an adjacent plot and they were putting flowers on the grave of a complete stranger, which was dug at the same time as Mr Whelan’s. Mrs Vermiglio said: 'It’s been a terrible experience. It was only after my mum died, which was traumatic enough, that the discovery was made that the plot number for my dad’s grave didn’t match the headstone, and for all this time I have been laying flowers on the wrong grave. 'I just broke down when the funeral director told me.' She added: 'It mainly fell to me to look after it as other members of the family have moved away and I was the main carer for both my mum and dad before they passed away. 'No-one wants to say they’re to blame. It’s not about compensation – all the money in the world isn’t going to change what happened. 'My main concern is people are made aware that these things can happen. 'I’ve always been against cremation, but after this I’ve told my children I want to be cremated because I don’t want to put them through what I’ve been through.'

A spokesman for Liverpool council, which owns Kirkdale Cemetery, said: 'The responsibility for the installation of a headstone lies with memorial masons. We provide memorial masons with cemetery section maps and any assistance they request over directions. 'Quite clearly this service was not requested by the memorial mason at that time. We do not escort masons to graves. 'The error in placing this headstone came to light when cemeteries staff were making preparations for a burial in the family grave.' The stonemasons, Manor Monuments of Anfield, have agreed to inscribe the headstone free of charge before it is put on the family plot, while stressing this was not an admission of liability for the mix-up. Owner Dave Hollywood said: 'It’s a sad situation and somewhere along the line someone has made a mistake, but as to who that is, it’s a never-ending circle. 'There were two fresh graves dug at the same time, so there was another, out-of-town stonemason involved in placing the headstone on the other grave.'","Eileen Vermiglio thought she was paying respects at the grave of her father .

"PUBLISHED: . 19:53 EST, 22 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:53 EST, 22 November 2013 . Jill Kelley and her doctor husband have filed a new lawsuit where they accuse high-ranking U.S. officials of leaking their personal information to the media as part of a 'malicious smear campaign'. Last year, Florida socialite Mrs Kelley's report of cyber-stalking to the FBI inadvertently revealed an illicit affair between CIA director David Petraeus and author Paula Broadwell, ending the distinguished military official's career. In their original lawsuit in June, Mrs Kelley and her husband Scott claimed that in the wake of the sex scandal, the FBI and Department of Defense violated the federal privacy act by leaking their personal information to the press. The couple are seeking an apology as well as financial compensation. Jill Kelley, right, and her husband Scott Kelley, left, are seeking an apology and financial compensation from the government for allegedly leaking her name in the scandal that brought down Gen. David Petraeus . An amended lawsuit has been filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., an NBC . investigation revealed on Friday, and is designed to pile on pressure by naming top-ranking officials who may be subpoenaed if the case continues. The suit claims that the Kellys’ names, . emails and personal information were improperly leaked to the media . following Petraeus' resignation on November 9, 2012. Among those named are Deputy FBI Director Sean Joyce, former bureau director Robert Mueller, Attorney General Eric Holder and other top officials who Kelley claims made decisions on the investigation into the Petraeus scandal 'based on the timing of the 2012 presidential election', NBC reported. Jill Kelley was under intense media scrutiny at the time of Petraeus' resignation due to her reputation for throwing parties for military and intelligence big wigs at her Tampa home near MacDill Air Force Base - headquarters of U.S. Central Command. The leaks placed the socialite in . the middle of an avalanche of unfavorable publicity and as a result, she . shouldered the blame as the villain in the downfall of Petraeus and . General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, the lawsuit . states. The lawsuit reads: '[T]he government was not legally entitled to treat the Kelleys’ like criminals, pry into and disclose their personal communications, violate their privacy, and disseminate confidentialrecords as well as false information about them.' Allegations: The suit says the FBI did not provide Kelley the security protection a victim is entitled to because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the upcoming presidential election . In September, the Obama . administration sought to dismiss the lawsuit. The Justice Department . declined to comment to NBC on Friday about the amended lawsuit. The suit claims the leaks violated . the Privacy Act, which was enacted in 1974 after revelations of illegal . surveillance by federal agencies in the Watergate scandal. The Justice Department said in a . court filing that Kelley has failed to present any facts suggesting that . the FBI and the Pentagon flagrantly disregarded her privacy rights. In an act that triggered the criminal . probe resulting in Petraeus' forced resignation, Kelley told the FBI . in May 2012 that she and several U.S. top military officers had been the recipients of . anonymous harassing emails. Kelley and her husband 'sought to do the right thing by reporting the facts' to the FBI, the lawsuit says. But 'rather than protect the Kelleys' privacy interests as the law and their duty required, defendants . instead willfully and maliciously thrust the Kelleys into the maw of . public scrutiny concerning one of the most widely reported sex scandals . to rock the United States government'. Some of the anonymous emails ultimately traced to Paula Broadwell were sent to Allen. The messages included notes on the general's plans to see Kelley in Washington the following week. Allen was concerned about how anyone else would know about his personal plans. Former CIA Director David Petraeus shakes hands with author Paula Broadwell. It was later revealed that the two were having an affair . One email mentioned Petraeus and an . upcoming social event and military and intelligence meeting with NATO . leaders in Washington. The emails to the generals claimed Kelley was up to no good and impugned her motives for befriending the military leaders. The lawsuit says the U.S. government . 'unforgivably transformed Mrs Kelley's reputation from that of a . respected business and community leader'. According to the lawsuit, the FBI . Washington cyber division and FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce directed . agents in the Tampa Field office to treat the Kelleys' case differently . than normal criminal investigations. For example, the suit says, the FBI . did not provide Kelley with security protection to which a victim is . entitled because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the . upcoming presidential election. The lawsuit also says the FBI in . Washington directed investigating agents not to proceed with a scheduled . effort to interview Broadwell once the agents had determined she was . the stalker.

A handyman has been left with a potentially dangerous hole in his head after three operations to repair his skull were cancelled. Brain tumour patient, Steve Taylor, 40, has had to wear a hard hat to protect his brain since part of his skull was removed in January. Mr Taylor had surgery to remove a life-threatening growth from his brain in December 2012. He then needed a second operation a month later when he contracted an infection. Steve Taylor, 40, has been left with a hole in his skull for months because the NHS has repeatedly cancelled the reconstructive surgery he needs . Surgeons removed part of his skull to treat the infection - leaving Mr Taylor with an inch-and-a-half long hole in his head. A date for the procedure to reconstruct his skull has been set three times in the last two months - only for doctors to cancel every operation at the last minute. The father-of-three, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: ‘You prepare yourself, you make arrangements for time off work and then you find it’s been cancelled. ‘I just want to get it over with so I can get on with my life.’ Mr Taylor’s operation was initially scheduled for September 30 at University Hospital of North Staffordshire. Mr Taylor had surgery to remove a brain tumour in December 2012 but a month later he developed an infection so had to have part of his skull removed while it was treated. University Hospital of North Staffordshire has apologised for cancelling his reconstructive surgery . But he was left devastated after medics sent him a letter informing him it was cancelled just days before he was due to be admitted to the hospital. A second date was then set for October 21, but that was also postponed, . The procedure was then due to take place last week but Mr Taylor was told it had to be cancelled again because the hospital had no beds available for him. The cancellations mean Mr Taylor has been forced to return to his estate maintenance job without  having had the surgery, because his sick pay was about to be cut. Mr Taylor said: 'You prepare yourself, you make arrangements for time off work and then you find it's been cancelled. I just want to get it over with so I can get on with my life' He said: ‘My doctor told me I shouldn’t be back at work but how can I afford to be off work?’ Mr Taylor says it is dangerous for him to be at work as he is in an environment where he could easily suffer a knock to his head. His wife, Janine, 48, a Stoke-on-Trent city councillor, is blaming the delays on the number of patients the hospital is treating from outside its catchment area. She said: ‘The UHNS management needs to get its act together, they are letting everyone down. ‘UNHS assured the council it could cope with extra patients and it wouldn’t affect local people’s operations. So why are so many having theirs cancelled?’ Mr Taylor's operation has now been booked in again for November 25 and he is desperately hoping that this time it will go ahead . Hospital bosses have apologised to Mr Taylor and blamed the third cancellation on an increase in emergency patients. Vanessa Gardener, chief operating officer at UNHS, said: ‘I’d like to offer our apologies to Mr Taylor for the cancellation of his recent operation. ‘This was due to an increase in emergency patients on that day. ‘The trust has plans to reduce the impact emergency patients have on scheduled operations. ‘However, providing major trauma services is important to ensure specialist services are retained in Staffordshire, rather than them having to journey elsewhere.’ Mr Taylor’s operation has now been rescheduled for a fourth time and is due to take place on November 25.","Steve Taylor, 40, had surgery to remove a brain tumour in December 2012 .

"By . Jeannette Kupfermann . PUBLISHED: . 17:08 EST, 28 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:52 EST, 28 August 2013 . Who would you call the love of your life? The person who still inspires that delicious puff of wind around the heart - regardless of whether the relationship lasted or not? Many of us think of our first grand passion, rather than the dependable type we married - or so says a recent survey that showed one in seven admit they didn't end up with their 'true love' and instead opted for 'second best'. It sounds harsh but we've all been there: harking back to an old flame when times got tough or - even more corrosive - uneventful. First love: Jeannette with Anthony in 1961 . I am no different. I dumped the so-called 'love of my life' some 50 years ago and was lucky enough to go on to be happily married to my late husband, Jacques, for half of that time. Despite my good fortune, more than once during my marriage I confess I did recall that certain figure with a wistful sigh. So when I got the chance to meet up with him after 40 years apart, did we still have chemistry? Despite later happiness, was my first love 'the One'? Like many 'true loves', Anthony and I had the odds firmly stacked against us: he coming from an upper-class wealthy Greek family and me from an Orthodox Jewish background. He'd been 'affianced' at 16 to another wealthy Athenian socialite: I'd been forbidden - at the risk of being disowned by my very religious father who was desperate for me to marry within the faith - from ever seeing him. We had spotted each other at the London School Of Economics, where we'd both been studying in the early Sixties. Tall, athletic and as devastatingly handsome as any Michelangelo statue, he was also clever, animated, and sophisticated beyond his years - thanks to a privileged education and years spent travelling the world. And the Greek thing was so intoxicating: the warmth, the music, the lively discussions, the big Sunday lunches with the lemon-scented lamb, the generosity. Second time lucky: Jeannette with her late husband Jacques . It was so captivatingly at odds with the other students and their limited spag-bol-bedsit lifestyles. Anthony thought nothing of wining and dining me at chic Madame Prunier's in St James's, or dancing the night away at the Blue Angel club. Everything he did was excessive: extravagant, pleasurable in the extreme and all new to me. Someone once said the Greeks 'have honey running through their veins' and that, combined with his machismo and tenderness, made Anthony hard for a 19-year-old ingénue to resist. When we weren't making love and vowing devotion, we read romantic poetry. And when he wasn't teaching me how to eat artichokes or notice the difference between Chantilly and ordinary cream, we were taking trips into the country in the sports car he'd assembled himself.Then there was one wonderful holiday sailing round the Greek islands - my parents knew I was there but had no idea who with. 'As we get older we want to smooth the edges and a trip down memory lane allows us to re-imagine the past' Oh, memories of the fresh fish in the waterside tavernas, of jumping off the rocks into limpid azure waters, and the scent of honey and thyme on Mount Hymettus. But oh, too, the rows throughout the affair: the slammed doors, the hysterics at home, threats from my parents, the terrible scenes, the promises he never kept, the pain I felt every time I heard he was with yet another blue-eyed, dark-haired dead-ringer for myself. They were always waiting in the wings during our frequent splits, which the LSE crowd followed as if we were Taylor and Burton. It all ended badly, of course. After two and a half years on and off, I finally ended it. Despite his charm, Anthony had one fatal flaw: he did not believe in fidelity. Or rather, he could not tolerate any vacuum: it would instantly be filled by one of the many women who seemed to swirl around him. Not only could he not resist a pretty face, but the face often belonged to one of my so-called friends. I've no idea how many times he cheated on me - and he didn’t seem to regard it as at all important as I was 'the One'. Normally, if I found out, he’d simply say: 'Come on darling… you know you’re the one I love.' Something in the mellifluous tones, the subtle musk of his aftershave and his sheer beauty would convince me to forgive. I would be back in his arms, about to end the war with a passionate peace. That's how all our arguments ended: in bed. But all the love-making in the world wasn’t going to resolve them for good. The final straw came when I found out that he’d bought a house in Hampstead for the fiancee he told me he'd ditched long before. Wistful: Jeannette often thought of her old flame but learnt they were right to separate . Soon after he graduated, he went on to marry said girl. He made a spectacular political career for himself at one point before several reversals of fortune. As for me, I went to New York at 22 where I met Jacques, a Viennese-born artist 16 years older than myself who proposed on the second date. We were married nearly 25 years before he died in 1987. During this time, I’d occasionally heard news of Anthony. But he'd been out of touch for a very long time when, five years or so ago, I received an 'urgent' and suspiciously affectionate email via the LSE begging me to meet him. He seemed to be fantasising about those halcyon days. I agreed to see him when he revealed he was being treated for a ‘little light leukaemia’. Had this prompted his desire to meet up? 'I felt both let down and relieved that I wouldn't feel obliged to see him again. I'd made the right call all those years ago' I felt puzzled and curious rather than excited. I had no illusions. But there was, in spite of myself, a slight quickening of my heartbeat as I waited at my local station forecourt for Anthony to emerge. When he did, I had to look twice. The man advancing towards me was tall, white-haired and bearded. The chiselled features were still there but the face was fuller, slightly jowly, his eyes unfathomable. It was him - but not him. Too many years had elapsed and I felt nothing as we embraced and exchanged greetings. He might just as well have been a statue. My instincts were proved right when I discovered he’d divorced a few years after moving into that swish Hampstead house. Worse, he went on to have three further wives! Each marriage ended in heartbreak - for the women. I'd had a lucky escape. We made conversation but I felt no connection. Even the luxuriant atmosphere of my favourite restaurant - the Waterside Inn in Bray - failed to do the trick. I felt flat, irritated, even bored. Conversation revolved around him: his high-flying career, his divorces and his finances. He seemed to have little interest in my own life, apart from telling me I 'did too much' and 'looked tired'. Grass is greener? In a recent survey one in seven said they didn't end up with their 'true love' and settled for 'second best' (posed by models) I felt both let down and relieved that I wouldn’t feel obliged to see him again. I’d made the right call all those years ago. Far from being 'second best', my husband was very much the right choice. Jacques brought out the best in me - allowed me to develop my potential while I, hopefully, helped nurture his creativity. Together we'd created a family - a son and a daughter - the most precious thing of all. Anthony and I went our separate ways once more. Although our past chemistry was absent, I still persist in seeing him in a golden miasma. Once a romantic, always a romantic. Yet I'm sure others who ponder over a past love would reach similar conclusions were they to reunite. As we get older we want to smooth the edges and a trip down memory lane allows us to re-imagine the past. But we would do better to shed these memories once and for all and accept that second best may truly be the best. After all, you've none of the neediness, despair and self-deception that inevitably accompany doomed love. So if you hark back to the 'one who got away', take note. The end of that relationship was probably the making of you. Far from regret, we should congratulate ourselves for choosing enduring love over short-lived, jagged passion. Ordinary cream rather than Chantilly, so to speak.","In a recent survey one in seven said they didn't end up with their 'true love'

He and his wife Coleen have just welcomed their second son Klay into the world, but maybe football star Wayne Rooney should set aside any hopes of retiring and becoming a stay-at-home father for a little while longer. Just two years after spending £15,000 on hair transplant to hide his thinning locks, the England striker needs a second booster operation to conceal bald patches forming on the top of his head, according to a hair-loss expert. The Manchester United player's follicular flaws were clear to see as he left Liverpool Women's Hospital after Coleen gave birth to Kai's brother Klay this week.

'But he has continued to lose his hair further back on his head and on his crown. It has given him two noticeable bald patches.The best way to remedy this is with a second hair transplant. 'He also needs to start using the drug Propecia, which footballers can take quite legally without failing any drug tests.

As an ex-prima ballerina who now has a glamorous judging job on Strictly Come Dancing, the Darcey Bussell we know is poised, elegant and rarely has a hair out of place. But the 44-year-old dancer seemed happy to show off a slightly scruffier look this week, wearing a rather mismatched ensemble during a family outing in West London. She opted for a pair of loose-fitting tartan leggings, which she teamed with a wax overcoat and a long black tunic. She chose to go make-up free for the oaccasion, even apparently neglecting to style her normally luscious mane of hair as she walked the streets in west London. The mother of two, who recently starred in a high-profile Marks and Spencer’s advertising campaign, couldn’t have looked more different from her highly-poolished appearances on the BBC1 dance contest if she had tried. It was in August this year that Miss Bussell starred in the Leading Ladies campaign for Marks and Spencer alongside Olympic medal winner Nicola Adams, artist Tracey Emin, novelist Monica Ali and actress Dame Helen Mirren. The campaign was pitched as a celebration of successful women, highlighting their desire to remain fashionable as they mature. Talking about her sense of style, Miss Bussell, who is widely recognised as Britain’s greatest ever ballet dancer, recently said: ‘Don’t get me wrong, when I dress for an evening out, I like to go the whole way. ‘I know some people worry they’re going to be overdressed, but when I go out I don’t care. It’s odd because I live on stage in costumes and yet I never want to dress down. ‘My grandmother used to wear these really high, elegant Charles Jourdan stilettos well into her 70s, and I thought she looked great, whatever her age. I know I’ll always make an effort, and to look as glamorous as my grandma would be my ideal.’ Miss Bussell started in ballet at the age of 13. By 17 she had joined the Royal Ballet Company and, by 20, she had become the youngest ever principal dancer the company had seen, receiving an OBE six years later in 1995. She retired from dancing six years ago, and her final performance in Sir Kenneth MacMillan’s The Song Of The Earth at the Royal Opera House ended with an eight-minute standing ovation and a stage knee-deep in flowers. Groomed on: Miss Bussell looking glamorous for Strictly . Miss Bussell returned to the limelight in 2012 when she took over as a judge on Strictly Come Dancing from singer Alesha Dixon. She is married to investment banker Angus Forbes, and the couple have daughters Phoebe, 12 and nine-year-old Zoe. She and her husband of 16 years, banker Angus Forbes, then moved the family to Australia, where Darcey has since written a successful series of children’s books.","Miss Bussell, 44, stepped out with her family in West London .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 12:52 EST, 23 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:25 EST, 23 November 2013 . Secretary of State John Kerry has joined international talks over Iran's nuclear program as part of a late-stage push to reach a deal. The world's most powerful countries have all brought their biggest diplomatic guns to bear in negotiations that the West hopes will prevent Iran from making a nuclear weapon. Iran's new moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, is hoping to bring to an end the Western sanctions that have crippled his country's economy. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Geneva, Switzerland, to join the negotiations over Iran's nuclear program Saturday . Kerry joins the foreign ministers of China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany in Geneva, Switzerland. The goal is a six-month agreement to freeze Iran's nuclear program while offering Iran incentives through limited sanctions relief. If the interim deal holds, the parties would negotiate final stage deals to ensure Iran does not build nuclear weapons. But it was unclear whether the current round, which began Wednesday, would produce any first-stage deal. Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke of 'very difficult negotiations,' saying 'narrow gaps' remain on the same issues that blocked agreement at the last round earlier this month. 'We're not here because things are necessarily finished,' Hague told reporters. 'We're here because they're difficult, and they remain difficult.' Kerry and his counterparts from Russia, Britain, France, China and Germany headed for Geneva after diplomats said Friday that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and top European Union diplomat Catherine Ashton had made progress on a key sticking point - Iran's claim to a right to produce nuclear fuel through uranium enrichment. It is hoped that Kerry's presence can help seal a deal between the Iranians and western powers . Details were not released but it appeared the two sides were trying to reconcile Iran's insistence that it has a right to enrich for peaceful purposes while assuaging fears that Tehran was secretly trying to build a bomb, a charge the Iranians deny. As the talks entered an intensive phase, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the negotiations had reached 'the final moment,' according to China's Xinhua news agency. Others were less upbeat. Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle spoke of 'a realistic chance' for a deal 'but there is still a lot of work to do.' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told RIA-Novosti news agency that negotiations were very close to a breakthrough but 'unfortunately I cannot say that there is assurance of achieving this breakthrough.' French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters he wanted 'a deal - but a solid deal - and I am here to work toward that end.' France's concern that the negotiators were rushing into a flawed deal with Iran helped delay an agreement during a session nearly two weeks ago. Other obstacles include Iran's plutonium reactor under construction in Arak as well as a formula for providing limited sanctions relief without weakening international leverage against Iran. Kerry met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as part of the negotiations . Zarif appeared to allude to the toughening of demands after France's intervention. Iran's Mehr news agency quoted him as saying that back then, 'the two sides had agreement on issues but now it has reached a stage that there are various viewpoints and it is somehow difficult.' Enrichment is a hot-button issue because it can be used both to make reactor fuel and to make nuclear weapons. Iran argues it is enriching only for power, and scientific and medical purposes, and says it has no interest in nuclear arms. Washington and its allies point to Tehran's earlier efforts to hide enrichment and allege it worked on developing such weapons. Iran has insisted on that right throughout almost a decade of mostly fruitless negotiations. But Zarif last weekend indicated that Iran is ready to sign a deal that does not expressly state that claim. Iranian hard-liners are suspicious of talk of nuclear compromise since moderate President Hassan Rouhani took office in September, fearing his team will give not get enough in terms of sanctions relief over the six-months of any first-stage agreement. Kerry was greeted by Ambassador Alexandre Fasel of the Swiss Mission in Geneva (2-R), Ambassador Jurg Lauber of the Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs (2-L), and US Charge d'Affaires Peter Mulrean (L) Several U.S. senators - both Democrat and Republican - have voiced displeasure with the parameters of the potential agreement, arguing that the U.S. and its partners are offering too much for something short of a full freeze on uranium enrichment. On Wednesday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said his country would never compromise on 'red lines.' Since then Tehran has publicly reverted to its original stance - that the six powers must recognize uranium enrichment as Iran's right, despite strong opposition by Israel and within the U.S. Congress. Still, comments from Iranian officials in Geneva indicated that reverting to tough talk on enrichment may be at least partially meant for home consumption. In Geneva, a senior Iranian negotiator said the Iranian claim to the right to enrich did not need to be explicitly recognized in any initial deal, despite Khamenei's comment, adding that the supreme leader was not planning to intervene in the talks. He did suggest, however, that language on that point remained difficult and that there were other differences. The negotiator demanded anonymity because he was not allowed to discuss the confidential talks.","John Kerry joins the foreign ministers of China, Russia, Great Britain, France and Germany at negotiating table .

The ticket was purchased at Carrollwood Market on West Village Drive in Tampa, Florida (pictured) The ticket became worthless when a 180-day deadline to claim the jackpot expired at 11:59 p.m. EST on Thursday, Bisceglia said. It was the largest unclaimed jackpot in Florida since 2003, when a $53.7 million jackpot expired. The winning numbers were 2, 6, 19, 21, 27 and a Powerball number of 25.

The moment an overdosing heroin addict was revived by a new life-saving drug has been released as campaigners push for the medication to be provided to police officers. A drug called Naloxone, also known by the brand name Narcan, can revive these addicts during an overdose, but only if it's quickly administered. In an effort to push for the disbursement of the drug to non-medical first responders and even non-emergency workers, CNN's Dr Sanjay Gupta showed a video of how one 29-year-old addict got a second chance from the drug. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Scroll down for video . Gruesome discovery: Louise Vincent and Adam Wigglesworth, volunteers for an addict-assistance group in Greensboro, North Carolina, found Liz passed out in August and dying from an overdose of heroin . Quick thinking: The two volunteers gave Liz two injections of Naloxone . Awake again: After a second shot of Naloxone, Liz comes to and is able to move into a sitting position. Her revival was caught on camera . The video shows a woman named Liz, who's been taking drugs since she was 11, passed out from an overdose of heroin. 'She seemed to be pretty unresponsive, we were noticing a blueing of the lips, lack of oxygen. So her breathing had become quite shallow,' said Adam Wigglesworth, who found the dying the woman in August. He and Louise Vincent volunteer with a program in Greensboro, North Carolina which provides clean needles and other assistance to addicts. The two tried to revive Liz by regulating her breathing but it wasn't working so they injected her with Naloxene. When she still didn't wake up, they gave her another shot and that did the trick. She starts responding and they are able to move her up into a sitting position. Four emergency room physicians validated the video's authenticity to CNN, saying that's how the drug works. Now, Liz credits Wigglesworth and Vincent for giving her the drug that saved her life. The pair, like others, believe the drug should be more widely available beyond just doctors. 'I can't believe that somebody cared about me enough or loved me enough to being me back,' Liz said of the life-saving jabs. Soon after, Liz checked into a rehab facility. Second chances: Liz (pictured left) credits the drug (right) with giving her a second chance to get clean. She entered rehab after the drug brought her back to life in August . The drug is so effective that many are lobbying for the right of first responders and lay people to carry the drug. In La Crosse, Wisconsin, Fire Chief Warren Thomas is trying to get approval to use the drug on overdose patients if they arrive before ambulance personnel. 'If we get to a call where we're a few minutes ahead of Tri-State and we know it's a known overdose, we can get this Narcan into the patient's system and start reversing the effects of that drug before a sudden cardiac arrest occurs,' Chief Warren told HaywardWI.com. 'That would just be one more patient that hopefully would walk out of the hospital and try to get some help.' Saving lives: Officers Bill Lachner (left) and Bryant Halsey (right) were the first to help save an addict's life with Naloxone as part of a new program to outfit the police with Naloxone kits . On October 12, police in Lorain County, Ohio were equipped with Narcan kits after getting approval to use the drug last June. Already, Naloxone is saving lives in the area of Ohio with a serious heroin problem. Officer Bill Lachner and Bryant Halsey were the first to use it on a 21-year-old overdose victim on October 29. 'It's nice to be able to do something other than take their pulse and say ""don't worry, the paramedics will be here in a minute,""' Officer Lachner told Cleveland.com. After recovering from her overdose, the unnamed woman spoke with Cleveland.com, thanking the police for saving her life. She entered a detox clinic last Friday.","A heroin addict named Liz was captured on video being revived from an overdose using the drug Naloxone .

Forget jumping around and playing the air guitar to Bon Jovi's Living On A Prayer, karaoke just got cool. Putting a fresh twist on the traditionally cheesy sing-a-long, Hip Hop Karaoke is taking London's nightlife scene by storm. One event, which takes place every Thursday at The Social in Soho, gives budding rappers the chance to channel their inner Missy Elliot and Notorious B.I.G. Hot new night: Hip Hop Karaoke, which invites . amateur rappers to the stage to perform in front of a cheering crowd is . hitting the mainstream . Akin to a scene in 8 Mile, which sees Eminem take to the stage and bust out a fierce rendition of Lose Yourself, Hip Hop Karaoke really is the place to lose yourself in the music. Describing the night on its website, it says: 'We let you get on the mic and act out your rap fantasies to the fullest. 'Whether that includes teaming up with friends to rock through a Wu-Tang jam, living the lyrical high life like Jay-Z or Drake, bawsin it like Rick Ross, celebrating summertime with The Fresh Prince or acting all crazy like Nicki Minaj.' The £5 night is hosted by a peppy gold jacket-clad man who goes by the name of Bobby Champagne junior (think a young Tim Westwood). He enforces a 'no booing' rule so everyone can feel like Lil Wayne (even if they don't sound like him). Lose yourself in the music: Fancy channeling your inner Eminem? There's no better place . In between the live acts, the rammed crowd get low to tunes from Nars, Busta Rhymes and Fat Joe. Their weekly event has become a . roadblock, with wannabee rappers often queuing for hours to get in. They have also taken it on the road to . Glastonbury, V Festival, Bestival, Isle Of Wight Festival, hosted . parties and seen the likes of Wretch 32 and Daniel Bedingfield take to the stage. Catherine Smith, a first time rapper, said: 'I got up on stage and felt exhilarated as I sang Eminem in front of hundreds of cheering people. 'It's the perfect way to build your confidence because everyone is so accepting and encouraging.' Intimate: The £5 takes place at The Social, just behind Oxford Street, and is packed out every Thursday . Missy Elliot wannabee, Lindsay Cleland, added: 'I've always rapped Missy Elliot Get Your Freak On in front of my bathroom mirror but I braved the stage and had the time of my life.' Rob Pursey, DJ, Founder and Promoter of Hip Hop Karaoke, told MailOnline: 'For me the best thing about Hip Hop Karaoke is the inclusive and communal nature of the event, which we promote above all things, and the fact that whether you own only a couple of rap albums or are a fully committed hip hop fan you can get on that stage and feel like a real rap performer for those three or four minutes.'

The American challenged the Maltese driver after their two cars came nose to nose on a narrow street in the town of St. Julian’s. With neither conceding passage, the American got out of his car and launched into a tirade of expletive-laden abuse.

One of the founders of lyrics site Rap Genius has revealed how a brain tumor he initially dismissed as a toothache turned him mean - even making him tell Mark Zuckerberg to 'suck my d***'. Mahbod Moghadam, 30, revealed that the tumor left him so moody that his co-workers at the website, which allows users to annotate lyrics with their meanings online, told him to get his act together. Since he formed the site in 2009 with two fellow Yale graduates, the New York-based company has attracted a $15 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz and has now expanded to annotating images - in what the owners claim will revolutionize the way users interact with the internet. But several months ago, Moghadam began experiencing some bizarre health problems. Revelation: Mahbod Moghadam, one of the founders of Rap Genius, has revealed he recently underwent surgery for a brain tumor that altered his personality. He is pictured at a conference in May . After having his wisdom teeth removed, he had a migraine down the right side of his head which he blamed on the dental work - even though it lasted weeks, he told Fast Company. He was also unable to work out as hard and began having problems with his left hand, such as shaking, which he chalked down to an athletic injury from his youth. But as well as physical struggles, he started noticing other changes. 'My personality became terrible,' he said. He explained how he started smoking a . lot of marijuana, his girlfriend broke up with him and he began shouting . at people at work. 'My cofounders were furious at me because I wasn’t doing shit,' he said. 'They said, ""You have to get your act together"".' Attitude: Moghadam, pictured left with rapper Nas, previously told Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg he can 'suck my d***' but he now puts that attitude down to a brain tumor that was discovered this year . Famous friends: He is pictured with Kanye West and Ben Horowitz, who has invested $15m in the company . Rap Genius is a website dedicated to the annotation and interpretation of lyrics, poetry, news and other forms of text. Users upload a rap, for example, and can annotate the lines with meaning behind the words or with opinions. Contributors earn 'IQ' points when they make interesting annotations, so other users can see who best to trust. On the site, users can listen to songs, read their lyrics and click the lines that interest them for pop-up annotations, which are marked with a different color. Others can correct content while moderators monitor it. Their annotation system has since expanded to images, where users can click on an image for a description or to see how they can buy it. And . in one particularly bizarre incident, he lashed out at Facebook founder . Zuckerberg after posting pictures to Instagram showing them hanging out . together with rapper Nas and investor Ben Horowitz. When Zuckerberg's team found out about the photographs, they asked Moghadam to remove them. He responded: 'Zuck can suck my d***'. He now blames this outburst on the tumor he unknowingly had growing inside him. Moghadam finally went to a doctor six weeks ago and was sent for a brain scan, which found he had a brain tumor. He was put in an ambulance to another hospital for surgery the following day. But with his personality altered, he just played on his phone nonchalantly as he was prepped for surgery. He survived the surgery and spent two . nights in hospital, before recovering at home. He was left with a large . scar, which he hates, 'but girls seem to like it,' he said. After the operation, he said he is back to working out and is now more driven with his business. 'This really lit a fire under my ass for . working on the website,' he said. 'This brain tumor . motivated everyone, gave everyone a swift kick in the ass. Everyone's . working 10 times as hard now.' Now the team is hoping to expand and change the way people interact with the internet. On the mend: Since undergoing the surgery, Moghadam (right) said he is more motivated at the company, which he started with fellow Yale graduates Tom Lehman (center) and Ilan Zechor (left) in 2009 . Two weeks ago, they launched Fashion Genius, which allows users to annotate imagery. For example, if a user sees a bag they like, they can click on it and be taken to a website to buy it. Then Rap Genius will get a percentage of the purchase for sending the user there. Moghadam still has touches of the hip hop persona he uses to promote the brand, Fast Company noted, but his rhetoric has softened since the surgery. He said that drugs are also off limits after the surgery affected his blood-brain barrier. 'The only drug I have each day is a cup of green tea, and it hits me like about six lines of cocaine,' he said. Moghadam formed his company with Tom Lehman and Ilan Zechory; the trio met while studying at Yale University for their undergraduate degrees. He later studied at Stanford Law School.","Mahbod Moghadam, 30, is one of the co-founders of Rap Genius, which allows users to annotate songs, poetry and other texts with meanings .

When Jerral Hancock came home from the Iraq war paralyzed and missing one arm, he was hailed a hero. But despite the good will from his Mojave Desert town, his care was shockingly poor and for six months he was trapped in his mobile home, 'like a prison', when his handicapped-accessible van broke down. After hearing of his plight, local high school students in Lancaster, Los Angeles County, decided to do something about it and have so far raised $264,000 for a new home, that will be purposely built for his needs. Local high school students have raised $264,000 for a new handicapped-accessible home for Iraq war veteran Jerral Hancock, was lost his arm and was paralyzed while on patrol on his 21st birthday . The Lancaster High School students, pictured with Mr Hancock (center) have dubbed the fundraising effort Operation All The Way Home . The remarkable fundraising effort - which they dubbed Operation All The Way Home - began when Mr Hancock, 27, was asked to speak to Jamie Goodreau's U.S. history classes at Lancaster High School about his experiences. They heard that he was badly burned on his 21st birthday while on patrol in Baghdad on May 29, 2007. The tank he was driving hit an improvised explosive device that blew a hole through its armor and set . it ablaze. A chunk of shrapnel lodged in his spine, paralyzing his legs . so that he couldn't get out. He was brought back to live in his mobile home but the hallways are so narrow he could not get his wheelchair through most of them, meaning he was trapped in certain rooms. The high school chose to help him as part of their end-of-the-year . project to honor veterans, something Goodreau's classes have chosen to . do every year for the past 15 years. The students were spurred into action after Mr Hancock told his story to a U.S. history class . Through yard sales and pizza nights, the group have raised more than ten times the amount they usually would . They usually raise $25,000 or $30,000 . for veterans charities and a celebratory dinner but have so far raised more than ten times that amount in just six months. Mr Hancock, a father-of-two young children, has been astounded at the response of the teenagers. Blueprints have been drawn up for the new handicapped-accessible house and the students plan to break ground next month. 'They gave up their last summer of high school for me,' he said. Lancaster senior Joseph Mallyon said some people doubted the scale of their fundraising ambitions. He said: 'We had no doubt that it could be done. Now there are some people in the community. 'You know, the older people, the people who have jobs, who go through life every day and know the harsh reality of things. 'Those people doubt us. But we just accept it and say, ""Watch what we can do.""' Mr Hancock, who has a Chinese for 'warrior' tattooed on his face, has been amazed at the response . The veteran is pictured with his two children, nine-year-old son Julius (left) and six-year-old daughter Anastasia . The students raised $80,000 in just four months, mainly through yard sales, pizza nights and selling things like T-shirts and refrigerator magnets. Inspired by their efforts, businesses in Lancaster and neighboring Palmdale began to get involed. Big box stores are offering discounts on building supplies and construction contractor has volunteered to pitch in when the building begins. An architectural firm provided the blueprints and a real estate agent waived her commission. The credit union at nearby Edwards Air Force Base is kicking in money from new loans it writes. Even the inmates at the local prison held a sale of their art work and donated the proceeds. 'It's really just amazing,' says J.D. Kennedy, a local field representative for Congressman Howard 'Buck' McKeon. An Iraq war veteran himself, Mr Kennedy . met Mr Hancock after he learned the former Army specialist had been . stuck in his home when the oversized van that accommodates his . wheelchair broke down. Lancaster High School load items onto a trailer after a yard sale held to benefit Jerral Hancock . Despite graduating high school in the summer, the students are continuing to fund raise for Mr Hancock . It meant he could not get the 70 miles to the nearest Veterans Affairs hospital to see a dentist to fix his teeth, which were rotting from the effects of the painkillers he must swallow each day. Mr Kennedy's boss, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, pressed the VA to reimburse local doctors and dentists who agreed to treat Mr Hancock whether they were paid or not. Then Ms Goodreau, who met Mr Hancock at the annual Pride of the Nation Day, invited him to tell his story to her students. He joked that the fact the horrific incident happened on his birthday was the worst part. 'Yeah. That part really sucked,' he said. Mr Hancock was injured just a few months before he was due to leave the military. He had bought the mobile home near his mother's house and was due to live their with his wife, two children and their dog. However, the couple split up and their nine-year-old son and six-year-old daughter now live with her. Mr Hancock's mother and stepfather are now his carers. Lancaster High School student Joseph Mallyon hugs Mr Hancock's daughter Anastasia . The area of Antelope Valley, which has more veterans per capita than any other place in the country, honored Mr Hancock at public events. With the scale of his injuries, most people assumed he had a huge support network behind time and Mr Hancock admitted he let them think that. 'I don't like to complain,' he said, adding the recurring dreams of burning to death in a tank were bad enough without revisiting them while awake. Since Ms Goodreau's students began helping him, he said the nightmares have almost stopped as the project has given him a sense of purpose. The fundraising effort was due to end with the summer vacation but this year's group have vowed to continue until Mr Hancock has a new roof over his head, hopefully by the middle of 2014. Nicole Skinner, 17, who graduated in June and is now a college freshman, laughed when asked why she continues to help. She said: 'Just look at him, man. Many people these days are complaining about their lives and you look at him and what he's been through, and he's still smiling and all. 'He's not complaining. He's just so motivating.'","Jerral Hancock was injured and badly burned in Baghdad on 21st birthday .

National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden is living off public donations, according to his lawyer. Anatoly Kucherena said Snowden has no money and is waiting for his first paycheck from his Russian website employer. The lawyer said the analyst's own money has been mostly used up on rent, food and paying for his own security. Edward Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said his client had no money and is lonely . Mr Kucherena told Rossiiskaya Gazeta that his client is 'absolutely alone in Russia'. He said: 'He doesn't have his mom, or dad, or relations, or anybody here.' Snowden is living in Russia after President Putin granted him a one-year temporary refugee status. Mr Kucherena revealed last month that Snowden had secured a job but denied the post was as a state employee. He said: 'Edward starts work in November. He will provide support for a large Russian site.' Last week, an open letter purportedly written by Snowden said the U.S. and British intelligence agencies were the 'worst offenders' for mass surveillance. The former NSA analyst has spent his money on rent, food and bodyguards and is now relying on handouts . He wrote: 'While the NSA and GCHQ (the British national security agency) appear to be the worst offenders -- at least according to the documents that are currently public -- we cannot forget that mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution.' Snowden has requested for clemency from the U.S. government for his alleged crimes. However, the Obama administration made it clear it has no intention of showing leniancy. Snowden. 30, fled to Russia in June, where he was granted temporary asylum and respite from extradition threats to the US where he faces espionage charges. He has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified NSA documents, which revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e-mails and telephone calls in the United States and monitor the cell phone and Internet activity of overseas residents. He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges.","Anatoly Kucherena said Snowden spent money on rent, food and bodyguards .

He had an unparalleled career in broadcasting, in which he exquisitely exposed the foibles of the  rich, the famous and the infamous, but Alan Whicker guarded his own personal life with an obsessive dedication. Assisted by his long-term partner Valerie Kleeman, 24 years his junior, the charismatic Alan hid himself away for the last two years of his life at his mansion in Jersey, while his health deteriorated, declining inducements to journey to London or indulge his passion for travel. And now it transpires that the globe-trotting documentary-maker took a secret to his grave — his real age. The much-parodied TV star knocked off four years, making him 87, as is recorded in his Who’s Who entry and given by the BBC in the announcement of his death last week. But, in fact, Whicker died of pneumonia aged 91. Some might consider the debonair gent a tad mischievous to tell a white lie about how old he was, not least because one of his best-known TV exposés was his despatch decades ago about how the LA set were resorting to plastic surgery — in order to look younger. Whicker, I can reveal, was born on August 2, 1921, in Cairo, where his father was a serving Army officer. But when the Whicker’s World presenter was first asked by Who’s Who for his personal details, he gave his birthdate as August 2, 1925. Of course, Whicker is not the first celebrity to disguise their age. Joan Collins omits her 1933 birth year in Who’s Who after 2009 (she turned 80 this May). Says a colleague: ‘I once saw Alan’s birth certificate and can confirm he was 91.’ Disguising his age: Whicker (pictured with Kleeman in this undated photograph) gave his birthdate as August 2, 1925 when first asked by Who's Who for his personal details . As an apparent ladies’ man, Whicker was happy to portray himself as younger than he really was. When asked which six objects he would take with him to a desert island, he replied: ‘Two blondes, two brunettes and two redheads.’ In reality, however, he spent the last 44 years of his life devoted to Valerie, whom he met in 1969. They moved to Jersey in 1972 and she took the photographs for his travel books and produced his later documentaries. When Sir Trevor Nunn arrived at the Henley Festival to catch a glimpse of The Beach Boys creaking around the stage, he found his entrance blocked by a clipboard jobsworth. Having failed to recognise the famous beardy, he told theatre director Nunn that he would not be allowed in. ‘There was quite a kerfuffle until someone realised who he was,’ says a fellow music lover. Can you imagine Sir Trevor’s erstwhile consort, fiesty Italian firecracker Nancy Dell’Olio, putting up with such insolence? Atty turns the petrolheads . Striking sight: Atty (Alexandra) Gordon-Lennox, 29, was sporting a dramatically half-shaved head . Among the beautiful classic motor cars which pitched up for the annual Festival Of Speed yesterday, there was an even more striking sight on the lawn of Lord March’s Goodwood estate in Sussex. His elder daughter, Atty (Alexandra) Gordon-Lennox, 29, who is based in San Francisco where she is studying psychology, had returned home sporting a dramatically half-shaved head. As she mingled with guests including Sir Jackie Stewart and Sir Terence Conran at the Cartier champagne reception, she tells me: ‘The new hair was just a crazy day. I got bored of my long hair and one of my friends did it for me and it was  just for fun. ‘It is a ridiculous hairstyle, but I like it. I like just having a bit of a play and not taking things too seriously.’ However, her motoring-loving father is not so enthusiastic. Atty admits: ‘I’m not sure Dad likes it. ‘He’s very sweet and is always very kind about whatever hairstyle I come home with — but I think he prefers me looking more feminine.’ Of her new life across the pond, she adds: ‘I have an American boyfriend called Sean. ‘I haven’t been out with many Englishmen because I have been travelling and haven’t lived in Britain since I was 23. I am a free spirit. ******************************************************* . Despite attending one of the best behavioural clinics in the world, Antony Worrall Thompson still has no idea what prompted his shoplifting spree. Nineteen months after he was caught stealing wine, onions and coleslaw from his local Tesco, the chef says that even after having counselling here and attending the ‘very expensive’ Cottonwood Clinic in Arizona, he still doesn’t know why he did it. Psychiatrists, he says, tried to make a connection between his five instances of theft and his being abused as a child — but he isn’t convinced. ‘I did wrong and I don’t know why I did it,’ says Antony. ‘It was a  mini breakdown, there’s no doubt about that.’ Antony, 62, compares his behaviour with the time Hugh Grant got caught with Los Angeles prostitute Divine Brown. ‘He can get any woman in the world that he wants. And what does he do? He wants to be caught.’ It’s not unusual when a son declines to follow in father’s footsteps for Papa to be a bit disappointed. But not in the case of former F1 world champion Damon Hill, who has welcomed his 22-year-old son Josh’s decision to give up motor-racing after seven years — and become a rock drummer in a band. ‘I hate this idea that children are horses and they have to be bred into a particular thing,’ Damon tells me. ‘Josh was born into a big motor-racing family and I think there was always going to be a question over whether it was his calling. ‘He felt it was something he was expected to do, but he has to love what he does. That’s the important thing.’ However, Damon adds: ‘It’s the end of a phase, really, for us as far as the Hill racing dynasty goes.’ Mick’s crimper to wash and go .

Who will tend the unkempt locks of Sir Mick Jagger while his crimper Lee Stafford is in America? Lee is whisking his bride of six months, glamour model Jessica-Jane Clement, to New York because she wants to re-invent herself as a proper actress. ‘Jessica has been accepted on a method acting course in Manhattan and I’ve got important business in America,’ asserts Lee grandly at a bash at Covent Garden’s Film Museum. Lee, 46, whose clients include the Countess of Mornington (aka make-up artist Jemma Kidd), wed 28-year-old reality TV star Jessica at the Duke of Rutland’s Belvoir Castle. Sir Mick won’t miss his stylist for long: the couple will return to Lee’s Soho apartment, which is being refurbished for married life. ‘We want children,’ he explains. ******************************************************* .

Shalit booked into the £1,500-a-night Austrian clinic Viva Mayr last week, together with his wife, fashion designer Katrina Sedley. Apparently, Katrina  has been trying to get him to lose weight ever since their marriage three years ago — to little avail. After just a couple of days at the spa, Jonathan texts me in desperation: ‘They have poked and prodded me, served me stale bread for which I have paid a fortune. They have given me infusions, mineral analysis and electrolysis — and I have put on 1.5kg!’ Adds Jonathan: ‘But I am £10,000 lighter.’ Edited by HELEN MINSKY .","TV star recorded as 87 in Who's Who and BBC's death announcement .

Cornelius Gurlitt, son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, said his father had acquired the priceless works legally . More works have been revealed from the £1billion stash of looted art which was found behind stacks of tins and rotting food in a Munich flat. German authorities released images today of valuable sketches and etchings by two of the early 20th Century's most prominent artists. Jewish Max Liebermann was one of the leading lights of German Impressionism, growing up in central Berlin and becoming a highly-respected artist before his death in 1935. And Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, most famous for his iconic painting The Scream, was highly favoured among Jewish collectors in 1930s Germany. Both had works among the thousands which were declared 'degenerate art' by the Nazis and were unceremoniously strong-armed at knock-down prices from their Jewish owners, only to fall into the hands of wealthy collectors after the war. Now striking works by the pair, never shown before publicly, have been revealed from the 1,401 artworks found in the Munich flat of Cornelius Gurlitt - bringing the total so far seen publicly to 79. Gurlitt, 80, the son of Dr Hildebrand Gurlitt, was stopped by customs officials in 2010 on a train from Switzerland with 9,000 Euros in cash and empty envelopes bearing the name of a Swiss bank. The chance find led customs officials to his flat, where they stumbled across what is described as one of the greatest art discoveries of modern times. They kept the hoard secret and its existence became known only a month ago. Gurlitt had been living a hermit's life, it is said, existing outside the systems of modern society, dealing entirely in cash and selling works on the black market whenever he ran out. Scroll down for video . Hoard: German authorities today revealed a new cache of works found in the Munich flat of Cornelius Gurlitt, 80. Pictured: Melancholia 1 by Edvard Munch. There are now 79 works listed on a website dedicated to the stash .

Two People by Edvard Munch, one of the new images of hoarded work to be revealed, depicts a couple in love .

Among the works revealed were two Edvard Munch woodcuts from 1930, Brigitte I (left) and Brigitte III (right) Man on Horse in a Busy Street by Max Liebermann, the Jewish German artist who died in 1935, is on show . Ash, by Edvard Munch, is one of the 79 works revealed so far. The artist was known for the deep psychological readings behind his works, depicting agonised mental states, and he suffered a breakdown himself . Some works were easier to date than others - Woman at the Sea by Max Liebermann carries key details . In a rambling interview last month he said the works were rightly his - and they were all he had. 'I will not give anything back voluntarily,’ said Mr Gurlitt. ‘I hope this gets resolved soon and I finally get my pictures back. 'I’ve never committed a crime, and even if I had, it would fall under the statute of limitations. If I were guilty, they would put me in prison.' He added: ‘I just wanted to live with my paintings.' It is thought German authorities are unable to prosecute him for ownership of the works themselves, but they are investigating him over related allegations including of tax evasion. Gurlitt, who suffers from a heart condition, said he had given state prosecutors investigating him ‘enough’ documents to prove his innocence. The new works have appeared on the official Lost Art website. Others include works by Picasso, Matisse and Renoir. The works include Dune Landscape by Max Liebermann, a key figure in early 1900s German Impressionism . Group of People at the Bonfireby Max Liebermann. If the works' rightful owners cannot be found they could be returned to Gurlitt under German law, despite the manner in which they were taken from Jewish owners . People, by Max Liebermann, depicts an ambiguous scene which could be as much a courthouse as a pub . The Sea of Love, a lithograph print by Edvard Munch dating back to 1896. The works have been published online . Left, Woman Resting (1919-20) by Edvard Munch, and Woman Sitting with Dog by Max Liebermann, right. With artists of such stature any sketches have value, such as these on a sheet owned by Max Liebermann . Genius: Edvard Munch, pictured left in a self-portrait, is best-known for his four versions of The Scream, right . Breathtaking: A montage of some of the works which have already been released by German authorities . Gurlitt's Munich flat was home to 1,406 paintings by such greats as Picasso, Matisse and Renoir . At least 500 of the pictures have been identifed as being bought at rock-bottom prices from Jews seeking to raise the necessary cash to buy exit visas from Hitler’s Germany. But in the interview with Der Spiegel, Gurlitt said he had nothing to do with acquiring the paintings and felt deeply attached to them, having never loved another human being. He told the newspaper: ‘There are people who are . still climbing mountains at 97, but I won’t live to be that old. At . least they could have waited until I was dead to take away the . pictures. There is nothing I have loved more in my life than my . pictures.' Adolf Hitler declared a war on much modern art and culture, which he saw as hostile to Aryan ideals, when he became German Chancellor in 1933. Books were burned and paintings like those belonging to Gurlitt were confiscated or bought cheaply from Jewish families, often as a bartering chip to allow them to flee the country. Gurlitt's father Hildebrand was just one of a handful of experts trusted by Hitler to judge the qualities of what made a work of art degenerate. Many of the works were exhibited publicly in Munich in 1937 so the German people could learn what their rulers were telling them not to like.","Cornelius Gurlitt hoarded a cache of 1,401 paintings in his Munich flat .

Toronto's City Council today voted overwhelmingly to strip crack-smoking Mayor Rob Ford of some of his powers in the latest attempt to box in the brash leader who has refused to resign. The motion, approved in a 39-3 vote, suspends Ford's authority to appoint and dismiss the deputy mayor and his executive committee, so Ford is unable to fire members who speak out against him. An unusually subdued Ford vowed to fight the motion in court. 'I can't support this and obviously I have no other options but to challenge this in court,' the mayor said. Battle: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford stands in the council chamber in Toronto on Friday as the City Council voted overwhelming to strip him of some of his powers following his crack-smoking scandal . A few members had expressed concerns about the move to reduce his powers, even though they said they disapproved of the mayor's conduct. 'We are collectively disgusted with the mayor's behavior,' Councilor Anthony Perruzza said. 'If one day we are disgusted with someone’s political views or their political positions, basically we can do the same thing?' The vote came a day after yet another series of antics from Ford that outraged city councilors, anti-drunk driving advocates and even Toronto's football team. Most city councilors are frustrated by Ford's refusal to step aside since he admitted last week to smoking crack, but they lack the authority to force him out of office unless he is convicted of a crime. Stubborn: Ford, who has refused to step aside despite the revelations, smiles during the meeting Friday . Vote: Councillor John Filion, pictured on Friday, said reducing Ford's powers to appoint and dismiss the deputy mayor and his executive committee, means Ford is unable to fire those who criticize him . In the span of a few hours on Thursday, Ford used obscene language to deny that he pressured a female employee for oral sex, admitted that he had driven while drinking and then apologized for his vulgarity and said he was seeking professional help, though he refused to give details. Allegations that he made sexual advances towards staffer Olivia Gondek had sparked an angry outburst earlier in the day. 'It says that I wanted to eat her . p****,' he told reporters. 'I would never do that. I'm happily married. I've got more than enough to eat at home, thank you very much.' At . noon, the mayor held yet another press conference backed by his wife . Renata to apologize for his 'graphic language' blaming the 'impulse in . my remarks' on the last six months of 'tremendous stress'. 'The . revelations yesterday of cocaine, escorts and prostitution have pushed . me over the line,' he said. 'I used unforgivable language.' Beleaguered: Ford speaks at a news conference with his wife Renata on Thursday. Associates accused him of driving drunk, using racist language and pressured a female employee for oral sex . Standing by her man: Renata Ford does not look impressed as her husband gives at the press conference . He also upset the Toronto Argonauts by wearing the football team's jersey at City Hall on Thursday when he made vulgar statements and admitted to driving while drunk. Councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong, a former ally, said: 'We need to take away his power for the good of the city. 'The tide has turned and there are very few people that are prepared to defend him given his vulgar comments and his admission that not only does he takes drugs but that he seems to be comfortable drinking and getting behind the wheel.' Ford's troubles began escalating in May when news reports first surface of a video showing him smoking crack. After . month of evading the question, the mayor admitted to having smoked . crack when Toronto police announced they had obtained the video during . the course of a massive drug investigation that has ensnared a close . friend of Ford. Making enemies: Ford, pictured on Thursday, even upset the Toronto Argonauts boss after wearing the football team's jersey when he made offensive remarks and admitted he has driven while intoxicated . Revelations . have rapidly surfaced of other startling behavior, from former aides . alleging that the mayor has been frequently drunk on the job, to a video . showing the mayor threatening to kill someone in an incoherent rant. It . has been a stunning decline for the 44-year-old mayor who was elected . three years ago with fervent support from Toronto's conservative-leaning . outer suburbs, where many voters felt angry about they considered . wasteful spending and elitist politics at City Hall. Throughout the ordeal, his wife Renata has stood by him and pursed her lips as she appeared at his side during his press conference on Thursday. The couple met in high school when they were only living a few blocks from each other, and got married in 2000. They have an 8-year old daughter, Stephanie, and a 5-year-old son, Douglas. But she is famously secretive, even to people within the Ford circle, and has been described as the 'invisible wife' and an 'enigma' by Toronto Life Magazine.

The next day, Ford returned to his house to take a shower and change clothes and that's when Renata called police. Ford was arrested and charged with assaulting his wife and threatening to kill her. The charges were eventually dropped due to 'credibility issues' on Renata's part and the couple seemed to patch things up after the incident. 'Everything's going great...whatever it takes,' Ford said when he finally returned to his home. 'I support my wife.

Supplies of orange juice could be in danger as the EU is considering a ban on South African citrus imports, it has been suggested today . The price of orange juice on  Britain’s breakfast tables could rise next summer if the EU goes ahead with a ban on South African citrus imports. The move follows the interception of 35 citrus shipments this year from the chief summer supplier to Europe that were contaminated with fungal black spot disease. With growers in southern Europe fearing it could take hold in their citrus groves, the European  Commission is drawing up plans for a ban that could be adopted by the end of November. EU trade chief Karel De Gucht told . South African officials during a visit to Johannesburg this week that . the contaminated shipments were 'serious and problematic' and that a . response was needed. South Africa exports about 600,000 tons of citrus fruit – mainly oranges, lemons, limes and tangerines – to the EU each year and the industry is worth 1 billion euros. It is the main source of orange juice drunk in Britain, Germany and France during the summer months. For now the planned citrus ban would be largely symbolic, as it would apply only to this year’s South African harvest, which ended in October, meaning EU imports have already stopped. But the EU's food safety watchdog is . currently analysing the situation and if studies show the disease has a . risk of taking hold in Europe's estimated 500,000 hectares of citrus . groves, the ban could be extended. While harmless to humans, citrus black spot causes unsightly lesions on the fruit and leaves of affected plants, reducing both harvest quality and quantity. There is no known cure, but  fungicides can be used to control the spread of the disease. Disease: There could be a risk of the black spot fungus, pictured, taking hold in Europe's citrus groves . It is found in many citrus growing regions in the southern hemisphere, but has never established itself in Europe. The dispute comes at as the EU seeks South Africa's support to unlock stalled trade deals with sub-Saharan Africa. During . negotiations in South Africa this week, EU officials offered to improve . the terms of a bilateral free-trade deal dating from 1999 by granting . South African sugar farmers duty-free access to Europe for the first . time.

There is no known cure, but fungicides can be used to control the spread of the disease. It . is found in many citrus growing regions in the southern hemisphere as . well as China and the United States, but has never established itself in . Europe. Since 2011, the number of citrus shipments from South Africa found to contain black spot has averaged about 35 each year. Following . calls by citrus growers in top EU producer Spain to take a tougher . stance on the issue, the Commission said it would be forced take action . if more than 5 contaminated shipments were intercepted from the country . this year. In its draft . opinion published in July, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said the chance of citrus black spot taking in hold in Europe was 'moderately likely'. However, it it added there was a high level of uncertainty due to a lack of knowledge over how the disease would respond to the EU climate. The . EFSA is due to finalise its assessment by the end of the year. EU farm union Copa-Cogeca said if the . planned ban was confirmed it would be a step in the right direction. It . also urged the Commission to impose restrictions on next year's South . African citrus harvest. 'What we need is measures for 2014 . before imports start again in March,' Copa-Cogeca Secretary General . Pekka Pesonen said in a statement. The . head of the South African Citrus Growers' Association, Justin Chadwick, . said any type of ban by the EU would be 'most unfortunate'. 'Global experts have confirmed that citrus black spot is not a risk (to Europe), so a ban would seem unnecessary,' he said.

But a group of citrus black spot experts from countries affected by the disease said it had identified 'factual errors and omissions' in EFSA's draft assessment, and that there was no recorded case of the disease ever having spread via fruit exports.","35 citrus shipments from South Africa found to be contaminated with the fungal black spot disease in the past 12 months .

A firefighter promised a police officer 'beers for everyone' if he could prevent criminal damage charges being brought against him, a court heard. A series of text messages exchanged between firefighter Shey Watkins, 36, and police officer Byron Emerson-Thomas, 42, last October have landed the pair in prison for perverting the course of justice. When Watkins, who had been a firefighter for 12 years, was accused of causing criminal damage last year, he decided to contact the police officer he had met on holiday several years previously. Byron Emerson-Thomas (left) approached a colleague in Cardiff and asked him to get the case dropped against firefighter Shey Watkins . Firefighter Shey Watkins admitted in an interview with the police that he caused damage to his ex-partner's home and received a caution. David Webster, prosecuting, told Newport Crown Court yesterday that Watkins had asked the officer if he knew of anyone who could 'have a word' with the investigating officer dealing with his case. In response, Emerson-Thomas, who resigned from South Wales Police last November, said: 'I’ll speak to my mate.' His friend replied: 'Top man! Beers for everyone if you can.' The police officer then approached a colleague in Cardiff and asked him to get the case dropped. When interviewed by police after his arrest, Emerson-Thomas said he had been 'bragging' to make himself seem more important. The second officer confirmed he had received the message, but had taken no further action. The court heard Emerson-Thomas had also used a police database to make 14 unauthorised inquiries, which allowed him to access confidential information about friends, family and celebrities. Co-defendants Shey Watkins (left) and Byron Matthew Emerson-Thomas pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice . David Elias, defending the police officer, conceded his actions had been 'foolish', but claimed they had no 'sinister significance' and were prompted by his obsessive compulsive disorder, which caused him to become 'bored' at work. During a hearing at Cardiff Crown Court on May 8, Emerson-Thomas, of  Cowbridge, admitted misusing the police system, but both men denied perverting the course of justice and a trial date was set for September 9. But Watkins, from Blaenavon, changed his plea to guilty on August 19 and his co-accused admitted the charge 10 days later. Sentencing the pair at Newport Crown Court yesterday, Judge Rhys Rowlands said: 'There cannot be one rule for society as a whole and another for police officers. 'Police officers are trusted and they are given significant powers. Those who misuse or breach that trust must expect to go to prison.' Both men were sentenced to four weeks in prison for perverting the course of justice and Emerson-Thomas was sentenced to an additional two weeks for his misuse of the police computer system.","Firefighter Shey Watkins, 36, and police officer Byron Emerson-Thomas, 42, exchanged series of text messages .

But for those who have pre-ordered, they can watch their phone make its way slowly from overseas from China, with crates stacked high with iPhones due to land in both the U.S. and UK by the end of the week. Fans have been using the UPS delivery company's website to figure out when their phone will arrive, and by doing so have shown that that the first shipments left ZhengZhou in China yesterday. If people still want more information, then Apple has released detailed specifications about the phone, to allow third-party manufacturers to create cases for the phone. Waiting for your iPhone 5? This is what you will be getting: Apple has released these specifications of its new device . The specifications show every individual measurement of the iPhone - from the width of the lens to the spaces around the buttons. This means that third-party case-makers can get to work creating different covers for the phone, and a rush of covers are now likely to start appearing on eBay and other merchant websites. Apple states its design aims and warnings to manufacturers with the specifications. The company says that 'a well-designed case will securely house an Apple device while not interfering with the device’s operation. 'Significant factors in mechanical design include access to the device’s sensors, controls, and connectors. 'A case that encroaches too closely on the perimeter of any camera lens may produce image degradation, even without obstructing the lens. The case should not cause contrast decrease, color shift, image blocking, or flash interference through any camera lens.' Taller yet thinner: The iPhone 5 has gained an increased screen size and a new dock connector . To show the care Apple puts into ensuring a premium experience, it even offers a template against which manufacturers can take pictures to ensure image degradation does not take place. The avid buyers who have pre-ordered their iPhone have used UPS's order page as well as Apple's serial code checker to tease out new facts about their phones. For instance, the earliest manufacturing date discovered so far is August 5th-11th - showing just how tightly Apple runs its ship. An estimated 50million iPhone 5s are likely to be sold over the next year, meaning all of Apple's factories are outputting at maximum capacity to supply demand. Meanwhile, for those who want their hands on the first model, be warned that queues have already started forming outside Apple Shops in London and New York in preparation for the official launch this Friday.","Apple releases full specifications so that case-makers can begin their designs .

He claimed his marketing executive wife, Narhisa Amjad, knew about the relationship. But he kept two mobile phones – one to contact each of them, with Sahar kept in his address book as 'R2' – and lived a ‘double life’. The inquest also heard that an intimate video of Miss Daftary and Mr Jamil had been circulated on YouTube. Mr Jamil told police he had separated from his wife and had moved out of the £800,000 family home and into the exclusive NV Buildings in Salford Quays. But he said that problems began to arise when Miss Daftary started ‘demanding more from the relationship.’ He then told her that he no longer wanted to be with her and that 'life goes on'. During this time, he said, he was using cocaine around three times a week. He also claimed that Miss Daftary had taken an overdose in the Lowry Hotel in Manchester and tried to self-harm in his flat. Beautiful: Yesterday her inquest heard that Mr Jamil . told police he had been having an affair with Miss Daftary for a couple . of years after meeting her in London while on a business trip . The NV Buildings at Salford Keys, Manchester: Mr Jamil's downstairs neighbour described hearing a heated argument that night before hearing two screams and seeing what looked like a shadow pass her window . Miss Daftary was due to go to Mr Jamil’s 12th-floor flat to collect her belongings on December 20, 2008. He picked her up in his car and during the journey she repeatedly asked him to divorce his wife and to collect his own belongings from the family home, Mr Jamil said. He added: ‘I was just trying to keep her calm. She was out of control.’ Mr . Jamil was also frantically trying to contact two escorts who were . living in his flat to try to get them to leave before he arrived. Rashid Jamil pictured at the inquest, held in Bolton, earlier this week . They were still there when he got back, which upset Miss Daftary, but left shortly after. Former escort Lauren Penney, a glamour . model and make-up artist, said in a statement: 'I was very surprised and . shocked that this woman we didn’t know was so angry towards us.' Mr Jamil said he and Sahar kissed on the couch watching 'Mr and Mrs' before they went on to the balcony. The inquest in Bolton listened to interviews he gave detectives as he told them how he and Miss Daftary argued as they stood on the balcony: . He explained: 'I said, ""I want you in my life, but I can't do this."" She said, ""Where does that leave me?"" I said, ""I think you know"".' He said he told her it was 'not morally right' for him to leave his wife. Mr Jamil said she asked him: 'Can you live without me?' He said she started crying after he replied: 'It will be hard, but life goes on.' He told police: 'I said, ""Just come here"". I had my back to her. She said ""Rash, remember what you said, life goes on"". I heard her scream. I instantly froze. 'She wasn't on the balcony. I looked over and I could see her on the floor. I ran out of the apartment, got in the lift and went down.' The court heard he rang his wife as Sahar was being placed in the ambulance and said: 'Get over here. I need you.' He added: 'Any normal man would say it was fine to have two women in your life. It was fine until my wife found out about it. 'Sahar started demanding more from the relationship and that's when the problems started.' Rose-Marie Turner, who lived in the flat below, told the inquest she heard a heated argument that night, adding: ‘It sounded really intense and they were going at each other.’ A few moments later she heard a scream and then another sharper scream before seeing what looked like a shadow pass her window. Miss Turner also said that it would have been difficult to climb over the glass railing on the balcony and she believed the couple were having a physical fight rather than just an argument. The hearing in Bolton continues.","Rashid Jamil told police problems began when Sahar Daftary 'demanded more from the relationship'

She admitted she did not carry out the recommended sample test of the dye on herself before putting it on her hair, because she had used different colours by the same brand in the past with no reaction. Miss Jesus, of Bournemouth, said she was given an injection by paramedics who rushed to her home, and her GP gave her a prescription for tablets to relieve the swelling.

It has been part of Christmas for 800 years - but it seems the humble mince pie's popularity is crumbling. Sales of the mincemeat treat have fallen by 1.5 per cent, prompting Tesco to launch five bizarre new flavours in a bid to turn shoppers back to pastry. Fillings now competing with traditional mincemeat include chocolate and hazelnut, golden salted caramel and rhubarb and stem ginger. Unorthodox: Tesco has launched five unusual flavours of mince pie - including rhubarb and stem ginger . The supermarket chain predicts that it will sell two million of the 'alternative' pies - but still shift a healthy 30 million of their more traditional cousins. Market research by the supermarket giant claims people . aged 20 to 40 are avoiding mince pies because they do not like the traditional fruit filling. Spokesman Mike Baess said: 'We hold customer tasting panels and generally younger people were more in favour of different types of fillings. She's a fan: But falling numbers of people are buying pies at Christmas . 'We also found that there has been a slight decline in people buying fruited puddings and fruit cake - including Christmas pudding.' The other new flavours revealed by Tesco include red wine mulled fruit with a butter crumb topping, and the more traditional apple and cinnamon. The less adventurous can plump for an apple and cinnamon flavour - similar to pies already on the market . It comes after mince pie sales fell 1.5 per cent between the Christmas periods in 2011 and 2012 across the industry, according to the retail analysts Nielsen. Tesco picked the new flavours by holding focus groups with younger customers, who they fear are drifting away from mincemeat, and asking them what flavours they wanted to see on the shelves. Tesco bakery spokeswoman Kim Hesketh, who took part in the workshops, said: 'Food tastes change over time and as we’re seeing right now the mince pie is no exception to the rule and is evolving. 'Demand for fruited puddings and fruit cake in general is declining. In the last few years we’ve seen sales of sponge puddings grow over the festive season as an alternative to the traditional Christmas pud. 'What we’re hoping to do by bringing in these alternative flavours is cater for this change in taste and offer alternatives so that shoppers have a choice. We want the mince pie and its new alternatives to continue to be loved by generations to come.' The new alternative Christmas pies cost between £1.65 and £2.75 per pack, but they are not the first to try and make a crust from the 'alternative pie' market. The chocolate gift firm Hotel Chocolat sells 'pies' made entirely of chocolate - including fillings of praline and salted caramel placed in a milk chocolate 'cup'.","Mince pie sales fall by 1.5 per cent - and Christmas puddings are down too .

Decision: Bruce Davis, a former Charles Manson follower who has spent more than 40 years in prison . The Los Angeles district attorney . says she is opposing the impending release of Charles Manson’s right hand man who has spent more than 40 years behind bars. Now 70-years-old, Bruce Davis was 30 when he was . sentenced to life in prison in 1972 in a case that was a postscript to . Manson's notorious reign as leader of the murderous cult known as the . Manson family. Last year a recommendation to parole Davis came after the double-murderer’s 27th appearance before the board. But District Attorney Jackie Lacey sent a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown last week urging him to reverse a parole panel's decision to grant Davis freedom, reported Fox News. Lacey says Davis still lacks insight and genuine remorse for his crimes. Davis was not involved in the infamous . Sharon Tate murders in 1969, but he was convicted with Manson and . another man in the killings of a musician and a stuntman. Davis long maintained he was a . bystander in the killings of the two men but in recent years he . acknowledged his shared responsibility because he was present. When the news of his possible release surfaced Manson family prosecutor Stephen Kay said he was alarmed at the prospect of Davis being allowed back on the streets. Captured: Steve Grogan (left) and Bruce Davis (right) enter court to be tried for murder in 1970 . Behind bars: Charles Manson orchestrated the murders of eight people and is serving life at Corcoran State Prison in California . Insisting Davis should die in prison, Mr Kay added: ‘Would you want to wake up and find Bruce Davis next door? I think not.’ Three years ago, then Governor Arnold . Schwarzenegger blocked Davis’s release, saying he ‘would pose an . unreasonable risk of danger to society.’ The parole bid was opposed by a former Manson family member, Barbara Hoyt, as well as Sharon Tate's sister, Debra Tate. Killed: Sharon Tate was murdered by Charles Manson and his cult followers in 1969. She was almost nine months pregnant . Davis has been in prison since being . convicted with Manson and another follower Steve Grogan in the murders . of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald 'Shorty' Shea, who worked at . the ranch where Manson and his followers lived. Davis became a born-again Christian . in prison and ministered to other inmates, married and divorced a woman . he met through the prison ministry, and has a grown daughter. Davis also earned a master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy of religion. Few followers of the infamous Manson . cult have been released from prison. Grogan was freed in 1985 after he . led police to Shea's buried body. Infamous: Charles Manson is escorted by a deputy sheriff and his lawyer from a Santa Monica courthouse following a hearing in the Gary Hinman murder case . Terrorizing: Manson family murderers Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkle and Leslie van Houton . Lynette 'Squeaky' Fromme was released . from prison in 2009 after serving time for the attempted assassination . of President Gerald Ford.

Another . of the Tate killers, Charles 'Tex' Watson, is still in prison. Monday will be the end of a 120-day review period by the entire parole board.

Found dead: David Welch, 54, was reported missing on September 2 by his family in Manhattan, Kansas . The body of a missing father has been found after he was trapped in the wreckage of his car for weeks - and spent his final days writing emotional handwritten notes to his family. David Welch, 54, vanished without a trace from his home in Kansas on September 2 and police only found his body on October 18 more than 800 miles away in a remote part of Utah. It has now emerged that he likely fell asleep at the wheel, veered off the road and was trapped in his overturned vehicle. Police say that he survived in the wreckage for days and possibly weeks. They have said that he was injured and that prevented him from getting out of the vehicle, but they have not disclosed the nature of his injuries. The car was not visible when driving on the interstate, but a hitchhiker who was walking along the remote road was the one to spot the crash site on October 18. Utah Highway Patrol troopers found Welch trapped inside his mangled minivan at the bottom of a 50-foot ravine - with handwritten notes to his wife and four adult sons. What's in those letters, though, is not being made public. The Welch family declined comment and the Utah Highway Patrol isn't sharing what they call very personal. Horrific: The car was found on October 18 when a hitchhiker was walking along the remote stretch of highway and spotted the car that was not visible from the road . The discovery brought a tragic end to a . difficult several weeks for Welch's family that began on September 2 . when they reported him missing from his home in Manhattan, Kansas. The . family said Welch, a retired salesman, left in a 2000 Pontiac Montana . without telling anyone where he was going - according to Riley County Police . spokesman Matt Droge. Over . the next several days, police did several . searches of the area that came up empty. Welch was put in . the national missing persons database. As the days went on, the family struggled with not knowing what happened. They posted missing signs around the city and started a Facebook page to bring attention to the search, Droge said. On the Facebook page Find Dave Welch they asked people to drive two extra blocks each day in hopes of finding him somewhere in Manhattan. Family: Investigators are still at a loss for why Welch left his seemingly happy family life, seen at left with his wife Kelly and at right with one of his grandchildren . Heartbreaking: Police found handwritten notes addressed to his wife and children in the car when they found Mr Welch's body in the vehicle on October 18 . On October 17, the day before he was found, there was a post written directly to Welch, perhaps in hopes he might read them. 'Dear . Dave, it has been seven weeks since you left. Your wife, children and . grandchildren miss you more than the sky is high. Your classmates and . friends are concerned for your health and want to help. As we sit at . home tonight with tears welling up; our hearts aching, we wonder where . you are. We only pray that you see this message and ask God to bring you . home soon. We love you!' Investigators believe Welch fell asleep at the wheel of his minivan as he approached a curve on Interstate 70 in eastern Utah around September 3, Riches said. His minivan sped off the road and went airborne, smashing into the side of the ravine. It came to rest upside down, resting on the passenger side, he said. Evidence suggests Welch was injured and unable to get out of the van, Riches said. The medical examiner has not yet determined his cause of death. Even if we would have been able to get out, the nearest city, Green River, was about 50 miles west. Thousands of cars sped by on the nearby interstate without a clue - Welch's van couldn't be seen from the highway, Riches said. He may never have been found if not for the hitchhiker walking on the side of the road. 'It is very desolate,' Patrol trooper Gary Riches said. Fatal vehicle: Welch was found in his family's car, a 2000 Pontiac Montana . Long way from home: Welch was reported missing on September 2 and investigators believe he crashed sometime the next day nearly 836 miles away . They believe he survived for days, maybe weeks, keeping a journal and writing notes to family in Kansas. In his obituary, the family said Welch was a salesman at Pepsi Co. and later Frito-Lay until he retired in 2009. He liked landscaping his yard, being outdoors and scuba diving in the ocean. He had been married to his wife, Kelly Welch, an assistant professor at Kansas State University, for 31 years. He was looking forward to the upcoming birth of his second grandchild, the obituary said. It remains a mystery why he left his home state in the first place, said authorities in Utah and Kansas. 'I wish it would have turned out better for the family,' said Droge. 'It was an unpleasant turn of events for them.'","David Welch, 54, was reported missing by his relatives in Manhattan, Kansas, on September 2 .

Famed Raiders tight end turned television sports broadcaster Todd Christensen died at 57 in a Utah hospital on Wednesday after suffering complications during a liver transplant. The two-time Super Bowl champ's death was announced this morning by Christensen's alma mater, the school that would launch his impressive football career, Brigham Young University. Liver disease was among a number of illnesses Christensen reportedly battled prior to his death. RIP: Famed Raiders tight end Todd Christensen died Wednesday at the age of 57 after suffering complications during surgery . Christensen's son, Toby Christensen, said his father died Wednesday morning at Intermountain Medical Center near his home in Alpine, Utah. 'I've been receiving hundreds of texts, Facebook postings and emails — from everybody with a story about my dad,' Toby Christensen said. Christensen was a devout Mormon who didn't drink, and his family believes his liver problems started 25 years ago after a ""botched"" gall bladder operation, his son told The Associated Press. Chosen in the second round of the 1978 NFL draft, Christensen was first a Dallas Cowboy. He began the 1979 season with the New York Giants but midway through the season he'd join the team that made him a star. The Oregon raised Pennsylvania native helped lead the Raiders to Super Bowl victory twice, once in 1981 and again in 1984. Christensen, at 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds, never fit the Raiders' untamed mold. He was a thoughtful son of a professor, and even read his own poetry at a Super Bowl press conference. He later self-published three books of poetry. In 1983, he set a tight end single season record when he caught 92 receptions. Three years later, he broke his own record by catching 95. Legend: The 57-year-old (seen at left in 2002 and at right in 1987) was a two-time Super Bowl champion with the Raiders and appeared in the Pro Bowl on five occasions during his 11 year NFL career . Gladiator: In addition to his football career and stints in sports broadcasting, Christensen (center at left) was even briefly a host of the over-the-top American Gladiators television show . 'Our condolences, thoughts, and prayers go out to the family of Todd Christensen. Great player, great guy,' tweeted BYU Football. As a college baller, Christensen led the BYU Cougars in receiving three times between 1974 and 1977, ending his career at the school with 152 receptions. 'He had great skill,' BYU football Hall of Fame coach LaVell Edwards told the Daily Herald of Provo, Utah. 'He ran the ball well and he caught the ball extremely well. He had excellent ability in all areas and those are the things that stand out.' In addition to his Super Bowl rings, Christensen played in the Pro Bowl for five of his 11 NFL seasons. After his departure from pro football in 1988, Christensen's resume took some unexpected turns. He had a brief flirtation with Major League Baseball when he hit a home run during a workout with the Oakland A's in 1990. He even briefly appeared as a host of the over-the-top American Gladiators television series. Christensen appeared in other television projects like Married with Children and acted as a sports analyst for both ESPN and NBC. Record setting: Seen here mid-game in 1985, Christensen's career saw him break the single season reception record twice. He caught 92 receptions in 1983. Three years later, he caught 95 .","The former Raiders star tight end died from complications during a surgical procedure, according to his alma mater Brigham Young University .

An Atlanta teenager who was driving an SUV when another teen was thrown from its roof while 'car surfing' will be charged with homicide. Anna Gabrielle Hawkins, 16, was killed Monday night after the 16-year-old driver lost control of the SUV she was driving and hit an embankment. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, State Troopers will charge the teenager, who has not been named, with first-degree homicide by vehicle, reckless driving, driving too fast for conditions and violating license restrictions. Tragic: Anna Hawkins, 16, was fatally injured after an SUV she was 'car surfing' atop spun out of control. Hawkins was thrown onto the road where police say she died . The Dawson Advertiser reports that the teen was not seriously injured in the crash. The Specialized Collision Reconstruction Team will make an incident report then turn the investigation over to the Dawson County District Attorney. Police . say Anna Gabrielle Hawkins of Dawsonville, Georgia was 'car surfing' when the young driver took a turn too quickly and Hawkins was thrown . from the roof and onto the concrete below. The . driver of the Suzuki Grand Vitara was reportedly speeding . down a curvy road when the tragedy occurred Monday some time after 9pm. 'The vehicle was traveling south on Couch Road and the preliminary report indicates Miss Hawkins was ""car surfing,""' Georgia State Trooper Mark Cox told the Dawson Advertiser. ‘The vehicle entered a right-hand curve too fast and the driver lost control. The vehicle traveled across the northbound lane along the shoulder, hit an embankment, then came back into the roadway, throwing Miss Hawkins off the roof. She hit the pavement and sustained substantial head injuries.’ Cox said Hawkins died at the scene, though she was transported to an area hospital. Police say there is no indication alcohol was involved in the incident. Searching for the cause: An police investigator marks the curvy path the SUV took before Hawkins was ejected. Findings will determine if the driver, also 16 and newly licensed, will face charges . Beloved: Hawkins was captain of the soccer team and a star student. 'She was the best of the best,' said coach Jed Lacey . ‘She hadn't had her license very long, and it's still under investigation,’ Cox said. ‘But the law states you have to have six months' experience before you can transport anyone besides family.’ The girl described herself to officers on the scene as Hawkins' best friend. ‘I've heard of car surfing and have seen it in the movies,’ Cox said, ‘but in my 18 years of law enforcement, I've never seen anything like this.’ Car surfing is exactly what it sounds like. As someone drives, the surfer stands or sits atop the hood or on the roof as the vehicle flies down the road. Just this month, a Littleton, Colorado man was badly injured while attempting the stunt. 20-year-old Jeremy Davis is in critical condition after he, too, fell from the car he was attempting to surf June 3. At the site of Hawkins' death on Tuesday were the victim’s mother and other family members, including an aunt who told WSBTV she was shocked her niece would even attempt the dangerous stunt. ‘She was very, very smart. Her SAT scores were very high. She was probably going to get a full-ride scholarship to a college,’ Lynn Burn told the Atlanta station. ‘Anna was a beautiful child. She was at the top of her class. She was a star soccer player. She was voted most valuable player on her soccer team.’ Unbelievable: Hawkins, left, with her parents and sister Kati, right. Family was on the scene Tuesday and found it hard to believe she would choose to try the dangerous stunt . Sad: Hawkins, right, here with her sister Kati. The 16-year-old died while riding atop an SUV driven by a friend that spun out of control. The driver could face charges, but alcohol was not involved. The head soccer coach at Dawson County High Jed Lacey had glowing things to say about the teen, as well. He named her team captain last year. ‘She's the greatest kid I've ever coached in my life,’ he said. ‘She was the heart and soul of our soccer team. She always had a smile on her face. You'd be proud to have her as your daughter. This is a real shocker. I'm in serious pain.’ Police, like Georgia State Trooper Steve Thompson hope this grievous event will keep other young people from making similar choices in the future. Grieving: Hawkins' aunt, Lynn Burn, was in shock. 'Anna was a beautiful child. She was at the top of her class. She was a star soccer player. She was voted most valuable player on her soccer team.' Small community: Hawkins with her sister and father. Funeral arrangements are in the works as family and friends in the tight-knit Georgia town of Dawsonville begin to grieve . ‘When I see it on YouTube, I cannot . emphasize enough how dangerous this is. I beg the teenagers, please stay . inside the vehicle and wear their seat belts,’ said Thompson. Funeral arrangements are now being made as family and friends continue to make sense of the tragedy. ‘She was the best of the best,’ Lacey said.","A 16-year-old driver will be charged with homicide .

Courting controversy: UT Austin junior Lorenzo Garcia is chairman of the school's Young Conservatives and intends to hold a mock 'Catch an Illegal Immigrant' game on campus . A Texas university conservative student group announced Monday their plans to hold a ‘Catch an Illegal Immigrant’ game where winners will receive $25 gift certificates for nabbing players marked as undocumented. Lorenzo Garcia, chairman of UT Austin’s Young Conservatives says he came up with the idea simply as a means to ‘spark discussion’ on the issue of immigration reform, but admits his group isn’t above courting controversy. Now that news of his group’s unseemly plan has spread, the former Senator Ted Cruz campaigner and his club have gotten a huge response, but not much of it has been positive. ‘If we held a forum or a public . debate no one would show up,’ Garcia told the Houston Chronicle. ‘But if . we have an event like this it gets people talking about and if it gets . people talking about it then we've succeeded.’ If . success is measured in angry tweets, Facebook comments, and . unflattering media portrayals of their chairman, then Garcia and the . Young Conservatives of UT have certainly succeeded. No . sooner had the event been announced then internet sleuths and . progressive groups took the opportunity to pin Garcia—who many social . media commenters have identified as Mexican American—his group, and its . plans onto Republican politicians. Pointless exercise? The student group intends to mark volunteers as 'illegal' and then give students who 'catch' them $25 gift certificates . All hail the USA: The group, seen here holding up the Texas Longhorns sign, not the sign of the devil, says the game is a way to open discussion about immigration but critics say it's blatantly racist and offensive . Specifically, . the publicity around the Catch an Illegal Immigrant event led to the . revelation that Garcia had previously done paid campaigning for Texas . Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott. He’d also had stints as an intern for the Texas statehouse and Tea Party favorite Senator Ted Cruz. The Abbott campaign immediately distanced themselves from the growing controversy. Politico in training: Angry progressive groups and internet sleuths quickly revealed that the Young Conservatives chairman was once a paid campaigner for Texas gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbot (right) and an intern at the Texas statehouse and for Senator Ted Cruz's re-election campaign (left). Abbotts campaign has since distanced itself from Garcia and the event . ‘Our campaign has no affiliation with this repugnant effort,’ Abbott’s press secretary Avdial Huerta said in a release. History of controversy: The UT Austin Young Conservatives held a bake sale with this sign in September, writing 'If you agree with this, you agree with how the university is admitting students.' But the administration called it 'demeaning' Meanwhile, social media attacks on Garcia and his game continued. ‘Wouldn't it be awesome if I made a website with all these pictures and names of people participating in this event for future employers to see,’ wrote Facebook user David Niedrauer along with a screenshot of the guests who’ve opted to attend the event on a Facebook events page. Most commenters stuck to calling the event racist and offensive. The UT Austin Young Conservatives have garnered similar ire before. The group held a bake sale in September in which brownies were priced more cheaply for students of color and for women. In tweeting a picture of the price list, the group wrote: . ‘If you agree with this, you agree with how the university is admitting students. Please listen to what we're saying.’ The bake sale was later deemed ‘inflammatory and demeaning’ by UT administrators. As for Wednesday’s event, Garcia told the Houston Chronicle he’s none too concerned about critics or even potential protestors. ‘Sticks and stones,’ Garcia said. ‘We’re not going to let anything like that stop us this time.’","The event will be held by the Young Conservatives of the University of Texas at Austin .

When a 9-year-old Kent, Washington girl recently turned on her new Disney princess walkie talkie for the first time, she was subjected to the filthy conversation of two truckers. No sooner had stepmother Jennifer Childress popped batteries into the bright pink toy, than it began to spout profanity and even racist slurs. Apparently the same frequency used by the toy is used by nearby trucker CB radios. No good, buddy: Jennifer Childress demonstrates how her 9-year-old stepdaughter's Disney princess walkie talkie is stuck on a trucker frequency . Trucker talk: Though it is pink and adorned with Disney royals, the toy began to spout profanity and racial slurs as soon as they popped in the batteries . ‘We picked up some things that she shouldn’t be hearing, or any child should be hearing,’ the appalled Childress told Seattle’s KCPQ. Childress declined to specify what her young stepdaughter heard, but foul trucker talk must have come as a surprise no matter how filthy. Making matters worse for the girl: her walkie talkie only has one frequency, so she can’t shut the dirty talk off. Not so sweet: 'We picked up some things that she shouldn¿t be hearing, or any child should be hearing,' said Childress, though she didn't get any more specific . Frequently used: Many common devices use the 27.145MHz frequency. Unfortunately for the Childress family, so do CB radios used by many truck drivers . According to the sticker on the back of the walkie talkie, it uses a frequency of 27.145Mhz.

Two cage-fighting brothers who ran a drugs and racketeering empire in their hometown through 'fear' have been jailed for a total of 32 years. Anthony Diprose, 27, and his brother Jason, 26, exploited their terrifying reputations in the ring to build up their drugs network with 'iron fists'. Both men live a glittering high life and, according to police, had 'iconic' status in their hometown of Lancaster. Jailed: Jason Diprose, 26, left, and his brother Anthony, 27, who ran a drugs and racketeering empire in Lancaster, ruling the town through fear . Teetotal fitness fanatic Anthony - who 'regarded his body as a temple' - drove a Range Rover Sport and a BMW Five series and regularly went on holiday to Malaga, Spain. He spent £7,500 on a chunky gold chain, £5,000 on a Rolex watch and bought his fiancee a £5,500 diamond ring. He also wore Armani and Gucci clothes and rented a three-storey townhouse which was lavishly furnished and filled with designer items and a 50 inch television. Despite running a drugs empire, Anthony would regularly stop and talk to police officers on the beat, apparently believing he was untouchable. His younger brother Jason - who once caused the death of a four-year old boy dead in a hit and run crash - acted as Anthony’s enforcer and kept three fearsome Pit bull dogs. The brothers used military-style paraphernalia including pistols, Rambo-style hunting knives, Nato flak jackets and gold three-bladed knuckledusters as they ruled the Skerton and Ryelands estate in Lancaster. Arrest: Jason Diprose is put into the back of a police car as officers from Lancashire Police carry out coordinated raids on members of the gang. They have been jailed for a combined total of 67 years . Lavish: Anthony Diprose's Range Rover which he bought with the proceeds of his crime. He also drove a BMW Five Series and lived in a three-storey bachelor pad . Weapon: A blank-firing handgun which was seized by police as they raised properties across Lancashire . Chilling weapon: A samurai sword discovered by police which was used by the gang during their reign of terror across Lancashire . The pair encouraged children to shout: '*** the law' at police in the street and on the Ryelands estate was littered with graffiti inspired by the rap group NWA. In a text message Diprose boasted: 'I don’t trust no-one except my brothers. All the rest just do as I say and want to be me.' But the pair were arrested in raids on their homes in 2010. Eighteen other people were held and 14 of them were charged with various criminal offences. Anthony was found guilty of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and an offence under proceeds of crime laws after a 14 week trial. Father-of-two Jason admitted conspiracy to supply class B drugs, conspiracy to supply class A drugs and fraud by false representation. The pair were given 16 years behind bars each. Superintendent Andy Webster, from Lancashire Police, said the pair operated a 'sophisticate drugs network'. 'Anthony Diprose is a muscular individual who put himself up as a cage fighter and used his aggression to intimidate people,' he said. Grim: The Ryelands Estate in Lancaster where brothers Anthony and Jason Diprose ran their drugs empire . Drugs haul: Some of the illegal substances recovered in Lancaster as police carried out their raids in July 2010 . 'Jason was very much seen as his enforcer. Both were living a lifestyle significantly beyond their means. 'Anthony lived a lavish lifestyle, he spent over £5,000 on family holidays to Spain and spent a significant amount of money on jewellery. His Range Rover Sport was expensive and luxurious. 'Yet was quite clear that he had no honest source of income. He had no tax returns yet the way he said he earned his money was a sham. 'He said he was a car dealer but when he was asked the mile per gallon for a Range Rover he couldn’t give the correct answer. 'He drove around Lancaster every day in his car and would go to the best jewellers in Lancaster. Anthony thought he was too far up the ladder to be caught and I think that is a good example of his arrogance and his belief that he was unattainable. 'He was the head and ran the group on fear and intimidation and his gang members were forced to do their job. Weapons were used to intimidate and to threat. They were used as enforcements if people did not pay for drugs. 'Anthony would go to the gym on a daily basis and spend two to three hours weight training and working on his muscles. Paraphernalia: A drugs press which was also seized in the raids. Jason and Anthony Diprose who ran the drugs network have been jailed for a total of 32 years . Enforcement: A flak jacked used by the brothers which was recovered by Lancashire Police officers during the raids . Haul: A Rolex watch that belonged to one of the Diprose brothers, left, and, right, a knuckleduster with a skull and crossbone on it . 'He would think nothing of pulling over at the side of the road and chatting with police officers as he honestly thought he was publicly that far removed from the gang’s activities. 'The Preston house was like a bachelor flat. He didn’t drink or smoke and his body was very much a temple. He was a fitness fanatic and did not go to casinos or clubs.' 'The gang had an iconic status but we built up the intelligence and had a very clear picture about the hierarchy of the group. We identified the safe houses, money launderers and dismantled it from the bottom up.' The brothers would use the same mobile phones for four weeks before switching them to avoid being detected. But CCTV footage showed a meeting between Anthony Diprose and two associates in his black Range Rover where large piles of cash were seen being passed over to him. Accomplices: Kenneth Smith, 23, who got four years in prison, and Brian Coulton, 20, who got five years, for their role in the drugs and racketeering network . Behind bars: Andrew Gunningham, left, who got seven years, and Aiden Higgins, right, who got four years . Locked up: David Threlfall, 28, who got 18 months, while Liam Parkinson, right, got seven years . During 12 raids officers recovered three firearms, ammunition, imitation firearms and a stash of cocaine. Gang member: Liam Wiper who got six years and nine months . Officers also recovered 'tick lists' which were effectively the dealers’ diaries and they would list all the people who wanted drugs. Superintendent Webster added: 'We have had really positive feedback from the public as the brothers’ activities have been going on for almost three years and has had a huge impact on the area. 'The estate now sees a low level of crime and feedback says there has been a change in the atmosphere in the area because we have been able to tackle this crime group. Andrew Gunningham, 30, Brian Coulton, 20, Kenneth Smith, 23, David Threlfall, 28, Aiden Higgins, 21, Liam Wiper, 24, and Liam Parkinson, 24 were convicted of conspiracy to supply drugs. Gunningham and Parkinson were each jailed for seven years, Wiper got six years nine months, Coulton got five years, Smith and Higgins each got four years and Threlfall got 18 months. Katie Noon, 24, a cousin of the Diprose brothers and her husband Paul, 30, their uncle Paul Lynch, 45, and his wife Rachel, 41, were all found guilty of money laundering. The Noons were both given six month suspended jail terms and each ordered to complete 50 hours of unpaid work. The Lynches were given a two year community order, a two year supervision order and 40 hours of unpaid work.","Anthony Diprose, 27, and his brother Jason, 26, ruled their estate in Lancaster through fear .

Saudi Arabia's feared morality police say they will not punish men who walk around in their underwear - but women still face harsh punishments if they violate strict laws on women's dress codes. The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice has denied reports of a ban to counter the controversial trend of young men frequenting shopping malls in their undershirts and long pyjamas. Women, however, are still expected to cover their body with a cloak, head covering and a veil according to the country's strict Islamic laws. Men are expected to wear the traditional robe, or 'thawb' (pictured) but many young men are going out in just their underwear . 'The commission has not issued any statement about this matter and violations in general are addressed according to the existing regulations,' Najm Al Dhufairi, a spokesman for the commission, reported Saudi news website Albawaba. Saudi daily Al Yaum reported that the commission had called for a ban on young men walking into shopping malls wearing white undershirts and long underpants usually worn under the traditional robes, known as a thawb or dishdasha. The commission reportedly took the decision because more and more young men are doing it as an act of rebellion. Spokesman Ziad Al Ruqaiti said that complaints about young men 'parading in their undershirts and long underpants in shopping malls' was often reported by families, the third biggest complaint by shoppers after verbal assaults and harassment. He added: 'Usually the security services at the shopping malls deal with such incidents and the police intervene only when matters get out of their control.' Strict: Women face persecution if they don't cover up in Saudi Arabia . Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islam prohibits men and women who are not immediate relatives from mingling and women from driving. The playing of music, dancing and many movies also are a concern for hard-liners who believe they violate religious and moral values. A thawb, or dishdasha, is an ankle-length robe commonly worn in Arab countries. The word thawb is the standard Arabic word for 'a garment'. It is the traditional Arab clothing for men throughout the Middle East and parts of Africa. Those who refuse to obey their orders are often beaten by the religious police, known as mutaween, and sometimes put in jail. Many in Saudi Arabia say they exploit their broad mandate to interfere in people's lives. Perhaps the most serious and widely criticised incident attributed to them occurred on March 11, 2002, when they prevented schoolgirls from escaping a burning school in Mecca, because the girls were not wearing headscarves and robes. Fifteen girls died and 50 were injured as a result. Widespread public criticism followed, both internationally and within Saudi Arabia. The many restrictions on women have led to high rates of female unemployment, officially estimated at around 30 per cent. The country sent two female athletes to the London Olympics last year, ending the Muslim country's record of sending only all-male teams to the Games. A crowd of Saudi men in their traditional robes, called thawbs, or dishdasha . Comments in the Saudi blogosphere were divided about the underwear issue. One posted: 'I can assure you that most of these young men do it not out of conviction, but rather as a daring challenge', while another claimed the men do it: 'because they have plenty of free time and no real place where they can use their potential'. The second poster was likely referring to high levels of unemployment in Saudi Arabia, estimated to be 35% among men in their 20s. 'Get them busy by engaging them in activities they like and they will put an end to their unusual behaviour,' was the advice. One took a harsher view: 'They just want to be different even if their outfits clash with good taste and public decency. They are moral outcasts who need help.'","Religious police say men can walk around in underwear .

Warning signs: Miriam Carey's Connecticut home was visited by police several times leading up to her Capitol Hill rampage October 3 and police now say she behaved erratically and made bizarre claims about Barrack Obama . A delusional but extremely lucid-seeming call to 911 from a Connecticut mother in the months leading up to her October 3 attempt to ram the White House with her car have been released by Stamford police. Miriam Carey, the self-described Prophet of Stamford who died after a Capitol Hill car chase ended in a barrage of bullets, made the alarming call to authorities to report people watching her outside her apartment. Police responded and found no evidence of people watching the 34-year-old. And on two other occasions, after Carey’s boyfriend Eric Francis, 55, made calls to report Carey’s mental instability, police arrived to find the new mother convinced that Obama was spying on her. In a 911 call from November 29, 2012 . obtained by the New York Post, Carey insists she’s been monitored by her . new neighbors for months. ‘I have some people prowling outside of my window and they’ve been prowling outside of my window for, uh, all day,’ she said. Carey, . who comes off throughout the call as totally coherent and lucid, had . been diagnosed with post-partum psychosis and had her daughter in a car . seat next to her during the rampage. Carey said there were four or five ‘people loitering, and they’re actually trying to videotape me from my window.’ She . told the operator that she knew them, all of them were men, and that . they’d been monitoring her since moving into her apartment complex . months before. Asked why they might be interested in taping her, Carey said the men had ‘special interests and items,’ but did not elaborate. Listen to Miriam Carey's 911 call... Surrounded: Police officers surrounded the car with their weapons drawn after Carey rammed a barricade close to the White House October 3 . Searching for answers: Carey's sisters have been vocal about their belief that Carey was not delusional. But her boyfriend Eric Francis couldn't disagree more . After investigating, police reports indicate there was no evidence that anyone was watching outside the dental hygienist’s windows. Police records also show that Eric Francis had expressed concern about her emotional stability and the safety of their infant daughter. In a December 10, 2012 call, Francis told the operator that Carey was outside her apartment in the cold, holding the baby while neither of them had on coats. ‘She just went outside and I can’t get her back in and the baby does not have no coat or anything,’ he said. Scene: Police swarm around the Nissan Infiniti car on grass near the Capitol October 3. Eric Francis says Carey told police that Obama was spying on her in the months before the attack . Questions: Sisters Valerie (left) and Amy . (right) are now in a custody battle over 14-month-old baby Erica, who survived the crash. Francis has his daughter now and claims Carey was extremely delusional prior to her calamitous death. The sisters disagree and are fighting to get Erica . He said she’d previously locked herself in the bathroom and wouldn’t come out. ‘This has been going on for a week, now,’ he said. ‘She need help. Please.’ When police arrived, Carey resisted the authorities’ attempts to help her and told them that President Obama had her under surveillance. She also insisted the president ‘put Stamford in a lockdown after speaking to her because she is the prophet of Stamford.’ The records released Thursday by Stamford police also say that Francis called them twice later in December to report she was having delusions and becoming violent. Another call to police this past May made by Carey to report that the wheels had been stolen from her 2011 Infiniti, the same car she used in her unsuccessful attack on the white house, and the car placed on cement blocks. Responding offers found that the theft had, indeed, occurred. Carey’s 14-month-old daughter Erica is currently in the custody of her father after a failed attempt by Carey’s sister to gain emergency custody October 11.

Another Silicon Valley whiz kid is entering the league of extraordinary gentlemen who own NBA teams. The National Basketball Association  board of governors has approved the sale of the Memphis Grizzlies to 34-year-old Robert Pera, in a deal reportedly worth $350 million. New kid on the block: 34-year-old Robert Pera is now the youngest owner of an NBA team . Pera, a former engineer at Apple, is CEO of Ubiquiti Networks and with a net worth estimated at $1.5 billion - he was ranked as tenth on Forbes Magazine's list of Youngest Billionaires in the World. Pera actually reached an agreement with the team's owner, 75-year-old Michael Heisley, to purchase the NBA franchise in June. 'I think he'll be a good owner. He's young. He's in his 30s. I think he . loves basketball. And I think he's financially very well off. I think . he'll be an excellent owner,' Heisley told FOX Sports during the . summer. But before Pera could be installed as the new owner, the deal needed approval from the league, which came on Thursday. 'We are delighted that the NBA's Board . of Governors has approved Robert Pera's purchase of the Grizzlies,' NBA . commissioner David Stern said in a statement. 'Robert . will no doubt bring great energy and passion to the franchise. He has . assembled an ownership group with very strong local ties, and we . anticipate that their commitment to the Memphis area will greatly . benefit both the team and the community.' Pera will have the majority stake among . an ownership group of celebrities with ties to Memphis . including NFL star Peyton Manning's wife Ashley, who is a native of . Memphis, retired NBA player Anfernee 'Penny' Hardaway and singer Justin . Timberlake. Roots: Ashley Manning (left, pictured with her husband Peyton at a baseball game in April) is a native of Memphis and is part of the Memphis basketball team's ownership group .

'I . am proud of Ashley as she pursues this opportunity with the Memphis . Grizzlies,' the NFL star said in a statement in early . October. 'While . my focus is on playing quarterback for the Denver Broncos, I look . forward to watching her become involved with her hometown team.' Heisley . bought the team in 2000 and though he moved the franchise from . Vancouver to Memphis in 2001, he wanted to ensure the team stayed put . under new ownership. The Grizzlies have a lease at the FedEx Forum arena until 2021. Team spirit: The team moved to Memphis in 2001 and has a lease at the city's FedEx Forum until 2021 . Sizzlin: The team's former owner Michael Heisley wanted to ensure the Memphis fan base could continue to root for the home team. He wouldn't entertain offers by interested buyers wanting to move the franchise . Heisley decided to sell the team after health issues prevented him from traveling as frequently from his home base of Chicago to Memphis. 'It's such a long haul going back and forth down there ... I'm 75 years of age. I had a couple of medical problems this year (with his heart). I thought the team was in good shape. Fan base was in good shape. I thought if the opportunity presented itself, I would sell the team,' he told FOX Sports. 'It's very bittersweet, he added. 'I love Memphis ... I've spent a huge amount of money to make the team successful there. ... I did it because I love basketball and I love the city of Memphis and the people there and they've treated me fantastic. I have nothing but wonderful feelings.' Pera won out against other interested . bidders, including Oracle founder Larry Ellison who was dismissed by . Heisley because Ellison voiced his hopes of relocating the franchise. 'We're not even considering Ellison,' Heisley told the Memphis Commercial Appeal earlier in 2012. 'This team cannot be moved.'

Tragic: Mohammed Belkhair, 19, had a deadly reaction to the performance-enhancing drugs which he took secretly . A teenager died from heart failure  after taking steroids he had ordered from a website, an inquest heard. Mohammed Belkhair, 19, suffered a deadly reaction to the performance-enhancing drugs which he took secretly. Mr Belkhair, from Beamish Close, Longsight, Manchester, was rushed to hospital after his sister found him vomiting and ‘blue’ in his bedroom on May 20 last year. The teenager’s body temperature shot up and he died from heart failure at Manchester Royal Infirmary later that day. Manchester assistant coroner Robert Chapman said Mr Belkhair was fit and intelligent, and it was ‘a dreadful waste of a young life’. The inquest heard how the teenager was a keen swimmer and boxer, and went weight training three times a week. He was due to start a medical degree at Liverpool University later that year. But . the coroner was told that police arrested Mr Belkhair  the night before he . died, and found four types of anabolic steroids under his bed. The reason for his arrest was not revealed at the inquest. Mr Belkhair's sister Sama told the coroner she knew he had steroids in his room, but he denied ever using them on himself. Discovery: Mohammed Belkhair, from Beamish Close, Longsight, pictured,was rushed to hospital after his sister found him vomiting and 'blue' in his bedroom on May 20 last year .

There were no traces of any other drugs, or alcohol. Pathologist . Dr Georgina Howarth said the evidence showed Mr Belkhair died from acute . heart failure brought on by a combination of the anabolic steroids and . heavy exercise. Treatment: The teenager died from heart failure at Manchester Royal Infirmary on May 20 last year . The . coroner said: 'This was a dreadful, dreadful waste of a young life but . it does appear he was entirely healthy and the thing that ruined his . health was taking anabolic steroids. 'Had . it not been for taking the anabolic steroids he would have been here . today. That was the cause of his death, ultimately. It’s a lesson for us . all that we must keep clear of these things.' He also urged others to learn a lesson from the tragedy and ‘keep clear of these things’.

Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October focuses on fundraising for a cure along with providing information about prevention and helping sufferers and their families cope with the disease. Although it is predominantly women who suffer from breast cancer, it is often overlooked that men can be battling the disease too. Cecil Herrin was 67 when he was diagnosed with breast cancer - having repeatedly been refused a mammogram by his doctor for the lump that was growing under his nipple. Scroll down for video . Battle: Cecil Herrin, 67 survived breast cancer after he was repeatedly told by a doctor that he didn't need a mammogram . In the end, it was his cardiologist who told him that he needed to be tested while he was undergoing a routine check-up. Mr Herring, from Grovetown, Georgia, was informed that he had breast cancer from the biopsy results. He told ABC: 'I cried. It hit me so hard. That was the scariest moment in my life.' He had a mastectomy to remove his breast and was left with scar where his nipple had been removed. He did not have follow-up treatments of radiation or chemotherapy but does take  tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen drug, to ward off the disease. One in 1,000 men is affected by breast cancer and it mostly occurs in those aged 60-70 years old. One man dies from the disease daily, according to the American Cancer Society. Although women are regularly encouraged to check their breasts, groups are hoping to raise awareness with men that they may also be at risk. They have a higher chance of breast cancer if exposed to radiation, have family history or develop high esterogen levels which are linked to cirrhosis or Klinefelter's syndrome. The most common symptom for men is a lump in the breast area – nearly always painless. Early signs can also include lumps in the armpit or collarbone area, nipple . discharge, and puckering, flaking or redness anywhere on the breast. Other symptoms can include an inverted nipple, oozing from the nipple and an infected open sore. In terms of removing the cancer, the most common operation for men is the removal of the whole breast. Sometimes the surgeon also removes part of the underlying muscle if it is close to the cancer.

"By . Sarah Oliver . PUBLISHED: . 17:08 EST, 23 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:04 EST, 24 November 2013 . The picture of an urbanely handsome, silver-haired man caught the eye of lonely women across both Europe and America. An Oxbridge education, glittering CV and worldly sophistication added to his allure. And when he revealed he was a widower raising his small son alone, he could not have sounded like a more perfect love-match. However, the photographs and career highlights belonged to British politician Lord Brian Paddick, who is gay and happily married to Norwegian Petter Belsvik. Trick: A fake Facebook profile set up using pictures of Brian Paddick as part of a 'silver fox' dating con aimed at scamming money from single women . His identity had been lifted from the internet by a gang of international fraudsters stalking single women on both sides of the Atlantic. The conmen used his details to create rogue profiles on reputable dating websites, cross-referenced with matching fake accounts on Facebook and Skype. Once online romance had blossomed, the tricksters asked for money to be wired to a Western Union account in Ghana on the pretext of either a business opportunity or a personal crisis. The complex ‘Silver Fox’ fraud was unveiled when two women who had fallen for Lord Paddick’s  pictures tracked him down in real life to warn him. Fury: Lord Paddick, who was alerted to the scam by women who had been duped, is gay and happily married to Norwegian Petter Belsvik . It is the latest twist in a global phenomenon where handsome older men – so-called Silver Foxes – are used as bait for lonely middle-aged women, who often have access to cash after being widowed or divorced. As well as Lord Paddick, American General Wesley Clark’s photograph and military background routinely appear on fake internet dating profiles. He is one of the most highly decorated four-star generals of the US military. War hero: Photographs of American Colonel Tim Collins were also used on fake profiles . British Gulf War hero Colonel Tim Collins has also been exploited. The former officer from the Royal Irish Regiment shot to global prominence after his eve-of-battle speech to troops in Iraq in 2003. The married father of five once received an anguished email from an American woman waiting for him at Pittsburgh Airport – asking why ‘he’ had not disembarked from his flight after she had bought ‘him’ a ticket home from the Gulf. Fake emails purportedly from him to other American lonely hearts claim he is divorcing his wife and making a fresh start in the US, where he has been given a new home by the President for his  ‘services to humanity’. Last night Lord Paddick spoke out to condemn the cruel conmen, saying: ‘These women have been profoundly confused and distressed, extraordinarily strong emotional attachments have developed and money has changed hands. ‘It’s been devastating for them and I am powerless to stop it. Who knows how many more victims have chosen, through embarrassment or sheer heartbreak, to keep quiet.’ The 55-year-old Liberal Democrat peer was alerted to the hijacking of his pictures and data when a  German single mother emailed to say she had been swindled. Within 48 hours, the former Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police had also been contacted by an American nurse. The gang pretending to be Lord Paddick are Ghanaian and use aliases for him – Alvin Coleman in the US and Henry Smith in Germany. One of the Henry Smith victims, a divorced mother of three from Lower Saxony, spoke to The Mail on Sunday on condition of anonymity. 'Betrayed': Nurse Debbie Cason fell victim to the 'Silver Fox' scam . Nurse Debbie Cason fell victim to the Silver Fox scam after signing up with American site Match.com last month. Debbie, 60, of Illinois, received a message from  a man calling himself  Alvin Coleman – who used Lord Paddick’s pictures and professional details from his time  as a Metropolitan Police chief. Coleman invited the divorcee to become a friend on Facebook and within days she was spending up to three hours a night chatting to him on the social media site. She said: ‘I couldn’t believe that this distinguished, educated, sophisticated man – let’s face it, he was a great catch – wanted to spend so much time with me. 'I was flattered but a bit baffled when he started asking me what kind of jewellery I liked and if I’d accompany him on some of his round-the-world trips. ‘It was my 15-year-old grandson who said, “This is too good to be true.” He did an image search on Google and showed me photos of Brian Paddick. ‘He said: “Grandma, this man is the Mayor of London.’’ [Lord Paddick was twice Lib Dem candidate for Mayor]. My first thought was, “Why has the Mayor of London stolen Alvin Coleman’s photos?’’ ‘That shows you how deep you can get in just a few days.‘I always thought internet dating was a safe choice and, in retrospect, I ignored a lot of red flags. I feel hurt, betrayed, used, embarrassed and angry at my own gullibility.’ She told how Smith had been portrayed as a widowed Australian engineer working in Berlin and raising an eight-year-old son alone. Within days she was chatting to him for two hours at lunchtime and two hours in the evening. ‘I became emotionally dependent on him very fast,’ she recalls. ‘He reached out to me, let me dream of a future together and told me things I desperately wanted to be true. 'It was a slick psychological con trick. ‘He dropped into conversation a couple of times that his company did fundraising for a hospital in Ghana and he went there to help. ‘So when he called me from Africa on one occasion it checked out. I thought he was a humanitarian helping with blankets and clothes for sick children. Vulnerable: The con is aimed at luring lonely women and tricking them into sending cash . 'While there, he asked for money, €850 [£710], to pay for the shipping costs of some gold which he said would secure his future and mine. 'It was a line from a B-list movie and I fell for it. I thought if I didn’t send the money then I wouldn’t get to see him when he came back as promised. ‘I wired €300 [£250] which took me up to my overdraft limit. When he demanded more I guessed I’d been conned – I wanted to run to the bathroom to be physically sick. ‘My 16-year-old daughter used image-matching technology and identified Henry Smith as Brian Paddick. I haven’t told many people or gone to the police. I am too sad and ashamed. 'Worst of all is that for the month I was corresponding with Henry Smith, I was the happiest I have been in many years.’ Partly in response to the scale and seriousness of these online dating scams, 13 of Britain’s best-known internet dating websites have formed a new trade association – the Online Dating Association – to be launched next month. One of its key concerns will be its members’ ability to safeguard the hearts and  wallets of vulnerable clients. Its chief executive will be George Kidd, a former British consul and ex-Cabinet Office director responsible for compliance policy. He said: ‘Online dating is now part of everyday life, it’s the biggest single way people meet. ‘The industry has matured to the point that it needs a code of practice and membership of the ODA will  be like a hallmark people can trust. 'Our members each have their  own technological methods of  policing profiles and protecting clients and, of course, they have regard for the vulnerability of  people’s circumstances. ‘They do all they can, but they are not there to replace common sense. The guiding principle in online dating has to be: If you wouldn’t tell or give someone something in real life, don’t do it on the internet.’","Career highlights of former Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner used in scam .

"John Villers-Farrow, 66, turned himself into police after allegations that he sexually abused two children . Villers-Farrow is brother of actress Mia Farrow, who has 15 children, both adopted and biological . Police asking anyone with information to come forward as there are fears for more victims . By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 16:27 EST, 15 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:27 EST, 15 November 2012 . The brother of film scion Mia Farrow has been arrested and charged for the alleged sexual assault and abuse of two children over an eight-year period, it emerged today. John Charles Villers-Farrow, 66, was charged Wednesday with multiple offenses, including assault, child abuse, and sex offense after he turned himself into police. Investigators believe that there could be additional victims beyond the two children who were allegedly abused between 2000 and 2008. Mia Farrow's brother John Charles Villers-Farrow, 66, was charged Wednesday with assault, child abuse, and sex offense after two young men told authorities they had been abused . Villers-Farrow, who lives in Edgewater, Maryland, is being held on $800,000 bond at the Jennifer Road Detention Center. Anne Arundel County police first began investigation the brother of Mia Farrow in August after receiving a tip that he was abusing children in the area, according to the Capital Gazette. After police were informed of the possible abuse, two young men came forward, alleging that Villers-Farrow abused them, beginning in 2000 and ending in 2008. They said that Villers-Farrow had been their neighbor. The 66-year-old turned himself into authorities Wednesday night. As NBC Washington noted, this is not the first time he’s been in the public eye. In 1992, Villers-Farrow famously told PEOPLE magazine that Woody Allen, who had once been married to Farrow and fathered three of their children, would have serious legal trouble because of his relationship with her adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. Villers-Farrow said: ‘(He’s) going to be indicted, and he’s going to be ruined. I think when all of it comes out, he’s going to jail.’ Farrow’s brother was referred to at the time as ‘a sometime screenwriter and boat salesman outside Annapolis.’ Villers-Farrow spoke out on behalf of his sister Mia Farrow, pictured in 1990 with then boyfriend Woody Allen, when he left her for adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, pictured right with the director in 2011. He said Allen should be indicted for what he did . In total, Villers-Farrow is uncle to 11 of his sister’s adopted children, and her four biological children. The bespectacled Allen, famous for his self-deprecating and neurotic on-film persona, began a romantic relationship with Farrow’s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, 34 years his junior. Following the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Allen’s possession, Farrow split from Woody and launched a messy custody battle over their three children, Satchel, Dylan, and Moses. During the proceedings, which were closely followed, Farrow claimed that Allen had sexually abused Dylan, though the judge dismissed the claims because they were not substantiated. Farrow was awarded full custody, and Allen was denied visits with Dylan, who later changed her name to Malone.  The couple's other adopted child, Moshe, who changed his name to Moses, chose not to see Allen at all. In a 2005 interview, Woody confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children from his relationship with the star of Hannah And Her Sisters. 'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair.","John Villers-Farrow, 66, turned himself into police after allegations that he sexually abused two children .
