Many of us know the comfort of turning to a little retail therapy when we feel down or lonely. But while treating ourselves to something nice may improve our mood briefly, new research from the University of Chicago suggests that shopping as a cure for loneliness is futile - and could in fact make us feel more lonely. In fact, the very act of fending off loneliness by shopping can create a vicious cycle where one shops because they are lonely, feels more lonely because they have shopped, and continues shopping in a misguided attempt to cure the loneliness. The study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, analysed data from 2,500 consumers over six years and found that while loneliness does indeed contribute to materialism, the two have a bidirectional relationship. Defining materialism as the ‘importance consumers attach to acquiring and owning material possessions’ the study proposes that materialism can ‘crowd out’ social relationships and thus increase loneliness, which in turn increases materialism as a coping strategy. Before you throw out your credit card though, it is worth noting that the researchers found this vicious cycle only applied to two of the three sub-types of materialism: ‘Acquisition as source of happiness’ (where material possessions are a means to your happiness; you buy things in an attempt to fill an inner void of happiness) and ‘possession-defined success’ (using material things as a yardstick to measure how well you’re doing in life in comparison to other people) both increased loneliness over time. However the third type of materialism ‘acquisition centrality’ (buying nice or luxury things simply because owning them makes you happy) in fact decreased loneliness. Similarly, while being lonely increased both the first two types of materialism, it had no effect on acquisition centrality. The subtype of materialism 'acquisition centrality' can actually decrease your sense of loneliness- so just make sure you are shopping for the right reasons! If buying a new designer dress makes us happy because it's beautiful and we enjoyed choosing it, for instance, then the purchase may have the effect of making us feel somewhat less lonely. However . if we expect the dress to cure an inner sense of unhappiness, or . we want it to show friends and colleagues how well we are doing, then buying it may . ultimately lead to us feeling more lost and lonely than before the shopping trip. So while the study points at a wisdom in evaluating why we shop, it does not necessarily mean that we are all susceptible to the same pernicious cycle of materialism and loneliness.","Research by University of Chicago shows we shop when we are lonely .

Prince William and Kate have asked his 71-year-old former nanny to help look after baby George, it was reported today. Jessica Webb is said to be considering the offer of coming out of retirement and being the 20-day-old prince's first charge. Young William and Harry were shielded from their parents' bitter divorce by the nanny who never married or had children of her own. Royal charge: Prince William is led by his nanny Jessica Webb at the Guards Polo Club in Windsor in 1988 . She reportedly tried to ensure the princes did not witnessed the screaming rows between Prince Charles and Diana - caring for the the boys from the age of seven until William went off to prep school five years later. After she left Kensington Palace, Ms Webb went on to work for Viscount Linley and his wife Serena looking after their son Charles and daughter Margarita. But she kept in touch with the princes and was a guest at William's 21st birthday and attended the royal wedding two years ago. One royal courtier told the Sunday People: 'Jessie would be ideal. Everyone likes her. She's discreet and she's of an age when she's not going to have her picture in the paper every five minutes.' Splashing about: Nanny Webb, right, with Diana and the young princes at Thorpe Park in 1990 . The paper claimed the 'granny nanny' is keen to help because William was a favourite of hers, but she is reluctant about doing the job full-time. Princess Diana chose her to be William's main nanny overruling Prince Charles who had wanted an old-school royal appointee. She believed Ms Webb would give the boys values of fairness and compassion and bring fun into her sons’ upbringing, according the paper. William, 31, reportedly wants to recreate the same feeling of security that Jessica gave him and pass it on to his own son. Event: Nanny Webb with Diana and William attend Harry's school sports day in Richmond in 1992 . Kate, 31, is caring for George full-time but has been advised she will become exhausted by combining motherhood with her future royal duties. At the moment she is being supported by her mother Carole Middleton while William is back on duty as an RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot in Angelsey, North Wales. Royal courtiers have urged them to instal a more formal arrangement for looking after the baby once the summer is over. Prince Edward’s wife Sophie Wessex, 48, employs two full-time nannies for her son and daughter. A source told writer Sian James: 'They both accept the view that they won’t be able to do it all. There is also a feeling that Kate might lay herself open to criticism if she is seen letting her mother have too much influence. 'William has very fond memories of Jessie and they’ve put the idea to her that she comes back. I think she’s very flattered.' New parents: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, leave the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London, with their newborn son . Ms Webb, from London's East End, was traditionally trained and a colleague who worked with her is quoted as saying she had a “'terrific sense of humour'. The colleague added: 'She would stand for no nonsense and would want to do things her way.' William speaks to Kate and his baby son every day via videolink and Kate is supposed to be joining him on the island in four weeks’ time. A kensington Palace spokesman told MailOnline: 'It is too early to talk about potential childcare arrangements at this stage.'","'Granny nanny' Jessica Webb is said to be considering coming out of retirement .

'There is no justification for this kind of attack on people in a private residence. Hopefully the justice authorities will react to the perpetrators of this act.' The British victim said he was fine but did not wish to discuss the matter for fear of identifying his partner and making him more vulnerable to acts of homophobic violence.

The move will fuel claims that he is using his daughter as a tool with which to attack his estranged wife. Meanwhile, Nigella’s friends claimed yesterday that Saatchi had threatened to kill himself in an attempt to win her back. After their decree nisi was granted on July 31, the pair had two telephone conversations, during which Saatchi apparently threatened to take his own life.

A former Library of Congress employee accused of using a work computer to post fake sex ads on Craigslist has pleaded guilty to stalking and identification fraud. Kenneth Edward Kuban, 61, of Reva entered his plea Monday in U.S. District Court in Charlottesville. Kuban also pleaded guilty to violating a protective order. Kuban admitted during the plea hearing that he posed online as his ex-girlfriend and posted more than 160 false ads on Craigslist directing men to her home with the promise of sex. Stalker: Kenneth Kuban harassed and stalked a woman after she ended their six-month relationship . Kuban was arrested in March in connection with a protracted stalking campaign of a 64-year-old woman who had dated him for about six months before ending the relationship in February 2011. According to the affidavit, after the break-up Kuban began stalking the woman. She took out an order against him which prohibited any further contact, but Kuban continued to harass the woman, calling her five or six times daily. The woman changed to an unlisted number, after which Kuban called her service provider, Verizon, and told them she had died. Her phone, internet and television services were cut off and it was a month before she could restore them. Other pranks followed, including calling a meeting the woman was in to tell her that her property was on fire when it wasn't, before he began posting ads posing as the woman in the Casual Encounters section of Craigslist. Classified: Using Craigslist, Kuban would pose as his ex-girlfriend to offer sex to men. He would disclose her home address and photographs of the woman . According to the affidavit acquired by The Smoking Gun, Kuban posed as 'a senior lady' who was looking for a 'hung' man who could 'give me some pleasuring.' FBI agents responding to the ad were given the woman's personal home address and instructed to ignore the locked gate and come right to the front door. Some of the ads posted included a photograph of the woman. Kuban's ads were so effective that men turned up at all hours of the day to the woman's house, some even flying in from out of state. According to the Culpeper Times, the woman had to install a locked gate and security cameras. She put up signs telling potential suitors the ads were a hoax, but they were often ignored. Local law enforcement was called to chase men seeking sex away, sometimes several times a day, according the the Times. Jail time: Kuban worked as a preservationist at the Library of Congress facility in Culpeper, Virginia but now faces a lengthy prison sentence . Between January 1 and March 20 of this year, Fauquier sheriff's deputies had 46 calls at the woman's home, Lieutenant James Hartman, spokesman for the Fauquier County Sheriff's Office, told the Culpeper Times. 'They would pull up to the gate, find it was locked, climb over the gate and walk up the driveway,' Hartman said. Three arrests were made on men trespassing on the woman's property, including of Gregory Lamont Washington of Boston, who allegedly climbed the woman's fence, walked up the driveway to her door before turning back. Washington is a registered sex offender who was convicted in 2008 of indecent liberties with children. As soon as authorities or the woman contacted Craigslist to take down the fake ads, more would replace them. U.S. Attorney Timothy J. Heaphy says Kuban used a government computer at the Library of Congress . to post 111  of the ads. Fifty-four ads were posted from his personal . computer. Kuban's sentencing is set for November 15.

Greg Myerson, of North Branford, Conn., with one of the record striped bass he caught off the Connecticut coast . A Connecticut man, who is called the Warren Buffett of the fishing world, has been branded the greatest living striper fisherman for consistently snagging record breaking bass. Greg Myerson, 45, who is also an electrician, gives seminars on how he continues to catch striped bass weighing 50lbs or more, but won't reveal all his secrets. Myerson set the world record two years ago by catching a striped bass that weighed 81.8lbs off the Connecticut coast. Last year he set the striped bass length record of about 44 inches. Just last month he caught a 73-pound bass . 'I'm just going to go ahead and say it: Greg Myerson is the greatest living striper fisherman,' declared Rick Bach in an account last month in The Fish Report. Chris Megan, owner of On the Water magazine, said he doesn't know anyone who's caught so many large striped bass. Myerson reached the pinnacle by methodically studying his prey and developing devices to lure the fish to him and, perhaps, change how people fish. 'I've gotten it down to a science,' Myerson said. 'That's what all these great catches are attributed to, knowledge of the fish. You gotta think like them.' The 45-year-old electrician from North Branford began fishing at age two. At eight, he used the feathers from his grandmother's dead parrot to make his first fly, catching a rare rainbow trout and realizing the thrill of catching a fish with something he made. He studied fish, learning that striped bass feed on lobster and are drawn to them by the sound they make along the ocean floor. Myerson began trying to replicate that sound with a rattle he put in sinkers, at one point using discarded crack cocaine vials he cleaned up at work and filled with bearings and BBs. His methods grew more sophisticated as he listened to crayfish in his 200-gallon aquarium with a stethoscope. He also used a sound meter to determine the decibel and frequency and then tweaked the sound of the rattle to mimic it as much as possible. Last year Greg Myerson (pictured center) set the striped bass length record of about 44 inches . Greg Myerson (pictured left) has been called the Warren Buffet of the fishing world, giving seminars on how to catch the big bass . 'It's the reason why I caught more big striped bass than anyone in the world,' Myerson said. 'It was my secret weapon for years.' Myerson said he's received patents for his rattling sinkers designed to lure the striped bass to fishermen and formed a company called Fish Call to sell the products. 'We're changing the whole fishing industry. We already have,' Myerson said. Myerson stocked a stream on his property with trout and noticed how the biggest ones take the best spot. He figures striped bass do the same, such as by staying near a boulder that breaks the current so they can conserve energy as they wait for lobster to come out when tides are slow. He likes to head out in the evening and will fish through the night at times. He insists on quiet, often barefoot on the boat to prevent noise and alert to the slightest disturbance to his line. Myerson really began to attract attention when he caught three bass in 2010 that weighed more than 60 pounds and won angler of the year. In 2011, Myerson headed out in calm waters off the Connecticut coast when he snagged a powerful fish that began to pull his boat. 'It was an incredible fight,' Myerson said.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:15 EST, 12 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:42 EST, 12 August 2013 . William P. Clark, who rose from campaign volunteer to one of President Ronald Reagan's most trusted advisers, has died. He was 81. Clark died Saturday at his ranch home in the central California town of Shandon after a long battle with Parkinson's disease, according to his son. 'It's been a hard fight for him, but we do feel he's in a better place and he's not suffering any longer,' Paul Clark said Sunday. The elder Clark began working for Reagan by managing the actor's 1966 gubernatorial campaign in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles. He ascended to various political jobs as Reagan moved from the Golden State to the White House. In this Nov. 11, 1984 file photo, President Ronald Reagan signs the papers accepting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Interior Secretary William Clark is pictured directly behind Reagan . Clark worked for Reagan in Sacramento, rising to the position of executive secretary, before accepting a judgeship with the San Luis Obispo County Superior Court. Reagan later appointed him to the state appellate court in Los Angeles, and then the state Supreme Court, before he moved to Washington to serve as deputy secretary of state and national security adviser. Clark began working for Reagan by managing the actor's 1966 gubernatorial campaign in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles . Clark was national security adviser when Reagan maneuvered the Soviet Union toward arms control, and he was a key player in Reagan's philosophy of 'peace through strength.' Their close relationship led Time magazine to name Clark 'the second most powerful man in the White House' in a 1983 cover story. The New York Times said Clark had more access to Reagan than anyone else. 'They had very similar ideas about what ought to be done,' Edwin Meese, who served as counselor to Reagan and then as attorney general, told the San Luis Obispo Tribune in 2009. 'And they also knew and understood one another very well, having worked together back in the California days.' Clark then served as interior secretary for nearly two years, replacing unpopular department head James Watt, before returning to his private law practice and business consulting firm. Born in 1931 in Oxnard to a family of lawmen (his grandfather Robert was Ventura County sheriff and a U.S. marshal; his father, William Sr., was the police chief of Oxnard), Clark served in the Army Counter-Intelligence Corps in Europe in the mid-1950s. He attended both Stanford University and Loyola Law School without earning degrees, but nevertheless passed the bar exam. 'That's been pointed out throughout his career that he finished neither college nor law school, but be that as it may he did just fine,' his son Paul said. After retiring from public life, Clark and his wife Joan designed and built a chapel in Shandon that they donated to the community. A devout Catholic, he also became a strong abortion opponent. Clark is survived by five children. His wife died four years ago.","Clark died Saturday at his ranch home in the central California town of Shandon after a long battle with Parkinson's disease .

Stephen Merrill was finishing his freshman year of college two years ago when he and a group of friends went to an indoor trampoline park in Utah for a day of flipping, jumping and bouncing. At one point, Merrill leaped from a platform into a pit full of foam blocks, and he shot right through them and landed on his head. He broke a vertebra in his neck, and was left paralysed from the neck down. Stephen Merrill, 22, was left paralysed from the neck down after an accident at an indoor trampoline centre. He wants others to realise how dangerous the seemingly harmless pastime can be . Mr Merrill's injury underscores recent . warnings from doctors and government officials about the dangers of the . jump gyms amid a heightened effort to regulate the indoor trampoline . parks as they have become a popular rain-or-shine suburban entertainment . for birthday parties and summer camps. 'Anything where something like that can happen, I mean, it's such a devastating injury,' the 22-year-old said of his accident in Provo.  'It doesn't seem like things are properly regulated if something like that is possible.' Citing broken necks, shattered leg bones and one death, some doctors say the parks are dangerous and can lead to serious injuries that eclipse any benefits. Governments are starting to take notice, with proposed regulations in Utah and California among the first attempts in the country to address concerns about safety in the burgeoning industry. Operators of the trampoline gyms say severe injuries are rare and safety fears are overblown. They claim an injury rate lower than organised sports such as baseball or soccer and point out the gyms offer a place for adults and kids to have fun and get much-needed exercise. Indoor trampolining has become popular in the U.S. where centres offer fun for adults and children whatever the weather. Governments are starting to take notice of the phenomenon, with proposed regulations in Utah and California among the first attempts in the country to address concerns about safety . For safety, many of the gyms post staffers around trampolines like lifeguards to enforce rules. But some doctors say that's not enough, and they've asked the health board to step in . The parks are typically giant warehouses filled with a series of trampolines that allow customers to bounce every which direction, slam-dunk basketballs and do gymnastics moves. This X-ray shows a broken leg caused by playing at a jump gym . Some parks feature angled trampolines sloping up the sides and pits filled with brick-size foam blocks. The industry has grown rapidly, from a handful of centres in the Western U.S. in 2007 to about 160 throughout the world, according to ASTM International, a standards-development organisation. For safety, many of the gyms post staffers around trampolines like lifeguards to enforce rules and require jumpers to first sign a waiver. Emergency room doctors in one Utah county say that's not enough, and they've asked the health board to step in. 'You'll see a lot of these very severe, open wounds that you don't see unless you're in a high-velocity type of injury,' Dr Craig Cook, trauma director at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center. 'This is like a war type of injury or a motor vehicle crash.' Trauma staff at the hospital say they saw 52 injuries requiring multiple doctor visits from area jump gyms from May 2011 to November 2012, according to their emergency room records. Most of the patients are young men around 19 years old, they say, and have had injuries such as dislocated feet, brain hemorrhaging and paralysis. Misty Uribe, who manages Lowes Extreme Air Sports in nearby Provo, said her gym already follows many of the health board proposals, but she's concerned the industry has been unfairly targeted. This X-ray shows all the hardware, plates and screws required to fix a fractured ankle caused by a jump gym . Ms Uribe said her centre sees few injuries compared to the number of people that participate, citing one major injury for every 20,000 visitors. That was Mr Merrill, and she said his jump violated the facility's rules but that the location still took steps to make the pits safer. 'My concern is, once they start with this, where is it going to end?' she said of the proposed regulations. The Utah County Health Board is considering proposals that stipulate gyms must supervise the activities, report their injury rates to the county and warn jumpers about the risks beyond having them sign a waiver. The board will have a public discussion on the proposals this fall. 'We do feel like we have an obligation to inform the public about safety risks out there, especially when it's just open to general public,' said Dr Joseph Miner, executive director of the Utah County Health Department. At the new jump gyms, children and adults take on moves that might previously have be limited to professional gymnasts . The Utah proposals are partly modeled after legislation pending in California that would create an inspection program for the parks akin to regulations for amusement park rides, in addition to requirements about insurance, employee training and injury reporting. The bill has been promoted by a Coronado woman whose 30-year-old son died days after breaking his neck at an Arizona trampoline park in 2012. In Orem, the jump gym Get Air Hang Time has posted signs warning of rules and risks of ""serious catastrophic injury or death"" from the activity. In addition to requiring participants to sign a waiver, the gym requires jumpers to watch a safety video. 'We try to make sure that people understand what this activity is all about and that the risks are there just like any other recreational activities,' owner Aaron Cobabe said. Mr Cobabe said his gym saw more than 150,000 visitors from July 2012 to July 2013, but during that time had about 11 major injuries that required multiple doctor visits. 'The vast majority of people that come in our facility,' he said, 'enjoy the activity and leave without any injuries.'","Indoor trampoline centres for children and adults are growing in popularity .

Two men have died and nine are injured after inhaling toxic gases in the engine room of the Pacific Princess, made famous in the 1970s and 80s in the TV series The Love Boat. Dogan Balci, 37, and Davut Özdemir, 40, were part of a crew of workers dismantling the ship for parts on Saturday in Aliağa, Turkey, after it was sold to Izmir Ship Recycling at auction recently. The ship had sailed from Genoa, Italy, and encountered rough seas during the voyage, which caused damage in the engine room, according to Turkish media reports. Scroll down for video .

TV star: The Pacific Princess featured in almost every episode of The Love Boat . Pumps being used to drain the engine room of water by workers emitted toxic gas and smoke and workers in the room were poisoned. The English language paper Today's Zaman reported that Balci and Özdemir complained of feeling unwell but were 'given a yogurt drink by their employer instead of being taken to a hospital.' Balcı and Özdemir died shortly after, while nine other workers were hospitalized. The 42-year-old vessel, one of the original ships used in the opening credits of The Love Boat, had been sold for scrap for $3.5 million after languishing in a dock in Genoa for several years.

The tragic death of the workers disassembling the boat is a sad end for the once-great cruise ship - though its twin, formerly called the Island Princess, still sails as MV Discovery.

Third round: Jury selection got under way in a third murder trial of former Indiana state trooper David Camm, who is accused of killing his wife and two children in 2000 . A third trial of former Indiana state trooper accused of murdering his wife and children in 2000 got off the ground Monday after his two previous convictions have been overturned on appeal. Prosecutors and defense attorneys began questioning 150 prospective jurors in the trial of David Camm to determine whether Camm is guilty of shooting and killing Kimberly Camm, 35, his 7-year-old son Bradley and 5-year-old daughter Jill. Defense attorney Stacy Uliana said both sides began jury selection by weeding out people who had hardships that would prevent them from serving or who had already decided Camm's guilt or innocence. The trial was moved to Boone County in hopes that an impartial jury could be found. The slayings occurred more than 100 miles away at the family's Georgetown home. The former state trooper has spent a majority of the past 13 years behind bars following two convictions in deaths of his family, even though higher courts threw out both verdicts over inadmissible evidence. The 49-year-old Camm insists he was wrongly convicted, and this trial is another chance to clear his name. For Frank and Janice Renn, Kimberly Camm's parents, this is another shot at closure. 'It’s like that movie Groundhog Day, where he keeps waking up to the same thing every day,’ Mr Renn said. The Camm slayings are one of Indiana’s longest-running murder cases, following a tangled legal path riddled with missing murder weapons, allegations of affairs and child abuse, the emergence of a second suspect and a prosecutor’s removal over a book deal. Bloody tragedy: Kimberly Camm, 35 (right), her son, Bradley, age 7 (left), and daughter Jill (center), age 5, were discovered shot dead in the garage of their home in September 2000 . For years, a debate has raged over . whether Camm is a villain or a victim, with both sides taking to . websites, books and national television to argue their points. A petition on change.org seeking to have him freed has collected hundreds of signatures.Prosecutors . have moved the trial to Lebanon, Indiana — in hopes of finding jurors . who haven’t already made up their minds about Camm’s guilt or innocence. Another challenge for prosecutors is making a legal argument that resonates with jurors after the two previous failures. Camm, . who had left the state police four months before his family was killed, . was arrested a few days after telling investigators he had discovered . his wife and their two children shot to death in the garage of their . Georgetown home September 8, 2000. The weapon was never found. Defense . attorneys argued at Camm’s first trial in 2002 that prosecutors ignored . evidence that another man had been in the garage where killings . occurred. After DNA . linked a violent ex-convict to the scene, they thought Camm would be . freed. Instead, prosecutors said Camm had conspired with the second man . to kill his family, and he was convicted again in 2006. The second man, Charles Boney, is serving a 225-year prison sentence for murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Legal fumbles: Camm (center) has been found guilty twice, but both convictions were later overturned on appeal . Conspiracy theory: Ex-con Charles Boney (left) was convicted of the murders and sentenced to 225 years in prison, but the prosecution believes he was acting in concert with Camm (right) Boney’s palm print was found on Kimberly Camm’s SUV, and a sweatshirt found in the garage had been issued to Boney in prison while he was serving time for armed robbery and criminal confinement. Both times, appellate courts ruled that prosecutors had deliberately inflamed the jury, in the first trial by calling a dozen women who testified they had extramarital affairs with Camm, and in the second by suggesting he had molested his daughter without any evidence to back up those statements. The third trial is expected to last at least six weeks amid heightened security at the Boone County Courthouse, about 25 miles northwest of Indianapolis. Floyd County Prosecutor Keith Henderson, who won the second murder conviction against Camm, won’t be there. He was removed after signing a book deal regarding Camm’s case, though he said the deal later was dropped. The Renns plan to be in court, hoping for closure and a chance to heal. ‘Hopefully one day we'll wake up and this will never have happened. But common sense tells you it won’t be that way,’ Frank Renn said. Crime scene: Camm told investigators that he returned from a game of basketball on the night of September 28, 2000, and discovered his family slain in the garage of their Georgetown, Indiana, home . Resting place: The grave site of Kimberly Camm and her two young children, Brad and Jill . Both David Camm and Kimberly Renn were born and raised in New Albany, Indiana. The two met in 1988 and got married a year later - three years after Camm had divorced his first wife. Also in 1989, David Camm was accepted into the Indiana State Police as a trooper recruit. The young couple had their first child, Bradley, in 1993, followed by Jill in 1995. According to some accounts, the Camms' relationship took a turn for the worse shortly after the birth of their son, with the husband allegedly starting an affair with another woman, which culminated with him briefly moving out of the house. By the time their daughter was born, however, the Camms’ life appeared to be back on track. The family finished construction on their new house on Lockhart Road in Georgetown, and things were seemingly going well, with David Camm serving as a state trooper with the Indiana State Police Sellesburg District, and his wife advancing her career as a well-paid financial analyst. In March 2000, about four months before the killings, Dave resigned from his post with the state police and went to work for his uncle, who owned a basement waterproofing business. September 28, 2000, began like most . days in the Camm household, with Kimberly waking up at 6am, followed by . David and their kids a short time later. The . husband kissed his family goodbye and left for work. About an hour . later, Mrs Camm headed out with the children, dropping off Bradley at . his elementary school and Jill at her pre-school. After . making arrangements with her parents to stop by later in the day, . Kimberly Camm drove to her work at Capital Holding Insurance Company. At . around 4pm, she left to pick up her daughter from school and take her . to dance practice. After . 6pm, Kimberly took her son to his swimming practice at New Albany High . School. Shortly after 7pm, the Camms set out for home, located about 11 . miles away. Meanwhile, . David Camm left work just before 7pm and drove to a nearby church, where . he arranged to play a pickup game of basketball with a group of . friends. Costly case: It is estimated that by the time Camm's third trial reaches its conclusion, the state will have spent $4million in taxpayers' money on the case . Grieving parents: Janice, left, and Frank Renn hold a photograph of their daughter Kimberly Camm in their New Albany home . Seeking closure: In an undated photo, Janice and Frank Renn, center, are seen in a family portrait from Christmas of 1999 with their daughters Kimberly Camm, left, Debbie Karem, right, and their grandchildren Jill and Bradley Camm . Just before 9.30pm, Dave Camm placed a frantic call with the ISP Sellersburg, where he had worked for 10 years, reporting that he found his wife and children shot dead in the garage of their home. The prosecution, however, rejected David Camm’s version of events, accusing him of murdering his family in order to pursue affairs with other women. During his first trial, the 11 people who took part in the basketball pickup game on the night of September 28 testified in Camm's defense, telling jurors that he was at the gym at the time of the murders. But the prosecutors claimed that Camm could have sneaked out to meet up with ex-convict Charles Boney and kill his family. Camm was convicted the first time in 2002, but the verdict was thrown out two years later, the Indianapolis Star reported. He was found guilty a second time in 2006 - a conviction that was also overturned on appeal in 2009, when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors inflamed the jury by making baseless accusations that Camm had molested his daughter. It is estimated that by the time Camm's third trial reaches its conclusion, the state will have spent $4million in taxpayers' money on the case.","On September 28, 2000, bodies of Kimberly Camm and her children, Bradley, 7, and Jill, 5, were found in their Georgetown, Indiana, home .

Two men have been arrested in Saudi Arabia on suspicion of planning terrorist attacks which forced the closure of several foreign embassies in the region in recent weeks. The arrests come as the U.S. sharply escalated its drone attacks on neighbouring Yemen on Thursday with 12 militants killed in three separate strikes. Saudi officials claim the two men arrested, from Yemen and Chad, were planning suicide attacks connected to recent al Qaeda threats on American and British embassies which forced their closures this week. A soldier mans an anti-aircraft machine gun on a military vehicle during a patrol in Sanaa, Yemen, yesterday . Attack: American drones similar to these killed 12 militants in three separate blasts in Yemen yesterday . The pair were detained in late July after they exchanged information on social media about imminent attacks, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. The Saudi Interior Ministry said an investigation is continuing into the pair, who used mobile phones and encrypted electronic communications to discuss the terrorist plot. 'The security authorities through monitoring and follow up of published messages of incitement and hatred through social networks managed at the beginning of the last ten days of the holy month of Ramadan to arrest two expatriates,' the ministry added, in a statement published by the official state news agency SPA. 'The two recruited themselves for the service of deviant thought, as evidenced by their seized items which included computer hardware, electronic media and mobile phones and which indicated their communication with the deviant group abroad either by electronic encrypted messages or through identities via the social networks (such as Abu Alfidaa, Hspouy, Muawiya Almadani, Rasasah fi Qusasah, and Abu El Feda Aldokulai) so as to exchange information about impending suicide operations in the region,' the statement added. Children play with toy guns in Sanaa, Yemen, yesterday as America continued to launch drone attacks on al Qaeda terrorists in the country . As the world's top oil exporter and main U.S. Gulf ally, Saudi Arabia is a top target for al Qaeda, which carried out attacks the country a decade ago which killed hundreds. Saudi Arabia has arrested thousands of suspects over the past 10 years and accused them of being involved with al Qaeda. Attacks have been rare since 2006 when it crushed a domestic campaign by the militant group. Survivors of the al Qaeda group in Saudi Arabia responsible for attcks between 2003 and 2006 are believed to have later fled to Yemen where they joined local militants to set up AQAP. The Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is now based in Saudi Arabia's lawless neighbour Yemen - which is one of the militant movement's most active wings. The U.S. is now targeting the terrorist group with drone strikes across Yemen - with 34 suspected al Qaeda militants killed in the last two weeks. It comes amid a global terror alert issued by Washington. High alert: A Yemeni soldier guards security barriers outside the British embassy as authorities tighten security measures around the western embassies in Sanaa, Yemen, earlier this week . The U.S. and Britain evacuated diplomatic staff from the Yemen capital of Sanaa this week after learning of a threatened attack that prompted Washington to close temporarily 19 diplomatic posts in the Middle East and Africa. On Thursday, the U.S. State Department warned Americans not to travel to Pakistan and ordered nonessential government personnel to leave the U.S. Consulate in Lahore because of a specific threat to that diplomatic mission. Thursday's first reported drone attack hit a car carrying suspected militants in the district of Wadi Ubaidah, about 175 kilometers (109 miles) east of Sanaa, and killed six, a security official said. Badly burned bodies lay beside their vehicle, according to the official. Five of the dead were Yemenis, while the sixth was believed to be of another Arab nationality, he said. The second drone attack killed three alleged militants in the al-Ayoon area of Hadramawt province in the south, the official said. The third, also in Hadramawt province, killed three more suspected militants in the al-Qutn area, he added. On patrol: Yemeni soldiers search a car on a street leading to the U.S. and British embassies after Washington issued a global terror alert . All the airstrikes targeted cars, added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The drone strikes have become a near-daily routine since they began July 27. So far, they have been concentrated in remote, mountainous areas where al Qaeda's top five leaders are believed to have taken refuge. But drones also have been seen and heard buzzing for hours over Sanaa, worrying residents who fear getting caught in the crossfire. While the United States acknowledges its drone program in Yemen, it does not talk about individual strikes or release information on how many are carried out. The program is run by the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command and the CIA, with the military flying its drones out of Djibouti, and the CIA out of a base in Saudi Arabia. Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale declined to comment Thursday and would not confirm the existence of a military drone program in Yemen. The CIA also declined to comment.

David Cameron warned last night that Britain was ‘missing out big time’ on the benefits of fracking by not drilling at enough sites in the search for shale gas. In his most outspoken comments about the technology, the Prime Minister said it would be a ‘big mistake’ if the Government did not encourage fracking across Britain. Mr Cameron said the Government would dispel ‘myths’ from green groups that drilling for gas would lead to earthquakes, and he dismissed fears that it could lead to water taps catching fire. But campaigners last night accused him of lying about the dangers, as he suggested the UK should copy the US, where thousands of wells have been bored. Addressing a question and answer  session in Lancashire, the Prime Minister said: ‘I will just give you one figure to show how much we are missing out. 'In the whole of the European Union last year there were 100 shale gas wells dug. ‘At the same time in the United States there were 10,000. ‘Now, the EU has about three quarters as much shale gas as the US so we are missing out big time at the moment and I want to make sure Britain doesn’t miss out.

Fracking demonstrators at Balcombe, West Sussex. Mr Cameron said the Government would dispel 'myths' from green groups that drilling for gas would lead to earthquakes, and he dismissed fears that it could lead to water taps catching fire . ‘Their gas prices are about half the level of ours. So we would be making a big mistake if we didn’t think hard about how to encourage fracking and cheaper gas prices.’ Forty wells are expected to be drilled before the 2015 general election, half in the North West. But there could be widespread drilling across the South. Dorset, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent are thought to contain gas reserves. Mr Cameron said: ‘Nothing is going to happen in this country unless it’s environmentally safe. ‘There are some myths that  we have to dispel. There is no question of having earthquakes and fire coming out of taps.’ Police escort a lorry towards a proposed fracking site at Balcombe . But he mistakenly promised . communities where wells are drilled that they will get £1million . compensation – ten times the amount actually proposed. Downing Street confirmed he had been mistaken and that Government policy has not changed. He also told staff at Crown Paints in Darwen: ‘If people can see a direct benefit from fracking and shale gas, they will be more willing to really look at the arguments about what this will mean for their community if it goes ahead. ‘In that way we can see wells dug and we can see the benefits of shale gas here in the UK.’ But he was forced to dodge anti-fracking campaigners by sneaking into Wigan Boys and Girls Club through a children’s playground. Protest organiser Stephen Hall, 56, said: ‘Cameron does not care about the dangers because it is all going to be in the “desolate” North. We are the ones who will have to live with the consequences. 'This is not a safe process – we know that already because the last time they drilled we had earthquakes.’ Gayzer Frackman, 52, who changed his name by deed poll and runs the Frack Free Fylde group, said: ‘He is not telling the truth about fracking. ‘We are worried about our water supplies and our houses toppling down and these issues need to be addressed.’ Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘Any language that implies that a decision has been taken and that people will be forced to accept fracking is bound to raise hackles and increase concerns. ‘Companies drilling the wells are well aware of the need to get people on side and do proper consultations. If they don’t do that in the Weald of Kent or the South Downs, you’re going to have an uprising.’","PM said it would be 'big mistake if Government did not encourage fracking .

The father of a four-year-old boy who was knocked over and killed on Friday night has spoken of his anger at the driver who hit him and then drove away. Reda Gendy's only son Kyrillos was hit as he waited to cross a road near a bagel shop in Staten Island, with his mother and seven-year-old sister. Former Air Force serviceman John Sanjurjo handed himself into police 16 hours after the crash, but pleaded not guilty at his court appearance today. Suspect: John Sanjurjo handed himself into police but pleaded not guilty at a court hearing . Heartless: The driver struck Kyrillos, left, his seven-year-old sister Gabriella and their mother Arini Thomas . 'You got the wrong guy, man,' the 33-year-old said as he walked into court, where he was released on $50,000 bail. 'He could have at least waited until I . buried my son,' Mr Gendy, said after hearing Sanjurjo had been released on bail. 'I'm going to send . him a postcard of my son every single birthday so he can know what he took from me,' Mr Gendy told ABC 7. Sanjurjo faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident and could face seven years in prison if found guilty. His . defense attorney Anthony Caronna has claimed that no one could identify . his client as being the driver and argued for the case to be thrown . out.

'Had he ran to my son and held him as he took his last breath that would have meant more to me,' Mr Gendy said. 'I'm going to let him live with the fact that he took life from me,' he added, as he sobbed and beat his chest. The . Gendys are being supported by their extended family, who have expressed . shock at the charge of leaving the scene of an accident which Sanjurjo . faces.

The four horseback riders who spotted 16-year-old  kidnap victim Hannah Anderson in the Idaho backcountry said it appears she was sharing a small tent with her captor James DiMaggio and that the 40-year-old murder suspect had his arm around the teen when they were seen together. Mark John, a former county sheriff and U.S. Army Ranger, said the couple set off alarm bells when he and three friends came across them on Wednesday afternoon near a lake in River of No Return Wilderness near Cascade, Idaho. John called the police in Idaho upon his return home, which led to the discovery of DiMaggio's car hidden by tree branches at the edge of the Frank Church wilderness trail. Scroll down for video .

'He was like a square peg going into a . round hole, he didn't fit,' Mr John said Sunday. 'He might have been an . outsdoorman in California, but he wasn't an outdoorsman in Idaho.' The four friends are being credited with leading authorities to kidnapped Hannah and to the fugitive DiMaggio, who is believed to have murdered the teenage girl's mother and eight-year-old brother. When Mr John noticed young Hannah and sweatpants soaking her feet in the lake he joked that she should pull her feet out because she's scaring the fish. As he rode off down the trail, he said she could be heard remarking to herself, 'I guess we're all in trouble now.' It's unclear what she meant by the cryptic remark. She appeared to try to hide her face as the riders passed, Mr John said. Another of the horseback riders said he encountered DiMaggio and Hannah moments later and saw 40-year-old DiMaggio with his arm around the high school girl's waist. The four houseback riders, who had been fishing the same remote late in the Idaho wilderness for years, said the entire scene made them profoundly suspicious an they talked about it throughout the night.

They shot dead DiMaggio, who was unarmed, and who had been trying to 'fortify' his remote campsite. DiMaggio is suspected of killing Hannah's mother Christina - who thought of him as a friend - and Hannah's eight-year-old brother Ethan. Hannah Anderson's grandparents say the identity of the man accused in her kidnapping and the murder of her mother and brother came as 'complete shock' and reveal she is expected to be hospitalized for some time.

He mentioned this fact to the riders in an attempt to explain why he and the young girl were deep in the Idaho wilderness. He told them, 'She got to pick where we went last year, she wanted to go to Hollywood in Los Angeles.' The implication was that this year, he got to pick and they took a rugged camping trip. Mr John said that the spot where the riders found DiMaggio and Hannah was a remote and deep in the wilderness. DiMaggio had picked a spot for the tent high on a ridge that was far from the water, Mr John said.

An eight-year-old boy who needs life-changing surgery to allow him to finally play football with his friends, has been given hope by the generosity of MailOnline readers. Joseph Hill suffers from spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy which affects his lower limbs and means he has to rely on a wheelchair. He was told he could have pioneering surgery - called Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy - on the NHS. Joseph Hill, eight, who needs life-changing surgery to allow him to finally play football with his friends, has been given hope by the generosity of MailOnline readers . However, he then received a letter saying that the surgery, which was previously only available in the U.S., had been cancelled because of an 'NHS shake-up'. The operation would involve cutting the nerves in his spine to relieve the severe tightness in his legs. As a result, Joseph's family were left with no choice but to try and raise the £20,000 needed for the surgery themselves. Joseph's story appeared on Monday, at which point the family had raised half of the target. Donations flooded in from generous readers and by Wednesday they had reached the target. Joseph’s mother Angela Hill, 36, from Wakefield, said: ‘I couldn't believe it. When the story went on MailOnline my phone started pinging with all of the donations. Joesph (with his mother Angela) has spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy which affects his lower limbs. He was told he could have surgery on the NHS but then got a letter saying the operation had been cancelled . 'It's been an emotional rollercoaster. It's just been mad. The comments have been so touching. 'When we hit the target me and my husband were really, really tearful. I don't know how to thank people for being so kind.' Mrs Hill added: 'Joseph was so excited when we told him. He was absolutely ecstatic. 'He shouted ""yes, that's amazing"". He couldn't believe it. 'He wants the surgery done as soon as possible.' Mrs Hill and her husband, Allan, are now consulting with Joseph's surgeon at Leeds General Infirmary. As a result, Joseph's family (parents Allan and Angela, and sister, Emma) were left with no choice but to try and raise the £20,000 needed for the surgery themselves . They believe that he will be able to have the surgery in September or early October. After the surgery he will need physiotherapy five times a week for two years. The family believe that this will also cost about £20,000 so they are continuing to fund raise to pay for it. Mrs Hill said: 'The physio is so important to get the most out of the operation.' She added: 'I can't thank people . enough. The words are not enough to thank the people who have taken time . out of their day, when times are so hard, to help our son. 'We are absolutely overwhelmed.' The Primary Care Trust, who had . originally organised Joseph's operation, was abolished and NHS England . who took over shattered the hopes of Joseph, and five other children, by . cancelling their operations. Joseph's story appeared on MailOnline on Monday, at which point the family had raised half of the target. Donations flooded in from generous readers and by Wednesday they had reached the target . Mrs Hill said: ‘One minute they were . booking him in for the operation and Joseph was looking forward to being . just like his friends, and the next a bog standard letter came through . the door saying it had been cancelled. ‘He was really upset, and it was heart-breaking to see. ‘He thought he had everything coming to him and it was taken away from him in a heartbeat.’ Joseph was born prematurely at 34 weeks by emergency caesarean when his mother could no longer feel him moving. Joseph's mother, Angela Hill, said: 'I don't know how to thank people for being so kind' At six-weeks-old, his parents were . told he had suffered brain damage due to a lack of oxygen and he was . later diagnosed with spastic diplegia. He has a walker to help him get around but he struggles with it, and needs a lot of physiotherapy to keep his muscles as loose as possible. Mrs Hill said: ‘He loves watching football but he can’t run around and play football with his friends. ‘He’s getting to the age where he’s starting to notice he’s different. He doesn’t like sports day because he can’t compete properly to win anything and he feels left out when he doesn’t get picked for things. ‘We just want him to be able to run around with his friends and not feel like he is being held back.’ A spokeswoman for NHS England said they did not discuss individual cases but added: ‘NHS England’s current commissioning policy means that this procedure is not currently being routinely funded for patients in England. ‘Individual funding requests will continue to be considered where there are believed to be exceptional clinical grounds in an individual case.’ She said that NHS funding may be provided later this financial year for a small group of patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment.

Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs. Source: SCOPE .","Joseph Hill has spastic diplegia, a cerebral palsy that affects the legs .

Experts have described the dress outfit as one of the most collectable Elvis items in the world. Elvis was one of the world's biggest stars when he accepted national conscription to the US army in 1958 aged 21. Incredibly, he turned down the chance to join the Special Services division and perform at bases around the world in favour of becoming a private with no special treatment. Private Presley was assigned to the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, and shortly after arriving moved out of barracks into the luxury Hotel Grunewald. Elvis turned down the chance to join the Special Services division and perform at bases around the world in favour of becoming a private with no special treatment . Following Elvis' death in 1977 the uniform was passed on to his cousin Patsy Presley, who has kept in pristine condition . He spent two years overseas before being honourably discharged as a sergeant in 1960. During his time with the army he was introduced to karate, which would famously become part of his stage routines, and also met his future wife Priscilla. He flew back to the US on March 2, stopping to refuel in Scotland, the only time he would set foot on UK soil. Elvis Presley is known for his flamboyant stage costumes . During his conscription Elvis had ten top 40 hits including A Big Hunk o' Love and Hard Headed Woman. Following Elvis' death at his Graceland home in 1977 the uniform was passed on to his cousin Patsy Presley, who has kept in pristine condition. The summer dress greens outfit comprises of a jacket, size 38S, 29ins by 32ins trousers and a size 7 hat with his name and conscription number printed on the inside. The uniform, worn for formal occasions, is expected to sell for upwards of 13,000 pounds. Garry Shrum, from Heritage Auctions, said: 'It was a real shock when Elvis was drafted into the army, especially as he chose to enlist as a regular soldier rather than in Special Services entertaining troops. 'Elvis spent two years serving in Germany, something you can't imagine today's music and film icons doing. 'He was one of the world's biggest stars at the time and he instantly became the US army's most famous soldier. 'This uniform is his summer dress greens which he would have worn for official occasions like assemblies, ceremonies or meeting dignitaries. 'When he died it was passed on to his first cousin Patsy Presley who has kept hold of it up until now. 'His army uniform is a very special piece of rock and roll history, and comes with a full dose of mojo. 'This uniform is definitely in the top ten most desirable Elvis collectors' items in the world. 'It's going to be a very exciting auction.' The sale will take place at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on August 10.","Elvis accepted national conscription to the US army in 1958 aged 21 .

Since then, the Mercedes 540K Cabriolet B, custom built for Hitler’s designated successor, was largely left to waste away until High Velocity Classics of Pompano Beach, Florida, stepped in to preserve the classic piece of history.

The Mercedes is now in the hands of a Florida group, High Velocity Classics, Inc., who are assembling a team of experts and investors to restore the vehicle to concours quality . According to the Times of Israel, the car was considered a trophy of allied victory after it was captured at Hitler’s villa at Berchtesgaden at the close of the war. It was used by Colonel Heintges, the commander of the 7th Infantry who captured the vehicle, as his personal vehicle, which it remained during the Allied Occupation of Germany. Towards the end of the occupation, the car was sold as surplus to a U.S Army staff sergeant and brought to the United States. He kept it in Texas for a few years, and then sold it to Richard Taylor of North Carolina, who has kept it in his garage to this day. It was shipped to Texas, where it received a proper American paint job complete with army green body and allied star. The car stayed with Taylor up until recently, when High Velocity Classics owners Steven Saffer and David Rathbun heard about the relic. Write caption here .

Goering was the head of the SA, also . known as the Brownshirts, and helped Heinrich Himmler set up Germany's . concentration camps. In 1938, he became head of Germany's armed forces and when the Second World War broke out the following year, he was put in charge of the Luftwaffe and led the Nazi air force during the Battle of Britain. Following Hitler's suicide in 1945, Goering surrendered to the U.S. Army in Austria. He was found guilty of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials and was sentenced to death. However, he cheated the hangman's noose by killing himself in his cell aged 53 with a phial of hidden cyanide. He was known as a Nazi 'magpie' and amassed a personal fortune through the confiscation of Jewish property. His collection included paintings, tapestries, jewellery, hunting ornaments, altarpieces and rugs.","Hermann Goering had Mercedes Benz 540K Cabriolet B custom built in 1940 .

In response to the controversy surrounding ‘Blackfish,’ a documentary about SeaWorld orcas, Pixar reportedly rewrote the ending to ‘Finding Dory,’ the much-anticipated sequel to the box office smash ‘Finding Nemo.’ The movie’s ending reportedly involved a marine park similar to SeaWorld before being modified. Finding Dory: The sequel to 'Finding Nemo' has been reworked in response to public outcry over the treatment of orcas at SeaWorld after the release of the 'Blackfish' documentary . As a result of the sometimes harsh ‘Blackfish’ … and the resulting publicity battle SeaWorld has had to fight, Pixar decided to restructure that part of the story so that the fish and mammals taken to its aquatic center have the option to leave,’ the New York Times reported. Though it’s not uncommon for movie scripts to change prior to the final cut, it is uncommon for plot changes to be made public before the premiere. The notoriously secretive Pixar is known to keep quiet about films until they are ready for release, according to the Times, which noted that this reported change is the only known part of the story line. ‘Blackfish’ has caused a raft of problems for SeaWorld since its release earlier this year. The documentary tells the tale of Tilikum, the orca who caused the 2010 death of trainer Dawn Brancheau, according to NBC News. The film then delves into how SeaWorld treats its stable of orcas, also known as killer whales, portraying the park as exploiting the giant orcas. Gabriela Cowperthwaite, the film’s director didn’t expect it to have as big an impact. ‘I don't have one end goal for this film,’ Cowperthwaite told NBC News ""I didn't want the film to ever feel like it was telling you what to do or how to feel... if you were moved by it, that feeling is yours.’ Blackfish: Killer Whales swim in a tank at Seaworld in San Diego, California . The beleaguered marine park lashed out at the film Friday in a written statement. ‘Blackfish is billed as a documentary, but instead of a fair and balanced treatment of a complex subject, the film is inaccurate and misleading and, regrettably, exploits a tragedy that remains a source of deep pain for Dawn Brancheau's family, friends and colleagues,’ the statement said. ‘To promote its bias that killer whales should not be maintained in a zoological setting, the film paints a distorted picture that withholds from viewers key facts… that SeaWorld rescues, rehabilitates and returns to the wild hundreds of wild animals every year, and that SeaWorld commits millions of dollars annually to conservation and scientific research,’ the statement continued. The rebuttal was the latest in a back and forth between the filmmaker and SeaWorld, which has even seen the theme park chain release a series of objections to the film that were then posted to the documentary's website and addressed on an individual basis. Despite the bickering, Pixar has green-lit the script change. The film is due out in 2015.","The sequel originally included a marine park similar to SeaWorld .

It is understood a man had the snake wrapped around his neck as he got into the cab, but the driver said he wasn't allowed in with it. The passenger then threw the snake into a hedge and now police and firefighters are hunting for the boa in Portsmouth, Hants. The whereabouts of the snake has sparked fear in the city as it comes just days after two children were killed by a python in Canada. Connor, six, and Noah Barthe, four, were sleeping over in the flat where their friend lived above a pet shop. The 14ft python escaped from the shop and strangled the boys to death.

'The RSPCA and Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service also went to the scene. 'A thermal imaging camera was used to try to find the snake.' Elizabeth Oakshott lives on the street in Milton, Portsmouth, where the snake was last seen on Thursday. The 75-year-old said: 'My neighbour has three dogs and they kept going to the bush around the side of the garden, but when someone came out to check it, they found nothing. 'The police went all along the hedge with a stick and pulled some of the branches back.' Steve McGovern, who works for The Landscape Group, which maintains grounds around nearby student halls, said a man is understood to have thrown the snake. He said: 'We were told a man got picked up by a taxi and he had a snake wrapped around his neck. Hunt: The snake was last seen on this street in Portsmouth on Thursday . 'The taxi driver said ""there's no way you're getting in here with that"" so he threw it in the hedge so he could still get in the taxi. 'It then drove him to wherever he was going - I don't know what to make of it.' Security staff at the student accommodation have seen the funny side of things and have already nicknamed the animal Bernard the Boa. The large snake is a member of the family Boidae, typically found in North, Central and South America. It usually feeds on a wide variety of small to medium sized mammals and birds and can reach lengths of around 14ft.","It is believed the man had the snake wrapped around his neck when he tried to get into the cab .

The skies are expected to shimmer with a 'natural firework display' tonight as a meteor shower crosses into the earth’s atmosphere, astronomy experts have predicted. Although the Perseids meteor shower is an annual event, the Royal Astronomical Society believes prospects for this year’s showing are particularly good and could mean up to 60 shooting stars an hour in the UK. The best display will last from late Monday evening through to early Tuesday morning. Wish upon a star: If you're lucky bright meteors like this one seen during the 2009 Perseids shower will shoot through the sky leaving visible trails . Spectacular: The annual meteor shower is a result of material falling from the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle . Stars gazers will need only their own eyes to enjoy the natural occurrence, which is a result of material falling from the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle, which last passed near the Earth in 1992. 'Comet Swift-Tuttle won’t be visiting our neck of the woods again until the year 2125, but every year we get this beautiful reminder as the Earth ploughs through the debris it leaves in its orbit' said Professor Alan Fitzsimmons of Queen’s University Belfast. 'Every meteor is a speck of comet dust vaporising as it enters our atmosphere at 36 miles per second. What a glorious way to go.' Meteors, commonly known as shooting stars, are the result of small particles entering the Earth’s atmosphere at high speed. Prime time: This Monday night and the early hours of Tuesday morning are the peak times to spot a meteor, as the shower crosses into the earth's atmosphere . These heat the air around them, causing the characteristic streak of light seen from the ground. They mostly appear as fleeting flashes lasting less than a second, but the brightest ones leave behind trails of vaporised gases and glowing air molecules that may take a few seconds to fade. The Perseids meteor shower is active each year from around mid-July to late-August, but for most of that period only a few meteors an hour will be visible.","Best time to see the Perseids meteor shower is from Monday night to early Tuesday morning .

After two years of bad weather blighting the annual event, the recent hot weather means the Glorious Twelfth will truly live up to its name this year. In Scotland, the grouse-shooting season could be one of the best for many years because of the recent warmth and sunshine, moorland managers have said. The red grouse season gets under way with the Glorious Twelfth today, and the better weather this year than in the past few years means that grouse breeding in England has been more successful, the Moorland Association said. Excitement: As the red grouse season starts today, known as the Glorious Twelfth, experts are predicting the best for years . Fetch: A Labrador retrieving a grouse in the Yorkshire dales . Obedient: The well-trained dog hands over the dead bird to his owner on a successful hunting trip . Cold, wet conditions which were widespread last year in the washout summer meant grouse chicks got chilled and died, while the insects they rely on for food in their early days were in short supply. But the weather has had some negative impacts again this year, with swathes of heather in places such as the North York Moors killed off by icy winds in March, leaving nothing for the grouse to eat and leading to lower numbers. Some moorland managers have delayed the start of their shoots because the cold, late spring meant the birds have developed later. Shooting could carry on later into the year as a result of the late start. Moorland Association chairman Robert Benson said pre-season counts of grouse in England had been delayed by the heatwave, and results were now coming in that showed problems in some areas. But he said: 'Generally, at long last, for the first time in the last few years, we've had a reasonable nesting and hatching period, with good chick survival. 'In odd places, for various reasons, it's not going to be quite as good as they thought.' Clear day: Better weather this year than in the past few years means that grouse breeding in England has been more successful . Beautiful scenery: Bright purple heather in the Yorkshire dales surrounding a shooting butt . A good grouse season is 'massively important from an economic point of view' to the uplands, Mr Benson said. The Moorland Association estimates the £67 million English industry helps employ around 1,500 people. Robert Rattray, of rural property and sporting let agents CKD Galbraith, said Scotland's prospects looked good. 'Although Scotland endured a cold and long winter, in recent weeks this has made way for sunshine and almost unprecedented warm weather. 'Careful assessment of grouse stocks is revealing potential for one of the best seasons for many years, with some unusually large broods being seen. Energetic: A hunting party setting off to walk the hills in the warm weather . 'Grouse shooting on average generates around £30 million for the Scottish economy but I would imagine figures this year will be much higher, with all the knock on benefits of seasonal employment in local communities.' Mr Benson said people came to shoot red grouse from around the world, providing direct employment and knock-on benefits for hotels, restaurants, B&Bs and shops in upland areas where otherwise little would be going on except sheep farming. In England, he said: 'Shooting creates 42,500 days of work a year. With the prospects of a better season ahead, associated spin-offs will be in excess of £15 million, essential earnings in these challenging economic times.' One man and his dog: A hunter in traditional country clothing walking the moorland with his faithful companion . He also said there were benefits to wildlife of moorland management, for example control of predators such as foxes and crows, which maintained conditions suitable for moorland nesting birds including lapwings and curlews. But figures released in the past few days showed that no hen harriers managed to successfully nest in England, pushing the bird of prey to the brink of extinction in the country. Hen harriers benefit from the control of predators such as foxes, which feed on the birds of prey as well as grouse, but they also prey on red grouse, bringing them into conflict with moorland managers and making them the target of illegal persecution. Mr Benson said the breeding situation in England for hen harriers was 'very sad', and that the Moorland Association was working hard with moor owners and keepers to convince them that measures can be put in place to deal with the problem. Traditional pursuit: Beaters crossing the moors to drive up the birds in the centuries-old passtime . He said there was a need for organisations to work together to promote measures such as diversionary feeding of hen harriers which are rearing their chicks to reduce the amount of young grouse which are taken and killed by the birds of prey. Joe Duckworth, chief executive of animal welfare charity the League Against Cruel Sports, said: 'The shooting industry claims that they 'protect' the moorlands, creating a haven for wildlife. What a joke. 'The grouse shooting season does nothing more than annihilate and harm wildlife.","The red grouse season gets under way with the Glorious Twelfth today .

Tragedy: Lucy Woolley, 16, died after falling from her eventing horse after it was startled by a tractor . A girl of 16 with a passion for riding was killed when a tractor startled her horse and she was thrown off. Lucinda Woolley, who had taken part in national eventing competitions, had gone out on her horse Alfie, a recent gift from her parents. Her mother Julia, 48, rushed to find her daughter when the horse returned to their £875,000 country home without her. Lucinda was airlifted to hospital with head injuries and died the next day. Mrs Woolley said that she and her husband Peter, 52, had been reluctant to give the teenager Alfie, who was a professional eventing horse, but riding was ‘what she lived for’. The grieving mother, who runs a media management and financial consultancy business with her husband in Chattisham, near Ipswich, said: ‘Alfie got spooked by the vehicle – it was a fluke.

Autumn is set to be late this year, but when it arrives it should bring a bumper crop of fruits and berries in the countryside, wildlife experts have said. The autumn fruiting is expected to be delayed as a result of the late spring, but the recent warm weather means wild berry crops will flourish, according to early data collected by the public for the Woodland Trust’s nature’s calendar project. The promise of a bumper autumn is good news for wildlife, which suffered in the face of exceptionally poor crops of wild fruit last year when trees and shrubs were affected by the washout summer, and then were hit by this spring’s cold snap. Great expectations: Woodland Trust research shows that records for 16 species of trees and shrubs show that 14 of them, including beech (pictured) had their worst season for fruiting in the past decade, last year . Records for 16 species of trees and shrubs collected since 2001 show that 14 including beech, holly and brambles or blackberries last year saw their worst season for fruiting since the turn of the century, with many recording only meagre crops. Dr Kate Lewthwaite, the nature’s calendar project manager, said: 'Although our records suggest that autumn fruiting will be late this year due to the delayed onset of spring flowering, if the warm weather interspersed with occasional wet spells continues, this should mean the fruiting of shrubs like bramble, rowan and blackthorn is abundant. 'Wildlife species will no doubt benefit from a bumper crop, and finally fruit-eating birds and mammals will be able to enjoy an autumn feast. Bountiful: A bumper crop of blackberries and holly berries are expected this Autumn . Last year, birds and mammals suffered some of the poorest fruiting crop in years and this, coupled with the prolonged cold snap in spring, meant that many species had to endure a long period without a decent food supply.' She urged members of the public to take part in the nature’s calendar scheme to record the changing of the seasons, which helps experts understand how wildlife is adapting to the changing environment. The number of citizen recorders has been falling year on year, and the Woodland Trust wants more people to sign up to contribute to the project which has records dating back to the 17th century.","Autumn fruiting will be delayed this year because of the late spring .

Ed Miliband came under renewed attack from his  own party yesterday after a second leading MP openly criticised his lack of policies and direction. Graham Stringer, a high-profile backbencher and former government whip, said he was worried about the ‘deafening silence’ of the Labour leader and his shadow cabinet over the summer. He said their failure to set the agenda or attack the Government was a ‘huge missed opportunity’, which he put down to their ‘lack of coherent policies’ in key areas such as welfare. Criticised: Labour leader Ed Miliband, right, has been blasted by backbencher Graham Stringer . Mr Stringer said the ‘real worry’ for Labour was not a leadership challenge, but the inactivity of Mr Miliband’s top team over the past few weeks – traditionally a time for the opposition to criticise the Government’s record while ministers are on holiday. In a broadside against his leader, he said: ‘A huge opportunity is being missed. The second worry is that I don’t believe members of the shadow cabinet are being lazy – I think it is stemming from a lack of coherence and cogency of our policies. ‘It’s not quite clear what our policies on welfare are, what our policies on housing are, what our policies on education are. ‘Although I don’t expect Ed Miliband and the shadow cabinet to write out precisely what is going to be in our manifesto in 20 months, I do expect the public should be told, and the party should be able to support, clear and coherent policies.’ Return? There have been calls to bring Peter Mandelson back into the fold for Labour . He added that there were ‘serious concerns’ among MPs about the ‘lack of activity in the shadow cabinet’, and suggested deep divisions about the party’s direction, saying the impression that it was united was a ‘mirage’. His criticism follows a warning at the weekend from shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, who said Labour faced defeat at the next election if the party did not come up with a vision for the economy within a few months. He said voters were ‘not convinced we have the answers’.  One frontbencher said yesterday Labour was ‘leaping into traps’ set by the Tories over welfare, the economy and immigration.Labour have been without an election strategist for weeks after Tom Watson resigned in the furore over union influence. While Mr Miliband has yet to name a replacement, the Tories have the services of Boris Johnson’s ex-campaign manager Lynton Crosby and have snapped up Jim Messina, who ran Barack Obama’s last victory. A poll yesterday put Labour on 36 per cent, the Tories on 29 per cent, UKIP on 17 per cent, and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Speaking on Radio 4 yesterday, Mr Stringer said the party should consider bringing back veteran spin doctor Peter Mandelson to firm up their message. He added: ‘Labour needs to get the best person. When Peter Mandelson held that position the party was more coherent in getting its message across.’ Mr Miliband is said to be planning a frontbench reshuffle in September to create a more dynamic top team.","Graham Stringer is unclear on the direction Labour is taking under Miliband .

Former Labour minister Denis MacShane has had his court case for fiddling his expenses delayed until after his summer holiday, it emerged today. Magistrates said they were 'mystified' by the decision to put off the case until after he returns from his pre-booked break on September 4. The former Europe Minister has been charged with false accounting after prosecutors said there was enough evidence to bring a case over suspicious claims worth £12,900. Former Labour MP Denis MacShane has been charged with false accounting over parliamentary expenses claims . The 65-year-old was given permission not to appear in court today to face a charge of false accounting over his expenses claims. His lawyers told Westminster Magistrates' Court they needed more time to make progress with his case. But Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said he was 'a little mystified' that yesterday another district judge had granted permission for the former Rotherham MP not to appear, but adjourned the case until September 10. He said: 'There must be a large amount of paperwork that the solicitors need to go through. I'm a little mystified that the decision has been made and I can't look behind that decision.' MacShane is accused of false accounting over alleged fraudulent claims of £12,900 for research and translation services. Prosecutors announced earlier this month that he would face one count of false accounting following claims that he had faked receipts. Today the court was told that he has a . pre-booked holiday from late-August until September 4, and that his . legal team had asked for the case to be adjourned until after that date.

MacShane quit the Commons last year, after 18 years as MP for Rotherham. Prosecutors accuse the former outspoken MP of fraudulently charging taxpayers for research and translation services. Announcing the decision to press charges earlier this month, Malcolm McHaffie, of . the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘This charge . relates to fraudulent claims with a total value of £12,900. The charge . is of false accounting, contrary to the Theft Act 1968. ‘It is alleged that Denis MacShane claimed expenses for research and . translation services carried out by a company that did not carry out . that work.

German security firm Protecus has found a setting in the fifth beta release of Apple's iOS 7 software called Feature Locations that tracks a user's GPS coordinates over time and plots them on a map. This news comes after code was discovered in Google's Android 4.3 software that lets devices scan for nearby networks, in order to determine a person's location, even when Wi-Fi is turned off. German security firm Protecus has found a setting in the fifth beta release of Apple's iOS 7 software called Feature Locations that tracks a user's GPS coordinates over time and plots them on a map, pictured . It is unclear if the Frequent Location feature is turned on by default but it can be disabled . The Apple feature is relatively hidden away on the iOS 7 software - due to be released in October - in Settings, Privacy, Location Services, System Services and Frequent Locations. It is unclear whether the feature is turned on by default but according to the Protecus security expert: '[The feature] kept track of my complete movement profile (location and time tracking) without me knowing anything.' He does continue, however, that the feature can be disabled. Frequent Locations is part of a wider Apple feature called Improve Maps set up to make the device's built-in mapping technology more accurate. Apps such as Foursquare track locations in a similar way, but only when a user actively checks-in. The maps created using Frequent Location can be used by people to see where they have been and the locations they visit most often. Apple's disclaimer about the feature says: 'If . you choose to enable Improve Maps, Apple will collect the GPS . coordinates obtained through the Frequent Locations feature on your . device and correlate them with the street address associated with your .

Earlier this week, reports emerged that Google's latest Android phone . operating system includes a feature that will scan for networks and . track user's locations even when Wi-Fi has been turned off. The . code used to build Android 4.3 claims that 'to improve location . accuracy and for other purposes, Google and other apps may scan for . nearby networks even when Wi-Fi is off.' A string of code discovered in the latest beta release of Apple's iOS 7 software implies that either the iPhone 5S or iPhone 6 could come with a fingerprint scanner. The code describes a user touching the Home button with their thumb. A fingerprint then appears on the screen, that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the 'recognition is complete'. A folder called Biometric Kit was also found. The iPhone 5S could additionally have a slow-motion camera. More code discovered in iOS 7 suggests phones running the software will be able to record video at a rate of 120 frames-per-second (FPS) rather than around 30 frames per second.This is fast enough to allow iPhone users to create slow-motion films. The iOS 7 software also lets users swipe between menus, select apps and control the device's screen using just head movements. When the Switch Control feature is enabled, it will scroll through and highlight different onscreen sections - including individual menus and apps. When the required section is highlighted, users can move their head to the left to select it. Other new features include Night Mode in Maps that responds to ambient light when you use it in the dark. FaceTime audio can be used to make high-quality calls over a data network and Notification Sync lets you dismiss a notification so that it is dismissed on all of your devices. By identifying nearby Wi-Fi networks a device can determine a user's location and it can be used as an alternative to GPS. Google's feature is turned off by default and can be enabled, or disabled, in Settings. Apple's new iOS 7 software was unveiled in June. It has a ‘flat . design’, but critics say the dramatic new look could backfire, confusing . users - while others claim it simply looks like Google’s rival Android . system. It will be available for users to download from October but beta versions of the software are being rolled out to developers. Developers can use the software to build apps in preparation for when the operating system it officially released as well as test it for bugs. A folder called Biometric Kit, pictured, was also found and the feature could be for security reasons to unlock the phone, or to authorise payments in the App Store and prevent people from stealing your phone, reading your messages or obtaining personal data .","Apple's iOS 7 software includes a feature that collects GPS coordinates .

Germans are the most forward-thinking people on the planet, overtaking Britons who fell to fourth place, according to researchers. The scientists, based in the UK, Switzerland and the US, correlated data from Google searches and national economic performance. They looked at the 'mammoth amounts of data' generated by our internet use, and discovered that there are 'strong links between changes in the information users are seeking online and events in the real world'. Which nation has the most forward-looking citizens? Researchers linked economic performance to optimism about the future and found that Germany led the way, with Britain dropping to fourth place . They analysed some 45 billion Google search queries and found 'a striking correlation' between the per capita GDP of a nation and the inclination of people to look to the future. Dr Suzy Moat, co-author of the report, says the findings could reflect international differences in the type of information that people search for . Lead researcher Professor Tobias Preis of Warwick Business School said: 'In general, we find a strong tendency for countries in which Google users enquire more about the future to exhibit a larger per capita GDP.

This year Britain has dropped down to fourth place, swapping places with the Germans as they romp into the lead. The league table: Germany leads the way, while Pakistan and Vietnam languish at the bottom for the second year running . Google has been accused of racism after allegedly linking names usually associated with black people to adverts related to criminality. A Harvard University professor found 'significant discrimination' after comparing the adverts which appear when searching a typically black name compared with those for typically white names. Findings showed that names typically associated with black people were 25 per cent more likely to bring up adverts related to criminality. Findings showed that names typically associated with black people were 25 per cent more likely to bring up adverts related to criminality. The findings raise 'questions as to whether Google's advertising technology exposes racial bias in society and how ad and search technology can develop to assure racial fairness,' Professor Sweeney said in a blog post. Google defends the process as race-neutral, saying outcomes are driven by decisions by advertisers. That could be because the Germans are focused on their federal elections later this year. The biggest climbers on the Future Orientation Index are Nigeria and Japan. However, right down the bottom of the list for the second year running is Pakistan, with Vietnam again in the penultimate slot. To create the league table, the team counted the number of searches done about previous and forthcoming years - for example, searches done in 2009 on 2008 or 2010. Then they divided the results by country and mapped them against each country's per capita GDP - the measure of a country's economic output divided by the number of people who live there. Co-author Dr Suzy Moat added: 'We see two leading explanations for this relationship between search activity and GDP. 'Firstly, these findings may reflect international differences in attention to the future and the past, where a focus on the future supports economic success. 'Secondly, these findings may reflect international differences in the type of information sought online, perhaps due to economic influences on available Internet infrastructure.'

An anonymous donor has given $150,000 to a campaign aiming to stop a gold ring once owned by beloved novelist Jane Austen from being taken out of the UK by American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson. Jane Austen's House Museum began the campaign to raise the cost of the ring to keep the piece in the country. As a self-proclaimed ‘history nerd’, pop star Clarkson was happy to pay more than £150,000, or US$232,000, for the ring that once belonged to Jane Austen. Precious: The ring is one of only three surviving pieces of jewellery known to have belonged to Jane Austen . National treasure: Musician Kelly Clarkson, pictured at the Annual Academy of Country Music Awards in Las Vegas earlier this year, has been told she can't take the ring out of the UK . But the 31-year-old singer was told she could not take the item out of Britain and back to her native Texas because it is a ‘national treasure’. Clarkson, the first winner of talent show American Idol, saw off seven bidders in an auction at Sotheby’s last year for the gold and turquoise ring. Still in its original box, it was sold for $235,596 despite being expected to fetch only $46,362. But when Clarkson applied for an export license, a reviewing committee recommended that the ring should be kept in the UK. Culture Secretary Ed Vaizey has placed a temporary export bar on the item in the hope a UK buyer can be found to purchase it. He said: ‘Jane Austen’s modest lifestyle and her early death mean that objects associated with her of any kind are extremely rare, so I hope this simple but elegant ring can be saved for the nation.’ If no British bidder comes forward the Government will not be able to refuse an export license. Clarkson has indicated she will be willing to sell the piece of jewellery if an offer matching hers is made. The campaign to keep the ring in the UK was only begun on Friday, but with the help of the anonymous donor has already raised $160,000. The museum was able to make a 'serious expression' of its intention to buy the ring, and was able to gain an extension on the ban until 30 December, according to the Guardian. 'We have very few of Austen's effects, so the ring is very unusual. It has very good provenance, there's a note from 1863 handwritten by Eleanor Jackson, second wife of Jane's brother Henry Austen. 'Henry was the one to negotiate the deals with Austen's publishers and so was a significant character in her life – and a bit of a Wickham. The note is giving it to a niece, saying this was given to me by Cassandra (Jane's sister) when she knew I was marrying Henry and it belonged to aunt Jane,' Louise West, Jane Austen's House Museum manager told the Guardian. Jane's house: This house in Chawton, Hampshire, is where Jane Austen spent the last eight years of her life, and now houses the Jane Austen's House museum . If the museum manages to buy back the ring, Clarkson will be invited to visit the piece as often as she'd like. 'We can only speak to Clarkson's ""people"", so we don't know if she even knows she's been invited to visit,' said West. 'We were very excited that someone like Kelly Clarkson was a fan of Jane Austen - it's not what you'd expect from a young, cool US pop singer. It says a lot about Austen's popularity and who she's popular with. It's not just middle-aged women.' Miss Clarkson encountered a similar problem when she bought a first edition of Jane Austen’s novel Persuasion, saying last year: ‘We put in an export request but I can’t take it out of the UK as they’ve named it a national treasure.’ Beloved author and national treasure: The tomb of Jane Austen at Winchester Cathedral . The ring is one of three surviving pieces of jewellery known to have belonged to the Pride and Prejudice author . If the museum is successful in raising the remaining cash to buy back the ring, it will be displayed next year as part of the bicentenary of Mansfield Park's publication. In Mansfield Park, the protagonist Fanny Price is given an amber cross by her brother - inspiration for which seems to have come from Austen's own life. A cross gifted to Austen by her brother is now in the museum's collection. 'To have the cross and ring together is very exciting,' West told the Guardian. The museum had attempted to purchase the ring at auction, but the piece went so far above its expected price that the museum was unable to compete. 'The Heritage Lottery Fund would have helped us, but Sotheby's had generated a lot of interest and we were unable to raise the cash at such short notice,' said West.","Kelly Clarkson bought the ring for five times the estimated price .

"All 364 guests wore costumes created by Lord of the Rings designer Ngila Dickson . They entered through a 20-foot-high gate, with the couple's initials intertwined in wrought iron . Parker's ring was temporarily lost amidst white rose petals . By . Amelia Proud . PUBLISHED: . 14:51 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:19 EST, 2 August 2013 . It was undoubtedly the wedding of the . year; whether or not you found it tasteless or a breathtaking evocation . of fairytale dreams. Now . new details have emerged that reveal the epic scale of billionaire internet entrepreneur Sean Parker's . Lord of the Rings themed wedding to Alexandra Lenas, 24, in California's Big . Sur this June. Multimillion dollar extravaganza: Internet billionaire Sean Parker exchanged vows with singer-songwriter Alexandra Lenas in Big Sur in June and new pictures and details have been revealed in Vanity Fair . Perhaps . the most corny revelation is that the 33-year-old Napster founder, who . was portrayed by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network, serenaded his . bride Alexandra Lenas with the song Part Of Your World from Disney's The . Little Mermaid. Considered a . sharp shooting Silicon Valley wise guy, mostly because of Timberlake's . too-cool-for-school performance in the 2010 movie, it will probably . surprise most people to hear that Parker knew all the words to the . cartoon classic. According . to Vanity Fair's David Fitzpatrick, the happy groom earnestly looked . into his new wife's eyes as he reeled out lines like: 'Look at this . trove, treasures untold / How many wonders can one cavern hold?' 'Corny': Parker serenaded his bride with the song Part of Your World from Disney's The Little Mermaid for their first dance . Fitzpatrick described the moment as 'endearing, corny, and over-the-top,' but it . was all part of what Parker described as their 'performance art . project.' Vanity Fair reveal many other incredible details, including how there were so many white rose petals on the ground that Parker's ring was temporarily lost when his nervous bride dropped it; her father had to lend his own for the ceremony. Parker, . who still disputes that the wedding cost $10 million, did concede that . preparing the Redwoods site alone came to $4.5 million. He . oversaw the whole shebang, from the tiniest detail to the gargantuan set dressing; and even created a . leather-bound keepsake volume for all those attending - which tells the 'fairytale' of the . couple’s romance. Its design was intended - rather incongruously -  to echo the invitation to . the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, showing how grandiose Parker intended the event to be. 'Performance art': Parker, here with Alexandra while she was expecting daughter Summer, saw the nuptials as an immersive experience . But it was just one of hundreds of opulent and elaborate touches that made June 1st a very special day in this forest near the Pacific Ocean. Fitzpatrick wrote: 'People literally gasped as [Parker and Lenas] emerged into a . glade in which planted flowers and hanging garlands conferred a riot of . color and a sense of undulation. 'The . newlyweds dined on salmon with beets and Napa cabbage (entrée choices: . porchetta, chicken, or venison) while perched upon a 10-foot . sofa-throne, their feet nestled in a bearskin rug.' And . they really did think of everything, as the Vanity Fair writer noted . that there was: 'A pen of bunnies was nearby for anyone who needed a . cuddle.' All 364 guests were dressed in outfits made by Lord of the Rings designer Ngila Dickson so nobody felt left out of Parker's all encompassing theme. Set design: Parker commissioned an artificial pond and stone bridge, pictured . Settlement: Parker agreed a $2.5 million settlement . towards coastal development works after the construction, pictured . Fantasy line: The setting was beautiful, but Parker had many more of his own touches to add . They included included Trudie Styler and Sting, Twitter creator Jack Dorsey who tried and failed to get Sting . to sign up to the social networking site, Cory Booker, Allison Williams, Kyle MacLachlan Olivia Munn, Emma Watson, . Sean Lennon and Charlotte Kemp Muhl. Sting, 61, even broke into an a cappella version of his song, I Was Brought to my Senses for the tickled bride and groom at one point. San Francisco designer Ken Fulk was put in charge of the setting’s visual elements, which were none too subtle in scope. You have to wonder what became of the '20-foot-high gate, with the couple’s initials . intertwined in wrought iron' that greeted guests before they 'descended onto a path lined with . imported evergreens.' Forest: The wedding took place in Big Sur, near the upscale Ventana Inn and Spa where guests stayed . San Francisco designer Ken Fulk was put in charge of the setting’s visual elements, which were none too subtle in scope. 'God's cathedral"": Set designers had constructed faux bridges, a ruined stone castle, a 10-foot Celtic cross, and two broken Roman columns that straddled the altar, beneath the largest tree in the grove . 'Set . designers had constructed faux bridges, a ruined stone castle, a 10-foot . Celtic cross, and two broken Roman columns that straddled the altar, . beneath the largest tree in the grove.' Last . month, Parker wrote a 10,000-word piece in TechCrunch about how he and . his new wife were on the receiving end of criticism 'normally reserved . for genocidal dictators'. Parker wrote in an email to The Atlantic: 'Everything we did was an homage to nature, to the natural redwood environment which I call ""God's cathedral"".' Mythical setting: The Big Sur area was ripe for turning into a fantasy land, but Parker paid for it . Princess Bride: Singer-songwriter Alexandra, 24, was swathed in acres of satin by Elie Saab . Parker paints a picture of a young couple, eager to exchange their vows. 'My wife Alexandria and I met five . years ago, fell in love, and almost immediately began fantasizing about . our wedding day, which, we both agreed, should take place deep within an . enchanged forest.' However, Parker goes into colorful . detail about the backlash he and his wife received the morning after . they became husband and wife. 'Descriptions of me included the words 'douchebag' and 'pr**k,' of my wife, the words 'gold-digger' and 'whore,' wrote Parker. 'Luckily amongst the rabble were some . unusually creative hate-mongers who managed to keep our attention by . dispensing inventive insults like 'douchemonster,' 'jackassery,' 'jackwagon' and, my personal favorite, 'douche canoe.' What else but big? The couple's wedding cake was nine feet tall . Parker goes into a tremendous amount of detail explaining how he and his wife-to-be went out of their way to protect the redwood forest that they had decided to marry in. 'We wanted our wedding to begin with 'Once upon a time' and end with' and they lived happily ever after' says Parker. However, he laments that 'life rarely works out the way it does in fairy tales, as much as we hoped it would.' This was despite decking out the woods at Big Sure with faux bridges, which Parker wanted to be like 'Lothlorien, the mythical home of Galadriel in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings'. Keen: Billionaire Sean Parker, right, said he was eager to exchange vows with Alexandra Lenas, left . Raging at the unexpected backlash, Parker says that it must be obvious he never intended any adverse ecological impact on the redwood forest. In fact, he claims to have gone out of his way to reduce the environmental impact of the large wedding, which was in stark contrast to Facebook founder and one-time colleague Mark Zuckerberg - who married at his home in Palo Alto, California. 'Because we wanted to avoid any harm to the forest, we asked the Save the Redwoods League to send their Director of Science, Emily Burns, down to the site to advise our landscape architect on 'best practices' for working within the forest,' wrote Parker in Techcrunch. Indeed, Parker points out that 'nobody chooses to get married in a redwood forest unless they love redwood forests.' Going into deeper levels of detail, Parker explains that the site of his fan-boy wedding was already damaged by 'a century of logging'. But the wedding also gained extra controversy after Parker has been slapped with a $2.5 million penalty after he failed to get the proper permits for his 'Game of Thrones' style Big Sur marriage ceremony. The California Coastal Commission and Parker said they have reached a settlement to pay for coastal conservation programs after the Napster co-founder built a large movie-set like wedding site in an ecologically sensitive area of Big Sur. Officials were tipped off about Parker's lavish $10 million wedding, which saw him build a cottage, fake ruins, waterfalls, staircases and a huge dance floor near iconic redwoods and a stream with threatened steelhead trout, when neighbors complained. The complaints prompted a county investigation into the construction at a closed campground owned by Ventana Inn & Spa. The Ventana is negotiating a separate settlement for allowing the construction to occur. The Ventana is located within the coastal zone, an area regulated by the commission, an independent state agency that oversees coastal development. Any significant construction within the zone has to be permitted.","All 364 guests wore costumes created by Lord of the Rings designer Ngila Dickson .

"By . Deni Kirkova . PUBLISHED: . 05:48 EST, 28 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:00 EST, 30 July 2013 . Terai Arc landscape community mobiliser Maya Yogi pictured in the Khata Corridor within the Terai Arc . 'Conservation is not just a man's thing. Women should have an equal role to play,' says Maya Yogi, who works with the Nepali government to encourage more women to get involved with tiger protection. I'm speaking to the landscape community mobiliser for WWF during a trip to Nepal where I witness the charity's staff grapple with the biggest wildlife crisis the country has ever faced. Tiger numbers have dropped by 97 per cent in the last 100 years and the species faces total extinction within a generation if things do not improve. Maya's mission to protect tigers in the Terai Arc region is in its 12th year. Through her work with the Khata Community Forest coordination committee, where she leads anti-poaching, reforestation and education projects, Maya is not only helping to protect Nepal's tigers but also giving the country's women real work and a purpose. But despite her years on the job, Maya has seen a tiger only twice. 'When I saw a tiger for the first time, it didn't strike my mind. I did not know how to react. 'It was only later, when I spoke with the two people I was with that they told me the creature was a tiger. 'It crossed my path. It was pretty big, and if I had known it was a tiger I might have been scared. 'Before I had seen a tiger there was . this talk in the village, a common thought that only a few lucky people . actually get to see one in real life. 'When I realised I has seen one, I felt like one of the chosen few. That in itself is motivation for me.' Tigers really are very rare now. On my visit to Nepal, when they used to roam in abundance, I didn't see one in the flesh, despite all our efforts, although the film crew managed to find one drinking from a lake the day after we left. The sheer scale of tiger slaughter is . reflected in the fact that just a century ago, 100,000 tigers roamed the wild lands of Nepal. On a visit in 1911, the famously trigger-happy King George V was able to leave with a staggering 39 trophies after a hunting trip. A century later, that equates to a third of the country's entire . tiger population. Scroll down for video . Just one tiger was caught on camera during our three day trip to the Terai Arc, showing their utter rarity . The majestic, solitary tiger seen on our trip bathed indulgently in a lake as photographer Adrian captured him . One of only 37 present in Bardia National Park, the endangered beast looks intensely into the lens . Today, the . majority of tigers are killed using traps, that immobilise the animal - . allowing the poacher space to shove a sharp wooden spear through the . tiger's mouth to kill it - keeping the hugely valuable fur intact in the . process. WWF anti-poaching patrols look out for tiger traps. When they find them, they dismantle them and dispose of them. Maya herself has been involved in the capture of six tiger poachers between 2004 and 2005, although she goes on patrol less today than she used to. She . lives and works in the Gauri forest in the Khata Corridor which bridges . Nepal's Royal Bardia National Park with India's Katarniaghat Wildlife . Sanctuary. This is a . crucial focus area for WWF but it is also an optimum spot for poacher activity . as they make their way through Nepal from the country of supply to the . one of demand. WWF staff patrol the Tera Arc on elephant, foot, bicycle, car, boat and UAV piloting.  As well as supplying patrol volunteers, they monitor tiger activity with motion-activated camera traps set up on trees. The photos are used to help confirm population . numbers, as well as contribute to research on tiger behaviour . and ecology that forms the basis for planning for their conservation. And . it is working. Poaching is decreasing and WWF are confident that with . support from communities, government, organisations and the public they . can double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022. In the Gaudi forest in the Terai Arc with an anti-poaching patrol group of young Nepalese women . But the challenge the WWF and the Nepalese volunteers face is vast. While protecting the tigers, they're also faced with tackling an ingrained belief in tiger parts as medicine held by many Chinese and other Far Eastern people. In the markets of Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, every . part of the 40 stone body, from skin to bones, flesh and . organs are sold for thousands of dollars.. 'The Chinese still harbour bogus . beliefs about medicinal properties of a tiger's body parts,' reveals . Diwakar Chapagain, WWF's Nepal programme coordinator for wildlife trade . monitoring. A continued belief in the medicinal properties of animal parts is the driving force behind 95 per cent of illegal trade in wildlife, including tigers, elephants, rhinos and red pandas. Tiger bones are used for medicine, . tiger balm and soup, while an underground tiger vineyard which produces . wine infused with ground tiger bone produces thousands of bottles every . year for sale on the Chinese black market. The National Trust For Nature Conservation, a partner organisation of WWF, works in the Terai Arc area to promote biodiversity and conservation. There is currently one tiger to 63 Chittal deer - a potential meal for one of big endangered cats. But it takes a tiger, on average, 22 attempts to catch and kill a deer, so more needs to be done to reforest the area and up the ratio. The skin is still seen as a symbol of wealth while tiger flesh and organs are believed to cure ailments such as impotency. A bowl of soup made from tiger penis . fetches an eye-watering 3,000 Hong Kong dollars (approx. £250) by . promising to cure erectile dysfunction - and Diwakar tells me the demand . for this potion in particular is increasing. Despite the demand, the number of agencies, charities and governments ranged against the traffickers is increasing. The governments, Chinese as well as . Indian and Nepalese, all work together to curb illegal wildlife trade. The Chinese government, Diwakar tells me, is cooperating well. But it's not just poachers killing . tigers - it's local people who come into . conflict with them. Human-tiger conflict is a very real and present . danger for the species. When tigers do not have enough prey, they seek out domestic livestock. Many . local communities depend on these animals for their livelihood and in retaliation, tigers are often killed or captured and sent to a zoo, in . an effort to prevent similar events happening in the future. A local volunteer in the Khata Corridor, part of the community-based anti-poaching unit (CBAPU), within the Terai Arc region, walks away with a tiger trap found on patrol . Camera traps are being set up all over Bardia National Park to track and keep record of tiger count and mobility . Already struggling to tackle poaching, the WWF has had to divert precious resources to increasing prey numbers in an effort to reduce human-tiger conflict. Worse, many of the tigers killed by locals end up on the black market and in Chinese medicine - worsening the already devastating effect of poaching. Local communities living around tiger habitats also depend on forests for wood. But . by entering forests, they increase the likelihood of becoming victim to a tiger attack - which have increased in recent years. A recent study by Michigan State University on attitudes towards tigers around Chitwan National Park found natives are more . likely to feel positive about them if they live on the 'good' side of . town, whereas those who live in rural and isolated areas have more . negative attitudes. 'When . you feel that you can control your surroundings and influence the world . around you, then you tend to be more positive about what's in the . forest,' said Neil Carter of the Center for Systems Integration and . Sustainability who produced the report. Pradeep Khanal, field project officer with WWF Nepal reveals a tiger caught on the camera trap we set up . The WWF works on projects to help people stay away from the forest and avoid tiger conflict. These . include providing local communities with tolls such as stoves and . systems with which they can use domestic animal waste as fuel instead of . wood. There are also educational programmes in place to teach them about the value of tigers for tourism and the ecosystem. Of the work done with local people, particularly important are the education programmes that teach that tigers are prolific predators who top . of the food chain along with man. Tigers . attack and kill between eight and 10 people each year in Nepal, and . natives are understandably hostile. In Chitwan in 2005, a single tiger killed a . group of five people enjoying a picnic. This . is especially common if the tiger is a mother with cubs. If the mother feels threatened or the cubs are hungry, the human has a problem. It is widely thought that when a tiger . kills a person they get a taste for human blood - and so the people will hunt down the . killer tiger to protect themselves. WWF have programmes in place to help people stay away from the forest and avoid tiger conflict. They provide stoves and a system with which they can use domestic animal waste as fuel instead of wood . Tiger numbers are at a critical low and they need all the protection they can get . It is control and understanding of environment that WWF is trying to give back to the people so they can avoid conflict, and also teaching them to love and protect tigers. Creating harmony within human-wildlife relationships is key to sustainably conserving species such as the tiger. But it means that yet more resources that could be used to take on the poachers has to be diverted into other projects. By purchasing special packs of Whiskas you can help save a tiger . As a result, cat food brand Whiskas has partnered with the WWF and hopes to give a financial boost to those trying to protect tigers. They want consumers to understand . the link between their own cats and endangered tigers in the wild so . that collectively they can work together to help preserve this . endangered species. Little cat lovers can get involved by helping to raise funds for the protection of the world's big cats through the purchase of special packs of Whiskas. 'These funds will go towards supporting the tiger conservation programme within the Terai Arc region of Nepal where currently only 120 tigers survive within their natural habitat,' says Alison Clarke, a spokesperson for Whiskas.

"PUBLISHED: . 11:37 EST, 9 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:03 EST, 9 August 2013 . A retired couple spent their summer holiday travelling the length of England for free using just their bus passes. Michael and Jacqui Burden hopped from one local service to another as they meandered over 500 miles from their Devon home to Carlisle. The journey involved 28 buses, 15 different bus companies, took seven and a half days - and didn’t cost them a penny in fares. Striking out: Michael and Jacqui Burden packed their bags and headed out with their free bus passes . They had hoped to reach John O’Groats but settled for the far north of England when they found their free passes didn’t cover Scotland. The thrifty pair, both in their 60s, mapped out a route involving 28 different villages, towns and cities before setting off on July 29. Their route took them through the West Country and Bristol to Coventry and Leicester in the Midlands and then through Manchester and West Yorkshire to Carlisle in Cumbria. They also saved more money by staying with friends and relatives across the country and spent the remaining nights in bargain hotels and B&Bs. Mr Burden, a retired laboratory scientist, said: 'I was the damn fool who came up with the idea. 'I’ve only ever used buses occasionally but I just loved the idea of it. Clyst Honiton: The couple at the village sign marking the start of their epic journey . Route: The couple went from Exeter to Carlisle passing through dozens of scenic towns . 'My wife is a superb organiser so she looked into the accommodation and the routes. 'Then we finished our breakfast on the Monday morning, packed up our luggage and headed to the bus stop. 'We . could have planned a shorter route but we enjoyed meandering from place . to place - it was more of a quiet adventure than a military campaign. 'Most of the buses were on time and, overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. 'You see the sorts of places that you would normally miss when you’re shooting past in the car.' Free travel: The couple enjoyed getting off the beaten track using their free bus passes . Diversity: The couple used 15 different bus companies to get to Carlisle . The couple, from Clyst Honiton, just outside Exeter in Devon, saved a total of £120.85 per person on the fares. However, they spent virtually the nearly same amount travelling home on the train after buying first class tickets at £103 each. Mrs Burden, a music teacher, said: 'We only saved about £17 each but we felt we deserved a little indulgence on the way back. Regional variation: They particularly enjoyed listening to all the different accents, which they say they would not have heard had they taken their car . 'People have said, ""for goodness sake, why didn’t you take the car?"" 'We have two - a Skoda estate and a Peugeot 106 - but where’s the fun in that? 'We . had an amazing time, we met lots of different people and we really . enjoyed listening to the different dialects as people got on and off the . buses. 'We could have done it quicker but we took the scenic route. 'We even had time to stop off for an opera en route - we were hardly slumming it.'

Critical: David Sproul, CEO of Deloitte, says the government's attitude on tax is putting businesses off . Trying to force companies to pay their fair share of tax is damaging the economy – according to the boss of Deloitte, which makes millions by helping clients to avoid tax. David Sproul, the firm’s chief executive, said businesses were discouraged from moving to the UK by MPs’ mixed messages on tax. He called for politicians to stop ‘playing to the gallery’ on the issue. The comments follow a series of lively hearings of the Public Accounts Committee, which saw MPs savage companies such as Amazon and Google for aggressively avoiding tax by exploiting legal loopholes. Mr Sproul, who was paid £2.7million last year, highlighted corporation tax cuts. ‘On the one hand, you’ve got a government pursuing a tax strategy to make the UK one of the most competitive regimes,’ he said. ‘But then you’ve got a push by the PAC and by others to say, separate to that, “We want to make sure everyone’s paying their fair share of tax and we’ll determine what that fair share of tax is”.’ The Government has launched a consultation on the clampdown on tax avoidance, and firms who promote such schemes could be fined up to £1million. There will also be measures to loosen the market stranglehold of the ‘big four’ audit firms – Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and Ernst & Young. 'Mixed messages' : Mr Sproul says that companies are being encouraged to come to the UK with low corporation tax but then giants like Starbucks and Amazon are criticised for using legal tax loopholes . Deloitte yesterday revealed that its revenues have increased 8 per cent to £2.5billion. Dave Hartnett, the former HMRC boss who was criticised for cutting tax deals with big firms, recently joined the company as a consultant. Mr Sproul also defended Deloitte’s audit of Royal Bank of Scotland before its near-collapse, which was criticised for being too optimistic. ‘An audit is a review of financial statements. It isn’t an assessment of the business model,’ he said.","Deloitte CEO calls on MPs to stop 'playing to the gallery' on tax .

The controversial investigation, which shows no sign of letting up, was sparked by the torrent of victims who came forward as Jimmy Savile was exposed as the most notorious paedophile in British history. Another arrest: Police have arrested an 80-year-old man as part of the Operation Yewtree investigation into the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal . Police said the suspect, who was . arrested on suspicion of sexual offences, is linked to the disgraced TV . presenter and radio DJ. The man, who was not identified, was later released on bail until an unknown date in October. Controversial: Former newspaper tycoon Eddy Shah, cleared last month of raping a schoolgirl in the 1990s, has accused Operation Yewtree of becoming a 'witch hunt' The arrest by Scotland Yard officers . came as prosecutors began considering two files of evidence against DJ . Dave Lee Travis and comedian Jim Davidson. They are expected to decide within . weeks whether the two household names should face charges for sexual . offences. Senior lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service have also . advised detectives on their investigations into TV performer and artist . Rolf Harris, comedian Freddie Starr and singer Gary Glitter. In a separate development, former . Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning, the 13th man to be arrested, was re-bailed . until October. Not all those arrested by Operation Yewtree officers are . linked to Savile. All have denied wrongdoing. The latest arrest came despite signals . from Scotland Yard over recent months that the Yewtree inquiry was . entering its final stages. Senior officers have spent millions of . pounds investigating a host of allegations that span at least five . decades since opening the inquiry last October. They were left red-faced when one . officer who undertook searches  as part of the operation quit policing . and walked into the Big Brother house as a contestant. Thousands of pounds were spent on . overtime as officers were forced to watch the programme around the clock . to ensure he did not jeopardise the inquiry. Yesterday’s arrest prompted dozens of people to speculate on the identity of the suspect on Twitter and other chat websites. This was despite the huge libel awards handed to Tory peer Lord McAlpine when he was wrongly linked to sex abuse claims. Questioned: Rolf Harris was re-arrested and questioned 'over further allegations' last week after three women came forward in Australia . Last week, Harris was re-arrested on suspicion of new sexual offences when he answered bail. The veteran performer was questioned over ‘further allegations’ following complaints by three women in Australia.

Labour made a humiliating climbdown over immigration last night after its spokesman finally admitted opening the floodgates to Eastern European migrants was a mistake. Chris Bryant said it was wrong to ditch controls on Polish and other workers in 2004 – and claimed far more came to Britain ‘than anybody had anticipated’. The admission came in a speech dismissed as a ‘car crash’ before it was even made as Mr Bryant launched a U-turn on planned attacks on Next and Tesco over their use of foreign workers. Critics pointed out the stark contrast with comments he made a year before the 2004 influx, when he called dire warnings about unrestricted migration ‘huff and puff’. In a further blunder, he accused British workers of being ‘physically less mobile’ than other EU nationals in their search for jobs. It adds up to a disaster for Labour on an issue likely to be critical at the next election, in a summer in which it is widely seen as having lost ground to the Government. Tory MPs condemned Mr Bryant’s ‘short-sighted intervention’, calling him ‘badly confused’. Tory MP James Clappison, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘This is breathtaking hypocrisy, because of Labour’s multiple failures in failing to impose transitional controls and the huge increase in the number of work permits made available to workers from outside the EU. ‘Labour hasn’t got a leg to stand on.’ Mr Bryant’s embarrassing retreat followed a clumsy briefing to a Sunday newspaper, which reported he would attack Tesco and Next for ‘seeming to deliberately exclude British people’ from jobs and hiring foreign workers at lower wages. In an attack on ‘unscrupulous employers whose only interest seems to be finding labour as cheaply as possible’ he would accuse the supermarket of drafting in cheap foreign staff when it moved distribution centres, and claim Next hired Polish people to avoid agency workers’ regulations, it said. After a briefing to a Sunday newspaper, it reported Bryant would attack Tesco and Next for 'seeming to deliberately exclude British people' from jobs . But key passages were cut from the speech after a furious response from the two British firms, prompting Tory vice chairman Michael Fabricant to accuse Mr Bryant of ‘so much backtracking you needed five reverse gears’. By yesterday morning, when he appeared on the BBC’s Today programme, Mr Bryant was reduced to saying: ‘I fully accept that Next and Tesco often go the extra mile to try and recruit local workers.’ He made clear he did not consider them ‘unscrupulous’ – and it was pointed out that a Tesco distribution centre he mentioned ‘in Kent’ was in Dagenham, East London. He said he accepted that ‘Labour made mistakes when we were in government on migration’, adding: ‘When the new A8 countries joined the EU in 2004 it was right they should join the EU. But France, Italy and Germany sensibly said they would have transitional controls for seven years. We didn’t do that. A larger number of people came to the UK than anybody had anticipated.’ However, in June 2003, as commentators warned of the risks of opening Britain’s borders without transitional controls on labour movement, Mr Bryant said in the Commons newspapers were guilty of ‘huff and puff’. Last night Paul Uppal, Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, said: ‘Chris Bryant now calls transitional controls sensible, but doesn’t apologise for failing to introduce them after levels of migration to the UK exceeded France and Germany. ‘Labour let immigration get out of control, and Chris Bryant’s short sighted intervention today will do nothing to change this.’ Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Labour have opposed every one of the Government’s policies to bring immigration under control and refuse to say whether they will support our immigration bill. ‘This badly confused speech shows that Labour haven’t changed.’",Chris Bryant says it was wrong to ditch controls on migrant workers in 2004 .

Charities will receive guidelines on ‘appropriate levels’ of pay in the wake of revelations of chief executives receiving six-figure salaries. An investigation last week found that 14 UK foreign aid charities – including Save the Children, the British Red Cross and Oxfam – agreed to pay rises despite donations falling. International Development Secretary Justine Greening called for more transparency as MPs complained that people donating after emotional TV appeals may feel misled. High earners: Among the highest paid chief executives of charities are Justin Forsyth, left, a former New Labour adviser who earns £163,000 as chief executive of Save the Children, and British Red Cross' Sir Nick Young, right, who earned £184,000 last year . Yesterday, it emerged the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, which represents charities in England and has 10,000 members, will draw up guidance for charity trustees ‘on how to go about determining senior staff remuneration’. The advice, which will be the first code of conduct about pay in the charity sector, is set to be published next spring. Chief executive Sir Stuart Etherington, who is calling on the Charity Commission to set up a working group on pay levels, said yesterday: ‘The public are right to ask that their donations are spent effectively and efficiently. ‘Setting senior staff salaries is a complex task for trustees, who have to balance many factors to determine the right pay level in their organisation. ‘I believe definitive guidance would be a useful resource for trustees and would help give the public confidence that salaries have been properly considered. ‘I’m pleased the Commission is responding positively to our proposal to work together on this.’ Former Oxfam chief executive Dame Barbara Stocking, pictured left with Miriam Gonzalez Durantez (right), wife of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, was another high earner . A spokesman for the Charity Commission said: ‘We welcome this initiative from NCVO to work on an advisory code for charity trustees when setting senior staff salaries, and we would be happy to be involved in a process that supports trustees to fulfil their duties when making decisions.’ Priti Patel, the Conservative MP who said charities should spend less on executive salaries, said: ‘The Charity Commission should be commended for taking this positive step by looking at the wholly inappropriate levels of executive pay across the charitable sector.’ Charity Commission head William Shawcross said that high salaries risked bringing the sector ‘into disrepute’. It emerged last week that of the 14 charities on the Disaster Emergency Committee, six executives earn more than the Prime Minister, and 30 were on six-figure salaries. Among the highest paid are Justin Forsyth, a former New Labour adviser who earns £163,000 as chief executive of Save the Children, and British Red Cross chief executive Sir Nick Young, who earned £184,000 last year. Dame Barbara Stocking of Oxfam took home £119,560 before stepping down this year. Charlie Elphicke MP, who sits on the public administration select committee, said: ‘Charity bosses need to remind themselves that charity is a vocation, not an opportunity for personal enrichment. ‘More people will volunteer and donate when they know charitable funds are targeted at the front line rather than the boardroom.’ But charities say their pay is lower than levels in the private sector and they ‘need to attract the best people’.","Investigation found that 14 .

Justine Greening yesterday defended giving vast amounts of taxpayers’ cash to Nigeria while the oil-rich country is pouring money into its own space programme. The International Development Secretary said it was sensible for Nigeria to invest in satellites it could use to check the weather and help its agriculture-based economy. Critics will point out that it is possible to track the weather using a range of meteorological websites, not least the BBC. Justine Greening yesterday defended giving vast amounts of taxpayers' cash to Nigeria while the oil-rich country is pouring money into its own space programme . Nigeria, which has set in train ambitious plans to launch its own rockets and even put a man in space, has accepted £300million in British aid this year alone and taxpayers are sending £1.14billion over the five years of the Coalition. The cash is being sent even though the country has enough money to fund the first Nigerian astronauts who are being trained to join Russian, Chinese or American  missions within the next two years. Some have asked why Britain is, in effect, subsidising a space programme for a nation where 70 per cent of people live below the poverty line. But Miss Greening insisted that Britain’s aid would ‘help Nigeria progress and develop as a country’.She told BBC Radio 4: ‘I believe it is being well spent but we obviously have to make sure that we critically assess the projects under way. ‘We do expect them to invest in their country as well. The so-called space programme was in fact investment in satellites, weather satellites and for communication. ‘So actually this investment that they’re making in the so called “space programme” which is actually satellite technology, some of which actually has been provided by UK companies based in Surrey, is a sensible investment and actually one that we would be expecting them to be making alongside the investment that we make.’ Nigeria’s space programme started in 2003 but its first satellite lost power and disappeared from orbit. It now has three in space. A Russian rocket of the type used by Nigeria to launch satellites . Although it has bought satellites and launched them on Russian rockets, Nigeria has built laboratories which it  hopes will produce its own spacecraft by 2028. The country’s National Space Research and Development Agency has confirmed Nigerian astronauts should be trained and ready for space travel within two years. The agency’s director general,  Professor Seidu Onailo Mohammed, said last month: ‘By our road map we are supposed to have astronauts prepared by 2015. ‘Before the end of the year, the recruitment of astronauts will begin so that we have them handy and as soon as we get the nod we can pick from that number.’ The £1.14billion Nigeria is receiving over five years is more than  double the £500million set aside to prop up struggling accident and emergency departments at our own hospitals. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The Nigerian authorities have  been quite clear that they are  working towards sending their own astronauts into space within a couple of years, so Justine Greening cannot bat away the public’s  concerns with talk about weather satellites. ‘Questions still remain as to why UK taxpayers should be expected to subsidise this advanced technology when the Nigerian government is not ensuring that some of its  citizens’ most basic needs are met.’ Miss Greening received strong backing from Downing Street. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘These satellites are designed to supply better information about weather and climate which for a country so dependent on agriculture is hugely important. ‘There are a number of programmes operating in that country, but fundamentally the point that the International Development Secretary was making this morning is that it will aid the growth of the economy and will help the country provide more food.’","Justine Greening defended vast amounts of taxpayers’ cash to Nigeria .

He has also met two Northern Ireland Secretaries, Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers, and met Mr Paterson again when he became Environment Secretary. He even called Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, Britain’s most senior civil servant, into the Palace for a summit. The archives of the Court Circular reveal that the Prince’s meetings with senior figures continued even after he stepped down from his controversial official role as the UK’s Special Representative for International Trade and Investment. He was forced into a humiliating resignation from the position in mid-2011 following criticism for his perceived closeness to unsavoury regimes such as that in the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.

Purchases in mind: White, a divorced father of a 16-year-old son said he plans to help out his parents and buy his son the car of his dreams . ‘It's crazy,’ said the 45-year-old. ‘I’ve gone through this in my mind so many times. You almost feel like it’s coming true.’ The project engineer opted for a lump sum and will therefore take home $86 million after taxes. The . divorced dad made no mention of his ex-wife, nor has the mother of his . son and daughter come forward with her own feelings about her ex's win. While . White's new partner VanRees appeared overjoyed, his boss Ron Bowen was . also on hand and White joked he 'is going to end the day as my . chauffeur.' White told reporters he intends to pursue charitable endeavors, help out his parents, and buy his son the car of his dreams. As . surprised as he was with the huge news he is a newly crowned . millionaire, White said he always had a hunch he'd be a winner one day. The father of two teens said he played the lottery around once a month or when the the jackpot was especially big, though he said he was always 'more of a scratch-off guy.' He also said he nearly forgot to get tickets this week. Lucky for him, he remembered and bought $10 worth. White said he checked the 10 tickets he bought and realized he had nailed all six numbers on one of them. The ensuing hours, he said, had been a blur. Lump sum: Before taxes, White's share of the $448 million jackpot is $149.9 million. He took a lump cash sum and will get $86 million before taxes, or $58.3 million after taxes . 'It's just surreal at this point. I don't think you guys can understand — it's crazy. No worries anymore. It's crazy,' he said. He specified that no longer worrying about paying to send his 16-year-old and 14-year-old children to college or for his family's medical needs. He also said he intends to buy several cars: a 1963 Chevy Impala for his 80-year-old dad, a car for his newly licensed 16-year-old son, and a rare 1991 Acura sportscar for himself. White said he worked for a Minneapolis electrical contractor that had worked on major projects around the area including the Twins' Target Field and the University of Minnesota's TCF Bank Stadium. He said he's help his company finish a few things up, but that after that his working days would be over. 'I think a lot of good things are going to come out of this for not only my family and friends but for random people,' he said. 'I don't want to work for anybody else for the rest of my life for a paycheck.' Three winners: One of the two other tickets was sold at this Stop & Shop in South Brunswick, New Jersey. Winning numbers for one of the largest Powerball jackpots ever were: 05, 25, 30, 58, 59 and Powerball 32 . White said he intends to stay in his small Minnesota town, though. 'We’ll stay in that area, maybe just not in the same house,' he said. The other two winning tickets were . sold in New Jersey, including at a store in Little Egg Harbor, which is . still recovering from the damage wrought by Superstorm Sandy, which made . landfall just a few miles away. 'Hopefully, . it's somebody who lives in the area, and this is their reward for . having gone through this,' said Carol Blackford, a retiree whose home in . Little Egg Harbor was flooded with knee-high water during last . October's storm. 'And if they want to share, we're here.' But even if the winner wasn't someone devastated by the storm, the community will benefit from the jackpot. Luxuriating: White and his partner Kim VanReese, of Ham Lake Minnesota, revel in the news of White's massive Powerball win. He opted for the lump cash sum and will take home $86 million before taxes . Phil Weber, director of the Acme . Markets store where the winning ticket was sold, said Thursday that the . store would donate $10,000 in gift cards to local charities. Weber said . some of the store's employees are still out of their homes more than . nine months after the storm. The store itself has been making donations . since Sandy, Weber said. The other tickets were sold in a Super Stop & Shop store in South Brunswick, N.J. The winning numbers drawn Wednesday night were: 05, 25, 30, 58, 59 and Powerball 32.

Protests against rail fare rises will be held across the country today as it emerged that the cost of train travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008. Campaigners say January’s rise will be the sixth time in seven years rail fares have outstripped wages. Although ticket prices will have risen by 40 per cent since 2008, average earnings are only expected to have increased by 15 per cent. Protests against rail fare rises will be held across the country today as it emerged that the cost of train travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008 . The TUC and the Action For Rail campaign group will stage demonstrations at almost 50 stations to mark the publication of the latest retail price index (RPI) inflation figure, which is used to calculate next year’s rail fare rise. Analysts predict the RPI will be 3.3 per cent today, which would see regulated rail fares rise 4.3 per cent in January, well above average wage rises. The TUC warned some season tickets could rise 9 per cent against forecasts of a 2.4 per cent increase in average earnings next year. It said rail privatisation was costing taxpayers £1.2billion a year despite ‘minimal’ investment in trains and stations. General secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Every year, hard-pressed rail commuters have to hand over an ever greater share of their earnings just to get to and from work. ‘Wage-busting fare rises are not even going on much-needed service improvements. Instead, passenger and public subsidies are lining the pockets of the shareholders of private rail companies.’ Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ‘Getting to work is the biggest single monthly outgoing for many commuters, more than food, more than housing. ‘One of the surest ways of stamping on any green shoots of recovery is to price people off the trains and out of the jobs market.’ Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, said: ‘The increased costs of travel, and the inability of some to afford to travel, contrasts with the increased profits made by train companies.’ Julia Long, of the Unite union, said: ‘The current system of privately-owned operators is haemorrhaging enough cash each year to cut fares by at least 18 per cent without reducing staff or services. Yet every year we see fares soar way beyond the inflation rate.’ Campaigners say January's rise will be the sixth time in seven years rail fares have outstripped wages . But Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ‘Government determines how the average season ticket price rise is set each year. Since 2004, it has been Government policy to allow regulated fares to rise above inflation to support investment in more trains, better stations and faster services. ‘This is helping to drive passenger satisfaction to near record levels while seeking to reduce taxpayers’ contribution towards the cost of running the railways. ‘To help limit future fare rises, the rail industry is working with the Government to find ways of providing services even more efficiently.’","Cost of train travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008 .

Scars: Yoselyn Ortega, the nanny who is accused of killing Lucia and Leo Krim, appeared at a hearing for her trial at Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday with her self-inflicted wounds visible . A nanny accused of brutally stabbing two children to death in the bathtub of their luxurious Manhattan home returned to court today after being ruled fit to stand trial for murder. Yoselyn Ortega, 50, wore her dark hair tied back in a braid for the brief hearing at Manhattan Supreme Court and her self-inflicted stab wound on her neck was clearly visible. The scar shows where the nanny attempted to slit her own throat on October 25 after Marina Krim came home to her Upper West Side apartment to find her daughter Lucia, six, and her son, Leo, two, dead in a pool of blood in the bath. The short appearance comes after Ortega was examined by two mental health professionals, both of whom found that she could assist in her defense in a meaningful way and that she was mentally fit to proceed to her trial. Her lawyer is challenging those results. Last month, Ortega claimed someone else killed the children she's accused of stabbing all over their bodies in the Krims home. 'I didn't do that,' the nanny insisted in jailhouse interview with New York Daily News. 'Someone else did.' Ortega did not say who else could be responsible for murdering the children. Ortega, Lucia and Leo had been due to . meet Mrs Krim and Nessie at a dance studio, but the mother became . concerned when they failed to turn up and returned to the home. After learning from the doorman that . the nanny had not left the building, Mrs Krim frantically searched the . apartment and came across the grisly scene in the bathroom. Horrific: Yoselyn Ortega, pictured, was discovered with the two children and a knife as she attempted to slit her own throat . Fit state: The hearing comes after two psychologists ruled Ortega, pictured left and right, was mentally fit to stand trial . Ortega's suicide bid failed and she was put in a medically-induced coma. When . questioned by police after awaking from the coma, the nanny attempted . to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the . tragedy on her. Ortega, . who had told neighbors and family that she was short of money, revealed . she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to do and . asked her to do the housework. 'She said something like, ""I'm paid . to watch the children, not clean up and do housework"",' a . law-enforcement source said of Ortega’s statements to police after she . woke from the coma. Yoselyn became extremely animated . when she discussed the incident with police, telling officers that  she . had numerous disagreements with mother Marina about how the kids were . being cared for. Reports claimed Marina didn't think . Yoselyn was interacting with the kids enough and was giving them junk . food. Plea: Jocelyn Ortega, pictured centre, has pleaded not guilty to killing six-year-old Lucia Krim (right) and her two-year-old brother Leo while they were in her care at their Manhattan home . Loss: Two-year-old Leo and his big sister Lulu, six, were found in a pool of blood in the family's home . Victims: Only Nessie, whose picture has been pixelated, escaped harm as she was with her mother . The Krims were also reportedly worried about Ortega's job . performance in the weeks leading up to the killings and had told her . that if she didn't improve, they might need to replace her. But the Krims' extended family . dispute they treated her poorly, explaining that they paid for her to . travel on holidays and even visited her family in the Dominican . Republic. In April, Ortega, was ruled fit to . stand trial and will now face a jury for two counts of first-degree . murder and two counts of second-degree murder. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Missing: Erika Kacicova, 13, was last seen leaving her home in Darnell, Sheffield, five days ago . A 13-year-old schoolgirl missing for more than a week was found safe and well last night as police arrested five people over her disappearance. Erika Kacicova vanished from her family home in Sheffield on Monday last week, and despite media appeals from her family never made contact. She was finally tracked down to an address 40 miles away in Centenary Square in Bradford city centre at 6.40pm. Erika was alone in the property when she was discovered. Yesterday morning, before she was found, a 37-year-old man from Bradford was arrested on suspicion of child abduction. Then, in a dramatic development last night, police said they had arrested three other men and a woman for abduction. One was a 41-year-old man, but there were no details of the other two men and the woman. On Friday, police arrested a 22-year-old man from Bradford on suspicion of child abduction. He was released on bail on Sunday. The ‘bubbly and very popular’ schoolgirl is thought to have been befriended by older men on the internet before she disappeared. As part of the South Yorkshire Police . inquiry, her computer was taken away to establish exactly who she had . been in contact with in the lead up to her disappearance. Earlier yesterday Erika’s bereft mother Janna, 30, hurt her chin after a car crash in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Last night Mr Kacicova said he was delighted Erika had been found. He said: ‘We are very happy and just want to see her now. We are happy that she is safe.’ Earlier, the unemployed former parking . attendant said he was horrified by the thought that Erika may have been . targeted by older men over the internet. He said: ‘She is just a child and these are grown men. Why are they speaking with my daughter and spending time with her? ‘This is not right. She is very young and these men are not behaving in the proper way.’ Police described the 22-year-old’s . relationship with the girl as ‘a friendship’, but said the man was still . ‘of interest’ to the inquiry. Mr Kacicova, who lives with his wife . Jana and Erika’s younger sister, Bozena, ten, and brother Stefan, 11, . said the teenager had met an older unnamed man online before she . disappeared. Relieved: Erika Kacicova's father Stefan (pictured here with his other daughter Bozena, ten) said his 'beautiful' daughter had got to know a man of Pakistani origin on Facebook before disappearing a week ago . Travelled 40 miles: Erika Kacicova's home is in Darnall, Sheffield, where she was last seen last Monday at 4pm. She was found in Centenary Square in Bradford city centre, yesterday at 6:40pm . He added: ‘She was speaking to this . man on Facebook and we found out and told her to stop but it is very . difficult with children.’ Erika’s family have been informed and . she is in the care of police officers in Bradford. Erika had been last . seen on Monday afternoon when she left her family’s home in Darnall, . Sheffield. More than 50 police officers joined the search for the youngster. Detectives said they carried out . ‘extensive inquiries’, speaking to various people they believed were in . contact with Erika in the last couple of days. Detective Inspector Helen Tate, from . South Yorkshire Police, said: ‘It’s fantastic that we now have Erika . safe and well, and a successful conclusion to the search. ‘Our primary aim now is to concentrate . on Erika’s wellbeing and begin to piece together her movements since . she left home last Monday.’ Injured: Janna Kacicova, mother of Erika, who was in a car accident yesterday and is now recovering at her home . Missing: Erika was last seen on Monday afternoon when she left her family's home in Darnall, Sheffield . She added: ‘I have personally been . overwhelmed by the way the public and the media have responded to our . appeals and I am extremely grateful for their help and support.’ She later said at a press conference: ‘We now have five people in custody on suspicion on child abduction.’ Detective Tate refused to comment on whether Erika had been targeted by a ‘grooming gang’. The family moved to Britain from Slovakia two years ago. Detectives took a computer and a mobile phone from their home for further analysis. Erika previously went missing about three months ago but she returned home after 24 hours. Officers had described the incident as . ‘critical’ and teachers and family members appealed to Erika to get in . touch to say that she is safe and well.

A campaigner whose son became the youngest person to die in police custody has been charged with drugs offences. Carol Pounder, 45, who lost her son Adam Rickwood when he was just 14, is accused of conspiracy to supply heroin in February this year along with his sister Laura, 21, and Luke Gorton, 28. They appeared at Burnley Magistrates' Court and were released on bail for a plea and case management hearing at a crown court. Charged: Carol Pounder (left), mother of Adam Rickwood (right), accused of conspiracy to supply heroin . Adam was found hanged at Hassockfield . detention centre near Consett, County Durham, after being subjected to a . controversial nose distraction technique that has since been banned. His mother led a long-running . campaign for justice following his death and lobbied for a second . inquest which ruled that 'unlawful' force by guards had contributed to his death. The teenager, who had previously written letters threatening self-harm, was left alone with a bloody nose in a cell . after being carried there by four detention officers. One administered a short, sharp blow to his nose to quieten him down en-route to his secure quarters. Adam . was remanded to Hassockfield at the same magistrates’ court in the . summer of 2004 after allegedly breaching his bail on a wounding charge. Carol Pounder (pictured) spent years campaigning for justice for her son Adam who died in custody . He was also facing a burglary allegation of the staff office at Stoops and Hargher Clough community centre at the time. His mother has also staged protests outside the courthouse, while campaigning to obtain justice for the teenager. The family had to wait more than three-and-a-half years for an inquest into the teenager's death. Even then an inquest jury returned a suicide verdict and placed no blame on Hassockfield staff. The nose-hold technique used to restrain Adam was banned in January 2008 and the following year a High Court judge ordered a fresh inquest into his death. It was not until January 2011, when a second inquest took place under a different coroner, that a jury ruled 'unlawful force' had contributed to his death by hanging. His case has also since been cited by the Children's Rights Alliance for England after they lobbied on behalf of teenagers who may have been assaulted in detention centres across the UK. Pounder, Rickwood and Gorton will appear for a plea and case management hearing at Burnley Crown Court later this year.

Patients who suffer poor hospital care are failed because complaints go unheard and lessons unlearned, the NHS Ombudsman has warned. Dame Julie Mellor said patients often felt too scared to complain about their NHS treatments. She said: ‘What we found was that there is a toxic cocktail – patients felt reluctant to complain, because they can fear it will affect the care they get. If they do, they are met with a culture of defensiveness, where they don’t get the explanations they need and the opportunity is lost to learn really powerful insights.’ A report by the NHS Ombudsman is calling for sweeping changes so that more complaints are acted on quickly, and action is taken before care is threatened. The changes include access to a free patients’ advice service 24 hours a day, each patient to be given the name of a senior person as the first port of call for concerns and a regular measure of feedback. Ann Clwyd, a Labour MP whose husband suffered appalling failings in care, has submitted the recommendations to an independent review which is set to report next month. Dame Julie told the  Daily Telegraph that hospitals often fail to learn lessons from even major tragedies, which were then more likely to be repeated. More than half of those who consider complaining about their treatment by the NHS do not do so, according to research. Many are put off because they expect the process to be bureaucratic, while others believe it will make no difference. Patients and carers contacted the NHS Ombudsman in desperation and frustration, Dame Julie said, because hospital complaints departments had failed to provide even the most basic explanation, let alone an apology. A report by the NHS Ombudsman is calling for sweeping changes so that more complaints are acted on quickly . ‘There are three core things that people come to us about,’ she said. ‘Number one is – “I just can’t get a decent explanation, I really don’t know what happened and actually maybe if I had a proper explanation that would sort it for me – I just want to know”. ‘The second is when something has gone wrong, but there is a lack of acknowledgement of mistakes, and inadequate apology. ‘The third is when there is insufficient remedy – I think what has really struck me about why the public complain is they do so because they want to prevent the same thing happening to someone else.’ A study by the Ombudsman also found staff are reluctant to properly investigate complaints because they are afraid of challenging the NHS hierarchy, drawing attention to failings or they are worried about being punished for admitting to failings. ‘This defensiveness is one of the most important things we need to overcome – that is about changing the culture, not about the procedure,’ Dame Julie said. Last month Dame Julie promised a ten-fold rise in the numbers of cases which the Ombudsman examines. A major review has called for NHS staff who ‘wilfully’ or ‘recklessly’ harm patients to face criminal penalties. It also demanded legal sanctions against NHS chiefs with a ‘couldn’t care less’ attitude.",The NHS Ombudsman says complaints must be acted on quickly .

This amazing 125-foot tall chasm is actually just one of a number of stunning rooms and passages in an abandoned mine in Wiltshire. The shots were taken during a caving-camping trip by photographer Robbie Khan - and capture the stark beauty of this ancient free-stone quarry, located in the tiny town of Box. He descended into the dark depths with a fire-juggling friends Oliver Nelson and Myk YP to cast a unique light around the interior of the mine, which is said to date back to Roman times.

The 'cathedral' chamber is an impressive 125-feet tall, 120-feet wide and 120-feet long. In the early morning, when the photo was taken, the condensation from the stone creates an eerie mist. The Box Freestone Mine was worked since the Roman era, reaching it peak stone production in the 19th century, until it was abandoned in 1968. It was progressively enlarged over the years and now has more than 90km of passages divided into three sections - northern, central and southern. According to The Mine Explorer Society, it retains many impressive features such as tools, work benches, cranes and wells.

Common sense might tell you that taking a staycation will help save a few pounds compared to travelling of to foreign destinations. But with decent weather, more people have opted to stay in the UK and hotels have been cashing in on extra visitors, making a quick weekend break at home much more expensive than last year. Last year's best-value city was Birmingham where the total-stay package was £139.54 - more than £25 cheaper than this year's lowest-priced city, Nottingham. The distinctive Edinburgh skyline is attracting many staycationers - but hotels have pushed up their prices . A stay in Birmingham was estimated at £183.82 this year, sixth cheapest among the 20 cities surveyed. The recent spell of hot weather is one of the reasons hotels are cashing in while travel agents are tearing their hair out - as consumers ditch their holiday plans and instead enjoy the hot weather at home. The predicted lengthy heatwave means that many have opted to save cash by transferring their holiday plans from exotic trips abroad to their local parks and pools. TripAdvisor spokesman James Kay said: . 'With the great summer we've been enjoying, staycations are sure to be a . popular choice for UK travellers over the August bank holiday, but . where you go will have a big impact on how much you're likely to spend. Nottingham proves the least-expensive of 20 UK cities for an August 2013 overnight break including a hotel stay, pre-dinner Martinis, an evening meal out and taxi rides . 'Generally, the further north you go the less you'll need to fork out for hotels and dinner, but there are some notable exceptions to that rule, so make sure you plan ahead.' Those looking for cheaper city breaks should consider nights out in Nottingham rather than expensive evenings in Edinburgh. Nottingham proves the least-expensive of 20 UK cities for an August 2013 overnight break including a hotel stay, pre-dinner Martinis, an evening meal out and taxi rides, the survey by TripAdvisor found. The two-person break in Nottingham is £164.73 compared with £298.46 in Edinburgh - the most expensive of the 20 cities.

An investigation by South Ayrshire Council in Scotland uncovered evidence that the big chains are misleading customers about the freshness of potatoes on sale. The findings have led industry body the Potato Council to call on supermarkets to adopt a new definition of what constitutes a British new potato. Misleading: A council investigation has found British new potatoes have often been harvested months before they arrive on supermarket shelves . The probe was sparked by customer George Norris who complained to his local Trading Standards office that potatoes on sale as 'new' potatoes had been stored for prolonged periods after harvesting. Investigators monitored the sale of . 'new' potatoes from Aldi, Asda, . Co-op, Iceland, Lidl, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco - between . December 2012 and March this year and asked for planting and harvesting . information. Aldi and Iceland did not respond. In each of the 24 samples, the potatoes had . been harvested four or five months previously. One sample from Tesco had been harvested in August 2012 did not go on sale until March 2013, but were still described as new. Council officers were also concerned . that the way some loose potatoes were displayed within supermarkets . could suggest to customers they had been freshly dug, when that was not . the case. They passed their concerns to the Potato Council, which confirmed there was not an agreed industry standard description of new potatoes. The revised description defines a new potato as a one that has been specially grown and harvested early, packed full of taste, with a thin skin or one you can rub off with a finger. Call for change: Industry campaigners the Potato Council now want all supermarkets to adopt a revised definition of what constitutes a British new potato . Leading retailers are now being urged to adopt the new guidelines. Today,Mr Norris told of his delight that the potato industry was taking action following his intervention. He said: 'I'm very pleased to be able to say that, following the initial verification that there could be a problem with selling stored potatoes as 'new', the council committed to a thorough investigation, which has had a positive outcome and I will follow any developments with interest.' Caroline Evans from the Potato Council added: 'New potato is a term that over-time has become short-hand for a small potato cooked in its skin, often boiled, baked or teamed. 'To meet demand for quick and tasty potatoes, we have lost the seasonality. 'Our description of a 'new potato' means customers know they're enjoying potatoes at their seasonal best and if your supermarket adopts the description, you can be sure of what you're buying.' Named and shamed: One sample of Tesco potatoes had been harvested seven months before they were put on the shelves . Today, Tesco said they would abide by the new standard and look at relabelling their Miniature New, Baby New and New 2.5kg products. A spokesman said: 'We are pleased to support The Potato Council's new industry standard description of 'new' potatoes. 'New or salad potatoes are popular with our customers all year round. We would love to be able to supply freshly lifted new potatoes year-round from UK growers but due to the nature of the growing season, this isn't possible, so we use cold storage to ensure we can always meet customer demand.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . PUBLISHED: . 17:51 EST, 12 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:25 EST, 13 August 2013 . Britain's biggest water company wants to impose a £29 surcharge on millions of customers. Thames Water has made profits of £1.7billion over the last five years on the back of a succession of inflation-busting increases in bills. At the same time it has paid dividends of some £1.4billion to its private owners, including investment funds owned by the governments of China and Abu Dhabi. Thames Water is expected to pay about £4million pounds for the damage done in Herne Hill when a three foot wide water main burst . But it now wants its 14million customers to dig deep into their pockets yet again to pay the one-off surcharge because of a raft of extra costs it faces. The proposal was immediately condemned by the official customer body, which called on the industry regulator, Ofwat, to block it. Thames Water justified the surcharge by saying it had suffered a bigger than expected drop in income because of customer bad debt. There had also been a £66million bill for maintaining thousands of miles of private household sewers, it said. The company is also having to find millions of pounds to buy land for the Thames Tideway Tunnel – a vast super-sewer for London. Last week dozens of businesses and homes were flooded in south London after a three foot wide water main burst near Herne Hill station, with parts of the suburb submerged under a metre-and-a-half of water on Wednesday. Thames Water and its insurers are expected to pick up a bill of around £4million for the damage. Critics say the company would have more than enough money to cover all these costs if it had not given away so much in dividends. Sir Tony Redmond, chairman of the Consumer Council for Water in the South East, said: ‘Many other water companies absorbed the costs that Thames say they are facing – and without applying for a further price increase. Thames Water should do the same. Thames Water justified the surcharge by saying it had suffered a bigger than expected drop in income because of customer bad debt . ‘Our research shows one in seven customers say they can’t afford their water bill. Thames Water’s price hike will add to the problem.’ The company already plans to put up bills by 1.4per cent above RPI inflation in April, which will raise the annual figure from £354 to around £370. With the new surcharge, the figure would rise to almost £400. Water bills are set to rise next year - with or without an extra charge from Thames Water . Thames Water has gone through several foreign hands since privatisation in 1989. Since being sold to a consortium headed by the Australian bank Macquarie, in 2006/07, it has been weighed down with billions of pounds of debt, and massive interest payments. This tactic has played a part in allowing the firm to pay  zero corporation tax on its huge profits. A recent study by the Centre Forum think-tank condemned the way water companies have been allowed to give billions of pounds in dividends to largely private investors. It called on the government to limit the stellar dividends. Thames Water provides some eight million homes with water and 14 million with sewerage services. Its prices – as with all water companies – are set on a five-year cycle with figures agreed by Ofwat. Thames insists this regime allows it to come back and argue for a surcharge to cover unusual costs. Chief financial officer Stuart Siddall said: ‘These significant costs could not be quantified at the beginning of the current pricing period; their scale is unique to Thames Water’s operations, project commitments and catchment area.’ The company would prefer the £29 surcharge to be spread over several years to ‘avoid a spike in bills for our customers’, he said. The decision on whether to allow the surcharge will be made by Ofwat. Chief executive Regina Finn said: ‘We have made it clear to companies we expect them to talk to their customers, listen to them and take account of their customers’ views.’","14 million customers will have to pay a one-off surcharge to cover costs .

"He has launched $500,000 appeal for donations to fund retrial . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:55 EST, 29 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:07 EST, 29 June 2013 . Raffaele Sollecito has spoken of his passionate relationship with Amanda Knox, . after judges in Italy ordered a retrial into the Meredith Kercher murder . case . Amanda Knox's ex-lover Raffaele Sollecito has told of their 'intense' relationship claiming he felt he had been 'hit by a thunderbolt' when they first met. Speaking to reporters in New York, where he and Knox were reunited earlier this week, Sollecito said he was horrified by the Italian Court's decision to reopen the case into the murder of  British student Meredith Kercher. Sollecito and Knox were found guilty of murdering 21-year-old Miss Kercher in 2009 and were jailed for 25 and 26 years respectively. They were freed on appeal in 2011, but Italian judges have now ordered them to return to court for retrial. Sollecito told The Sun: 'Meeting Amanda was like being hit by a thunderbolt. Our relationship got very intense, very quickly. 'I didn't have much experience of sex. She had a bit more than me. We were sleeping together and our sex life wasn't boring. 'We talked about fantasies and asked each other what we liked and so on, but it was totally normal.' Sollecito said he felt great sorrow over the death of Miss Kercher and added that he would one day like to visit her grave in Mitcham, Surrey. He said: 'I will never forget Meredith. It was terrible what happened. But I am not responsible for her death. 'It makes me sad when her family say they still believe other people were involved. Rudy Guede is in prison for her murder and his DNA was all over the scene.' He described the reopening of the trial as like a 'horror movie where . they keep making sequels', and continues to deny having anything to do . with Miss Kercher's death. The court ruled that the 21-year-old's death was a 'sex . game gone wrong' and have ordered Sollecito and Knox back for trial. This has resulted in Sollecito launching a desperate $500,000 (£320,000) online appeal for donations to fund his retrial. The . computer studies graduate said he was hard up and needed the cash for . 'legal expenses' but added he would donate anything raised above the target 'to a research foundation'. In an appeal posted on his Facebook page, Sollecito wrote: 'Well Guys, the problem for me now is pretty though.

On . Tuesday, the High Court issued its written reasoning for doing so. Miss . Kercher's body was found in November 2007 in her bedroom of the house . she shared with Knox in Perugia, a central Italian town popular with . foreign exchange students. Knox, . now 25, and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 29, were . initially convicted and sentenced to long prison terms, but a Perugia . appeals court acquitted them in 2011, criticising virtually the entire . case mounted by prosecutors. The appellate court noted that the . murder weapon was never found, said that DNA tests were faulty and that . prosecutors provided no murder motive. A . young man from Ivory Coast, Rudy Guede, was convicted of the slaying in . a separate proceeding and is serving a 16-year sentence. In the 74-page Cassation ruling, the . High Court judges said they 'had to recognize that he (Guede) was not . the sole author' of the crime, Italian news agency LaPresse reported. The judges though said he was the 'main protagonist'. They said the new appeal process would . serve to 'not only demonstrate the presence of the two suspects in the . place of the crime, but to possibly outline the subjective position of . Guede's accomplices'. It . said hypotheses ran from a simple case of forced sex involving Kercher . 'to a group erotic game that blew up and got out of control'. Crime scene: This is the flat in Perugia where Meredith Kercher was found dead . Decision: Italy's judges have ruled that the possibility that Meredith Kercher died during a sex game which went wrong needed to be looked at again . The high court faulted the Perugia appeals court for 'multiple instances of deficiencies, contradictions and illogical' conclusions. The new court must conduct a full examination of evidence to resolve the ambiguities, it said. Knox and Sollecito denied wrongdoing and said they weren't even in the apartment that night, although they acknowledged they had smoked marijuana and their memories were clouded. Miss Kercher was found semi-naked and with her throat cut in the . bedroom of the house she shared in the Italian hilltop town of Perugia . with his American former girlfriend. He . was given a 25-year jail term while Knox was given 26 years but in 2011 . the verdicts were overturned and they were released on appeal.

"By . Nick Pisa . PUBLISHED: . 05:48 EST, 27 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:50 EST, 27 June 2013 . The judge who cleared Amanda Knox of killing Meredith Kerchner has hit out at his colleagues who overturned the decision, saying they were 'violating the law'. Claudio Pratillo Hellmann acquitted Knox, 26, and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29, of murdering the British student in 2011 after they had initially been found guilty and sentenced to 26 and 25 years jail respectively. However, three months ago the Italian Supreme Court overruled that decision, saying that key evidence had been overlooked, and a fresh trial is expected to begin in the autumn. Cleared: Amanda Knox, left, was acquitted of killing her flatmate Meredith Kercher, right, in Perugia . Judge: Claudio Pratillo Hellmann, who overturned Knox's sentence, has criticised the Italian Supreme Court for ordering the American to undergo a fresh murder trial . In a furious attack Mr Hellmann, who has now retired as a judge, slammed the ruling in an interview with glossy Italian weekly Oggi. 'The Supreme Court judges in effect carried out a straight-legged tackle,' he said. They cannot do that and they should not have done that. They should have just limited themselves to the law. 'Instead they decided to interpret the evidence and that is a violation of the law. That is incorrect. What they have done is in effect hand the new trial a sentence that is ready and done - their ruling has explained to the judges in the new trial how they should convict the two accused.' In their ruling, the Supreme Court reverted to the original 2009 trial verdict that said Meredith had been killed by more than one person in a 'sex game gone wrong', claiming the acquittal two years later contained 'deficiencies, contradictions and illogical' conclusions. Relief: Knox after her acquittal in 2011; she now faces a retrial but is unlikely to return to the court in Italy . Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede was convicted of the murder and sexual assault of Meredith in 2009 and is now serving a 16-year sentence, reduced from 30 on appeal. He could be freed as early as 2014. Mr Hellmann said: 'The theory of a sex game gone wrong doesn't add up - in that small room where Meredith was killed after a struggle and supposedly a sex game gone wrong, maybe even an orgy, there was no biological trace of Knox and Sollecito - it would have been impossible for them to get rid of their traces and leave that of Guede.' He added that he was 'still convinced' he had made the right decision in freeing Knox and Sollecito - who were pictured last week warmly embracing in New York - and added: 'I am still convinced that I did my duty. I'm happy because I avoided an unjust jailing. 'Italy is a country that convicts where there is proof beyond all reasonable doubt. In this case there were only slim possibilities that they were both involved, and when you hold a trial you are not playing the lottery.' Couple: Knox was jailed for two years along with her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito . But in a press conference in Perugia, where Meredith was murdered in 2007, chief prosecutor Giovanni Galati insisted that the retrial would give fresh hope to the Croydon-born student's family. He said: 'This has become an unworthy soap opera and only Rudy Guede, Amanda and Raffaele can tell us what really happened on the night of November 1, 2007. The appeal court judges lost their way - they didn't take into account anything from the first trial because they wanted to confirm their innocence. 'The Supreme Court has overruled the appeal court's decision that there had been contamination of evidence. The new trial will bring justice and, in the case of a conviction, a new sentence. It gives fresh hope to the family of the student so they can know what happened to her.' Knox is not expected to return to Italy voluntarily for the retrial, and the U.S. is extremely unlikely to extradite her to Europe. She recently published a memoir, entitled Waiting to Be Heard, in which she protested her innocence and described the ordeal of spending two years in an Italian prison, where she says she was sexually harassed by guards and fellow inmates. Sollecito's father Francesco said: 'It is evident that sentences should be respected - and above all those of the Supreme Court. 'However, here we find it impossible to agree because there are serious inaccuracies in the judgement and they have no idea of the evidence. 'What judge Hellmann is saying is that the Supreme Court has in effect returned a third verdict which it should not have and which is forbidden by law.' Last week Sollecito launched an online appeal for $500,000 to help fund his new trial, and the total now stands at $10,000.","Knox had murder conviction overturned by Claudio Pratillo Hellmann .

Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has been pictured on state television just hours after rebels claimed to have attack his motorcade with shells. The dictator was on his way to a mosque in Damascus today to celebrate the end of Ramadan when he apparently came under fire from the Free Syrian Army. But government officials denied the claim, and a TV station controlled by the regime broadcast footage of Assad praying alongside the country's grand mufti. Broadcast: Syrian president Bashar al-Assad with the grand mufti Ahmed Hassan at a mosque in Damascus, as shown on state television . The Tahrir al-Sham rebel brigade said it fired several artillery shells towards Assad's convoy in the heart of the capital and that at least some hit their target. If confirmed, the attack would be one of the most direct against Assad in two years of civil war which have pitted mainly Sunni rebels against the Alawite president. Rebels have targeted Assad's residences in Damascus and a bombing in the capital last year killed four of his inner circle, but there have been no reports of Assad himself coming under fire. Video footage distributed by the rebels apparently showed smoke rising from the Malki district, where Assad and his close aides have homes. Other activists also reported rocket fire into the area. However, the government information minister Omran Zoabi said: 'The news is wholly untrue.' Prayer: Assad and his ministers were attending celebrations for Eid ul-Fitr, the end of Ramadan . Smiling: Assad has denied claims that his motorcade was hit with rockets fired by rebel fighters . Firas al-Bitar, head of Tahrir al-Sham, said his fighters had carried out reconnaissance of the route of Assad's motorcade and fired 120mm artillery towards the president's convoy early on Thursday. 'The attack rattled the regime, even if Assad was not hit,' he said. 'There were two motorcades, one containing Assad and a decoy - we targeted the correct one.' Bitar's brigade operates mainly in the Ghouta region of Damascus. Another Tahrir al-Sham official said Assad's forces fired rockets and artillery 'like rain' on the region in response to the reported attack. Following the statement, Syrian state television showed footage of Assad praying with ministers and other top officials. It said the footage was from Thursday's Eid ul-Fitr prayers at the Anas bin Malek Mosque in Malki. Assad appeared unharmed and smiled at the worshippers as he entered the mosque. Carnage: A scene of destruction in Raqqa province as Syria's two-year civil war continues to rage . Islam Alloush of the Liwa al-Islam, another rebel brigade, said that rebels fired rockets which struck Assad's motorcade. 'Assad was not hit but the information we have based from sources within the regime is that there were casualties within his entourage,' he added. More than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in Syria's civil war, which began as a largely peaceful uprising in March 2011.","Opposition group claims to have hit president's motorcade with rockets .

At trial: Former newspaper tycoon Eddie Shah was cleared of rape charges last month . Former newspaper tycoon Eddy Shah was condemned last night for saying some young girls who were sexually assaulted by celebrities were ‘to blame’. Mr Shah, cleared last month of raping an underage girl, said abuse of youngsters in the 1960s, 70s and 80s was a ‘technical thing’ because they ‘threw themselves’ at stars. The 69-year-old said there was a  difference between ‘girls who just go out and have a good time’ and those ‘who actually get “raped” raped’. He claimed Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree, set up following allegations of sex abuse by BBC DJ Jimmy Savile, is turning into a ‘witch hunt’. Last night a woman abused by Savile at age 13 said Mr Shah’s comments ‘beggar belief’. And a mother-of-one assaulted by TV star Stuart Hall in the 1960s said the victims ‘were not liars’. Mr Shah, who founded the now defunct newspaper Today in 1986, said: ‘Rape was a technical thing, below a certain age, but these girls were going out with the pop groups and becoming groupies and all the rest of it, and throwing themselves at them. ‘Young girls and young men have always wanted a bit of excitement. They want to appear adult and do adult things.’ Asked if he was implying underage victims were at fault, he said: ‘If we’re talking about girls who go out and just have a good time, then they are to blame. 'If we talk about people who happen to be out and actually get “raped” raped, then everything should be done against that.’ In the interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Mr Shah was asked if he thought Operation Yewtree was in danger of becoming a witch hunt. He said: ‘I think it’s developing into that. ‘It’s easy policing and it’s easy . prosecutions. In a civilised society there’s got to be more checks and . balances before these sort of accusations are used.’ Angered: Susan Harrison, who was a victim of Stuart Hall as a teenager, slammed Shah for describing Operation Yewtree as a 'witch hunt' Mr Shah said he was helping a ‘very well-known person’, who is being investigated by Operation Yewtree, deal with the ‘horrible, horrible feeling’ of ‘emptiness about everything’. He said he had felt similarly when he was wrongly accused of rape, adding: ‘Every night I worked out different ways of committing suicide to help me go to sleep.’ Mr Shah, who lives in Chippenham, Wiltshire, with his wife Jennifer, was found not guilty at the Old Bailey last month of raping a girl aged between 12 and 15. Caroline Moore, 53, was abused by Jimmy Savile aged 13 at Stoke Mandeville hospital in 1971. She said of Mr Shah’s claims: ‘It beggars belief that someone would say . that . . . I would like to give him a good smack and tell him to think . before speaking next time. These comments can cause a lot of pain and . distress.’ Susan Harrison was 16 when TV . presenter Stuart Hall lured her to BBC premises on the pretext of . helping her record a song, before attacking her in his car. Not guilty: The ex-newspaper tycoon arrives at the Old Bailey with his wife Jennifer last month, where he was cleared of charges of raping a girl aged between 12 and 15 . The 61-year-old said: ‘It does anger . me that it is described as a witch hunt when the police are just . responding to genuine complaints. ‘Every case is dealt with on its own merits. In our case we were not liars, contrary to what was said about us. ‘The police are not targeting these men because they are famous but because complaints have been made against them.’ Pete Saunders, of the National . Association of People Abused in Childhood, added: ‘I’d like to meet with . Eddy, and to have him explain to me, and maybe explain to some rape . victims, what he means by “raped raped”, because my understanding is . there is rape, or there is not rape, and rape is always a crime.’ Redefining crime: Mr Shah, pictured the year after the closing of Today newspaper, pointed out that there is a difference between underage girls who have consensual sex and what he called '""rape"" rape'","Ex- media tycoon Eddy Shah branded Operation Yewtree a 'witch hunt'

On trial: Andrew Reeve, 55, and his wife Lesley, 56, of Hartlepool, County Durham, are accused of theft . A husband today denied stealing more than £100,000 from his wife's vulnerable godmother and claimed the alleged victim had told the couple to spend her life savings ‘as we saw fit’. Andrew Reeve, 55, and his wife Lesley, 56, of Hartlepool, County Durham, are accused of reducing 91-year-old dementia sufferer Joan Killen's bank accounts from £130,000 to just £3,000 in two years. The prosecution claimed some of that went on converting a garage into a wet room and gym, but the defendants said they were making it into a bedroom for her to live in. Mr Reeve told Teesside Crown Court that Miss Killen, who lives in a care home and considered the couple as her only family, was ‘delighted’ with the plan to move in with them. He claimed she then showed the couple her will ‘and told us we could spend what we needed to do the modernisations, and she also said we could use it as we saw fit’. Mr Reeve claimed the spinster told him they could use the money for ‘anything’. She wanted to see the couple enjoy her money while she was still alive, he claimed. The court has heard the couple paid off debts of more than £11,000, bought a car and regularly shopped at Next, Marks & Spencer and Argos. Mr Reeve became a signatory for her bank accounts and transferred money from savings to her current account, the court heard. Building work: The home where the Reeve couple proposed the garage conversion would be carried out . The couple are accused of stealing . £95,000 from her savings, plus her pension, winter fuel allowance and . money they made by renting her home out once she went into care.

But when police arrested the couple . they found an exercise ball and treadmill in the room - which Mr Reeve . said was a coincidence. Matthew Bean, prosecuting, said: ‘The . truth is you had no intention of ever having Miss Killen to come and . live with you, did you?’ Mr Reeve replied: ‘That's not true.’ 'Taking advantage': There was regular spending by the couple at Next (left), Marks & Spencer (right, both file pictures) and Argos, funded by Miss Killen, the court was told .

It comes after another baby taken from Fuping County Maternal and Child Health Care became the first to be reunited with his parents earlier this week following the arrest of the hospital's obstetrician . Zhang Shuxia is accused of abducting newborns from the hospital in Shaanxi province after convincing the parents to give them up by falsely claiming the infants were born with serious health conditions. Police have received 55 reports of child abductions and allege that Zhang was involved in 26 of them. Twin baby girls stolen from The Fuping County Maternal and . ChildHealth Care Hospital (pictured) have been rescued following the arrest of the hospital's obstetrician who is accused of being involved in 26 abductions . Three government officials and three hospital managers have also been fired over the baby trafficking scandal, the official Xinhua News Agency reported last night. The twins were due to be reunited with their parents, mother Wang Yanyan and father Qi Kunfeng, today. The parents told CNN that Zhang convinced them to give up the twins after their birth on May 29 by telling them they had serious health problems. Wang, 31, said: 'The doctor was pretending to be very anxious, telling me that my babies have congenital problems. She said the twins would be brain damaged or paralyzed. 'I insisted on seeing the babies, but . she wouldn't let me. I never suspected that she was selling my babies, . because she was a family friend.' Emotion: Dong Wan cries as she holds her newborn son after being reunited with him in hospital . Joy: Ms Dong, 31, is handed her baby after he was recovered from human traffickers . The parents described the obstetrician as 'evil' and a 'terrible' person. Qi said: 'We trusted her so much. How could she be so cruel to sell our babies?' The other rescued baby boy was returned to his parents on Monday. His mother Dong Wan, 31, wept as she held the boy at the hospital in Fuping. The same doctor apparently told Ms Dong, 31, that her son was born with severe health problems and would soon die. The healthy baby boy was tracked down by investigators after Dong became suspicious. The . mother said: ‘I was told the baby would not survive and the best thing . for me would be to let the hospital take care of it so I did.’ Relief: The mother had been tricked by her obstetrician into handing over her son to him . Crime: Ms Dong spoke of her pain at being tricked by the doctor she had previously trusted . After signing the documents at The Fuping County Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital, Dong changed her mind and begged her husband, Lai Guofeng, to call the police. The baby was tracked down hundreds of . miles away in neighbouring Henan province where the original . traffickers had sold him on for a profit. He . had been sold for 21,600 yuan (£2,275 or $3,527) on July 17, the day . after he was born. The baby was then sold two more times over the course . ofthe next ten days. Despite severe legal punishments, including the death penalty, child trafficking is still a big problem in China.

Police have released images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the theft of a bike at the RideLondon FreeCycle event . A suspected bike thief is being hunted by police after he was pictured taking part in a huge cycling event on a stolen bicycle by an official race photographer. The bike's owner found the images posted online by official photographers of the RideLondon FreeCycle event after his bicycle was stolen ahead of the race starting. The green Trek Madone 4.9, worth up to £3,000, had been securely locked up at Green Park, near Constitution Hill, central London, before the event. But when the 42-year-old owner returned to the area before the race, at 1pm on Saturday, August 3, he discovered the lock had been cut and the bike was missing. Police have said an official RideLondon photographer captured images of the stolen bike, complete with race numbers still attached, being ridden along the Mall. The bike's owner discovered the images posted online and handed them to police. Officers from the joint Transport for London and Metropolitan Police Service Safer Transport Command Cycle Task Force are now trying to trace the man in the photograph. PC Charlotte Brierley, of the Cycle Task Force, said: 'The victim was about to take part in the FreeCycle event when his bicycle was stolen. 'The theft took place in the middle of a very busy event and we are urging people who were there who may have seen anything to come forward.

A Michigan oncologist is accused of bilking the federal government out of millions of dollars in Medicare claims by allegedly administering 'unnecessary chemotherapy to patients in remission.' According to federal prosecutors, 48-year-old Dr. Farid Fata, of Oakland Township, 'systematically defrauded Medicare by submitting false claims for services that were medically unnecessary.' According to the complaint, Fata defrauded the federally funded healthcare program out of roughly $35million over a two-year period. Scam: Dr. Farid Fata is accused of administering cancer treatment to people who didn't need it to scam Medicare . On Tuesday, federal authorities took Fata - who owns and operates Michigan Hematology Oncology Centers - into custody and raided several of his offices in the Detroit area, seizing medical records they say will show that he was misdiagnosing patients in a scam to steal from the federal government. 'Violating a patient's trust and placing them at risk through fraudulent . abuse of our nation's health care system is deplorable,' FBI Special . Agent in Charge Robert D. Foley III said in a news release. At a bond hearing on Friday, Jeff Berz, whose father was one of Fata's patients, testified that Fata refused to stop administering drugs after his father didn't respond to chemotherapy. 'From the time that my father began getting the chemotherapy, his health deteriorated,' he said. Angela Swantek, an oncology nurse who spent time at one of Fata's clinics, told ABC News that she first complained to investigators about Fata's alleged wrongdoings as far back as 2010. Raid: Federal agents seized medical records from several of Fata's Detroit-area offices on Tuesday . 'I don't know how he's gotten away with it for this long,' she told ABC News. 'I was disgusted. I got in the car, I was still sitting in the parking lot and I was truly almost in tears just because of what I saw and how patients were getting their chemotherapy.' Fata's attorney, Christopher Andreoff, says the government is wrong and that his clients was not guilty of anything. 'The government has not retained an expert to give an opinion that there was a mistreatment, or misdiagnosis, or unnecessary tests given to any patient,' he said. History: Oncology nurse Angela Swantek says she complained to investigators about Fata in 2010 . Fata is due back in court on Tuesday for a bond hearing, as federal prosecutors try to keep him behind bars while he awaits trial. For now, Fata's bond has been set at $170,000. Under his current bond conditions, Fata would be subject to home confinement and be required to wear an electronic monitoring anklet 24 hours a day. Additionally, he would not be allowed to practice medicine or prescribe medications. If convicted, Fata faces up to 20 years in jail.","Dr. Farid Fata 'systematically defrauded Medicare by submitting false claims for services that were medically unnecessary,' authorities say .

Oskar Schindler is among documents to be sold at New . Hampshire auction house. The German industrialist's efforts to save Jews . from the Holocaust were made famous in the 1993 Oscar-winning film . 'Schindler's List'. The one-page letter signed by . Schindler was sent from his enamelware factory in Krakow, Poland, where . he employed more than 1,000 Jewish workers from a nearby Nazi . concentration camp. Historical: The letter was sent on behalf of one of Schindler's employees, Adam Dziedzic, who had 'received a clearings contract for unloading and assembling war-necessary machinery . The letter, written in German and . dated Aug. 22, 1944, was sent on behalf of one of Schindler's employees, . Adam Dziedzic, who had 'received a clearings contract for unloading and . assembling war-necessary machinery and has been sent to Sudetengau.' Through bribery and personal connections, Schindler got . permission to produce arms and move the factory and its workers to . Brunnlitz, in Sudetenland, or Sudetengau, in what is now Czech Republic. Schindler had been tipped off in the . summer of 1944 that the Nazis planned to close factories unrelated to . the war effort. Holocaust . historian and Schindler biographer David Crowe said: 'This is the first document I have . seen verifying this move and it is quite important because I thought it . took him much longer to get such permission. 'Most importantly, if Oskar had not gotten such permission, there would have been no Schindler's List.' Permission: A collection of construction plans in German for Oskar Schindler's Krakow munitions factory . Schindler saved lives during World War .

The documents also include a medical . transfer document that underscores Dziedzic's importance to Schindler . and plans for part of Schindler's Krakow munitions factory, the auction . house said. Behind the new building were living quarters for Jewish . workers that served as a safe haven from the nearby Plaszow . concentration camp, it said. 'We've never seen a war-dated . Schindler document,' said Livingston, the auction house vice president. 'It's exceptionally rare, and something of this importance we just never . get.' The quiet savior: Oskar Schindler saving a thousand Jews from the Holocaust only became widely known because of a book and a movie about his actions . The auction ends Aug. 14. By Wednesday afternoon, online bids had reached nearly $21,000. 'Schindler's List' went on sale for $3million last month but failed to get any bids at all. The auction closed on eBay after being up for sale for one week. The document, which was being sold by a private owner in Israel and was only available . for local pick up, is the only copy of the list ever to be sold on the open market. The list is dated April 8, 1945, and has 801 male names on it. David Crowe, a Holocaust historian and . the author of the book, 'Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of His . Life, Wartime Activities, and the True Story Behind the List,' said . the date of the list may be one reason it did not receive any bids. The film was based on the first two . lists ever created, which were from the fall of 1944 - which were called . 'The Lists of Life'. Any lists that came after, including this one, were merely . updates of the original, he said. Crowe said any update of that would not be worth even close to $3million. 'When they say ""Schindler's list"", . it's almost like they are using the romance of the original list and the . magic of that to sell what was prepared at the end of the war. This . list is far less valuable. 'This is not fraudulent,' he said of the effort to place the list on . eBay. 'They certainly do tell the end of the the story, but they don't . illuminate the beginning, so they are less important.' Amid rumors the list wasn't the original, Crowe said even if it was, it still wouldn't be worth $3million. Seller Eric Gazin, the president of Gazin auctions, said he has no plans to reduce the price. 'The value and price of noted . historical documents has been rising the past two years as investors . realize their significance and investment value,' he said.

Tragic: Prisoners at the Buchenwald . concentration camp, one of many across Europe responsible for the . near-extermination of European Jews by the Nazi regime . Explaining that he understands why people believe the list belongs on display in a museum instead of for sale online, Garvin said that many people with collections of ‘fantastic items’ choose to share those items with a greater audience. ‘It would not surprise me if it ends up in a museum… I think that would be fantastic,’ said Garvin. The list originated from German . Industrialist Oskar Schindler. During World War II, Schindler made it . his mission to keep his Jewish employees from oppression and death at . the hands of the Nazis.

A US Army veteran, who was disabled by two explosions while serving in Afghanistan, claims to have been ordered off the boardwalk by a police officer simply for having his service dog with him. Jared Goering was on 26th Street North Wildwood broadwalk in New Jersey with his dog when he was approached by a police officer and ordered to leave the area. Both he and his wife Sally claim they were 'harassed' and 'mocked' by the officer involved, before being issued with a summons. Distressed: Disabled veteran Jared Goering was ordered away for having his service dog Gator with him . Disrespected: Jared Goering claims a police officer harassed him and his wife Sally . Mr Jared, who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan and one in Iraq during his 19 years service between 1993 and 2012, needs his three-year-old service dog Gator - short for Navigator - to get about and up and down stairs. He said: 'Just like any veteran with disabilities . with a service dog, to come back and be harassed and shown no respect, . it upset me - it really bothered me. I was up most of the night thinking . about it. 'I expected to get more respect from him because of the jobs that we both have to do.'

A mother who was involved in a horrific car accident at the age of 14 which left her with 50 broken bones has turned her life around to become a spinning instructor. Gemma Trotter was in a devastating road traffic accident while in Belgium with her family, leaving her with around 50 broken bones including three breaks in her neck, and her left leg completely destroyed. Gemma, now 31, was faced with the decision of being wheelchair bound with a lifeless leg, or getting it amputated and getting a prosthetic. Determination: Gemma Trotter lost her leg in a horrific road accident when she was 14 but didn't let it ruin her life and has now become a spinning instructor . She decided to have an above-knee amputation just before her 16th birthday. Making the decision was extremely tough. But Gemma was strong and didn't let her disability keep her down. She refused to sit inside and mope, as she puts it, and she developed an interest in cars, car racing and, later, fitness. She became a fully qualified fitness instructor and has been teaching for 11 years. Gemma, who currently teaches a tough Les Mills spin-style class called, appropriately, Grit, said: 'I was inspired to teach because of not only my mixed experiences I’d faced from people not understanding my disability but also because I wanted to inspire other amputees to get involved in group fitness as I'd seen the benefits and confidence it had given me. Inspirational: Gemma said she didn't want to sit around and mope about her disability so learnt a new skill and now wants to inspire others to do the same . Passion: After having an above-knee amputation aged 15, Gemma became a fully qualified fitness instructor and has been teaching for eleven years with a new-found passion for spinning . 'In life, we always want to feel good about an achievement and this is no different for me. I have to tailor so many aspects of my life and to have become a Les Mills instructor just like others had was a huge buzz for me. 'I feel like I’ve overcome another hurdle and now can give back to others. 'There aren’t many instructors who have to face the challenges I do. To become qualified was so hard. 'I had to stay so focused to keep practicing that it showed how much I really wanted it. It didn’t just fall into my lap.' One of the classes Gemma teaches is a fast-paced spin session called RPM that burns 675 calories in 45 minutes. And Gemma says that a lot of the class attendees are shocked when they first see that their instructor is missing a leg. Sometimes those attending the class even mistake her for a nervous novice. She said: 'I always wonder how the participants will react to me walking in. Turned her life around: After breaking around fifty bones in her body, Gemma was determined to recover and has now developed a talent for spinning . 'I have been asked before: ""Have you ever done this with your leg?"", before having to explain that I am the instructor and not just a beginner with a false leg.' Gemma, who is married with children, says she always tries to see the positive in life. She explained: 'I embrace being an amputee. Once I had made the decision to have my leg cut off, there was no going back. If you don’t embrace the hand you’ve been dealt then you will always struggle to enjoy life. 'I have a lot to be grateful for and I don’t ever take for granted the ability to walk. I love the fact that I can do so much, but know that a lot of the achievements I’ve made are through sustained effort. 'Keeping as fit and healthy as I can has really helped my recovery. Moving on: Despite setbacks in life, Gemma embraces all she has; she is now married, with children and tries to see the positive in life . 'I haven’t ever achieved anything through moping about or sitting around moaning - that’s for sure!' Gemma is keen to raise awareness and wants her success to inspire others with disabilities to get out there. She said: 'I would love other instructors to be more aware of the capabilities of people with disabilities. 'It didn’t happen overnight but over years I was then able to execute the movements as good as able bodied people. 'Never give up if the going gets tough because this is just adaptation and your body will become stronger. Some encouragement goes a long way.' When asked is if she would ever consider training to enter the Paralympics, Gemma said: 'It's a tricky one for me, because I know that if I entered . the Paralympics I would be accepted as there are hardly any female . competitors. 'I made the choice the steer away from that path because I . want what I do to be relatable to everybody at a grassroots level. 'Anybody can come to my classes, whereas not everybody gets the chance to . go to the Paralympics.'

Two rhinos have survived being drugged while their horns were sawn off using a battery powered hacksaw by poachers. The white rhinoceros, called Bonnie and . Clyde, were darted from the air with a powerful drug which left them . paralysed - but still conscious of what was happening and able to feel . the horrific pain of the entire episode. The poachers escaped with more than 15kg of horn, worth about £160,000. Scroll down for video . Rare white rhinos Bonnie and Clyde survived the attack in which their horns were removed with a hacksaw . If the horns had been removed 1cm closer to their heads then both animals would have bled to death . The pair were set upon at their home in . Schotia Game Park, South Africa, with a drug called M99, which is strong enough to kill a man and left . the rhinos unable to even blink. Keepers said it is the first time they known rhinos to survive such an attack where the horns are separated from their skulls in this way. The incision was done with an amazing . amount of precision and just one cut a centimetre further from the horn . would have seen the rhinos bleed to death. Head ranger Justin Bean said: 'The horns were really cleanly cut off. 'We . believe the poachers used something like a hacksaw with a very thin . blade which then gets rid of forensic evidence. There's not much . shavings or dust left behind. 'Because . we've been monitoring them so well and the police have been so good at . what they're doing, they've had to resort to being this organised and . sophisticated. The animals were darted from the air by poachers who then used a battery powered hacksaw to steal the horns . Bonnie lost her unborn calf after the ordeal and Clyde has been left partially blind and has organ problems . Head ranger Justin Bean (pictured giving medicine) said poachers are becoming more sophisticated . 'They can't just run around hacking horns off, it's not that easy for them anymore so they're coming up with new ideas. 'A . serious change is needed, if it carries on as it is now, within ten . years the species will be extinct. That's the white rhino and the black . rhino - the rhino species will be extinct.' Male rhino, Clyde, has been left partially blind with severe kidney, liver, heart and lung damage as a result of the incident. Bonnie, the female rhino was four months pregnant and the stress of the poaching caused her to miscarry. Both are now recovering with the help of the medical team at the Investec Rhino Project. Investec Rhino vet, Dr William Fowlds, said whoever was involved had advanced knowledge and medical training in rhinoceros anatomy . He said: 'When we were first called to the poaching of these two rhino we found Clyde the bull in a very drugged state. The rhinos were left with scars and cuts to their body after they were butchered by poachers . The rhinos were attacked as they grazed at Schotia Game Park, in South Africa, and are now recovering . 'He was stumbling around but he was able to walk, he seemed to have use of all his legs which was surprising because the particular drugs that were used to poach these animals are very very potent. 'I have never been called to living animals that have had their horns so neatly removed. 'With these syndicates we know that the level of professionalism is very high because of the amount of organisation that goes behind orchestrating a poaching procedure like this.' M99 is a powerful paralysing agent that tricks the host into reacting to an infection of all of the major organs. A darted rhino will produce an extreme amount of white blood cells in a bid to fight the drug. This causes all muscles and blood vessels to become so saturated with white cells that they body locks up and can no longer function. Experts fear this new tactic of shooting M99 from the air could spark a new trend amongst poachers.","The poachers made off with about £160,000 of rhino horn after the attack .

Lisa Parcel, 27, is making the sacrifice for her husband Lee, a diabetes sufferer who has endured ‘nightmare years’ of chronic ill health. Mr Parcel is set to go under the knife for the potentially life-saving operation after his bride was found to be a successful match. Lisa Parcel, 27, is to give her husband Lee, 33, one of her kidneys. Lee is a diabetes sufferer who has endured 'nightmare years' of chronic ill health including developing kidney failure and suffering a stroke . The organ pledge is even more remarkable because Mrs Parcel is petrified of pain. ‘It really is the perfect wedding present,’ said Mr Parcel, from Rhondda, Wales. Mental health nurse, Mrs Parcel, said she was more than prepared to make the sacrifice for her beloved husband. ‘In all honesty, I'm a bit of a wimp - any sort of pain normally scares me,’ she said. ‘But this is different. This operation will benefit both of us as Lee will be able to live a more normal life.’ Now 33, Mr Parcel was diagnosed with stage five kidney failure two years ago after falling ill on holiday in Spain. The couple got married in Cardiff Bay in June and are hoping that the kidney transplant operation will take place in about six months . He was put on emergency dialysis with both kidneys functioning at only five per cent of their full capacity. His . health then took a catastrophic turn for the worse in February 2012 . when he suffered a stroke caused by dangerously high blood pressure. He was put into a medically-induced coma by doctors at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, who later transferred him to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff to see kidney specialists. After learning how to walk again, Mr Parcel recovered and can administer his own blood-filtering dialysis treatment at home. He is now six to nine months away from getting a new kidney. The couple, who had been childhood sweethearts and dated for 13 years, finally tied the knot in June in Cardiff Bay, and now live in Cardiff with their two dogs. ‘It really is the perfect wedding present,’ Mr Parcel said. ‘But this gift isn't anything I can really repay or give back. ‘She is going through all of this for me and I will never be able to show my thanks enough. ‘I will just have to look after it as much as possible.’ Kidneys filter waste products from the blood before converting them to urine. But if they lose this ability then waste products can build up, which is potentially life-threatening. People can function normally with just one working kidney. A seven-year-old girl is finally able to live life to the full after being given one of her mother’s kidneys. Keira Murphy-Johnston can now do things that other children take for granted, such as taking dips in the swimming pool and wolfing down pizza, after the successful organ transplant. When she was born with kidney failure her mother Nikki, 26, from Birmingham, vowed to one day become a donor for her. Keira Murphy-Johnston, seven, was given a new kidney by her mother, Nikki. Keira was born with kidney failure and was dependent upon dialysis for years . ‘Keira's the happiest girl ever,’ she said. ‘When Keira grows up she wants to be a nurse. She said she wants to help everyone else and teach them to be brave and not be scared. It breaks my heart.’ Keira started school in September, 2010, just three months after undergoing the four-hour surgery at Birmingham Children's Hospital. Without the operation Keira would have only been able to attend school two days a week, her mother believes.

Commons Speaker John Bercow is planning to stand down after the next Election – paving the way for a sensational return to Parliament by Boris Johnson. Mr Bercow has told the local Conservative Party association in Buckingham that he will resign as Speaker in the middle of the next Parliament. It means there will be a by-election in the ultra-safe Tory seat just over a year after Mr Johnson completes his second term as London Mayor. Transition: Sources have confirmed that Boris Johnson is being lined up to take Commons Speaker John Bercow's Buckingham seat during the next election . High-level sources have told The Mail on Sunday Boris is already being identified by local party grandees as Mr Bercow’s ideal successor – and that the Speaker is ‘privately inclined’ to be ‘helpful’ to the Mayor. They added the constituency would select Mr Johnson ‘in about ten seconds flat’. The news is likely to be greeted with groans in No 10, which had hoped that the Boris leadership bandwagon was running out of steam. Mr Johnson recently reassured David Cameron’s circle that he will not seek to return to the  Commons in a by-election before 2015, and nor would he stand in that year’s General Election. But the No 10 aides were left with the impression he would start plotting his Westminster comeback shortly afterwards. Mr Bercow’s decision stems from a promise, made to the constituency association when he became Speaker in 2009, that he would serve a maximum of nine years before stepping down and allowing a return to ‘normal politics’ in Buckingham. By tradition, a Commons Speaker stands for Parliament as an independent and is unopposed by the main parties. Last night, the Speaker’s office confirmed Mr Bercow’s pledge, meaning Mr Johnson could be campaigning on the stump in Buckingham by the end of 2017. True blue: Buckingham is a rock solid Tory seat which had a whopping 18,000 Conservative majority last time it was openly contested . It is a plum seat. At the last openly contested Election in 2005, Mr Bercow won with a whopping majority of more than 18,000. It is an hour’s drive from London, where Mr Johnson has his family home, and directly adjacent to his former Henley constituency. Mr Johnson, whose ambition to become party leader and Prime Minister remains undimmed, is reluctant to serve for an extended period under Mr Cameron. Boris aides now suggest that the master plan is for him to serve out his full Mayoral term until May 2016, enabling him to keep the ‘solemn vow’ he made to Londoners to not combine the mayoralty with ‘any other political capacity’. He would then spend 12 to 18 months building up a campaign war chest, through writing, public speaking and media appearances, before standing in a rock-solid seat. By that point, his advisers expect Mr Cameron to either be struggling with a small Tory majority or confined to a second term of Coalition – or to have resigned after losing narrowly to Ed Miliband in 2015. Until now, it had been expected that Boris would return to the Commons by persuading a ‘stooge’ MP to stand aside for him. Mr Bercow’s plans remove that need. Last night, a Commons source said: ‘John has organised his  personal life around this pledge, but only a few people in the know have realised. He will publicly reiterate it in his 2015 “manifesto” for Buckingham. ‘It means it is one of the longest-signalled by-elections in recent political history. He and Boris get on well, so John would be inclined to be helpful in terms of the precise timing of his departure.’ The source added: ‘The activists in his patch are keen on the idea.’ A spokesman for Mr Bercow said: ‘Mr Speaker has previously indicated he wouldn’t expect to do more than nine years’. He added that Mr Bercow and Mr Johnson had not discussed the issue. Buckingham Conservative Association declined to comment. Mr Johnson’s office did not respond to messages.","John Bercow to resign Buckingham seat in the middle of next Parliament .

Scotland Yard could lose its £31 million-a-year contract protecting MPs and peers to a ‘cheaper’ outside security firm. The radical move would see traditional uniformed ‘bobbies’ inside the Palace of Westminster replaced by private staff from a company such as G4S. The plans come as MPs fight to cut the Commons’ £200 million-plus annual budget and find ways of making money out of the historic building – including hiring it out as a film set. Expensive: Scotland Yard could lose its £31million a year contract protecting Parliament to a cheaper contractor . However, that idea and the proposal to ‘privatise’ Westminster’s policing sparked a ferocious backlash from some MPs. There were fears of a repeat of the security fiasco of the 2012 Olympics when G4S was unable to provide 10,400 security guards on time. Officials in both the Commons and the Lords have embarked on cost-cutting programmes,  with the policing contract, traditionally provided by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), which runs out in 2015,  in the line of fire. Last year, MPs heard complaints that although the Met had 500 personnel at Westminster, only 20 or 30 were visible at any one time. Now official documents reveal that a review into the contract,  led by parliamentary security director Paul Martin, is exploring ‘all options’ – including ‘outsourcing’ some of the service currently provided by the Met. Olympics contract: Private security guards from G4S secure the entrance to Alexander Stadium, the US athletics team training camp for the London 2012 Olympic Games . A well-placed source said: ‘Many of the security staff in here are not fully-fledged bobbies anyway, even though they’re provided by the Met.  We could potentially save some money by letting a private company provide those.’ But senior Labour MP Barry Sheerman said: ‘After what happened at last year’s Olympics, it beggars belief we’re even considering letting a private firm look after the security of one of the most sensitive sites in the UK.’ Mr Sheerman, former chairman of the Commons education committee, also condemned the ‘over-commercialisation’ of the Palaces. He said: ‘This is the historic Palace of Westminster where the nation’s laws are debated and made. It’s not some Disneyland theme park by the Thames.’ Last night, a Commons spokesman said: ‘No decisions are expected to be taken until next year.’","Officials could replace Scotland Yard with cheaper security firm such as G4S .

Victor Conte, of all people, is now helping Major League Baseball in its fight against Alex Rodriguez. A-Rod sought the steroid guru last year in a hush-hush meeting set up by a former steroid-using football star, according to a report in Sunday’s New York Daily News. In addition to speaking with the Yankees third baseman, Conte said he also spoke several times with Anthony Bosch, a key figure in the Biogenesis steroid scandal. Rodriguez told Conte that Bosch was his ‘nutrition guy,’ according to the report. Turncoat: Victor Conte went from being a notorious PED peddler to being an anti-PED advocate . Conte infamously served four months in prison for heading a massive doping ring that involved professional athletes across multiple sports and gold medal Olympians out of his BALCO offices in San Francisco. Conte admitted supplying steroids to a litany of big name stars such as home run king Barry Bonds, former Yankees first baseman Jason Giambi, gold medal sprinter Marion Jones and former NFL linebacker Bill Romanowski, among others. The ex-con spilled all the details on his dealings with A-Rod during a meeting last week with investigators. Romanowski, a prolific steroid user during his time with the Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos, brought Rodriguez uninvited to Conte’s office in May 2012 when the Yankees were in town for a series against the Oakland A’s, the Daily News reported. The aging slugger met with the steroid guru to discuss ‘legal products that could give Rodriguez an edge,’ the paper reported Conte told investigators. After the meeting Conte is said to have dealt with Bosch, the accused ringleader of the Biogensis steroid ring that has resulted in MLB Commissioner Bud Selig handing down a total of 15 PED suspensions. Pumped up: Bill Romanowski, who organized the meeting between Conte and A-Rod, was a notorious steroid user during his NFL career . ‘I flushed it out with Romo before they ever showed up at the office,’ Conte said. ‘I clearly told Romo it (anything he could do for Rodriguez) was about legal performance enhancement.’ The summit happened at Conte’s new digs, Scientific Nutrition for Advance Conditioning (SNAC), after Romanowki called to say he was with A-Rod and five minutes away, the paper reported Conte telling officials. Despite not entering until Romanowski confirmed the office was empty, Conte told authorities Rodriguez never once asked about illegal PEDs during the 45 minute meeting, the paper said. The meeting resulted in A-Rod receiving a few shipments of legal over the counter supplements, including a protein that ‘promotes overnight healing of the little muscle tears that are the result of working out,’ according to the Daily News. Conte is not under suspicion or investigation for any wrongdoing, but by shedding light on Rodriguez’s inner circle he may have given MLB more ammunition in its fight against the brazen ballplayer. First of the season: Alex Rodriguez follows through on a solo home run Sunday against the Detroit Tigers . Rodriguez has steadfastly denied that he was a patient of Bosch since the two were first linked in January. Bosch ran Biogenesis, the south Florida anti-aging clinic at the center of the latest major sports doping ring. ‘The news report about a purported relationship between Alex Rodriguez and Anthony Bosch are not true. Alex Rodriguez was not Mr. Bosch's patient, he was never treated by him and he was never advised by him. The purported documents referenced in the story -- at least as they relate to Alex Rodriguez -- are not legitimate,’ a spokesperson for A-Rod asserted after a weekly newspaper in Miami made public documents that showed evidence of doping and payments between Bosch and several ballplayers including Rodriguez, suspended Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun and others. Kingpin: Anthony Bosch is accused of operating a major steroid distribution ring out of his Biogenesis anti-aging clinic near Miami . Conte told investigators that Bosch was deeply entrenched in Rodriguez’s training regimen and that he spoke to his alleged second-coming over the phone at least twice last summer, reported the Daily News. By proving Bosch was part of A-Rod’s inner-circle, even as it related to his legal supplement intake, MLB is one step closer to verifying evidence it can use when Rodriguez’s appeal is heard next month by an arbitrator. Since admitting his crime and serving time in prison, Conte has become an anti-PED crusader warning MLB for years that athletes are still doping - that investigators had a sit-down about Rodriguez with the reformed PED peddler shows the lengths the league is willing to go to rid itself of the caustic Yankee. Rodriguez, allowed to play until his appeal is heard, hit his first home run of the season Sunday.","Victor Conte spilled the details of his dealings with A-Rod during a meeting with league investigators last week .

Chefs have warned that Britons are storing too much in the chiller after a survey found that we are keeping things like nail varnish and paint in the fridge . It is undoubtedly the best place to keep milk to stop it going sour and you wouldn't want to tuck into a slice of ham if it had been left out in the warmth of the kitchen for too long. But many homeowners are taking to storing more than just dairy products and meat in the fridge. A survey by fridge manufacturers Sharp has found that Britons are becoming obsessed with storing items in the fridge that simply don't need to be there, including nail varnish and paint. Researchers asked 4,000 homeowners what they keep in their fridge and found that a staggering 26 per cent are storing medicines there. More bizarrely still, six per cent store glue alongside their milk and butter, with a further three per cent keeping nail varnish there and one per cent using the storage space for batteries. As well as some rather outlandish products being kept in the chiller, Britons are keeping slightly less obvious food stuffs that needn't be kept cool in the fridge and may even damage their shelf lives. According to top chef Raymond Blanc, storing certain vegetables, fruits and grocery goods can be detrimental to their taste. He told The Times: 'People keep far too much in their fridge, and it is normally a complete mess. 'They've got into the habit of refrigerating absolutely everything when often there is simply no need. Bizarre: More people are keeping things like paint and nail varnish in the fridge . 'We assume a product is always better kept chilled than at ambient temperature, and in the case of protein and dairy that is true, but there are many products that are better kept out.' According to Blanc, tomatoes shouldn't . be chilled because it spoils their flavour by damaging the membranes in . the fruit's walls. Similarly, citrus fruits shrivel and go tough and potatoes taste is spoiled as their starch turns to sugar. Although Blanc recommends keeping soft herbs and spinach, both liable to wilt, in the fridge, root vegetables like carrots are best kept in a cool part of the kitchen. Warning: TV chef Raymond Blanc gave his advice on what should be kept cool and what shouldn't . Damages the taste: The flavour of tomatoes can be impaired if they are kept in the fridge . Overcrowding a fridge also leads to more food being wasted, says Irish chef Richard Corrigan, who puts it down to laziness - people are buying too much in one go. Angela Hartnett, head chef at west London's Michelin-starred Murano restaurant  said that her fridge contains things like jams and chutneys - products that have enough sugar in them to act as natural preservatives. She believes that part of the problem is manufacturer's over-cautious advice and our obsession with use-by dates. Not to be chilled: Lemons are better off kept out of the fridge . Top chefs have said that we risk damaging the shelf life and quality of some of our foods by keeping them in the fridge. So what is more at home in the cupboard than the chiller?","A survey by Sharp found that Britons are storing bizarre items in the fridge .

Funny: A girl who had her phone stolen while on holiday is able to see all of the photographs taken by the man who now has it - every time he takes a picture with her phone they upload onto her computer. This is Hafid, the man who has the girl's phone . Silly: One of the earliest pics posted by Hafid was this one of him on a beach in Dubai - with the burj khalifa, the tallest building in the world, in the background . Curious: Hafid clearly enjoys visiting new locations and getting friends to take pictures of him . The pictures were taken from a smartphone which was stolen from a beach . in Ibiza. The man who now has the phone has used it to take dozens of pictures of himself - . completely unaware that every single one is automatically uploaded onto the owner's computer. The unnamed girl has now started a blog in which she uploads every picture the man takes, with hilarious results. Pictures show the man - called Hafid - posing in various locations around Dubai, often taking extraordinary selfies of himself. One picture shows him posing on a beach beside the tallest building in the world while another has him in front of a mosque with friends. There is no evidence to suggest that Hafid stole the phone or knows that the phone is stolen. The girl managed to find out Hafid's name when he entered her Facebook account using her phone and sent her a personal message from his own account. Writing on her blog, the girl said she was on a beach in Ibiza with four friends when her phone was taken. She wrote: 'We found ourselves hopelessly drunk and naked in the sea. We put our stuff on a deck chair 10m away. Poser: Hafid clearly likes this car and decided to have his picture taken next to it . Happy: Hafid relaxes with a pot of tea . Chilled: Sat on a piece of grass, Hafid appears relaxed, completely unaware that his pictures are being sent to the phone's owner . 'When I ran back to the deck chair to get rid of my underpants, I noticed someone lying stiffly under the chair, not moving, not reacting.' After thinking that it was her friend, she went back to swimming with her friends in the sea. However, she later realised it was not her friend but the phone thief, who proceeded to steal all of their belongings.'We tumbled out of the water quite irritated. Everything was gone. Money, purses, smartphones, passports, birthday presents and clothes.

Playful: Through the pictures, Hafid manages to show that he does have a sense of humour . 'Apparently some guys with night-vision glasses hid in the dunes, waiting for drunk tourists to leave their belongings somewhere unobserved. Then they crawled through the sand, stole the stuff and walked away like nothing happened.' It was four months after the holiday that the girl turned on her computer and noticed fifteen new pictures inside her camera upload folder. Every time a photograph is taken on her smartphone , it is automatically uploaded onto her computer. Other photographs taken by Hafid show the inside of his apartment and pictures of his friends as well as images of food which he has just eaten.","Girl had phone stolen while she swam in the sea in Ibiza .

A mother says she feels like a monster after a bungled £4,000 dental procedure left her totally toothless. Gabriela Andrews, 48, now has just a few jagged bones for teeth and faces a bill for more than £15,000 to repair her smile. But she has been left powerless to get compensation for the botched treatment because the private dentist who gave her dental implants in Cornwall in January 2010 has since moved to Poland and been struck off. Devastation: Gabriella Andrews says her confidence has been destroyed since a dentist left her looking 'like a monster' following botched operation to dental implants . She said: ‘I have been left looking like a monster.  I’m embarrassed when I talk. ‘I feel like people are staring at me. My confidence has been affected, my speech has been affected, I can’t eat solid food and nobody does you justice. ‘To be left like this, you can’t believe it can happen in this country. There’s nothing I can do. I have a mortgage to pay and bills. I cannot afford to fix this. I don’t want other people to fall in to this situation.’ The work had been undertaken by self-employed dentist Piotr Tadeusz Reichel. Dr Reichel’s licence to practise has been suspended by the General Dental Council ‘for protection of the public and in the public interest’ - in relation to care of several patients. Gabriela, from Keysham, Devon, said: ‘I went back to the clinic but they said the dentist is self-employed and it’s his responsibility, his insurance will pay. Anger: A legal loophole has left the mother of one unable to get compensation to help meet the £15,000 bill to repair her damaged teeth . ‘Then you go backwards and forwards, investigating and investigating.’ A letter from Gabriela’s lawyers last year stated they are unable to pursue her case due to Dr Reichel’s indemnity status. It stated that although Dr Reichel had insurance at the time of the treatment ‘the policy was not adequate to cover claims made after the relevant insurance period had expired’. They said she would have to enforce any judgement against him in Poland, which was unlikely to be successful. The mother of one from Plymouth, Devon, claims dozens of other people may also be victims of this legal loophole. Gabriela, who works as an area manager for a holiday home cleaning company, has been fighting for two years for the money to put things right. She is among campaigners calling for immediate change to laws which can leave patients powerless if dentists have no insurance, move abroad or refuse to contact their insurers. Gabriela opted for private treatment because she thought it would be the cheapest option after spending years saving the £4,125 needed for dental implants. Fight: Gabriela is calling for immediate change to laws to help patients get compensation if dentists have no insurance, move abroad or refuse to contact their insurers . She had previously had her upper teeth removed due to chronic root-canal infections because of an underlying health condition. A denture in her lower jaw was also failing. She had the dental implants - four metal rods in her upper gum. A bridge of teeth was to be attached at a later date. The procedure failed and Gabriela also lost her lower denture. Gabriela is backing national campaign ‘Bridge the Gap’, launched by the Dental Law Partnership, which calls for changes in the law. She has approached MP Oliver Colvile who has written to Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley about the issue. Mr Colvile, MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said: ‘I’m horrified by what has happened to Gabriela and am very supportive of her case. ‘We have got to try and close this legal loophole because people rightly expect when they go to a dentist, to be treated properly.’ Gabriela’s work was carried out at the Tamar Valley Dental Clinic in Kelly Bray near Callington. Darren Gardiner, of Tamar Valley Dental Clinic, said Dr Reichel was self-employed and money would have to come through his insurers. He said: ‘We are sympathetic towards her plight and emphasise the real need for a change in law in this country regarding indemnity insurance.’ He said since Dr Reichel returned to Poland in May 2010 he has not replied to contact from the clinic, his indemnity insurers, the Dental Defence Union, DDU, or the General Dental Council, GDC. He said the clinic is absolutely disgusted with the indemnity insurer’s stance and believe the GDC should apply more pressure. A GDC spokeswoman said that Dr Reichel has been struck off the GDC’s register so he cannot work legally in the UK. A misconduct hearing found ‘wide-ranging failings of Mr Reichel’s practice including the planning and execution of treatment, aftercare, a failure to obtain informed consent and failings in the manner in which he has dealt with complaints and enquiries as to his indemnity cover’. The spokeswoman said: ‘While we are sympathetic to the situation Gabriela finds herself in, it is important to note that we do not have the powers to award compensation - that is a matter for the courts - nor do we have powers to make insurance providers co-operate with solicitors.’ A DDU spokesperson said they were unable to comment about individual cases or the issue in general. The Department of Health has said it aims to have a consultation on indemnity cover for all health professionals in the autumn, and it is likely that legislation will be amended.","Gabriela Andrews, 48, was left with a few jagged bones for teeth after bungled dental implant operation .

Towering 360ft above the Atlantic on the west coast of Country Clare, Ireland's Cliffs of Moher attract more than 860,000 visitors every year. But in February, those visitors included a pair of French hitchhikers who chose to use their time at the Cliffs to create an 8ft tall mural on the rock near the spectacular Hag's Head. The pair, who call themselves 'Mama' and 'Dirty Edoir', then uploaded a short film of them defacing the beauty spot on Vimeo. According to the video, the duo are . part of a group called Dirty EST, an arts collective based in Paris who . focus on graffiti, painting, urban photography, sculpture and short . film. And not content with spray-painting the Cliffs of Moher, the pair then went on to deface other sites in Galway and Dublin. 'The Burren and Cliffs of Moher . Geopark have a Leave No Trace policy and would strongly encourage all . visitors to support this,' geologist Dr Eamon Doyle, told the BBC in the . wake of the visit from the French pair. 'As geologist for the Burren and . Cliffs of Moher Geopark, my main concern is that this graffiti will lead . to other copycat graffiti in more public and vulnerable areas and will . detract from the much more important story that lies within the rocks.'

THE MAN WHO MUNCHED AN ENDANGERED SQUID . Nothing beats a spot of fishing while on holiday but American tourist, Labros Hydras, found himself with more on his plate than he expected white on holiday in Greece. During a snorkelling trip, Hydras unearthed a rare 'hexapus' - an extremely rare octopus with just six tentacles - but despite suspecting it might be something special, killed it and whisked it off to be cooked in a beachside taverna. The hexapus killed by Mr Hydras was only the second ever discovered - a fact Mr Hydras only found out when he returned home and asked a marine biologist friend.

A repentant Mr Hydras said: ‘It . tasted just like a normal octopus but now I feel really bad. When we . caught it, there was nothing to suggest it was any different or had been . damaged. 'I thought it had been born with six . tentacles. We go to Greece every year and when we catch an octopus, we . do the same thing so we just did not think about it. 'I wanted to find out more, but there . was no internet where we were. I then called my friend who is a . biologist and he told me it was true and I was horrified.' THE CALLOUS MEN WHO MANHANDLED A DYING DOLPHIN . For the majority of travellers, just catching a glimpse of a dolphin is thrill enough. But it would seem that not everyone agrees. When a dolphin was hit by a boat and washed towards the shore in the Hainan province of China, far from attempting to help the stricken animal, a group of tourists decided to pose with it instead. The dying creature was lifted up and manhandled, while the male travellers pulled muscleman poses around it. When it finally died, reports in the local Shanghai Daily revealed that it had perished from 'excessive bleeding' - not helped by the antics of the men.

U.S. officials are warning that a global terror threat from al Qaeda is 'very specific' and could last through August, as at least 22 embassies and consulates across the world prepare to shut down Sunday in fear of a possible attack. 'We’re . not certain exactly where something might happen but it’s very specific . as to when and it’s also very specific as to the fact that it is going . to happen, so we have to be on alert everywhere,'  Rep. Peter King, chairman of the . subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, told WINS-AM. He said the threat is the 'most specific' he's seen since the 9/11 attacks. 'There's very little doubt that something serious is being planned,' King told CNN. 'It's a potential series of attacks. It could be anywhere.' The U.S. issued a global travel alert for American travelers on Friday after intercepting electronic communication among top al Qaeda operatives in Yemen regarding an attack in its final planning stages. The al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen has been linked to plots to blow up American-bound cargo and commercial flights, according to the New York Times. If traveling outside the U.S., King said: 'I would let the . American embassy know where you are. Basically check in and where you . are and how long you plan to stay there and what your itinerary is.' State Department officials said Thursday that they were taking action out of an 'abundance of caution' after receiving information the terror group was in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack.

The U.S. State Department, based at the White House, Washington (pictured), has instructed its embassies and consulates in the Muslim word that would normally be open on Sunday to close this weekend amid reports of an unspecified threat . The terror group and its affiliates . 'may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the . end of August,' the State Department said. Spokeswoman Marie Harf cited information indicating a threat to U.S. facilities overseas and said some diplomatic facilities may stay closed . for more than a day. A source told CNN the preparations appeared to have increased in . recent days with the approaching end of the Muslim holy month of . Ramadan. A U.S. official noted it was unclear whether the plot . would be directed at a target inside Yemen or elsewhere. Those officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The British embassy in Yemen is to be closed on Sunday and Monday as 'a precautionary measure', the Foreign Office confirmed today. On the heels of the American foreign travel alert, Interpol has issued a global security alert in connection with suspected al-Qaida involvement in several recent prison escapes including those in Iraq, Libya and Pakistan. The Lyon, France-based international police agency said Saturday that the alert follows 'the escape of hundreds of terrorists and other criminals' from prisons in the past month. The alert calls on Interpol’s 190 member countries to help determine whether these events are coordinated or linked, the organization said.

The United States is locking down its . embassies and consulates throughout the Muslim world on Sunday after . receiving an unspecified threat, officials said. Quoted by ABC News, one official said the closures were a response to a 'specific threat against a U.S. embassy or consulate,' described as a 'concerted effort' to target an embassy or consulate in a Muslim country. The U.S. Embassy in Amman (pictured), the capital of Jordan, is among those which will close from Sunday as a 'precaution' following a reported terrorist threat .

The official also said that 'there could be other targets, not just embassies'. According to the news service, 28 U.S. installations will close Sunday, including  offices in Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. The threat comes close to a year after four American consulate workers in Libya were killed in a night time arson attack.

The administration no longer says that attack was related to the demonstrations. The mass closure of U.S. embassies and consulates across the MENA region also comes almost 15 years ago to the day that hundreds of people were killed in simultaneous terrorist attacks, conducted by al Qaeda, on U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam. In Dar es Salaam, 10 Tanzanians were killed and more than 85 Americans and Tanzanians were injured. The blast at the U.S. embassy in Nairobi killed at least 212 people and wounded an estimated 4,000. In his recent visit to Africa, U.S. President Barack Obama paid his respects to those who lost their lives in the attacks.

One of Afghanistan’s first woman MPs today revealed that she is no longer welcome in her own home, after escaping an abusive husband and a family who disowned her. Noor Zia Atmar, 40, who was a politician from 2005 to 2010 but now lives in a shelter, added that progress in the country’s gender equality rights is falling apart as Western forces withdraw. It comes after she served in the country’s first parliament following the Taliban's downfall - and got important legislation pushed through that banned more than 20 acts of violence against women. Concerns: Noor Zia Atmar, 40, who was a politician from 2005 to 2010, now lives in a home for abused women after escaping from a husband who beat her and a family who disowned her after she divorced him . But she told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘Women are in a worse condition now. Every day they are being killed, having their ears, noses cut. It is not just women in villages - it is also people like me.’ Elections came in 2005 after the U.S. helped the country draft a new constitution which guaranteed big steps towards and gender equality - and that a quarter of the seats would be for women. Miss Atmar carried out a strong campaign on a small budget - even selling a gold necklace to help - and was a much-praised member of parliament, making trips to India, France, Turkey and Britain. Nato’s efforts to secure Afghanistan over the past 12 years have led to more girls entering education and making women more heard in the country - as well as a lowering of maternal mortality rates. But the conservative society appears to be fighting back. It hopes women’s shelters will be closed, and the electoral law over women having at least a quarter of the seats has already been revised. Voting: Afghan women line up as they wait to cast their ballots inside a polling centre in Kabul in August 2009. Elections also came in 2005 after the U.S. helped the country draft a new constitution . And attempts to approve a law drafted by Miss Atmar and others that set penalties for rape and child marriage - but was never ratified by parliament - were called off amid claims it was ‘un-Islamic’. As Miss Atmar’s term came to an end she failed to win re-election and married a businessman, who was unimpressed by her campaign for women’s rights and refused to let her leave the house. 'Women are in a worse condition now. Every day they are being killed, having their ears, noses cut' Noor Zia Atmar, former Afghanistan MP . She told the newspaper: ‘He would get drunk and demand I remove his shoes. Then he would shout at me to put them back on, over and over. If I refused he would beat me. It was torture.’ Miss Atmar said that he once even banned her from using the phone - and that eventually she asked for a divorce. But, as would be expected in the society, her family severely frowned upon this. ‘They saw my face bruised, and scars from the knife - but they told me it was a traditional society, that I would bring shame on the family,’ she told the Sunday Telegraph. They eventually abandoned her when she tried to get a lawyer, and she went to a shelter. Miss Atmar  contacted the British Embassy, but was told domestic abuse victims were not able to claim asylum.","Noor Zia Atmar, 40, was a politician in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2010 .

A father-of-three diagnosed with leukemia was denied his life-saving health coverage after his wife accidentally missed 26 cents off their payment, the couple have revealed. Sergio Branco, 33, from Edison, New Jersey, has been battling his insurance company after it refused to give him coverage for a bone marrow transplant even when he offered to send the extra change to correct the oversight. The company only backed down when attorneys and the media heard about the case. The spat came after Branco was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia - which can kill within months or weeks - and took three months off from his truck driving job under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to start chemotherapy and transfusions, NJ.com reported. Battle: Sergio Branco, who has leukemia, was denied health insurance coverage for a life-saving operation after his wife Mara, right, accidentally missed off 26 cents from their payment . Doctors said a $500,000 bone marrow transplant would prolong his life, which Branco knew his company insurance would cover. But after three months, the FMLA time expired and his company, Russell Reid, fired him. He . promptly applied for health insurance coverage through the Consolidated . Omnibus Reconciliation Act (COBRA), which allows a fired worker to keep . the same health insurance he had while he was working, but requires him . to pay the full premium. Branco's . wife, Mara, called Paychex, which was handling COBRA for the company, . to ask about the premium for Sergio and she was told it would cost . $518.26. Fight: Branco, who has three children, was fired from his job after taking three months off to begin his treatment and had to file for a special type of insurance for employees made redundant . Treatment: He needed the coverage for a $500,000 bone marrow transplant that will extend his life . But when it came to filling out the check, she mistakenly wrote $518 - missing off the 26 cents. Paychex cashed the check nearly three weeks later and Branco continued to receive treatment. But weeks later, in June, his hospital said the insurance coverage had been terminated. Paychex said that the payment had been 26 cents short and that the company had been instructed by Russell Reid not to accept any more payments from the family, Mrs Branco said. She called Russell Reid, Paychex and the U.S. Department of Labor, but neither would help. 'There's nothing to comment on at this point,' Russell Reid's human resources representative Rich Gross told NJ.com. 'We’re still trying to figure it out.' Coverage: Paychex refused to accept a further payment of 26 cents to cover the difference . Sergio Branco's doctor also pleaded for help on their behalf by writing a letter to the companies. He wrote that Mr Branco 'will most certainly die in the very near future if he does not proceed to transplant; therefore I am writing to request that every effort be made to reinstate his health care insurance coverage'. Again, nothing happened. The Brancos hired an attorney, Jeffrey . Resnick, who went to court last week where he claimed that Branco . should have been notified about the 26 cents before his coverage was . terminated. He added that the law also states that health coverage cannot be terminated for 'non-payment of a de minimis amount', and that the mistake was innocently made as Mara was juggling two young children, a teenager and a very ill husband. Support: But Branco, pictured center with relatives, battled the company with attorneys and media coverage and now the health insurance has been reinstated, so he can undergo the bone marrow transplant . And after the New Jersey Ledger contacted the company, it said it is working on getting the coverage back. 'Paychex is working diligently with our client and other appropriate parties right now to reinstate Mr. Branco’s coverage,' said spokeswoman Laura Saxby Lynch. 'We are very ardently working on the situation with all parties including the carrier, and the decision ultimately rests with the carrier.' Mrs Branco added that the Department of Labor said the insurance would be reinstated. 'They said the company did it wrong,' she said. 'I am super happy. It’s like a weight has lifted off my shoulder. It’s better than winning the lottery.'","Sergio Branco, 33, diagnosed in January with acute myeloid leukemia - which can kill within weeks or months .

The FBI believe Israel Keyes, who killed himself in his Alaska jail cell, murdered 11 people . An Alaskan serial killer who committed suicide in his jail cell last year is now believed to have killed 11 people, the FBI said yesterday. Officials released an updated timeline of travels and crimes Israel Keyes, which sheds new light on a case that left a trail of unsolved killings around the U.S. FBI spokesman Eric Gonzalez said they hope the information will help identify victims who remain unknown and provide some closure to their families. 'We've exhausted all our investigative leads,' Gonzalez said. The FBI documents said Keyes frequented prostitutes during his travels and killed an unidentified couple in Washington state sometime between July 2001 and 2005. The FBI said yesterday that Keyes is believed to have killed 11 people, all strangers. Previous reports had estimated he had killed eight people across the country. Keyes also told investigators he committed two separate murders between 2005 and 2006, disposing of at least one of the bodies in Lake Crescent, near Port Angeles, Washington. When he killed himself in jail, the 34-year-old Keyes was awaiting a federal trial in the rape and strangulation murder of Samantha Koenig, 18. She had been abducted in February 2012 from the Anchorage coffee stand where she worked. Keyes confessed to killing Koenig and at least seven others around the country, including Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex, Vermont, in 2011. The murderer told investigators his victims were male and female, and that the murders occurred in fewer than 10 states, but he did not reveal all locations. Koenig and the Curriers were the only victims named by Keyes because he knew authorities had tied him to their deaths. Keyes killed himself while he awaited trial for the abduction, rape and murder of Samantha Koenig (pictured) Video surveillance captures moment Keyes approached Koenig in the coffee shop and abducted her . Bill and Lorraine Currier were the only other people Keyes specifically admitted to murdering . Keyes told investigators that only . one other body - other than Koenig - had ever been recovered but that . victim's death was ruled as accidental. The bodies of the Curriers were . never found. The FBI said Keyes admitted frequenting prostitutes, but it's unknown if Keyes met any of his victims this way. Officials said Keyes told them he robbed several banks to fund his travels along with money he made as a general contractor. The father-of-one also told authorities he broke into as many as 30 homes throughout the country, and he talked about covering up a homicide through arson. The timeline begins in summer of 1997 or 1998, when Keyes abducted a teenage girl while she and friends were tubing on the Deschutes River, he told investigators. The FBI said Keyes was living in Maupin, Oregon, at the time, and the abduction is believed to have occurred near that area. The FBI said Keyes lived in Neah Bay, Washington in 2001 after he was discharged from the Army. The timeline states that Keyes committed his first homicide while living in the area. The identity of the victim is not known, and neither is the location of the murder. Keyes moved to Anchorage in 2007, but continued to travel extensively outside the state. FBI say Keyes killed his first victim in Neah Bay, Washington, in 2001 after being discharged from the Army . After killing Koenig, Keyes flew to New Orleans where he went on a cruise. He left Koenig's body in a shed outside his Anchorage home for two weeks, according to the FBI. After the cruise, Keyes drove to Texas. The FBI said that during this time, Keyes may have been responsible for a homicide in Texas or a nearby state — a crime Keyes denied. He was arrested in Lufkin, Texas, about six weeks after Koenig's disappearance. Keyes had sought a ransom and used Koenig's debit card. Three weeks after the arrest, Koenig's dismembered body was found in a frozen lake north of Anchorage. The FBI said Keyes also traveled internationally, but it's unknown if he killed anyone outside the U.S. In December last year, Keyes was found dead after slashing his wrists with a razor blade. After his death the Alaska Department of Corrections admitted a blade was mistakenly issued to  in . his jail cell allowing him commit suicide. The razor was never found.","Israel Keyes committed suicide with razor in prison cell last year .

Revelations: Carla Bruni was interviewed by Tania Bryer for U.S. TV show 'CNBC Meets...' Insight: The model turned musician revealed how her family's life has changed since her husband lost power . But Carla, who has a son, Aurelien, 11, from a previous relationship with the French philosopher Raphael Enthoven, said she just knew it was 'a match'. In the interview that will air on Wednesday night, she said: 'It was love at first sight. I must say, we left the dinner party together. People were like... (laughs) and we got married three months after.' Speaking about what attracted her to the 58-year-old, who has three sons from his previous relationships, she said: 'I don't know, his intelligence, his charisma, his kindness, his way of talking.' Love at first sight: The wife and mother spoke of her whirlwind romance with Nicolas Sarkozy . She added: 'What is it about someone we love? It's hard to tell, I can see how many qualities he has but, is love coming from that? No. I think it's a match, so you know. It's a sparkle. I think it's a mystery.' During his reign as president, Carla gave birth to their daughter, Giulia in October 2011. She said as a result it was a 'relief' when her husband then lost the 2012 election to Francois Hollande. She said: 'I was very happy to leave and I . was very happy to spend five years at Elysee. I was also relieved . because my man is so much like a hundred percent person. I thought . he might get a little rest and go back to a normal . life, have more time for the children. 'One of his children already has . children themselves so my husband is a grandfather so now it's . like a really nice family life. I must say it's nice because the . pressure goes off and that's really pleasant.' Leaving office: While she enjoyed being France's first lady, Carla said it was a relief when her husband wasn't re-elected last year . The pressure being off has allowed Carla to return to modelling - recently posing in a campaign for Bulgari - and further her music career. This summer she released her fourth self-penned studio album - Little French Songs. She said she gets her inspiration 'from life' and confessed that one number on the album is a love song for her husband, even though she didn't name it after him. She explained of the song 'Mon Raymond': 'Of course (my husband) he's not called . Raymond, he's called Nicolas, but I thought Raymond is a good name. It's very old fashioned, it's very French. The real Raymond: Carla told Tania who her love song is really about . 'I said ""I make a song about . you called Raymond, you don't mind?"" He said, ""non""  and then sometimes I . call him Raymond for fun!' She added: 'It's just a love song. Describing him - how I see him how I feel about him. It's funny . because he's been such a public person and so this song is maybe a . little bit of a private eye on him.'  CNBC Meets Carla Bruni will air on CNBC on 14 August at 10pm .","The model turned musician was interviewed on 'CNBC Meets...'

And no, that isn't sour grapes - it's according to Le Figaro, a French magazine. Our continental neighbours are lauded are as effortlessly chic, slim and poised in British and American books such as French Women Don't Get Fat by Mireille Guiliano and Pamela Druckerman's Bringing Up Bébé. But, to the relief of many, new research by one of their compatriots reveals that it may all be a myth. French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg attends a premiere in New York City . Journalist Peggy Frey has dissected the 'six vanity clichés' pertaining to French women in Le Figaro, magazine. The idea that they are naturally beautiful, eat but don't get fat, are great in bed, are great at cooking, raising children, and effortlessly chic, is blown to pieces by Frey. She says that the French feminine mystique, 'nonchalant, subtle, confident, funny and charismatic', is in fact a carefully constructed fiction. Their supposed natural beauty, for example,  is all down to an intense, yet covert, regime. Frey says French women would 'rather die than reveal their . beauty secrets'. They scour hairdressers for the best colourist to give them a 'natural' looking blonde, and invest in super strong anti-wrinkle creams from the age of 25. Actress Charlotte Gainsbourg (l) and star of Coco Before Chanel, Audrey Tautou (r), epitomise French chic . They may never talk about dieting, but that doesn't mean they don't watch what they eat. After all, you can't gorge on buttered baguettes all day and magically maintain a size eight figure. Almost half smoke cigarettes, known to suppress the appetite, according to a recent report. We might imagine they possess lingerie drawers full of silk and lace - but in fact, a recent report from the French . Fashion Institute shows in 2012 the average French woman spends just £100 on underwear. This is a fifth of what the average American shells out. It was also revealed the French buy mostly cotton bras and knickers, rather than investing in luxury materials. And according to Frey, you won't find them slaving away over  a hot stove - they're more likely to pop a ready meal in the microwave. Finally, the famed French chic is not quite as effortless as it appears. Frey says a French woman will fight 'like a lioness to . understand trends and how to display them. No innate style on the . horizon'. The thought-provoking research shines a new light of the French way of life. According to the Le Figaro, the secret is 'to do everything falsely: [they are] falsely coiffed, falsely dressed.' FRENCH WOMEN DON'T GET FAT . The grandmaman of ‘learn from the French’ books, this  purports to unlock the key to how, despite eating mounds of cheese and fois gras, French women retain their figures. Author Mireille Guiliano claims that while they don’t forbid themselves anything, they eat it in moderation. Rather than obsessing about diets, they take pleasure in staying slim while eating well. WHAT FRENCH WOMEN KNOW . ...is the importance of understanding ‘the brevity of time and the immediacy of pleasure’, writes Debra Ollivier. In other words, they’re more pragmatic than the rest of us. CHIC AND SLIM . Never mind diet, it’s undies that’s . are key to French women’s figures, according to Anne Barone. ‘Even . French women’s lingerie helps to keep them slim,’ Barone writes. ‘It’s a . constant reminder to make choices that pay off in slimness. Their . belief in this principle is demonstrated by the fact that there are . almost as many lingerie shops in Paris as bakeries.’ FRENCH CHILDREN DON'T THROW FOOD . French mothers 'seemed to adhere to different rules' to their English counterparts. Pamela Druckerman decided to investigate and, after interviewing dozens of French mothers, sociologists and doctors, wrote a fascinating book . FRENCH WOMEN DON'T SLEEP ALONE . Aside from an inbuilt knowledge of how to tie a Hermes scarf, French women never seem to have any problem finding a boyfriend. Yet, according to author Jamie Cat Callan, they don’t go on dates — instead the secret to finding love French-style is to adopt a ‘coterie’ of fabulous friends through whom you are introduced to men in a relaxed social context. Of course, it also helps if you’re slim and fabulous.","French women lie about gorging on buttered baguettes - and they smoke .

The parents of an Atlanta Braves baseball fan who died after he fell 65ft from the upper deck of his team's stadium in Atlanta have blamed the building's design for their son's death. Ronald Lee Homer Jr. fell six storeys onto a parking lot during a rain delay before a game between the Braves and the Philadelphia Phillies on Monday. His mother, Connie Homer, said the safety railings at the Braves's Turner Field stadium in Atlanta were only 3½ft high, and her son was about 6½ft tall. Scroll down for video . Fatal fall: Ronald Lee Homer Jr. plummeted 65ft to his death from the upper level of stands during an Atlanta Braves game on Monday night in Georgia . Concerns: Homer's parents say Turner Field Stadium is unsafe and that changes should be made . She said: 'I wouldn't be surprised if he was . leaning over looking at the cars in the players' parking lot. 'He might have had one or two beers but no more than that,' she . told NBC Atlanta affiliate WXIA, adding, 'He was tight with his money. He's a good guy.' According to WBSTV, Homer fell from the 400-level upper deck and landed in the players' parking area outside the stadium. Homer's father, Ronald Homer Sr., told The Associated Press: 'I would like to see the building . built to prevent something like this happening to another family. 'It should have . been better engineered from the jump-street when they built that . stadium. 'This this is going to hurt us for the rest of our life,"" he said. ""When . you lose a kid, not only your kid but your best friend, too, it's bad.' The Fulton County Medical Examiner on Tuesday said Homer’s death was . solely the result of blunt force trauma. The medical examiner’s report . said further investigation, witness’ accounts and toxicology testing . would be necessary to determine why Homer fell over the railing. Ronald Lee Homer Jr. (pictured here with his girlfriend Crystal Bracewell) spoke to his mother before he died and told her that he loved her . Tragedy: Ronald Lee Homer Jr., was a life-long fan of the Braves, according to his parents . Witnesses told police no one was standing with Homer when he fell over the upper deck, the Associated Press reported. Atlanta Police spokesman John Chafee said, 'There is no indication of foul play and the fall appears accidental.' In a statement on Tuesday, the team said: 'The Atlanta Braves extend our . sincerest and heartfelt condolences to Mr. Homer's family and friends. 'We are saddened by this tragic incident and will continue our . investigation along with the Atlanta Police Department. 'We will have no . further comment until the investigation is complete. 'The Atlanta Braves will observe a moment of silence for Mr. Homer before tonight's game.' The 30-year-old landscape gardener . spoke to his mother before his fatal fall to tell her that the game had . been postponed for two hours because of rain. Connie Homer said he ended the phone call telling her that loved her. 'He said, ""I love you Mom,"" and I said ""I love you too"" and that was . it,' Mrs Homer said in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday morning. 'He was big-hearted, just a great guy, very . respectful,' she said. 'It didn’t matter if they were winning, losing or . what — he’s been a Braves fan forever.' According to Homer Sr., his son went to see the Braves play a few times a month and never missed a game on TV. Homer's mother said she’s heard nothing from authorities as to what might have . caused her son's fall. She told The Associated Press her only son was . probably smoking a cigarette while he passed the time of a rain delay. Tragic turn: Baseball fans look over the railing at Turner Field where Homer fell onto the parking lot . 'I'm just sick,' she said. 'We're a very close family. He was big-hearted.' Homer, who grew up in Conyers, . Georgia, graduated in 2001 from Rockdale High School, where he was . involved in student government, according to his mother. He was her only son and leaves behind one sister. There’s no indication of foul play, and the fall appears to have been an accident, Atlanta police spokesman John Chafee said. An autopsy was planned for Tuesday, the Fulton . County Medical Examiner’s Office said. An Atlanta Braves spokeswoman declined to comment on Monday night, referring calls to the Atlanta police. The tragedy occurred when the game had . just begun after heavy rains caused an almost two-hour delay from the . scheduled start time at 7.10pm. At 11pm, police were still at the stadium trying to piece together how Homer fell. Mr Chafee said witnesses described the . fall as accidental, and added that he was not sure whether wet . conditions or alcohol had contributed. 'At this time there's no indication of foul play and the fall appears accidental,' Mr Chafee. 'It appears he fell from an upper-level platform to a secured lot below.' This wasn't the first accident of its kind to happen at Turner Field, and was the third time a . sports fan has fallen from the stands in Atlanta in about a year. Ballgame falls: Several falls in sports stadiums have troubled Georgia recently, such as Isaac Grubb's fatal fall at the Georgia Dome . In May 2008, a 25-year-old man from Cumming, Georgia, suffered head injuries when . he fell down a stairwell at Turner Field during a game against the New . York Mets. He later died.

Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford attempted to visit a convicted violent offender with an alleged history of drug activity in jail after visiting hours, a new report claims. The accused, Bruno Belissimo, is described as a childhood friend of Mr Ford. The strange visitation request - which was denied - associates the major of Canada's largest city with yet another shady character from Toronto's underworld. In another bizarre development, a video surfaced Saturday that many observers say showed Mr Ford staggering drunkenly around a Toronto neighborhood declaring, 'I' not driving, I'm not driving,' after attending a street festival. Cast of characters: The new revelation add to the less-than-stellar associations of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford. He is seen here with three suspected members of a Toronto street gang . Video surfaced Saturday that appeared to show Mr Ford drunkenly wandering through a neighborhood after going to a street festival . These are just the latest allegations against Mr Ford. In May, a suspected drug dealer approached two media outlets with a video that claimed to show Ford smoking crack cocaine. Mr Ford denies the existence of such a video. Mr Ford was also pictured with three alleged members of the Dixon City Bloods, a Toronto street gang, in front of the home of two other childhood friends, Fabio and Elana Basso. A spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately return a phone call from MailOnline seeking comment . The Toronto Globe and Mail has introduced a new character to the motley cast surrounding Mr Ford - Belissimo. Sources told the newspaper that in March, Mr Ford showed up unannounced at the Toronto West Detention Centre at 7pm and asked for a tour. Mr Ford was elected in 2010. He has been under fire for much of that time for various scandals, including allegation that he was caught on video smoking crack cocaine . When jail officials declined his request, he then asked if he could visit Belissimo. Mr Ford was reportedly told that visiting time ended three hours before he showed up and that he would not be allowed to see Belissimo. At the time, Belissimo was in jail on charges of assaulting and threatening his parents. He was later convicted and released on probation. Police sources told the Globe and Mail he also had a history of 'drug activity.' Belissimo's mother told the newspaper that Belissimo is a childhood friend of Mr Ford and that the two used to go swimming together. On Saturday, a video surfaced that appeared to show the mayor stumbling drunkenly through a neighborhood after attending a Greek street festival. 'I'm not driving,' the red-faced mayor could b repeatedly heard saying. Mala Turay, who posted the video, told CBC News that the mayor also asked several times 'where's the party?' 'He's the mayor. He should be setting a better example if he's representing our city like that,' Turay said. When stopped by a CBC reporter as he was buying snacks at a gas station at 1am Saturday, the mayor dismissed the video and allegation that he was intoxicated. 'I'm big news. I'm a big guy. I guess anything happens with me is big, right?' he said.","Ford showed up to visit Bruno Belissimo, being held on charges of assault and making threats, three hours after visiting period ended .

While at Cocke County Chancery . Court, Child Support Magistrat Lu Ann Ballew ruled that baby Messiah . DeShawn Martin be renamed Martin DeShawn McCullough, WBIR reported. According to the judge, only one person earned the name Messiah, 'and that one person is Jesus Christ'. The mother's two other children are called Micah and Mason and she argued that she wanted to name her third child with an M too. Messiah is ranked 387th most popular baby name according to the Social Security Administration's 2012 list of names. Christian: Magistrate Ballew has strong feelings about children being named after Jesus - but not with the name Jesus . A WBIR reporter asked the judge what she thought about all the children named Jesus. 'Well, I thought about that,' she responded. 'That's not relevant to this case.' Martin is amazed a judge could force her to change her son's name because of their own religion. 'I was shocked. I never intended on naming my son Messiah because it means God and I didn't think a judge could make me change my baby's name because of her religious beliefs.' Judge Ballew said she was thinking of the child's future wellbeing when she made the decision. The area of Newport where Martin and her son live has a large proportion of Christians, said the judge.

'It could put him at odds with a lot of people and at this point he has had no choice in what his name is,' Judge Ballew said. Martin intends to continue fighting Ballew's decision. 'Everybody believes what they want so I think I should be able to name my child what I want to name him, not someone else,' she said. An appeal will go before the Cocke County Chancellor on September 13.

India has launched its first home-built aircraft carrier today as it continues to bolster its maritime presence. It joins the U.S., Russia, France and Britain in building its own carrier, which was launched at the Kochi shipyard in southern Kerala state. However, INS Vikrant stills needs to be outfitted and extensive trials will be held in 2016 before the carrier is inducted into the Indian navy in 2018. Britain said last November that its £280million-a-year aid programme to India would be halted in 2015, in light of the country's booming economy. Scroll down for video . Naval milestone: Indian launched its first domestically built aircraft carrier at a shipyard in Kochi, Kerala state, on Monday . Proud day: The Indian Navy said the INS Vikrant, which dwarfs other ships, is its 'crowning glory' and the launch marks the end of the first phase of construction . Enormous: MiG-29K, Light Combat Aircraft and Kamov 31 could fly from the 37,000 tonne carrier . Defence Minister A.K. Antony said today that India needed a strong navy to defend itself and that the country will . press ahead with developing its maritime capabilities. India has steadily built up its naval capabilities in recent years, spurred by its rivalry with neighboring China, and the aircraft carrier launch marks another maritime milestone. On Saturday, India activated an atomic reactor for its domestically built nuclear submarine. The carrier launch comes just six days after Japan launched a new ship capable of carrying 14 helicopters at once - although Japanese officials insisted the giant vessel is an aircraft carrier and said it will not be used to launch military jets. The launch marked the end of the first phase of construction. The 37,000 tonne INS Vikrant will now be moved to another dock for further construction. MiG-29K, Light Combat Aircraft and Kamov 31 will be able to fly from the vessel when it is complete. Vice-Admiral R.K. Dhowan, the vice-chief of Naval Staff said the vessel is the 'crowning glory' of the Indian Navy's construction programme. Maritime giant: INS Vikrant docked at the Cochin Shipyard will be more than 850ft long and have a breadth of 196ft when it is complete . Elite list: India now joins a group of just four other countries - the U.S., Russia, France and Britain - capable of building an air craft carrier . Next step: Tugboats guide the carrier as it leaves the dock of the Cochin. It will be re-docked where it will be outfitted and undergo trials . Spurred on: India's rivalry with neighbouring China has seen it build up its naval capabilities in recent years . It is more than five times larger than any other ship built in India. Once complete the ship will be more than 850ft (260m) long, with a breadth of 196ft (60m). The ship's production work began in November 2006. It has been designed by the Directorate of Naval Design. Vice Admiral K. Nair, Controller Warship Production and Acquisition, said: 'We have built 6,000 to 7,000 tonnage capacity ships so far. This is 37,500 tonnes.' He said they had encountered a number of issues during the first phase of construction. Vice Admiral Nair said: 'Availability of steel, problems with acquisition of machines were some of them. 'Most of the equipment has gone on board while the weapons have to be inducted. It has got ski jump from where aircraft will take off.' Commodore K. Subramaniam, Cochin Shipyard chairman and managing director, said the next phase will include laying of electric cables, ventilation systems and setting up about 2,300 compartments and will take about four years to complete. Diesel generators and gas turbines, capable of lighting up the whole of Kochi, have already been installed. The Indian naval milestone comes amid rising tensions in the region between China and Japan. Warship: Japan's new destroyer 'Izumo', which has a flight deck 820ft long (250m), was unveiled in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, last week . Izumo: Japan's naval authorities insist the flat-top destroyer is not an aircraft carrier despite bearing a strong resemblance to the vessel . The Japanese launched its destroyer last week after calls in the country for beefed-up naval and air forces to enable it to enforce its territorial claims against China. The 250m vessel, named 'Izumo', is officially labelled a destroyer, . although it has a flat top which functions as a flight deck like that on . an aircraft carrier. The unveiling of the new destroyer - . which has been under development since 2009 - also coincides with a . dispute between Japan and China over a chain of tiny islands in the . South China Sea. The two countries conduct regular . patrols of the waters around the islands, which are called the Senkakus . in Japan and the Diaoyus in China. In November, China took a step towards achieving its ambition of becoming a leading naval power after successfully landing a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier for the first time. The carrier is China's first and was bought from the Ukraine but the country is planning to build its own. China spent ten years refurbishing the carrier, named Liaoning, after buying the unfinished former Soviet navy ship in 1998. Britain's Royal Navy has four ships which form the core of its amphibious fleet - helicopter carriers HMS Illustrious and Ocean, and assault ships HMS Albion and Bulwark.","The INS Vikrant was launched at the Kochi shipyard in southern Kerala state on Monday .

Search teams are looking for Sebastian Kinasiewicz after he went missing on Oregon's Mount Hood . A Polish military man, 32, has been found dead after a fall from near the summit of Oregon's Mount Hood. Sebastian Kinasiewicz was reported missing on Monday by his roommate after he failed to return on Sunday. Crews found his car at a trailhead, but a daylong search of two routes that start at that point failed to determine his whereabouts. The search resumed today using a helicopter with equipment that can identify a signal from an international cellphone, Hood River County sheriff's Sgt. Pete Hughes said. Kinasiewicz was carrying water and warm clothing but no sleeping bag or food and wasn't equipped to stay out overnight. Hughes said conditions hd been survivable, and hypothermia and moisture would not be a problem above ground. Kinasiewicz was described online as a novice climber who has had survival training, Hughes said. Two teams of searchers headed up the mountain today, joined by a National Guard helicopter. One team had 13 members. Kinasiewicz has been in the U.S. for drone training at the Insitu Inc. in Bingen, Wash. 'Our thoughts are with Sebastian's family at this difficult time,' VInsitu spokeswoman Jill Vacek said in a statement. Sebastian Kinasiewicz was reported missing after failing to return from an attempt to summit Oregon's Mount Hood (pictured) There have been multiple climbers gone missing while attempting Oregon's Mount Hood . Mount Hood, the tallest mountain in . Oregon, is a popular climbing site that has seen dozens of accidents and . fatalities over the years. Thousands . of people climb the peak each year, mostly in the spring. Summer . climbing is more dangerous because warmer temperatures melt the ice and . loosen rocks. Mount Hood is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest in the Cascade Range. Earlier this month a snowbowder traveling through an ice tunnel on Mt. Hood with five companions was found dead nearly 14 hours after the passageway collapsed on top of him. Professional snowboarder from Pines, Colorado, Collin Backowski, 25, was trapped under 8 to 10 feet of snow and ice, which took 12 rescuers two days to dig him out of. In June, the body of Salem dentist Kinley K. Adams was found at the top of Sandy Glacier near the Hood River County line, at 8,400 feet high after he had also attempted the climb.

As a fledgling actress in the 1960s, she had no shortage of attention from casting directors. But despite going on to become one of the most respected stage actresses of her time, Dame Janet Suzman says it is now harder to find work – because people ‘lose interest’ in older women. The 74-year-old accused the theatre world of ‘ignoring half the world’s population’ by not creating enough parts for experienced actresses. Heyday: Dame Janet Suzman appeared in 1986 BBC drama The Singing Detective alongside Patrick Malahide . She also said that feminism has ‘stalled’ and lamented that women are still judged on how they look. Dame Janet made the comments yesterday during a break in her production of Solomon and Marion at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The renowned Shakespearean actress, who was appointed DBE in 2011 for services to drama, plays Marion, a mother struggling to come to terms with the murder of her son in South Africa. Thoughts: Dame Janet is pictured discussing The Singing Detective in Central London last November . She said: ‘There are not eternally interesting parts for women with an interesting mind and view on life, gravitas. People aren’t interested in what women think. ‘If you’re peachy and young, the world’s your oyster. But as you get more interesting, they lose interest. ‘I started writing and directing as well as acting because there just wasn’t enough to keep me interested. It is ignoring half of the world’s population.’ Dame Janet also said she felt that feminism had not made the progress people thought it would in the 1970s. She said it was ‘disappointingly not easier’ for women these days, because the ‘shift in attitudes has not happened’, adding: ‘It seems that women are not liked very much which I find very weird. ‘There’s been no movement at all in terms of judging women by their looks. Feminism has stalled.’ Born in South Africa, Dame Janet made her name at the Royal Shakespeare company in the 1960s. She went on to have a distinguished career on stage and screen, including an Oscar-nominated performance in the 1971 film Nicholas and Alexandra, and appeared in many British television productions, including 1986 BBC drama The Singing Detective alongside Patrick Malahide. She married director Trevor Nunn in 1969. The couple had one son, Joshua, now 32, but divorced in 1986.","Dame Janet claims the industry is 'ignoring half the world's population'

First lady Michelle Obama’s next healthy eating campaign seeks to motivate kids to eat their vegetables is missing the music industry A-listers often seen with the first family. Her Let’s Move! program has partnered with names like Dr. Oz, Jordin Sparks, and Doug E. Fresh on 19 songs directed at children and teens at risk for obesity, but is curiously missing the likes of Common, Jay Z, P Diddy and others that have spent time at the White House. Some of the artists featured on the album include Doug E. Fresh, Travis Barker and Monifah, as well as one of the New York Knicks. Cameo: First lady Michelle Obama makes an appearance in a hip hop music video released by her Let's Move! program in collaboration with Hip Hop Public Health and Partnership for a Healthier America . The surprising lack of star power paved the way for Knicks Guard Iman Shumpert to spit a few lines on one of the songs, according to the New York Post. A cameo is also made by DMC, of the duo Run DMC, but that's where the notoriety ends. The group also plans to produce ten . music videos from its album Songs for a Healthier America--which have . titles like U R What You Eat and Veggie Luv. The album is due out . September 2013. Singers such as Ashanti and Jordin Sparks make appearances, as well as Dr. Oz - yes, he's rapping, or at least trying to - but one can't help wonder if Jay Z sent the call about this project straight to voice mail. This move is yet another in the first . lady’s campaign against childhood obesity, a condition that affects . African American children disproportionately to whites. It is estimated that 50 percent of African American youths are obese. ‘I think hip-hop in particular – so many kids love hip-hop. It's such a core part of our culture,’ Let's Move! Executive Director and White House assistant chef Sam Kass told U.S. News. ‘And particularly in the African-American community and the Latino community which is being disproportionately affected by those health issues.’ 'It's your body, tell somebody': Called 'Everybody,' the video features Jordin Sparks among other big names singing about healthy eating and Let's Move! hopes to release nine more videos once the album is out September 30 . Star studded: The video came out in June and features TV personality Dr. Oz singing about eating right along with Jordin Sparks, Fresh E. Fresh and other performers . The White House’s program was first inspired by the efforts of Hip Hop Public Health, which began in 2005. ‘[We] started looking at the communities with obesity in New York, and a lot of these communities just happened to be poor communities, and happened to be African-American, Hispanic, Latino,’ said the group’s founder Olajide Williams. ‘We needed to develop an interventionary tool for the community. Hip-hop was born as a platform to bring our interventions to the youth.’ Then, this past June, the first video from the collaboration was released. Called ‘Everybody,’ the song features the music stylings of Jordin Sparks, Doug E. Fresh, and others, along with cameos in the video from Dr. Oz and Michelle Obama herself. In the first song out from the first lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! campaign's hip hop album, TV medical personality and Oprah Winfrey scion Dr. Oz raps with Hip Hop MD. On his latex-gloved hand, Dr. Oz wears several big gold rings. He also wears a bejeweled stethoscope around his neck. Dr. Oz has a vegetable-themed rap session with his gold chain wearing colleague Hip Hop MD . They sing: . You gotta watch your calories, what you're taking in. Now, to balance out your calories you gotta hit the gym. Never thought a cardiac surgeonAnd a neurologist. Will talk exercise,Not politics. You only got one life to live. Live healthy, that's what it is!LET'S GO! For his cameo, Dr. Oz sports a jewel-encrusted stethescope and raps alongside a sort of hip hop parallel to himself, Hip Hop MD. In her appearance, Obama recalls the first days of her Let’s Move program when people wondered if they could really make a difference in childhood obesity. Now, as the group prepares to release what is likely to be its most visible campaign yet, FLOTUS may be about to find out. 'Everybody': Doug E. Fresh and Jordin Sparks sing about vegetables and staying positive in the first single from the album Songs for a Healthier America called Everybody . Once the videos are complete, Obama and her collaborators intend to distribute them to schools first in New York City and then in Washington, DC, San Antonio, and Philadelphia with the hope they'll be played during recess or between periods. For his part, Kass believes Songs for a Healthier America is going to be a winner, thanks in no small part to the way they’ve chosen to reach out. ‘Cultural leaders and visionaries in our country can give these messages to kids in a way that's not preachy,’ he said. ‘Kids are going to be dancing and listening to the music.’","Song titles include Veggie Luv, U R What You Eat, We Like Vegetables, and Hip Hop FEET (Finding Exercise Energy Thresholds)

A tree outside a cathedral that began dripping last week has attracted crowds of parishioners who say it is crying God's tears. Clear liquid began falling from the crape myrtle tree opposite St John's Cathedral in Fresno, CA, last Wednesday, prompting worshippers to declare it a 'miracle' and a sign that God was manifesting himself on earth. But a tree specialist who examined it said the liquid was not salt water but excrement from the aphids that covered its trunk and branches. Worshippers in hope of a miracle have flocked to the tree in Fresno, CA, after it began dripping a clear liquid . The liquid was first spotted leaking from the crape myrtle tree opposite St John's Cathedral on Wednesday . The tree, outside St John's Cathedral in Fresno, throws out water when you pray, according to Maria Ybarra . Arborist Jon Reelhorn told wptv.com the drips were a form of honeydew secreted by aphids after they drank the sap from the myrtle tree. He said: 'The aphids will suck the sap, the sap goes through the aphid and then it is a honey dew excrement from the aphid and it gets so heavy in the summertime that it will drip down.' The church-goers who have flocked to the tree, some in search of a cure for their ailments, disagree. Maria Ybarra told the television channel: 'When you say ""Glory be to God in Jesus' name"" the tree starts throwing out more water.' She added: 'I can tell you looking at it from a scientific standpoint and a spiritual standpoint it is the work of God manifesting here on earth.' Tree of hope: Believers, some of them sick, are now flocking to the tree on the Fresno sidewalk to pray . Arborist Jon Reelhorn says the dripping liquid is honeydew, or undigested tree sap from aphids . Aphids produce honeydew after feeding on plant sap - the undigested, sugary liquid is forced out of their gut . Another parishioner, Rosemarie Navarro, who attends a Catholic church in Fresno, believes the tree has power from God. Ms Navarro, who says she is seriously unwell, went to pray under the tree in the hope that what she believes are tears from God might cure her. A clinical therapist told the TV station that it was natural for humans to want to believe in something they could not see, because humans need to hope. In the Bible, the Israelites encountered a white, honey-tasting substance that may well have been honeydew as they walked through the desert after the Exodus.

She is regularly spotted picking up a coffee from Starbucks or stopping off for a treat at McDonalds. And while she clearly loves a bargain when it comes to clothes and food, Britney Spears managed to spend a whopping $7million last year on one too many good deals. According to TMZ the star spent around half of her $14million conservatorship back in 2012 on a wide range of items varying from the thrifty, such as a Subway sandwich,  to the extravagant - $3,400 on Christmas lights. She loves a deal: Britney managed to spend nearly $7million last year on a number of bargains . Documents obtained by the website show she spent a total of $6.8million, which included $63.74 at a 99 Cents Plus, $11.92 at Pay 99 Cents Or Less and various receipts from a range of her favourite food chains, including Domino’s, El Pollo Loco, McDonalds and In-N-Out. It wasn’t all just spent on food though - it’s reported she spent $33,959 on grooming and wardrobe, which is in fact a small budget for most stars in the public eye. It doesn’t however come as much a surprise considering just this week Britney was spotted wearing a top she wore the week before – showing that fashion really isn’t a priority for her. In control: Jamie Spears (pictured here with Jayden) is still in charge of most aspects of Britney's life . While much of what the 31-year-old spent her hard-earned cash on was cheap food, she also splashed out on a few extravagant items. TMZ reports she spent $500 on a manicure and $1,500 went to Casey Alridge – the father of her sister Jamie Lynn’s child. The documents also reveal the singer's worth and shows that the conservatorship alone has $36.4million which at this stage doesn’t include her net worth – which includes the $68million she made on her last tour and $15million she received for her role on the X Factor. Yummy: Over the years Britney has become known for her love of fast food and continues to spend money on it . Drive-thru: Documents show that Britney spent some of her money last year on McDonalds and In-N-Out . Britney’s father, Jamie, has been conservator of her affairs for almost five years after her life spiralled out of control in 2007. A judge handed Mr Spears control of the singer's fortune and almost every other aspect of her life after she had a public meltdown. At the height of her problems Britney lost custody of her children, Sean Preston and Jayden James for a long spell which prompted an infamous rant outside Kevin Federline's LA home, resulting in a shaven-headed Britney rampaging with an umbrella. Thrifty: Just this week Britney stepped out in a top she was spotted in again last year- showing she's more than happy to wear an items a few times . In January of last year it was reported that her father was considering halting the conservatorship as a special gift to celebrate her upcoming wedding to Jason Trawick. Unfortunately the couple never made it down the aisle and Britney never regained control of her money. Long list: A 150-page document, filed at Los Angeles Superior Court on Aug. 9, shows that her conservatorship earned almost $14 million - and she spent $6.8 million . Expenditures: Some of Britney's expenses came at hefty cost - she spent nearly $31k on her wardrobe and nearly $40k on cleaning services .

Fit for trial: Nanny Yoselyn Ortega has pleaded not guilty to killing Lucia and Leo Krim . A New York City nanny charged with stabbing two small children to death has again been found fit for trial. A Manhattan judge reaffirmed his finding in Yoselyn Ortega's case on Tuesday after he was asked to reconsider. Ortega allegedly killed six-year-old Lucia Krim and two-year-old Leo Krim in October while their mother was out picking up her third child from a swimming lesson. Authorities say Ortega also cut her throat in a suicide attempt. She has pleaded not guilty to murder. Defense lawyer Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg has said Ortega's delusions and injuries mean she cannot understand the case. Doctors offered diverging views of Ortega's mental state. State Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro also heard recorded phone calls Ortega made from jail to relatives. She sounded coherent while discussing everyday matters. The prosecution presented audio recording of Yoselyn Ortega, 50, speaking coherently with her family on the phone from jail, giving advice and showing concern for building works - evidence they say that she is not mentally disabled. After the killings, Ortega told doctors she didn't remember the attacks and that she heard voices telling her to kill people. Horrific: Yoselyn Ortega, pictured, was discovered with the two children and a knife as she attempted to slit her own throat . Fit state: Yesterday's hearing comes after two psychologists ruled last month that Ortega was mentally fit to stand trial. Her lawyer is arguing that she is not mentally well enough for the trial . Ortega is due to stand trial for the . first-degree murder of the two children, Lucia and Leo Krim, ages 6 and . 2, who were found stabbed to death inside their parents’ apartment on . the upper West Side, New York, last October. At . a hearing on Monday, the court heard a recording of Ortega chatting . with her family, in reasoned statements. In a conversation with her . 17-year-old son, Jesus, she asked about renovations being done to the . house. Quoted by NY Daily News, she . showed understanding about why tiles would be laid after paint work has . been done, because otherwise, 'the tiles get dirty while painting'. She . also expressed concern about the family planning to go out at a time . when workers were scheduled to arrive, the news service said, and . remembered details of the planned renovations. While . prosecutors said this was evidence of her sanity, Ms Leer-Greenberg . called defense witness Dr. Karen Rosenbaum, who testified that Ortega’s . seemingly lucid thought process during the calls was not proof she is . mentally fit. Quoted by the . news service, Rosenbaum said: 'Somebody can function in a day-to-day . sense on some level but still not be competent to stand trial because of . the specific nature of what [the law] demands.' 'She de-compensates under stress,' Rosenbaum said on cross-examination, the NY Daily News reported. The . nanny attempted to slit her own throat on October 25 after Marina Krim . came home to her Upper West Side apartment to find her daughter and son . dead in a pool of blood in the bath. Last month, Ortega was examined by . two mental health professionals, both of whom found that she could . assist in her defense in a meaningful way and that she was mentally fit . to proceed to her trial. Her lawyer is challenging those results. In June, Ortega claimed someone else killed the children she's accused of stabbing all over their bodies in the Krims home. 'I didn't do that,' the nanny insisted in jailhouse interview with New York Daily News. 'Someone else did.' Ortega did not say who else could be responsible for murdering the children. Plea: Yoselyn Ortega, pictured centre, has pleaded not guilty to killing six-year-old Lucia Krim (right) and her two-year-old brother Leo while they were in her care at their Manhattan home . Loss: Two-year-old Leo and his big sister Lucia, six, were found in a pool of blood in the family's home . Victims: Only Nessie, whose picture has been pixelated, escaped harm as she was with her mother . Ortega, Lucia and Leo had been due to . meet Mrs Krim and Nessie at a dance studio, but the mother became . concerned when they failed to turn up and returned to the home. After learning from the doorman that . the nanny had not left the building, Mrs Krim frantically searched the . apartment and came across the grisly scene in the bathroom. Ortega's suicide bid failed and she was put in a medically-induced coma. When . questioned by police after awaking from the coma, the nanny attempted . to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the . tragedy on her. Ortega, . who had told neighbors and family that she was short of money, revealed . she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to do and . asked her to do the housework. 'She said something like, ""I'm paid . to watch the children, not clean up and do housework"",' a . law-enforcement source said of Ortega’s statements to police after she . woke from the coma. Ortega became extremely animated . when she discussed the incident with police, telling officers that  she . had numerous disagreements with mother Marina about how the kids were . being cared for. Reports claimed Marina didn't think Ortega was interacting with the kids enough and was giving them junk . food. The Krims were also reportedly worried about Ortega's job . performance in the weeks leading up to the killings and had told her . that if she didn't improve, they might need to replace her. But the Krims' extended family . dispute they treated her poorly, explaining that they paid for her to . travel on holidays and even visited her family in the Dominican . Republic. In April, Ortega, was ruled fit to . stand trial and will now face a jury for two counts of first-degree . murder and two counts of second-degree murder. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. In June, the Krim's revealed they are expecting a baby boy in October, . Family: Lulu is pictured with her father Kevin Krim and mother Marina Krim, who found her children stabbed in the bathtub and their nanny with a slit throat and wrists on the bathroom floor . Happy news: Marina and Kevin Krim, whose son and daughter were allegedly stabbed to death by their nanny last year, have revealed that they are expecting a baby boy this fall . 'Hello everyone, We are very happy to let you know that Marina is expecting a baby in the fall,' read the message on the Lulu & Leo Fund. 'Nessie . can’t wait to welcome her new baby brother. We are filled with many . emotions as we look to the future, but the most important one is hope. We are very grateful to you all for your amazing support.' In . January, Mr Krim, an executive at America's CNBC television station, . said that they are drawing strength from their remaining child.

A woman who was reported missing after a mudslide and flash flood, that killed a 53-year-old driver and knocked down houses, has been found safe, it emerged today. Six homes were destroyed and about 30 others were damaged when the mudslide and flash flooding hit Manitou Spring after heavy rain fell in an area destroyed by wildfire last year. Many people were forced to cling to trees and scramble up cliffs by the sides of roads to escape the torrent of mud and silt. Scroll down for video .

As heavy rain continued to fall on . the small city, residents and business owners did their best to salvage . belongings and clear up the damage, while wrecked cars were towed from . the streets and highway. Victim: John Collins was found buried under mud . The . area has become more vulnerable to flash floods after damage caused by . wildfires last year left the scorched soil less able to absorb water. 'This is the first year of the burn scar. We've got nine more years of this,' Colorado Springs fire lieutenant Steve Schopper said. When the storm hit on Friday it swept mud, boulders and other debris into Manitou Springs, which has a population of about 5,000 people. Initial reports said two people had been killed but one of them, a woman who asked not to be identified, was later found safe. Another . woman has revealed details of her dramatic escape, after her rental . home was swept away by a 4ft wall of mud and floodwater. 'I lost everything, but I survived it. I'm so happy I survived,' Laura Hunter said. Ms Hunter was at home when . water started coming in her living room window. She said she went to the . front door thinking she would be able to head to higher ground, but was swept . away.

John Collins, 53, was killed when the mudslide hit Highway 24. John Collins, of Teller County, was found buried under debris next to his car, El Paso police said. It was not clear if Mr Collins, who had been driving home from work, had tried to flee on foot or whether the force of the mudslide pushed him from his car.

As more heavy rain fell yesterday, residents tried to salvage their belongings and secure their homes from further damage. Many have been forced to clean up and rebuild their homes before, according to CBS Denver, and some said they were not sure if they could cope with doing it again. Swarms of volunteers have arrived to help residents clear away the banks of silt left in homes and businesses. However, a woman who lives close to the Timberline Baptist Church said looters were seen rifling through items volunteers had salvaged from the church and left to clean to the parking lot. 'They were going through the stuff, just seeing what they could get,' the woman told CBS Denver. At least 20 cars were swept away on Friday. Kathryn Presnal, of Cascade, recounted how she ran from her car and scrambled up a cliff by the road, pulling another driver up with her, as the flood hit. Danger: A woman runs for cover as heavy rain continues to fall, bring fears of more flash floods . Prepared: Residents stack sandbags along the streets to try to prevent further flooding . Salvage: Business owners stack up items they have managed to pull out of their ruined shops . Heartbreaking: Neighbors comfort each other after the floods, which are likely to hit again because of wildfire damage . Community spirit: Residents help clear out mud from businesses and homes . 'I grabbed her hand and pulled her up,' the Colorado Springs school principal said. 'We stood there and watched our cars float away.' City officials are trying to protect the area from further flood damage, including building 11 catch basins. 'With the amount of rain that we . received Friday, nothing that we could have done could have prevented . the kind of flooding we had,' Dave Hunting, a spokesman for the city government said.

"By . Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:39 EST, 13 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:20 EST, 13 August 2013 . The Justice Department sued on Tuesday to block the merger of American Airlines' parent company AMR Corp and US Airways Group Inc, saying the deal would hurt consumers by leading to higher fares and fees. The $11 billion merger would create the world's largest airline, after four other major U.S. carriers combined in recent years, narrowing the field of large U.S. airlines. The antitrust lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and joined by several states including Arizona and Texas, drew concern from industry experts and support from consumer advocates. The Justice Department has challenged a proposed $11 billion merger between US Airways Group Inc. and American Airlines' parent company, AMR Corp. US Airways fell 8.4 percent at $17.23. American shares, which are thinly traded, were down 44.5 percent at $3.22. The Justice Department seeks to block the merger 'because it would eliminate competition between US Airways and American and put consumers at risk of higher prices and reduced service,' Bill Baer, head of the Justice Department Antitrust Division, said in a statement. 'Both airlines have stated they can succeed on a standalone basis, and consumers deserve the benefit of that continuing competitive dynamic,' Baer said. AMR and US Airways did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the suit. The two airlines secured European Union approval for the proposed merger on August 5 after promising to surrender slots at two airports, London's Heathrow and Philadelphia in the United States. The Justice Department said it was concerned that if the merger went through, four airlines would control more than 80 percent of the U.S. commercial air travel market. The Justice Department says the merger would hurt consumers by leading to higher fares and fees . At Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, the one closest to Washington, the combined company would control 69 percent of the take-off and landing slots, the department said. But industry experts said the move was out of step with past practices and would potentially leave US Air and American, which is emerging from bankruptcy, at a competitive disadvantage. 'This borders on shocking,' said George Hamlin, an aviation consultant in Fairfax, Virginia. He called the suit 'marvelously inconsistent,' considering the approval of mergers between United Airlines and Continental, and Delta Airlines and Northwest. 'Assuming it prevents US Air and American from merging, does that condemn them to perpetual second-class existence?' Hamlin asked. Others said the move was necessary to protect travelers who have paid higher fees and fares in recent years. Consumer advocate Charlie Leocha, director of the Consumer Travel Alliance and a vocal opponent of the merger, said he was elated that the Justice Department had filed suit. 'This is a stake in the heart of the merger. I don't see this moving forward,' Leocha said. 'This is the best possible and the only good consumer outcome that we could have gotten.' While U.S. discussions had centered on remedies such as slot divestitures at Reagan National, Leocha said, 'in my meetings with DOJ and in my testimony before Congress, I have constantly said that that won't take care of the overriding nationwide loss of competition that we're going to face. It sounds like the Department of Justice has agreed with me.'","The Justice Department says the merger of American Airlines' parent company AMR Corp and US .

Sorry: Julian McKnight said his son, also called, Julian, 15, was sorry for his role in the beating of a 13-year-old boy on a Florida school bus in St. Petersburg last month . All three of the 15-year-olds are first time offenders and are due back in the juvenile court on August 27th where prosecutors will seek a sentence of nine months of probation for the suspects, no contact with the victim and random drug testing. The attack on the bus which made national headlines and caused outrage across the country came after the unidentified 13-year-old victim told officials at Lealman Intermediate School that one of them attempted to sell him marijuana. The three boys were captured on surveillance video camera on the bus landing 50 blows onto the younger teen, leaving him with a broken arm and two black eyes according to Fox News. The bus driver in Gulfport, Florida who made the desperate call for help as he witnessed three teens brutally punch and stomp a younger student and won’t face charges despite video that shows he did not physically intervene. Pinellas County driver John Moody, 64, put in a call to his dispatcher as he watched three 15-year-olds attack a 13-year-old, breaking the boy’s arm and leaving him with two black eyes. ‘You gotta get somebody here quick, quick, quick, quick,’ Moody could be heard pleading in surveillance footage as the victim moaned with each kick and punch. 'They are about to beat this boy to death.' Additional charge: Joshua Reddin is also charged with unarmed robbery for allegedly stealing the victim's money . The 18-year veteran did not try to . stop the attack himself, which led Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent . to pursue criminal charges. ‘There . was clearly an opportunity for him to intervene and or check on the . welfare of the children or the child in this case, and he didn't make . any effort to do so,’ Vincent told WFLA. However, . Moody was not required to help the beaten boy under Pinellas County . rules.

Moody followed protocol, say officials, by radioing for help. ‘Please get somebody here quick. There's still doing it,’ Moody said in footage from the scene. ‘There's nothing I can do.’ In fact, Moody says he was traumatized by the event  and has since retired. ‘I had many sleepless nights,’ he told CNN. ‘I had nightmares.’ Moody described the fight and subsequent controversy as the ‘final straw…and it was a big straw, too.’ ‘Me . jumping in the middle of that fight with three boys,’ he told CNN, ‘it . would have been more dangerous for other students on the bus for as . myself.

'Quick, quick, quick!': Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent initially accused Moody of neglect, but video shows he followed protocol by asking dispatchers to get to the scene . Police say the victim was targeted because he was offered marijuana by one of the attackers and then reported the attempted drug sale to school administrators. In spite of this, all the boys were allowed to board the bus together, which Moody’s attorney says points to a problem at the school. 'Stop!': Footage from the July 9 attack shows Moody yelling at the attackers to stop and repeatedly asking dispatchers for help . Brutal: The 13-year-old victim walked away with two black eyes and a broke arm . Nightmarish: Pinellas County, Florida school district rules allow a bus driver to intervene in a fight but does not require them to. Moody, 64, says the attack has left him with nightmares.

'Please take this final request for a DNA test seriously,' he wrote before taking on a more stern tone: 'Because if you don't, I will be forced to take legal action and sue.' He continued: 'I assure you I don't take being a father lightly. I will be a great father to Mason.' Last week, Girgenti filed paperwork at a Los Angeles County Superior Court in . a bid to get joint custody of the three-year-old child . alleging he had unprotected sex with the reality TV star nine months . before Mason's birth. Real . life drama: Kourtney and boyfriend Scott Disick were seen . leaving a lawyer's office last week after news of the lawsuit became public . The lawsuit documents the alleged . relationship between Kourtney and Michael, which he claims heated up in August 2008, and continued with months of texting in which she told him her relationship with Scott was 'on the . outs' and 'she wanted to hang.' According . to gossip website TMZ.com, Michael wants the judge to order DNA tests . for Kourtney, Mason and her long-term boyfriend Scott Disick - . who is father to her daughter Penelope, 13 months. A hearing has been set for next month. Furious: Kourtney said she was 'furious' when the allegations first emerged, and the model has now filed a claim with the court . Kourtney who in March was said to be 'furious' over Gigenti's claims has yet to comment personally on the fresh allegations. And her spokeswoman has not responded to requests for comment. However her lawyer told TMZ.com on Friday that Gigenti's allegations are 'absurd'. 'This individual has been selling false and fabricated stories to the tabloids for years about Kourtney Kardashian and her son, Mason.  Scott Disick is Mason’s father,' Todd Wilson told the website. 'We have not seen the reported court filing, but we are informed that this individual has been seeking to get paid to publish his ridiculous pleading. 'His claims are absurd and this is simply another shameful attempt to gain publicity and profit from fictional stories about my client.' Photogenic: Kourtney and Michael met on a photo shoot in 2008, but the star's attorney says there was no further contact after that . The reality star was seen outside her . lawyer's office on Wednesday, no doubt seeking advice over the . embarrassing and upsetting lawsuit. Michael . claims they had full sex and as soon as she had given birth to Mason - . born on 14 December 2009 - he tried contacting her. The allegations first came to light . in March earlier this year when he told In Touch magazine: 'After . [Mason] was born, and I saw photos of him, I began to wonder. 'I would definitely want to acknowledge Mason if he's my kid - he deserves to know his real father.' A . legal representative for the Kourtney & Kim Take Miami star previously branded the Chicago native's allegations 'preposterous and an . outrageous lie'. Something on your mind: Kourtney shares an intense conversation with boyfriend on Wednesday . So it must have come as a surprise that the model has now filed papers with the court. In . addition to son Mason, the couple - who have been dating on and off for . seven years - have a baby daughter, Penelope Scotland, together. Just last week it was reported that Kourtney was pregnant with her third child. She . did not comment on the rumours, although was later seen eating sushi . with her family - a food type pregnant women are advised to steer clear of due to the raw fish ingredients. Fashion plate: Kourtney was dressed in head to to black-and-white Chanel . This is not the first time the extremely wealthy Kardashian family has been confronted by allegations of paternity. Kourtney's younger sister Khloe, 28, . has had to regularly deny rumours that their late father Robert . Kardashian was not her biological father. Their half-sister Kylie Jenner, 15, also recently hit back at reports that Bruce Jenner may not be her real father.

Despite his fame, Michael Jackson was mired in debt and spending millions more than he earned, a financial expert testified on Monday. Forensic accountant William Ackerman said the late singer was paying a staggering $30 million annually just in interest on his debts, which totaled roughly half a billion dollars when he died. Ackerman was called to testify by attorneys for concert promoter AEG Live in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jackson's family. In this March 5, 2009 file photo, Michael Jackson announces several concerts at the London O2 Arena. A Forensic accountant testified Monday that the late singer was paying a staggering $30 million annually just in interest on his debts when he died . Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine, has brought a wrongful death lawsuit against concert promoter AEG Live. Here, she exits Santa Barbara County Superior Court for Michael's child molestation trial in April 2005 . 'On an annual basis [he was] spending 15 to 20 million dollars a year more than he brought in,' Ackerman said, according to CBS Los Angeles. 'He was tapped out.' Jackson appears to have started accruing debt in 1993, when he owed about $30 million. By the time he died, his debt had grown to half a billion dollars. Records show Jackson spent money on donations to charity, gifts, travel, art and furniture, according to the Los Angeles Times. 'He spent a lot of money on jewelry, 'Ackerman said. Neverland Ranch, where Jackson lived, was also a huge expense because it required a maintenance staff for the zoo and train that traveled around the property. His largest expenditure, however, were his annual  interest payments on his debt. Jackson's family claims in their wrongful death lawsuit against AEG Live that the concert promoter had negligently hired Dr. Conrad Murray (pictured in 2011) to watch over the singer while he prepared for his comeback tour. Murray gave the singer a fatal dose of anesthesia in 2009 . This Oct. 27, 2009 file photo shows Columbia Pictures' Premiere of Michael Jackson's 'This Is It' tour at the Nokia Theatre L.A.

The family is seeking income lost by his death, which their lawyers estimate at roughly $1.5 billion for the months of touring he was preparing for. AEG counters that Jackson had requested Murray as his doctor and that Jackson's earnings potential would have amounted to $132 million.","Forensic accountant William Ackerman .

"PUBLISHED: . 16:17 EST, 11 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:02 EST, 12 August 2013 . The first time I tried to lure a robin to feed from my hand, I failed. My experience with wildlife is almost entirely based on mammals, and I was not convinced that your heart could easily be captured by a bird. Perhaps my lack of commitment shone through as I stood near the specks of organic mature cheddar I had placed on the garden table, waiting for the robin, which seemed to glower at me from the nearby dogwood, to swoop down and accept my offering. Hugh Warwick from Oxford who has a Robin in his back garden that will eat from his hand . The reason I was trying to lure him to my hand was down to robin expert Andrew Lack, whom I had met while writing my latest book, The Beauty In The Beast. I had challenged a number of wildlife gurus to convince me that their favourite species was equal to my own, the hedgehog. Andrew, obviously, had opted for the robin. The challenge was life-changingly serious — I had rather rashly declared I would get a tattoo of the species to join the one of a hedgehog I already had on my left ankle. I have long held that the hedgehog is the most important creature on the planet. Between its muddy little paws are held the keys to the salvation of humanity. This is because its behaviour allows us to get so close to it. While most wildlife flees or attacks you when you approach, the hedgehog just rolls itself into a ball.It can be a profound experience coming nose to nose with a wild animal, and that’s what you can do with a hedgehog. Could I get as up close and personal to a robin? Wing and a prayer: Like a jump jet preparing to land, the robin swoops in to retrieve its prize - a tiny piece of cheddar cheese . Say cheese: The bird¿s feathers fan out as it lands - and Hugh's camera captures the image . I wasn’t confident — even though the British people’s bond with robins goes back many years. Elsewhere, the bird is hunted. But here, thanks to the way we garden, the robin has struck up a peculiar relationship with human beings. Why? Because to the robin we are little more than tall pigs. In their natural habitat, the woodland edge, they follow wild boar, watching as they turn over the soil and expose food. And what do we do in the garden? We weed and dig — and the robin hops along behind us. But the bond between man and robin is not just down to our pig-like behaviour. The robin does itself a lot of favours by being bold, bright and musical in the bleakest months. People have found you can tame robins to feed from your hand, which is what Andrew Lack had told me about. He learned the technique from his mother, who always had a ‘pet’ robin. Last year, a recently fledged robin was tolerating my presence in the garden. And though I tried to lure it to feed from my hand, I failed. Then, this summer, a bold redbreast, which I like to think is the same one (though they have such short lives that might not be the case), appeared just outside the conservatory door. Not expecting much, I took a few crumbs of cheese, put them on the table outside and waited nearby.The robin swooped, took a piece of cheese and was off again. I had just completed the first hurdle. A few minutes later the robin was back so I set up the next step — cheese on the table, but this time I stood closer, with my hand out. A little more hesitantly, the robin came closer, bounced around the far side of the table, before flitting across, pinching the cheese and disappearing down the garden with a thrumming of wings. Fantastic flight: Hugh took photographs to prove to friends that the magical connection with the robin really happened . The next day, it was back, and this time I placed the cheese on the table, but with my hand nearby. Again, more hesitation, but it came and grabbed another crumb of mature cheddar. Later in the day, I heard the rapid flutter of wings and a little cheep. I decided to be as bold as the robin and placed the cheese on the tips of my fingers, with my hand on the table. Hopping around, plucking up courage, the robin came close, before flying away without the treat. I realised I had been holding my breath. The next day I repeated the exercise, though this time with my camera in the other hand — at least, I thought, I would get a nice close-up of the bird. Hop, hop it came, closer and closer, then a dart forward. It took the cheese and buzzed off. I had completely forgotten to take a photograph. Elated, I went back to the fridge for more cheese, and over the next three weeks we struck up an understanding — the robin will pose for a photograph on my hand for around 1/500th of a second in return for a piece of cheese the size of a grain of rice. Apart from the neighbour’s cat, my only worry for the bird is its cholesterol levels. I took the first photographs to show my doubting friends that the magical connection between the robin and me had happened. But then I noticed how beautiful the bird was, so I began to take out a camera with me every time. Close-up and personal: The camera helped Hugh see the minute details of the robin's feathers . Snatch and grab: The robin darts away with the piece of cheese it has taken from Hugh's hand . When the robin hovered nervously to begin with, as it decided whether to come for the food or not, this gave me a rare view of the wings, trembling in mid air. As it became bolder, the wings seemed to look different because it flew in more directly, sometimes folding them back like a falcon. And then, when it was even more comfortable, I got shots of the great fan of feathers that make up the wing of this amazing little bird. Sometimes it seemed to be dancing on my hand as it perched for a fraction of a second before darting away with its prize. The feathers around the face are so fine. Without the camera, I would never have seen so closely what makes a robin special. I have been lucky enough to be able to share the delight — my wife, children and friends have all enjoyed moments of wildlife connection. One morning I was having a snooze in the conservatory when I was woken by a ‘cheep, cheep . . .’ I looked down and the robin was hopping around my feet. I got some cheese and as I stood there, feeding the bird, it dawned on me that perhaps I had not trained the robin — it had trained me. Perhaps I should consider that tattoo after all.","Hugh Warwick has trained a Robin in his back garden to eat from his hand .

A two-year-old girl who suffered a stroke just moments after birth has defied doctors who said she may never be able to speak - by uttering her first words. Leila Higgins was born a healthy 8lb 2oz but had a devastating postnatal stroke which remained undetected for nine months. Her parents, John and Libby Higgins, were horrified when doctors diagnosed a severe bleed on the right side of her brain which had caused extensive damage. Leila Higgins, who suffered a stroke just moments after birth, has defied doctors who said she may never be able to speak, by uttering her first words . They were told that Leila may never walk or talk and that she may have very limited development. But the couple were determined to prove the experts wrong and spent endless hours coaxing Leila out of her silence. When she was 18-months-old their perseverance paid off when she sat unaided and uttered her first word - daddy. The toddler is now starting to chat like any other child and is making good progress towards being able to walk. Mrs Higgins, 27, a social care student, said: ‘We are so proud of Leila and how she’s progressing. The doctors told us that she would never walk or talk but we wanted to prove the doctors wrong and show that no matter how bleak the diagnosis you can fight and improve. ‘When she said “daddy” for the first time it was a really emotional moment because all along we just prayed for her to be able to talk. Leila Higgins was born a healthy 8lb 2oz but had a devastating postnatal stroke which remained undetected for nine months . ‘We said, no matter what else, we just want her to be able to talk, so she can voice what she wants or needs. ‘We didn’t want her to be frustrated and not be able to voice if she was in pain or needed anything. ‘So, for her to cross that hurdle was massive, and we were so happy. It’s lovely to hear her having conversations now. ‘Her speech is now almost on par with any other child.’ Her parents, John and Libby Higgins, were horrified when doctors diagnosed a severe bleed on the right side of her brain which had caused extensive damage . She added: ‘Now Leila is improving all the time, and it’s just her walking that’s the next hurdle. She’s getting better and better with her progression towards walking too. ‘We hold her up by her arms and she kicks her legs out as if she wants to try and walk. ‘We’re hopeful that at some point in the future she will be able to walk, and prove the doctors wrong again. ‘She’s just like a normal two-year-old in terms of her development except her left-hand side is very stiff due to hemiplegia resulting from the stroke. Her parents were told that Leila may never walk or talk and that she may have very limited development. Leila is pictured with her mother and father, John and Libby, and her sister, Zoe . ‘She’s amazing, we’re so proud of her.’ Mrs Higgins and warehouseman husband John, 40, are also parents to three-year-old Zoe and live in Leeds. Mrs Higgins said: ‘I remember the devastation when we heard the news from the consultant that Leila may never walk or talk. ‘We were literally numb, and didn’t know what was going to happen. When Leila (pictured with her mother, Libby) was 18-months-old, she sat up unaided for the first time and uttered her first word - daddy . ‘It was horrible being shown the pictures of the brain scan, and to be told she had suffered a major stroke, I can’t describe it. ‘We are a relatively healthy family with no history of strokes, so it was a complete shock. ‘But now, instead of seeing Leila’s condition as a negative thing, we have embraced it and it has enriched our lives.

The toddler is now starting to chat like any other child and is making good progress towards being able to walk . ‘Having a child who has had a stroke and resulting hemiplegia makes you find an extra level of determination and patience.’ Mr Higgins recently took part in a 50-mile bike ride and raised £700 for the Stroke Association.

A mother who thought an indentation in her breast was a result of an ill-fitting bra ha spoken of her devastation after her GP told her it was a symptom of breast cancer. Lisa Roberts, 37, casually mentioned a mark on her breast at a routine appointment with her doctor. But doctors immediately sent her to Royal Blackburn Hospital, Lancashire, for a scan and biopsy, which revealed she had breast cancer and three tumours on her spine. When mother-of-two Lisa Roberts casually mentioned a problem she thought was caused by a badly fitted bra to her doctor, she assumed it was nothing serious. But within days, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and given the devastating news that she also had three tumours on her spine . Ms Roberts story has touched dozens of people who have donated £12,000 to help pay for possible treatment in America. And Ms Roberts hopes more lives will . be saved by her one-woman crusade to urge women, and men, to regularly . check their breasts for the early signs of cancer. Ms Roberts, of Banbury Avenue, Oswaldtwistle in East Lancashire, was diagnosed in January and is still undergoing treatment. At . a routine doctor’s appointment, Ms Roberts mentioned an indentation in . her breast which she assumed was caused by an ill-fitting bra. But she was immediately transferred . to Royal Blackburn Hospital for a scan and biopsy and before doctors . even had her results, a consultant told her that they were ‘99.9 per . cent sure it was cancer’. Ms . Roberts said: ‘There’s a lot of misinformation out there and even . people that do check their breasts tend to think that all they need to . look out for are lumps and that’s not the case. ‘I hadn’t felt ill and had no other symptoms at all so it’s really important that both men and women know what to look out for.’ Ms Roberts said: 'There's a lot of misinformation out there and even people that do check their breasts tend to think that all they need to look out for are lumps and that's not the case. I hadn't felt ill and had no other symptoms at all so it's really important that both men and women know what to look out for.' A week later, the diagnosis was confirmed and a private PET scan showed the tumours in her spine. She was told her condition was ‘incurable’ but she said: ‘They haven’t said that it’s terminal and I’m hopeful that with treatment, I will be able to live to see my children grow up. ‘You have down days and I do look at my children sometimes and it all just hits me. ‘I wonder how long I’ll be able to tuck them in bed and it is heartbreaking. ‘I’ve been honest with them about everything though, and they are happy and healthy and an absolute credit to me. Ms Roberts hopes more lives will be saved by her mission to urge women, and men, to regularly check their breasts for the early signs of cancer . ‘In spite of everything they are going through, they are still smiling and still doing brilliantly at school. ‘They make me so proud and want to fight to be there for them.’ When a group of lively friends created a sponsored walk event on Facebook to raise money to send her and her children on holiday, they were inundated with requests from people who wanted to get involved and donate money. A committee was formed and an official campaign was launched in March, aiming to raise awareness of breast cancer and raise money for possible treatments. Ms Roberts has had chemotherapy and this week underwent a mastectomy, but the tumours in her spine will prove harder to treat. She was put on a course of medication which would increase her life expectancy but the treatment was stopped when it was found to be affecting her heart. To date, Ms Roberts’ Kick Cancer Campaign has raised more than £12,000 which will be put towards specialist treatment in America. Lynda Corben, committee leader for the Kick Cancer Campaign said: ‘She is still recovering from her surgery at the moment but when she’s feeling better, we are going to look at arranging the trip to Houston, Texas for a consultation.’ Ms Corben’s husband was diagnosed with cancer in April and had his oesophagus removed on the same day Ms Roberts had her operation. Ms Corben said: ‘Lisa had always said to my husband that she would hold his hand all the way through and they really did. They were in beds next to each other in intensive care. It was unbelievable. ‘She is such a courageous, inspirational and selfless girl. As soon as she found out about my husband, she said “you use the money”. ‘Of course, we never would but that’s just what she’s like. Always thinking of how she can help others.’ Ms Roberts added: ‘I never expected anything like this and I would never have asked for money from anyone - but if there is one life that this campaign can save, then it’s worth it. ‘I tell all my friends all the time and I’m sure they get sick of me, but I just can’t say it enough - check, check, check!’","Lisa Roberts, 37, have developed an indentation on her breast .

Babies born by Caesarean section have lower levels of healthy bacteria in their guts, experts believe. A study suggests babies born in theatre have lower levels of some types of bacteria which are naturally passed from mother to baby during a normal delivery. This may put babies born by Caesarean at higher risk of some conditions, such as allergies, due to implications for the immune system. Babies born by Caesarean section have lower levels of healthy bacteria in their guts, experts believe . Writing in the journal Gut, researchers from Sweden assessed gut bacteria in 24 babies, of whom nine were born by Caesarean. They examined samples when the babies were one week old and again at one, three, six, 12 and 24 months after birth. Blood samples were also taken to test the immune response of the babies. The results showed that those delivered by Caesarean section, and who therefore did not pass down the mother’s birth canal, lacked one of the major groups of gut bacteria, the Bacteroidetes, or acquired it late when compared with babies born vaginally. In some babies born by Caesarean, Bacteroidetes did not appear until a year after birth. The total range of bacteria among babies born in theatre was also lower. The experts said: ‘Microbial colonisation of the infant gut gastrointestinal tract is important for the postnatal development of the immune system. The lower levels of good bacteria may put babies born by Caesarean at higher risk of allergies . ‘In this study, Caesarean section-delivered infants who are not entering the birth canal of the mother either lacked or displayed a delayed colonisation of one of the major gut phylum, the Bacteroidetes. ‘The colonisation of this phylum was delayed by up to one year for some infants. The total microbiota diversity was also lower in the Caesarean section infants, probably largely as a consequence of the lack of this phylum.’ Bacteria are important for prompting the immune system to respond to triggers and to not overreact as is the case in allergies, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease, the experts said. The results had nothing to do with whether the mother had received antibiotics to help prevent infection. The gastrointestinal tract of newborn infants is considered to be sterile in the womb, the authors went on. ‘Bacteria from the environment, mainly from the mother, colonise the infant gut immediately following birth,’ they said. Bacteroidetes do not appear to grow outside the gut and ‘hence need to be transmitted between human hosts’.","Some types of bacteria are naturally passed from a mother to her baby during a normal delivery .

The female orgasm is a sensation that . many people find complex and perplexing, but one woman claims to have had 11 orgasms in one day using the orgasmic meditation or 'om' method. Actress Karen Lorre claims orgasmic meditation, or 'OMing' enables her to be more sensitive  - both physically and emotionally - appreciate men and experience multiple orgasms in a day. OMing is taught in 'orgasmic meditation centres' called OneTaste by long-time practitioner and founder Nicole Daedone. Scroll down for video . Actress Karen Lorre (pictured) claims orgasmic meditation, or 'Oming' enables her to be more sensitive and appreciate men as well as to experience up to 11 orgasms in one day . She believes that the orgasm fundamentally . roots the capacity for connection between people, 'hormonally, . emotionally and spiritually' and insists that her classes focus on this . rather than the goal of achieving orgasm. It is thought that one in 10 women never reach orgasm but Ms Lore is not one of them. Ms Lorre, 51, from Long Beach California, is a former Playmate and describes herself as a model, 'fun coach and love goddess,' as well as an actress, who has appeared in numerous TV programmes including Cheers and the X-Files. She told Medical Daily: 'I was already in a place of bliss - I had . been doing sit down meditation for 20 years but [OMing] opened up my ability . to sense more and more subtle things and my appreciation for men.' OMing is a 15-minute practice between two people where both people focus all their attention on the  techniques used and sensations created when bringing a female to orgasm. In a video of a class, one 'student' called Rachel said she was told at the age of 25 that she could not orgasm but disproved the diagnosis having attended orgasmic meditation classes. She said: 'I felt a moment of electricity and thought that's what it feels like to be a woman - to be that safe and comfortable with another human being.' Ms Daedone said the idea of the practice is similar to Buddhist . Tantric sex, which aims is to extend the peak and like conventional . meditation, oming affects the same parts of the human brain. While it is possible to 'OM' individually or in private, OneTaste controversially organises 'OM circles', which is the group practice of orgasmic meditation. The website says partners can set up a 'nest' and have a 15 minute oming session before sharing their experiences. Dr Pooja Lakshmin, an associate researcher at a Rutgers University who studies orgasms, said: 'The same parts of the brain that are activated during deep meditative states get activated during orgasm.' She believes the way in which people think about the female orgasm is limited and the mechanics of what happen when a female reaches climax is not fully understood. Ms Daedone founded the OneTaste centres having had a tantric experience at a friend's party. Rachel is pictured who said she was told at the age of 25 that she could not orgasm but has since mastered 'Oming'. Nicole Daedone, founding or orgasmic meditation centres, believes orgasm fundamentally roots the capacity for connection between people . She said: 'The experience that I had was everything . that I had in sitting medication; cosmic connection, bliss, all of those . things.' She claimed that it was the most profound human connection she had ever experienced. While Ms Daedone accepts that the idea of Oming and Oming classes might seem strange to many people, she said that while Yoga was unusual in the West 30 years ago, it is now common and orgasmic meditation could become usual activities too. She established the first centre in San Francisco and now has 10 centres across the world, including a group in London.","Actress Karen Lorre claims orgasmic meditation enables her to be more sensitive and appreciate men as well as experiencing multiple orgasms .

Weeks to live: Kirstie Tancock was told she was close to death for the second time in two years when her body rejected her first transplant . A 23-year-old pole dancing instructor with cystic fibrosis has today had her second double lung transplant in just two years. Kirstie Tancock was told she had weeks to live without a new transplant, after her body rejected the first pair. Doctors warned Mrs Tancock that the chances of finding a suitable donor for a second time were slim, but miraculously found a donor within hours. The transplant team said chances of success were blighted by Mrs Tancock's high levels of antibodies, which suggest that a transplant could be rejected. Mrs Tancock, who became the face of organ donation in the Devon area in a Lifesavers campaign, was sedated today following the successful operation. Her husband Stuart thanked the doctors who had worked on the transplant and said the operation, 'went well'. Before the transplant Mrs Tancock said: 'I have the delight in telling you all that I'm going down to surgery for my second double lung transplant. 'I've . kept that secret all night!

An animal lover who befriended a stray puppy while volunteering in Cambodia raised £3,000 to have it flown back to England. Elise Dixie, 26, flew the sick mongrel more than 6,200 miles back to the UK after she cared for it while she was away. The 26-year-old first met the dog when it had lost most of its hair and had a distended stomach before she set off on a fishing trip. Elise Dixie, 26, pulled out all the stops to bring two-month-old mongrel Snooky back to the UK . She saw the two-month-old dog again on her return to the beach and looked after it in the hostel where she was staying between last September and December. Miss Dixie paid for the puppy to be treated by a vet who told her that it was only two weeks from death as it was in such a poor condition. She then arranged for the puppy, which she named Snooky, to be cared for by the Phnom Penh Animal Welfare Society when she returned to Felixstowe, Suffolk. Snooky is now getting used to life at the Suffolk seaside after the 17 hour journey from Cambodia . Miss Dixie received regular updates about . its progress from animal shelter staff before deciding to fly the dog . back to her home. She raised the cash with the help of her parents Gerard and Sue Dixie to fly back to pay for her to Cambodia so she could collect the puppy and bring it to the UK. Snooky is now getting used to life at the Suffolk seaside after the 17 hour journey from Cambodia. Miss Dixie, who works at a school in Ipswich, said: 'I was certain he wouldn't know who I was - but he was so happy to see me, wagging his tail. 'I was bawling my eyeballs out. He's a great dog and everyone loves him so much.' Miss Dixie said the puppy was one of many strays roaming around when she first saw it. She said: 'He was so tiny and in an absolutely dreadful state. 'He had this chain round his neck which was cutting into his neck, and he looked emaciated and his stomach was all distended. 'He had severe mange and no fur - totally bald, and just kept scratching his skin. 'We managed to get some bolt croppers and cut the chain off, and a vet later told me Snooky had been two weeks from death. 'It's a completely different culture over there - they don't have dogs as pets like we do. 'They eat dogs, and dogs that roam are likely to be attacked and killed by other dogs. 'I just couldn't let that happen. I took him with me back to the hostel and immediately tried to find a vet to help him.' The teacher looked after Snooky in the hostel where she was staying in Cambodia . She said she became increasingly frantic as she tried to find a charity or rescue centre to take care of the puppy before she left. Eventually Nicky Scales at the Phnom Penh Animal Welfare Society (PPAWS) agreed to help find him a home. Miss Dixie said: 'I reluctantly handed him over. 'I know it will sound stupid to anyone who has not got a relationship with animals like my mum and I, but I don't think I could have come home without PPAWS taking him - it was such a relief. 'When I got home mum and I had a bawl together. I just knew I had to bring him home here. 'People will say why that dog, why not one from the RSPCA or Blue Cross, which we also support.

A great-grandmother has used a tablet computer to distract her during knee replacement surgery instead of being sedated. Janet Blank, 65, is the first patient to choose the distraction method during surgery at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. Ms Blank was awake and ‘heard everything’ during her total knee replacement, which she had under spinal anaesthesia last Friday. A great-grandmother has used a tablet computer to distract her during knee replacement surgery instead of being sedated . During the two-hour procedure, the great-grandmother-of-10 used an iPad to listen to her favourite radio show. The benefits of avoiding sedation drugs include reducing sickness, drowsiness, and confusion after operations. Surgeons are also able to communicate with the patient during procedures. Ms Blank, who works at a local care home, said she would recommend the technique to anyone. ‘I heard everything, the hammer and drill but it didn’t bother me at all,’ she said. ‘I didn’t feel any pain and I actually watched the screen when they put the nerve block down my leg which was fascinating. ‘I went to the recovery room after the operation and then straight up to the ward. I’d advise it to anyone. ‘I didn’t actually watch TV as I . prefer the radio so I asked to listen to BBC Devon, the Judi Spiers . show, as she’s always good and makes me laugh.’ Janet Blank, 65, is the first patient to choose the distraction method during surgery at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth . The new iPad was on loan from the South West Regional Anaesthesia Group. Matt Oldman, consultant anaesthetist, said: ‘By avoiding sedating anaesthetic drugs during the procedure we can reduce side effects such as sickness, post-op drowsiness and confusion. ‘Staying awake may also be a safer option for patients with certain medical conditions. Another added advantage is that the surgeon can communicate with the patient during the procedure. ‘The use of spinal anaesthetics for this type of surgery is not new but until now we have not had anything to offer our patients as a distraction, and as a result many patients have opted to have sedation throughout the procedure to avoid hearing or seeing anything. ‘Typically, the procedures last between one and two hours, which is a long time to expect someone to lie still. But with the new iPads we can offer a choice of music, films and television using the trust’s free Wi-Fi.’ Ms Blank is looking forward to returning to her twice weekly gym classes and being kept busy by her 18 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. ‘I’m glad to get it over and done with. I’ve been in a lot of pain, and especially leading up to the operation, but I won’t give in to it. It’s much better now,’ she added.","Janet Blank, 65, was the first patient to choose the distraction method during surgery at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth .

Hero: Reverend Patrick Dowling, pictured, who works with the Diocese of Jefferson County, was the religious figure who appeared at the side of Katie Lentz, 19, after she was injured in a head-on collision on August 4 . The mystery priest who anointed a young car crash victim and then vanished before rescue workers could thank him has been identified as Reverend Patrick Dowling who works with the Diocese of Jefferson County, Missouri. Dowling revealed he was the religious figure who appeared at the side of Katie Lentz, 19, after she was injured in a head-on collision on August 4, in a comment under a story on a Catholic news website on Friday evening, but his confession went largely unnoticed until Monday. The incredible story went viral as some assumed the mystery priest was an angel or deceased Catholic saint Padre Pio, had persuasive powers of conversion and could heal the sick. But Dowling, under the article on the National Catholic Register site, explained he was in fact responsible for the apparent divine intervention. He said he had been filling in for a sick priest at Mass and was on his way home when he came upon the crash scene. Authorities had closed off the area and were re-routing traffic but Dowling waited until he could get closer. 'I parked behind a large vehicle about 150 yards from the scene. I asked the Sheriff's permission and approached the scene of the accident,' Dowling said. 'I absolved and anointed Katie, and, at her request, prayed that her leg would not hurt. Then I stepped aside to where some rescue personnel and the pilot were waiting, and prayed the rosary silently.' He said he left the wreckage just as the helicopter was about to leave to take Katie to hospital. Interestingly, he said he told someone on the scene his name but it must not have been passed on. He then thanked the hard work of the first responders. Mangled Wreck: Emergency workers were struggling to save Katie Lentz when she was hit head-on by a drunk driver on Highway 19 near to Center, Missouri . Prayer: When emergency workers could not free her - Katie Lentz asked them to stop so that a prayer could be said . 'God has blessed your work. I hope the credit goes where it is due,' he explained. In a statement to The Blaze, a . spokesman for the diocese, Deacon Dan Joyce, confirmed Dowling was . indeed the faith healer responsible. 'Fr. Dowling said that he is pleased that he was able to help by performing . his ministry and noted that that he was just one of many who responded . to assist the victim at the accident,' the statement reads. 'He . and the Diocese wish to acknowledge and thank the first responders, . medical team and law enforcement personnel for their efforts that . morning in aid of the young woman injured in the accident. Fr. Dowling, a native of Kilkenny, Ireland, was ordained a priest of the . Diocese of Jefferson City in 1982 and has served at parishes in Moberly, . Monroe City, Indian Creek, Milan, Unionville and Eldon, Missouri, and . in the diocese’s mission parishes in Marcona and Nasca, Peru. He is currently serving in prison ministry and in parish ministry to Spanish-speaking Catholics. Missouri Savior? Many had speculated online that Padre Pio who was said to be blessed with many supernatural powers during his life time was the priest who helped Katie Lentz on Highway 19 on Sunday . Effort: The desperate effort to save Katie Lentz was blessed by the Catholic priest who appeared from nowhere and just as mysteriously vanished . Emergency workers had been battling for an hour and a half to free Lentz after the head on collision, but to no avail. But . as they joined hands the priest appeared, even though there were no . bystanders and the road was blocked, who offered a prayer and an . instruction to the rescuers that they would now be able to free her. Suddenly, heavy equipment needed to cut . through the metal arrived from a nearby town and Lentz was pulled from the wreck in time to . be saved - but when they turned to thank Dowling, he was gone. 'He came up and approached the patient, and offered a prayer,' Chief Raymond Reed said of the then-mystery priest to KHQA-TV. 'It was a Catholic priest who had anointing oil with him. A sense of calmness came over her, and it did us as well. 'I can’t be for certain how it was said, but myself and another firefighter, we very plainly heard that we should remain calm, that our tools would now work and that we would get her out of that vehicle.' Divine Intervention: Katie Lentz was saved after emergency workers from Hannibal fire services arrived with heavy duty cutting equipment . That is when officers from the . neighboring Hannibal Fire Department arrived with their jaws-of-life and . Lentz was pulled to safety and put into an air ambulance to hospital. Turning to thank the guardian angel who had arrived from nowhere at their lowest ebb, the emergency crews could not find him. The highway had been blocked for a . quarter of a mile each end during the hour and a half rescue and no . bystanders and parked cars were anywhere near the crash site on Highway . 19 near Center. 'We would like to find this gentleman and be able to thank him,' Reed said before Dowling identified himself. 'As a first responder, you don't know what you're going to run into. We have a lot of tools, and we have intensive training. In this particular case, it is my feeling that it was nothing more than sheer faith and nothing short of a miracle.' Lentz suffered several broken bones . to repair her legs, but her friends and family say that her spirit has . been boosted by the somewhat divine intervention. Scene: Dozens of emergency workers battled to free Katie Lentz as she lay pinned in her Mercedes wreck on Highway 19 . Saved: Chief Raymond Reed said that the Catholic priest, now identified as Patrick Dowling, made everyone including Katie Lentz calmer before the jaw-of-life appeared from Hannibal . 'Both of her legs are very damaged,' Lentz's friend Amanda Wiseman said. 'Her wrist is broken, several broken ribs, so she's had a lot of broken bones to deal with.' Chief Raymond Reed said rescue crews were struggling to cut through the strong metal of Lentz's Mercedes. 'It was a very well-built car, and when you compact materials like that one, they become even stronger because you're cutting through multiple things instead of one layer,' Reed said. Reed says Lentz was pinned in between . the steering wheel and the seat and the prayer was offered just as he . was told by the paramedics that Lentz was failing. 'Where did this guy come from?' Lentz's friend Travis Wiseman asked. The driver of the other car in that . accident, Aaron Smith, has been charged with a DWI, second degree . assault and failure to drive on the right half of the roadway.

The corgi, Ripley, met the little rabbit one day while she was out walking with her owner, Lareina Tan. After that, whenever Ripley left the house in West Lafayette, Indiana, for a walk, the bunny would pop up, ready to play. Close encounter: Ripley the corgi meets her new little friend . Cottontail: The tiny bunny popped its head out of the grass when Ripley came close . No fear: The bunny jumped onto Ripley's paw as she lay in the grass . Unlikely friendship: Dog and bunny take a turn together around the residential street where Ripley lives with her owner . 'This has happened two days in a row. We'd take the corgi out to potty, and she'd go sniffing around. Bunny pops out, play-date starts,' Tan wrote on Reddit. 'I was lucky enough to have my phone on me the third time this happened.' Tan was slightly concerned her dog, who is named after Ellen Ripley from the Hollywood movie Alien, might hurt the rabbit, but realized after watching the pair that she had no intention of injuring her new playmate. 'The bunny ran around in circles around us instead of away, and jumped onto Ripley's front paw while she was sitting. I want to believe the bunny chose to hang with her,' wrote Tan. Instincts: A terrier bred for hunting might have attacked a tiny bunny like this, but Ripley the corgi just wants to play . Thumper: The bunny bounds along happily beside Ripley . Out for a stroll: The cute pair look perfectly at ease in each other's company as they scamper about together . Believe it or not: Ripley was named after Sigourney Weaver's character in the Alien films . Corgis are of Welsh origin, trained to herd animals. They're reportedly one of the few breeds that can herd geese. Perhaps Ripley's herding instincts were at work as she rounded the bunny up off the road and towards the sidewalk. Dog tales: Ripley looks extremely pleased with herself as she hangs out with her rabbit friend . Leap of faith: Ripley looks around for the bunny after jumping up onto the curb . Gentle nudge: The corgi seems to be trying to encourage the bunny to jump up onto the sidewalk with her . This cute encounter could have had a different outcome if the tiny bunny had met a different dog. 'Ripley is pretty much one of the least threatening dogs around... it could be because she grew up with a huge bunny and a hamster,' wrote Tan. The bunny hopped off after Tan called Ripley inside, but she doesn't think that's the last Ripley will see of the rabbit. Tan hopes that as the rabbit grows older, it will build its nest nearby so that Ripley and her new mate can maintain their friendship - and she can take more cute photos.","Corgi called Ripley has struck up an unlikely relationship with a rabbit .

Muriel Edwin, 62, from Hulland Ward in Derbyshire, said her fondness for cow-themed trinkets 'snowballed' over the years from the odd clock or pair of slippers into a staggering collection of more than 2,000 items. The widow's hoard has now grown so large that almost every inch of her flat above the Black Horse pub is now stuffed with cuddly toys, pictures, ceramic figurines, and even a cow-shaped kettle. Cow crazy: Derbyshire pub landlady Muriel Edwin, 62, has spent around £10,000 on cow memorabilia - including these three life-sized ceramic models . Passion: The widow is so obsessed with collecting cows that every room of her flat above the pub is stuffed with pictures, cuddly toys, clocks, mugs and slippers . Mrs Edwin's collection - which includes three life-sized ceramic cows and a calf on her front lawn - is now so well known she has even had a coach-load of tourists knock on her door to ask for a tour of her home. 'My obsession . started off with a mug here and a pair of slippers there and it just . snowballed when I moved into the pub,' said Mrs Edwin - who said her fondness for cows once earned her the nickname 'Moo'.'I've just always loved cows, and have spent thousands and thousands on them over the years - well over £10,000. 'But it's my hobby, it makes me happy and it's not hurting anyone - so I keep on collecting,' she said.'My nickname used to be Moo and my maiden name was Brown, so you can imagine the ""how now brown cow"" jokes I used to get.'

'Thousands and thousands have been spent . on them over the years- £50 here and £100 there, it all adds up,' she . said of her collection. 'It just snowballed': Everything from clocks to crockery to bed spreads and even a toilet seat are emblazoned with cows at Mrs Edwin's Derbyshire home . Hobby: The hearth in front of Mrs Edwin's fireplace is home to enough cows to fill a farmyard . Mrs Edwin said the family of ceramic cows standing proudly outside the pub - each of which cost around £1,000 - had become a 'landmark' in the village. 'I fully accept that if I move house, not all of the cows would be able to come with me, but I could never get rid of the big ones outside, which my husband bought me. I don't expect any new neighbours would like them, but they would just have to put up with it. 'The amount of times the big cows have been photographed is out of this world. Kids love them, adults love them- I've even had whole coach parties spot the cows outside and come upstairs to see my collection.' Mrs Edwin said she has no plans to change the name of the pub to what some might say would be a more appropriate title; the Black Cow. 'You have to keep some things separate. They aren't work related, the cows are the switch off mode,' she said. 'I love the quirkiness of it, and it's nice at the end of the day to be surrounded by the cows, which are completely different from my work.'","Muriel Edwin, 62, has filled her Derbyshire home with cow-themed trinkets .

A 14-year-old who killed his 78-year-old great grandmother with a hatchet broke down sobbing in court as he was sentenced on Monday. Antonio Barbeau has been sentenced to spend at least 36 years in jail over the murder, making him eligible for parole when he is 50-years-old. Barbeau tried reading an apologetic statement but started crying, passing it off to his defense attorney who also had to fight back tears while doing his best to read the statement. Crying in court: Antonio Barbeau had tears running down his face when he was sentenced to at least 36 years behind bars on Monday after his killing of his great grandmother . Breaking down: Both Barbeau and his attorney George Limbeck were in tears as they tried to read out his apologetic statement to his relatives in court . Barbeau and his friend Nathan Paape were previously found guilty of killing Barbara Olson in her Sheboygan, Wisconsin home using a hatchet . She invited them into her home and as she turned her back to call Barbeau's mother, Barbeau hit her on the head with the hatchet, the Shaboygan Press reported. He said he then ran to the bathroom as he was feeling sick but that when he emerged, he saw Paape hit the woman with the hammer multiple times. Judge Timothy Van Akkeren said that the sentence was 'the minimum' based on the crime, which he described as 'nothing short of horrific'. In for a long time: The earliest Barbeau, 14, will be able to be up for parole is in 36 years when he is 50 . 'In my 24 years on the bench, I’ve not seen anything of this nature. Not even close,' he said during his ruling. The court held that Barbeau had a brain injury from a 2009 car accident that left him with 'unspecified cognitive disorder' that played a role in his decision to commit a crime. That mental issue was not enough to disregard the brutal nature of the murder. 'I feel bad for the family. I know they love him. But this type of crime cannot go unanswered and be explained away by brain trauma,' district attorney Joe DeCecco said. 'The kid’s life is gone. He has to wait until he’s 50. He won’t be anything like he is today. But that’s the way it is.' Testimony: Antonio Barbeau, pictured at an earlier court appearance, raises his hand to take the oath before testifying during a trial for his friend Nathan Paape, with whom he allegedly killed his great-grandmother last year . 'Accomplice': Nathan Paape, Barbeau's friend who was a co-conspirator in the attack, has pleaded not guilty . Weapon: Sheboygan Falls Police officer Nicole Schmelter holds up an axe allegedly from the crime . The teen's grandmother- who is the daughter of his victim- read a statement of her own that also had Barbeau weeping. 'My . mom was not a vindictive person. She would want (Antonio) to have a . chance to be a better person, to have hope, to have something to work . towards,' grandmother Judy Offut said according to the Sheboygan Press. Victim: Barbara Olson, 78, was found in a pool of blood at her home last September . The . killer's account came in stark contrast with Barbeau's friend Nathan . Paape's version of events, the Shaboygan Press reported. Paape claimed the robbery and . murder were Barbeau's idea and that he only hit Olson twice . with a hammer because he feared his friend would turn on him. Paape . thought Barbeau was joking about killing Olson, his lawyer said. But . Barbeau said his friend never suggested he thought it was a joke. He has pleaded not guilty but if convicted, he faces life in prison and a minimum 20 years in prison. Olson's body was found in a pool of blood outside her home last September. Once . the teens realized Olson was dead after the horrific attack, they . attempted to drag her body to the car, leaving a trail on blood through . the house, police said last September. After failing to load Olson into the vehicle, they dumped her in the garage. The boys then allegedly stole several items, including a purse, loose change and jewelry. The . perpetrators then hopped into Olson's car and sped off. They eventually . dumped the vehicle in the parking lot of a local bowling alley and . walked to a nearby eatery, where they shared a pizza.

The father of the three-year-old Cherokee girl at the center of a tug-of-war dispute turned himself in to authorities on Monday but refused extradition to South Carolina. That's where Veronica's adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco live and where state authorities have finalized Veronica's adoption and charged Brown with 'custodial interference' for refusing to turn over the girl. 'This is my daughter,' Brown said, according to Anderson Cooper 360. 'It isn't a yoyo I borrowed for two years.' Scroll down for video... Handed Himself Over: Dusten Brown (left and right with his daughter Veronica on Monday). She is set to be returned to her adoptive parents and Brown handed himself over to authorities this afternoon in Oklahoma . Relieved: Melanie and Matt Capobianco stand side by side before a news conference on James Island, S.C., on Monday, August 12th, 2013 . Relieved: Melanie and Matt Capobianco stand side by side before a news conference on James Island, S.C., on Monday, August 12th, 2013 . Couple: Matt and Melanie Capobianco have been awarded custody of the girl they brought up from 2009 . Brown posted $10,000 bond and was released at 11am Monday, according to Oklahoma's Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office. Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation, was charged over the weekend with custodial interference after failing to appear at a court-ordered meeting in South Carolina. He's now refused extradition without a governor's warrant from South Carolina. Brown's lawyer, Robert Nigh, said his client is caught between competing jurisdictions and is 'making every effort to do the right thing for himself and his daughter.' Nigh refused to say where Brown is currently. He's due in court again in 30 days. The James Island, South Carolina parents, meanwhile, have been trying to adopt Veronica since her birth in 2009. after which they raised the girl for two years. But Brown has had custody of his daughter since 2011, when South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled that a 1978 federal law written to ensure Native American children stay with Native American parents gave him preference over the Capobiancos. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law does not apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of Veronica and abandoned her before birth. Native American tribes across the U.S. see the case as a test of tribal sovereignty which could set a precedent for other adoptions . Veronica, her biological father Dusten Brown, feed their geese and ducks at his home in Oklahoma where she has lived for the past 19 months . Veronica is in the care of her paternal grandparents and Dusten Brown's wife, Robin Brown. Earlier Monday, the Capobiancos called on federal law enforcement to help them bring the child to South Carolina, saying they'll take the matter into their own hands if necessary. 'Send someone to the location our daughter is being held and work with us to bring her home. No more delays and no more excuses,' Matt Capobianco said during a news conference. 'Our daughter has been kidnapped, and I expect the situation to be treated as such.' In the middle: Veronica has been caught in an ongoing tug of war custody battle for most of her young life . 'I'm always going to be her daddy': Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011 . Brown had never met his daughter and, after Veronica's non-Indian mother rebuffed his marriage proposal, played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the girl was born. The legal proceedings began when Brown found out Veronica was going to be adopted. He objected and said the Indian Child Welfare Act favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions. The Capobiancos appealed the South Carolina Supreme Court's 2011 decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it ruled in June that South Carolina courts should decide who gets to adopt Veronica. The state court said the Capobiancos should raise the girl. Last week, South Carolina Family Court Judge Daniel Martin finalized the couple's adoption, approving a transition plan detailing a gradual process for reintroducing the girl to the Capobiancos. South Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Brown's arrest Saturday, charging Brown with custodial interference for failing to appear with the girl for a court-ordered meeting with the Capobiancos on August 4th — a date the couple has said was set by the judge and to which Brown's attorneys did not object.","Melanie and Matt Capobianco of James Island, S.C., have been trying to .

An anonymous donor has handed a Jane Austen museum £100,000 so that it may try and buy one of the author's rings back from U.S. singer Kelly Clarkson who wants to take it out of Britain. Earlier this month, the British government placed a temporary export ban on the gold-and-turquoise ring in the hope that money could be found to keep it in Britain. The Jane Austen's House museum said it had raised £103,200 of the £152,450 asking price since launching a fundraising campaign on Friday, most of it from a single anonymous donation. The gold and turquoise ring once owned by Jane Austen has been stopped by the Government from leaving the country . The Jane Austen's House museum said it had raised £103,200 of the £152,450 asking price since launching a fundraising campaign . 'We are two-thirds of the way there in 48 hours, which is tremendous, but we're not there yet,' said museum fundraiser Louise West. The author of 'Pride and Prejudice,' who died at age 41 in 1817, left the ring to her sister Cassandra. It remained in the family until it was sold at a Sotheby's auction last year. The museum at Austen's former home in Chawton, Hampshire, had hoped to buy the ring last year but was outbid when it sold for five times the estimated price. Clarkson - an Austen fan who owns a first edition of the author's novel 'Persuasion' - was the successful buyer. Kelly Clarkson has agreed to sell the author's ring should a buyer come forward and offer her the same price she bought it for . But she has been prevented from taking the ring home to the U.S. by a power that allows the British government to temporarily halt the export of works judged to be national treasures. The museum has until December to raise the rest of the money, and Clarkson has agreed to sell the ring should a buyer come forward. West said the situation is a shame for Clarkson, 'but the ring should stay in this country, because there is so little of Austen's personal effects left.' West said the museum had invited the 2002 'American Idol' winner to come visit the next time she is in Britain. She said Clarkson's interest in the author was another sign that Austen's popularity remains strong, 200 years after she published her most famous novel, Pride and Prejudice. 'It is very good for Jane Austen PR that a young, famous American pop star expresses a love for her,' West said. Jane was the daughter of a clergyman and had seven siblings. She was born in Steventon, Hampshire. She began to write as a teenager, which would later lead to her publishing a variety of novels, the first being Sense and Sensibility'. Among her famous works were Northanger Abbey, Emma and Mansfield Park. In 1801 the family moved to Bath, but following her father's death in 1805 Jane, her sister Cassandra and their mother moved several times eventually settling in Chawton, near Steventon. The museum has launched a campaign to buy the ring back.

First sold by the Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York, the croissant-doughnut that took over the city’s SoHo neighborhood earlier this year can now be made from the comfort of your own kitchen. The good news? You don’t need any croissants, doughnuts or an alarm clock. Behold: Dominique Ansel's cronuts can now be had without hours on line or by paying through the nose on Craigslist . The ingredients for the dough are all fairly common: Butter, an egg, flour, milk, salt, sugar, water and yeast. A fancy French market isn’t necessary, any supermarket will do. According to the recipe from Googly Gooeys, the first step is to combine the salt, yeast butter, flour and sugar and blend in a food processor while heating the milk and water on a stove. Once thoroughly blended and combined with an egg, the ingredients should go in the refrigerator while the dough rises. While the yeast is doing its thing, it’s time to make the filling. Combine eggs, sugar, flour and your fruit of choice, in this case oranges, and heat all ingredients thoroughly. Once your filling is ready, your dough should be good to go. Easy as pie: You too can make Cronuts by following this diagram . What line?: Standing on-line for Cronuts is so last-month . Remove it from the fridge, roll it out and dust with flour before folding it over three times and cutting the cronuts using a doughnut cutter. Next up is the most fun part! Deep fry each side at 160 degrees Celsius for about one minute while dumping strawberries, icing sugar, egg white and lemon into a blender for your frosting. The icing should be ready by the time the cronuts cool down. Put it all together and you’ll be ready to brag to your friends . Invented by French baker Dominique Ansel and sold at his SoHo bakery since June, cronuts fans spend hours each morning on line to buy the famous pastries - which usually sell out shortly after the bakery's 8am opening. Cronuts have even spawned an underground economy, with pricey delivery services springing up on Craigslist.","The always-sold-out pastries can now be made from the comfort of your own kitchen .

Detectives fear that inmates who escaped from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, the al-Kwyfah facility in Libya and a number of other jails intend to hit British and other Western targets around the festival of Eid – which takes place this week.

The city of Johannesburg has apologised to Nelson Mandela after he was mistakenly sent a warning that his water and electricity would be cut off. Municipal authorities said the notice was incorrectly sent to the home of the former freedom fighter, who was the first black president of South Africa.

Now Clark and Miss Mei are being more open about their burgeoning romance. In an interview in September 2010 with the Wall Street Journal, Miss Mei revealed she was living with a boyfriend in New York, but said she did not feel pressure to get married, adding: 'It's like a rule of thumb: You have to live with them before you decide. 'Marriage is not something that has to happen.' However, in an interview  last year, she said that she was single. A witness told The New York Post that the new couple were spotted making slight public displays of affection during a recent trip to the Hamptons. The witness said they 'looked very affectionate, it was clear they were a couple. They were holding hands, they were not trying to hide their relationship.'

The father of the 16-year-old rescued in the Idaho back country after being kidnapped by a family friend who killed her brother and mother today asked for privacy so his daughter could heal from her 'horrific ordeal'. Brett Anderson spoke for the first time since his daughter Hannah was rescued over the weekend - six days after she was abducted by James DiMaggio, who was said to be infatuated with the teen. He thanked law enforcement officials, the media, anyone who spread the word about the teen's disappearance and the four horse back riders who tipped off authorities after stumbling across DiMaggio and his daughter last week. Time to grieve: Brett Anderson, the father of kidnap victim Hannah Anderson, 16, speaks to the media following his return to San Diego, California, on August 12, 2013 . San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said earlier this week that Hannah 'did not appear to be held against her will' Tribute: Brett Anderson wore a T-shirt with the names of his wife and son on the back - whose bodies were found in DiMaggio's burning home on Sunday . 'It is time for us to grieve and move on to the healing process,' he said. 'I respectfully ask you to give us the time to allow this to happen. 'As for my daughter, the healing process will be slow. She has been through a tremendous and horrific ordeal and I am very proud of her.' Though it has been alleged that Hannah was not being held against her will, Sheriff Bill Gore stressed today the teen was under 'extreme duress' and was the victim in the abduction. Hannah Anderson was found on Sunday by federal agents, who were tipped off by four horseback riders who last week stumbled upon the teen and James DiMaggio. 'It is clear from the information we’ve received, that she was . under extreme duress. She was taken out of the county, out of the state, . clearly against her will,' Sheriff Bill Gore said. It also emerged today that DiMaggio fired at least one shot at FBI rescuers before agents killed him. DiMaggio, 40, killed Hannah’s mother Christina Anderson and her eight-year-old brother, Ethan, whose bodies were discovered on Sunday in the suspect's burning home in eastern San Diego County. DiMaggio was shot and killed on Saturday during the confrontation with police. Hannah was reunited with her father on Saturday. Sheriff Gore told FOX5 San Diego: 'The kidnapper, the murderer is dead. Our focus now is getting Hannah . all the resources, the help she needs to get through this extremely . traumatic ordeal that she’s been through. 'Plus, let’s not lose sight of the fact that she’s lost her mother and . her brother, which she was not aware of until she was recovered up in . Idaho.' Lifesavers: Mary Young, top left, Mark Young, top right, Mark John, bottom right and Christa John talk with GMA about stumbling across Hannah Anderson and DiMaggio . The four 'hero' horseback riders . spoke to GMA this morning about what drove them to call police after . seeing Hannah with DiMaggio during her six-day ordeal. Mark . John, a former county sheriff and U.S. Army Ranger, said: 'They did not . fit in with that kind of country. They were not dressed correctly and . were extremely quiet. Hannah had a bad look about her face.' Mark Young, who was there with his wife Mary, said: 'She had a lot of fear in her eyes.' His wife Christa John said: 'She looked like a teenage daughter who was made to go with her dad. Their rucksacks were brand new.' 'She was worn out and neither of them . wanted to talk which is unusual in the back country, usually people . want to talk. We are just happy that everything has turned out alright.' The two couples spoke to Good Morning America, following the rescue of the teen, who had been sharing a small tent with DiMaggio when she was found. Their strange behavior set off alarm bells to the horseback riders. John called the police in Idaho upon his return home, which led to the discovery of DiMaggio's car hidden by tree branches at the edge of the Frank Church wilderness trail. Sheriff's officials told NBC San Diego that Hannah's mother Christina Anderson, recently separated from her husband, had a 'close platonic relationship' with DiMaggio. He had an 'unusual infatuation' with Hannah, they said . Discovery: Police found DiMaggio's car, covered with brush and stripped of license plates, at a trail head at the edge of the Frank Church wilderness which triggered a massive search . No Idaho outdoorsman: This undated photo released by Andrew Spanswick, a friend of James Lee DiMaggio, shows DiMaggio posing for a photo during a camping trip in the Ten Lake's region of Yosemite National Park, California . Suspicious: Mark John and his wife were among the four riders who spotted Hannah Anderson in the backcountry of Idaho and called police . Spotted a killer: (left to right) Mary Young, Mike Young, Mark John and Christa John, all from Sweet, Idaho, speak with the media during a news conference at the Ada County Sheriff's Office in Boise, Idaho . Evidence: DiMaggio's car is towed away from the start of the trail where it was found on Friday . 'He was like a square peg going into a . round hole, he didn't fit,' Mr John said yesterday. 'He might have been an . outsdoorsman in California, but he wasn't an outdoorsman in Idaho.' The four friends are being credited with leading authorities to kidnapped Hannah and to the fugitive DiMaggio, who is believed to have murdered the teenage girl's mother and eight-year-old brother. When Mr John noticed young Hannah and sweatpants soaking her feet in the lake he joked that she should pull her feet out because she's scaring the fish. As he rode off down the trail, he said she could be heard remarking to herself, 'I guess we're all in trouble now.' It's unclear what she meant by the cryptic remark. She appeared to try to hide her face as the riders passed, Mr John said. Another of the horseback riders said he encountered DiMaggio and Hannah moments later and saw 40-year-old DiMaggio with his arm around the high school girl's waist. The four horseback riders, who had been fishing the same remote late in the Idaho wilderness for years, said the entire scene made them profoundly suspicious an they talked about it throughout the night. Ordeal: Hannah Anderson's grandparents were in 'complete shock' that DiMaggio would commit the crimes he has . In trouble: This undated shot shows DiMaggio posing for a photo during a camping trip in the Ten Lake's region of Yosemite National Park. The four campers who witnessed DiMaggio and Anderson said they seemed unprepared . Spotted: Horseback riders tipped police off after seeing DiMaggio, left, and Hannah hiking on Wednesday . Hunt for a murderer: FBI agents walk toward a Blackhawk helicopter at the Cascade Airport during the search for James DiMaggio in Cascade, Idaho . 1,000 miles from home: James DiMaggio's car was found in a remote area near Cascade, Idaho, on Friday morning . It wasn't until the four friends got home on Wednesday night and turned on the television that they realized the importance of their encounter. An Amber Alert flashed across the screen, showing DiMaggio and Hannah, as being wanted by authorities in California. 'I told my wife, that is that girl we seen on the mountain,' Mr John said. Their tip led the FBI Hostage Rescue Team to zero-in on DiMaggio's campsite. The agents rescued Hannah, who was recovered unharmed. They shot dead DiMaggio, who was unarmed, and who had been trying to 'fortify' his remote campsite. DiMaggio is suspected of killing Hannah's mother Christina - who thought of him as a friend - and Hannah's eight-year-old brother Ethan. Hannah Anderson's grandparents say the identity of the man accused in her kidnapping and the murder of her mother and brother came as 'complete shock' and reveal she is expected to be hospitalized for some time. 'He was Uncle Jim. We had known him for years when Hannah was born,' Ralph Britt told NBC. Search: Law enforcement officers have shot dead James DiMaggio and rescued the teenage girl he abducted . Rugged: The River of No Return Wilderness, 2.3million acres, is the second-largest national wilderness area in the contiguous United States . Victims: Ethan Anderson, 8, was murdered in California and his sister Hannah, 16, was abducted . DiMaggio is said to have had a 'crush' on Hannah and took her on a trip to Hollywood last year. He mentioned this fact to the riders in an attempt to explain why he and the young girl were deep in the Idaho wilderness. He told them, 'She got to pick where we went last year, she wanted to go to Hollywood in Los Angeles.' The implication was that this year, he got to pick and they took a rugged camping trip. Mr John said that the spot where the riders found DiMaggio and Hannah was a remote and deep in the wilderness. DiMaggio had picked a spot for the tent high on a ridge that was far from the water, Mr John said. It appeared that they had been at the site for about a day and had not had a campfire.","Kidnapper James DiMaggio shot dead as officers tried to arrest him .

A fraudster couple who used £1.1million stolen from a hospital to fund their decadent lifestyle were jailed yesterday. Anne and Andrew Baker spent the money on landscaping their garden and installing cascading waterfalls and fountains at their Grade II-listed ‘dream home’. The couple also bought a luxury villa in Turkey with the cash Anne Baker stole from her job at the  Princess Grace Hospital in Marylebone, West London. Andrew Baker and Anne Baker, pictured outside Southwark Crown Court, were jailed for 10 years between them for a 13-year scam which saw them gain £1.1million in hospital funds . Splashing out: The couple spent a large chunk of the money in the grounds of their 2.5 acre Cornwall home, Manderley . Grand: Mr and Mrs Baker spent money of fountains and waterfalls for the gardens of their home, which is a popular wedding venue . Thousands of pounds were hidden in . Turkish bank accounts and £25,000 was stashed in a gun cupboard at their . 16th-century home, where the Bakers also kept two Jaguar sports cars . and an Aston Martin. Baker, 61, stole the money in a . ‘breathtaking’ 13-year fraud which saw her pocket four times her salary . as a manager at the hospital’s radiology department. She invented a . fictional ‘Dr Baker’ and submitted 131 bogus invoices to her department . for radiology consultancy services. She then signed off the invoices . herself, using her maiden name Anne Fitzpatrick, and pocketed . £1.14million. Baker worked at the hospital for 29 . years and ran the ‘well-oiled’ fraud from 1999 to 2012 without . detection, Southwark Crown Court in Central London heard. Her deception was uncovered only when an internal audit in 2012 discovered there was no ‘Dr Baker’ at the private hospital. Lavish: The couple also paid almost £100,000 for a holiday villa in Bodrum Turkey (file picture) Mr Baker, left, was convicted of two counts of money laundering, while Mrs Baker, right, admitted false accounting and money laundering prior to her husband's case . Her 65-year-old husband knew about the scam and was a key beneficiary from his wife’s stolen cash, the court was told. The couple spent the money on  lavish . home improvements at their historic house and 2.5-acre gardens near . Launceston in Cornwall. Denial: Mr Baker, pictured, had denied that he knew anything of his wife's fraud . They marketed the house, known as . Manderley, as a wedding venue and boasted that it had a 30ft koi carp . lake, an exotic bird aviary, its own pitch-and-putt golf course and a . series of dramatic waterfalls built from Dartmoor stone. The Bakers spent £88,882 on building . work on the sprawling detached home and invested £94,000 on a luxury . villa in Bodrum, Turkey, before hiding £85,000 in two Turkish bank . accounts. Prosecutor Hugh Forgan told the court . that Anne Baker’s fraudulent income ‘dwarfed’ the couple’s genuine . earnings, and that her husband was aware of her scam. ‘Mr Baker turned the house in Cornwall . into something rather splendid,’ he said. ‘The defendant knew he could . afford it because he knew full well what his wife was up to.’ Belfast-born Anne Baker admitted false . accounting and money laundering and confessed she had taken up to . £179,000 from the hospital every year. She has since been declared . bankrupt and the private healthcare firm which ran the hospital has . begun legal proceedings to retrieve the stolen money. Her lawyer Justin Rivett said: . ‘Initially she hadn’t set out to defraud her employers over a long . period of time, but events just simply carried on. She spent a lot of . money and most of it did go on Manderley. It was a large property and . expensive to maintain.’ Baker said her husband did not know about the deception and he denied money laundering. He told the court he believed the . money had come from the sale of a flat in London, and a £132,000 ‘bonus’ given to his wife when she retired. But the jury rejected his account . and the judge said his explanation was ‘patently untrue’. Anne Baker was jailed for four years . and her husband, a qualified civil engineer, was jailed for six years. His longer jail term reflected his decision to plead not guilty, meaning . his case came to trial.","Anne Baker submitted fake invoices to a fictional radiologist for 13 years .

Nurse: Genene Jones was convicted of murdering 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan in 1984, two years after she injected her with a lethal dose of muscle relaxant . A nurse convicted of the murder of a baby in 1984 and suspected of killing up to 46 more under her care will be released from prison after serving just one third of her 99-year sentence, it emerged today. Genene Anne Jones, 63, may be released from prison as soon as 2018 because of an expired Texas law that grants a 'mandatory release' to inmates with good behavior. Jones was convicted of murdering 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan in 1984, two years after she injected her with a lethal dose of muscle relaxant while she was still in her mother's arms in hospital. Petti McClellan told ABC: 'I was holding Chelsea, she was facing . me, and Jones gave her the first shot in her left thigh. 'Immediately . Chelsea had trouble breathing. Chelsea was trying to say my name, but . she couldn't. I was extremely upset.' Jones was sentenced to 99 years in jail along with a 60-year sentence for injuring another child, who survived, which she was ordered to serve concurrently. Ron Sutton, the criminal prosecutor who . won the murder conviction, estimates that Jones is responsible for the . deaths of between 11 and 46 infants in Bexar County from 1978 and 1982. Cheryl Pendergraph worked at Bexar County Hospital with Jones after she was hired in 1977. She was a shift supervisor and gave patients assignments to nurses. In 1981, she - and other nurses - began to notice a significant increase in the unit's infant mortality rate and when she looked at the patient logbooks she noticed a distinct and unsettling pattern. 'Most of the deaths were on the 3-11 . shift, which was the shift that Genene Jones worked on,' she told ABC. 'And most of the . infants who died were Genene's patients. She was assigned to them.' Petti McClellan and a number of others opposed to Jones being released are trying to find more of her alleged victims to prevent her release. They are appealing to parents whose children died or became more ill in the hospital - now known as University Hospital of San Antonio - in the four years she worked there to come forward. Victim: Jones was sentenced to 99 years in prison for the 1982 murder of 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan who died under her care at Bexar County Hospital . Monster: Nurse Genene Jones, shown right in January 1984, was convicted of using a powerful drug to kill baby Chelsea and injuring another - who survived . 'Just the idea of a serial killer walking free in the United States of America is the craziest thing I have ever heard of,' she said. 'This is going to happen. There is . nothing we can do. Nothing I can do,' Petti McClellan, continued. 'This . has nothing to do with the parole board, the courts. Genene Jones is . going to walk free. 'It makes no rhyme or reason. Not just for me and my family, but anybody who suffered. There were so many other victims. 'I truly feel it in my heart that this . is something I have to do,' McClellan said. 'How does it make me . different from her if I don't do anything?' Jones will be released because of a Texas law called Mandatory Supervision which was enacted in 1977. It allows all convicted criminals to be automatically released on parole after they complete a certain amount of calendar time and if they have behaved well, and participated in certain work programs. Her projected release date according to the website is February 24, 2018. She will have served just one third of her sentence. Killer: Nurse Genene Jones, in custody of Kerr County Deputy Clay Barton, left, and Williamson County Deputy Loretta Pickett, right, arrives at Williamson County Courthouse on February 16, 1984 for her sentencing . Medical facility: Jones is suspected of murdering up to 46 babies while she was a nurse at Bexar County Hospital - now The University Hospital of San Antonio - from 1978 - 1982 . The 63-year-old is currently being held in the Carole S. Young Medical Facility, a correctional center in Dickinson, Texas. A Facebook group called 'Victims of Genene Anne Jones' has been set up and currently has 60 members. Joann Garza, the group's administrator, had a twin brother her family believes was killed by Jones. Baby Joel was taken to Bexar County Hospital after he choked on his bottle and, according to Garza, was given shots by Jones along with two unidentified twin girls. All three children died. The hospital have not responded to requests for comment.","Genene Anne Jones is scheduled for release in February 2018 .

Former Mets great Dwight ‘Doc’ Gooden was evicted from his New Jersey mansion last month after leaving his wife and kids there without the money to pay the rent. The Cy Young award winning pitcher has a history of drug and alcohol problems and moved out of the house in March after his wife Monique won a restraining order against him. Gooden’s family lived in the home without the former big leaguer from March through June without paying the $4,500 monthly rent, until the owners of the home finally got a judge to agree to their eviction June 11. Booted: Major league baseball legend Dwight Gooden has reportedly been kicked out of his Bergen, New Jersey rental mansion for non-payment . Estranged: Dwight Gooden with his wife Monique - who was granted a restraining order against him after he made 'terroristic' threats . Home: Gooden's estranged wife Monique and their two children had been living in the $4,500 per month Bergen, New Jersey mansion (pictured) without paying rent since March . The family had been in the luxury digs since 2011, reports the New York Daily News, even after Monique reportedly filed for divorce in November. The pitcher’s wife won a restraining order against her husband of three years after he made ‘terroristic threats.’ ‘All bets are off and I will hurt you and your family,’ Gooden allegedly told his wife. ‘You’ll see, just wait.’ Police . reportedly called a family court judge at the time of the incident and . Monique was granted a temporary restraining order on the spot. Legend: Seen here on July 16, the once promising pitcher has had high profile arrests and battles with addiction since becoming Rookie of the Year in 1984 . Troubled: The troubled pitcher is seen here in a 2005 booking photo. Gooden was arrested for allegedly hitting wife Monique that year. She won a restraining order this past March after he allegedly threatened to hurt her . Back rent: Gooden left his family's home in March after his wife Monique won a restraining order against him for making 'terroristic threats' and no one paid the rent for months . Gooden was told to pack his things and leave the home, but was not arrested. The temporary order also stripped Gooden of his right to visit his children. According to SI Wire, Monique has made domestic abuse complaints against Gooden before. In 2005, the pitcher was arrested after allegedly hitting Monique in retaliation for throwing a phone at him. More recently, in 2010, Gooden was arrested on a DUI charge after allegedly leaving the scene of an accident he was involved in while his young son was a passenger in his car. Plagued: The former major leaguer, called one of the greatest pitchers of all time, saw a promising career spin out of control due to well-publicized arrests and drug abuse . For all his run-ins with the law, Gooden first appeared on the public’s radar as the 19-year-old major league phenom who helped lead the Mets toward one of their best seasons ever. He became the National League Rookie of the Year in 1984. By 2001, Gooden retired and his series of high profile run ins with the law ensued including a 2006 parole violation that got him seven months behind bars. Gooden recently released his memoir, titled Doc: A Memoir. Tagged as 'a bruisingly honest memoir of addiction and recovery from one of the greatest pitchers of all time,' the book came out June 4.","Gooden's estranged wife Monique and their two children had been living in the $4,500 per month Bergen, New Jersey mansion without paying rent since March .

The programme follows the drunken . antics of young holidaymakers abroad while secretly allowing their . parents to spy on them and confront them about their behaviour. But looking at the holiday snaps of . the film crew sent to record them – which also show them downing rum . cocktails – it seems there is little to distinguish the subjects of the . programme from its makers. Most of the crew are freelancers . working for production company RDF, which is paid around £150,000 an . episode for each seven-episode series.

The crew stayed at the smart Kalima . Resort & Spa, where the cheapest rooms cost £185 a night. It boasts . spectacular ocean views and rooms with private pools. Yesterday some viewers called on the . BBC to stop using licence fee payers’ money to fund ‘trashy programmes’ which allow staff to enjoy luxurious trips abroad. Writing on . MailOnline, one said: ‘All aboard the licence fee payer gravy train. Disgusting behaviour, but you would not expect anything less from the . once great BBC these days.’ Another added: ‘Good old BBC.

Reward for failure: The BBC gave former director general George Entwistle a £475,000 payoff . The BBC has repeatedly been exposed for wasting licence fee payers' money on doomed projects and expensive pay offs. In May, the corporation admitted it had blown £100million on a failed IT, the Digital Media Initiative. First billed five years ago as 'the single most important initiative we are working on', the scheme was meant to save money by allowing all production staff access to video and audio material. But costs spiralled, the project ran 21 months behind schedule and it was eventually halted in April this year. Former director general George Entwistle walked away from his job with £475,000 after being sacked following a calamitous 54 days in charge. And the National Audit Office revealed the BBC handed its own staff £369million in severance payments over eight years. MPs said the massive sum showed an ‘outrageous disregard for licence-fee payers’ money’. The . National Audit Office said the BBC often breached its own guidelines . and had ‘put public trust at risk’ by authorising the payouts, including . £61million to senior managers.

Battle: Lewis Philbrick, 86, says he requested meetings with MoD bosses for years about his cancer but has been snubbed . A former navy mechanic who was diagnosed with cancer after being exposed to radiation at Nagasaki wants recognition from the Ministry of Defence bosses who he says have snubbed him for years. Lewis Philbrick, 86, escorted scientists onto the Japanese island in September 1945, a month after the atomic bomb was dropped, killing 74,000 people. He immediately started suffering bleeding gums, loose teeth and lip sores, and was diagnosed with cancer in 1984. His face is disfigured after seven operations, in which part of his jaw and skull were removed. Mr Philbrick, who now lives in Colchester, Essex, says he does not want compensation, he simply wants recognition that his service led to years of suffering. Speaking on the eve of the 68th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, he said: 'I can’t forget because every time I look in the mirror, it is there. My greatest worry is ""when is it coming back?""' He has requested face-to-face talks with MoD bosses after years communicating by letter. Mr Philbrick said: 'All I can ask for is one-to-one talks, which gives me the chance to respond immediately to whatever it is the MoD representative comes back with.' The Allies dropped a bomb in Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. Mr Philbrick escorted scientists to the area a month later. War veteran: Lewis Philbrick, left as young navy mechanic, escorted scientists to the site of the Nagasaki atom bomb, right, after it was dropped in 1945 . Reduced to rubble: A survivor looks over the expanse of ruins left by the explosion of the atomic bomb . He lost his cousin Gerald during the war in the Pacific and was one of the first people to witness the aftermath of the bomb, including finding Japanese prisoner of war camps. Naval doctors diagnosed Mr Philbrick with gingivitis and later pleurisy. Mr Philbrick said: 'When I went to the . doctor at the time they didn’t take a great deal of notice because a . lot of people were coming forward with symptoms and they were being put . down to heat exhaustion.' He . got home in 1946 and spent six months in Colchester Military Hospital . before spells in the Red Cross Auxiliary Hospital and the Royal Naval . Hospital. Mr Philibrick, . who played inside-left for Colchester United from 1946 to 1952, . diagnosed with a type of skin cancer in his jaw and neck in 1984. History: This picture was taken by Lewis Philbrick on board the USS Missouri of General McArthur, seated, signing the Japanese surrender . Hero: After the war, Lewis Philbrick played inside left for Colchester United from 1946 to 1952 . The Ministry of Defence told MailOnline that Mr Philbrick applied for a Military Disablement Pension, but his case was rejected. He applied to have the decision reconsidered at a tribunal appeal, at which an MoD panel ruled that his medical condition was unrelated to his service in the Armed Forces. A spokesman said: 'War Disablement Pensions are payable in respect of illness or injury as a result of service in HM Armed Forces before 6 April 2005. 'All decisions follow careful consideration of all the service and medical evidence available and carry full rights of appeal to an independent Tribunal.' She added that the MoD remains in contact with Mr Philbrick about his case. Anger: Mr Philbrick says he does not want compensation, just recognition for his sacrifice . Lethal: Smoke billows over the Japanese city of Nagasaki after an atomic bomb was dropped in 1945 . An atomic bomb weighing more than 4,000kg was dropped on Nagasaki by parachute from an American B29 Bomber at 11.02 local time on 9 August, 1945. Nicknamed 'the Fat Man', in reference to Winston Churchill, it exploded 500metres above ground and completely destroyed the city which lies on the western side of the Japanese island of Kyushu. It was the second attack by the United States on a Japanese city in three days. More than three million leaflets had been dropped over the country from American aeroplanes warning the Japanese people that more atomic weapons would be used 'again and again' unless the war was ended immediately. The Japanese surrendered less than a week later on August 14. The two attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date. The war in Europe ended when Nazi Germany surrendered on May 8, but the Pacific War had continued. The use of atomic bombs by the United States remains one of the most controversial moments in human history.","Lewis Philbrick, from Colchester, Essex, blames radiation for his illness .

A Canadian woman is suing a fertility clinic after alleging her husband ran off with the couple's nurse. Po Leung, 44, claims her husband Stuart Westcott was having a secret affair with their nurse Wendy Shanks during their $60,000 (£38,000) treatment. She became pregnant through in-vitro fertilisation after several years of treatment at the fertility clinic, which she has now launched a lawsuit against as well as the nurse and facility director. Suing: Po Leung, 44 (pictured), claims her husband Stuart Westcott was having a secret affair with their nurse Wendy Shanks during their fertilisation treatment. She alleges the nurse abused her position of 'power, trust and influence' The lawsuit alleges Shanks 'abused her position of power, trust and influence as her medical care provider' and exploited that position to pursue a sexual relationship. Wescott broke the news he was leaving Po, his partner of four years, the day after she became pregnant - and tragically within two weeks she suffered a miscarriage and lost the baby. Po, an investment adviser who lives in Ontario, Canada, believes the miscarriage was triggered by the news of the affair. She said: 'It was one of the best days of my life - I was thrilled. After three years and $60,000 we had finally reached our goal. But the next day was the worst day of my life. 'What really hurt me the most was that my health-care professionals had so profoundly betrayed me while I was at my most vulnerable. 'I remember saying ""do not do this, not right now"". I really wanted to give this baby the best chance but he just left and was gone for hours. Stuart Wescott, pictured, broke the news he was leaving Po, his partner of four years, the day after she became pregnant - and tragically within two weeks she suffered a miscarriage and lost the baby . Stuart Westcott and his wife Po Leung had spent $60,000 (£38,000) on years' of treatment before Po finally fell pregnant. But she lost the baby, two weeks after Westcott left her . 'I confronted him but he didn't give her up right away. However he said she was the most special person, the kindest, most compassionate person he had ever met. He was enthralled. 'We trusted everything she said. She portrayed herself as happily married with two kids. 'She told me both her kids are from fertility treatments, that she knew how hard it is and not to give up. She said her husband and her were still paying off their loans.' Po, who became pregnant on March 24, 2010, has now launched a $400,000 lawsuit against Shanks, the Markham Fertility Centre, near Toronto, Ontario, and the facility's director Dr. Colette Pyselman. The statement of claim reads: 'Shanks intentionally used Po's private medical treatment and information as an excuse to repeatedly contact Stuart and foster an intimate relationship with him, without Po's knowledge or permission.' When she complained to the Markham clinic's director, Pyselman relayed that confidential information to Shanks to 'warn, protect and defend Shanks and the reputation of the clinic,' the lawsuit alleges. Mrs Leung said: 'I remember saying ""do not do this, not right now"". I really wanted to give this baby the best chance but he just left and was gone for hours.' Pictured, Westcott, left . The lawsuit says Shanks' employers 'breached their fiduciary duty owed to Po' because they failed to protect her from the harm inflicted by their employee and failed to investigate and report Shanks to the College of Nurses. Shanks' employer also failed to take any disciplinary action against her, the lawsuit alleges. Shanks' lawyer, Chris Wayland, said she will vigorously defend the lawsuit and will be filing a statement of defence in the next few weeks. He declined to comment further. Pyselman's lawyer, Jaan Lilles, also declined to comment and hasn't yet filed a statement of defence. None of the allegations have been proven in court. Although there is no legal action against him, when contacted Friday about the allegations contained in the statement of claim, Westcott said: 'I respectfully decline to comment.' On its website, Markham Fertility Centre, in Ontario, Canada, says Wendy Shanks 'offers not only a wealth of expertise and knowledge but a high level of compassion and commitment to her field, her profession, and to the health and happiness of each of her patients'.","Po Leung, 44, claims her husband Stuart .

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 19:18 EST, 13 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:24 EST, 14 August 2013 . Professor Andrew Ashworth said locking up thieves and fraudsters and 'condemning' them to prison was an 'abuse of State power' (file picture) Serial thieves, pickpockets and fraudsters should never be jailed, a former Government sentencing adviser declared last night. Professor Andrew Ashworth claimed even repeat offenders with dozens of convictions should be spared the ‘pain’ of a prison term. He said locking up thieves and fraudsters and ‘condemning’ them to prison was an ‘abuse of State power’. Instead, he argued, they should be fined, given community service and forced to pay for the damage they have caused. The controversial comments in a pamphlet for a penal reform group were condemned as ‘extreme’ and ‘callous’ towards victims by crime prevention campaigners. Prof Ashworth, now an Oxford University law professor, said jail was ‘disproportionate’ for what he called ‘pure’ property offences, including theft, handling stolen goods, criminal damage and fraud. Depriving someone of their liberty for an offence that ‘only’ targeted property was unfair, he claimed, arguing that jail should be reserved for violent and sexual crimes. He described the theft of £250 worth of clothes from a store as ‘in the overall scale of things...not  serious harm’. Prof Ashworth was chairman of the Sentencing Advisory Panel for three years under Labour when there were repeated criticisms that policy was going soft. His comments came in a pamphlet for the Howard League for Penal Reform, which calls for fewer criminals to be jailed and a rise in the age of criminal responsibility, currently ten in England. ‘We should be reserving our most severe form of punishment for our most serious types of offending,’ said Prof Ashworth. ‘Should someone be sent to prison and deprived of their liberty for an offence that involves no violence, no threats and no sexual assault?’ He said this was ‘an abuse of State power’. The professor added: ‘Instead, the priority should be to deal with such offences in the community, giving precedence to compensation for the victim and, where the offence is sufficiently serious, imposing a community sentence.’ The result of such a policy would be more than 25,000 fewer criminals sent to jail every year, most for theft and handling offences. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘These extreme recommendations are callous towards victims and show a complete ignorance of the facts. Prof Ashworth said jail was 'disproportionate' for what he called 'pure' property offences, including theft, handling stolen goods, criminal damage and fraud (file picture) ‘Only an ivory tower academic who started out determined to reduce prison numbers whatever the evidence could reach this conclusion. ‘Theft is not a “minor offence”. Victims can find their lives  transformed by fear. Making a promise to thieves and fraudsters that they will never go to prison is ridiculous. ‘Already the courts bend over backwards to give criminals  community sentences and fines which fail to protect the public. Prison protects the public. ‘More prison places and longer sentences would be better for  victims and most likely to turn these thieves’ lives around.’ Last year, around 91,000 serious and repeat offenders, including  thousands of thieves and other property criminals, escaped jail. Frances Crook, chief executive of the League, said theft and fraud victims were losing out as too much priority was given to jailing criminals rather than returning stolen property and compensation. She backed fines, compensation orders and community sentences over jail ‘which produce a much lower rate of reoffending at a fraction of the cost’.","Professor Andrew Ashworth said repeat offenders should be spared prison .

The full extent of the blue-chip hacking scandal may never be known, one of Scotland Yard’s leading detectives admitted yesterday. Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs said it is impossible to estimate how deep the murky trade in illicit personal information runs. He said police are unlikely to name the companies and individuals who pay corrupt private investigators to hack, blag and steal sensitive data. Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs said it is impossible to estimate how deep the murky trade in illicit personal information runs . But he revealed that officers have questioned 31 people suspected of illegally invading the privacy of others. Asked if the number was only the ‘tip of the iceberg’, Mr Briggs replied that police had no way of guessing an ‘unknown, unknown’. ‘Of the material that we hold, we are conducting a thorough investigation of that for computer hacking offences,’ he said. ‘There may be other people elsewhere committing these offences of which the police have no intelligence or evidence.’ Scotland Yard and the Serious Organised Crime Agency have been criticised over their response to the blue-chip hacking scandal. The two crime-fighting bodies are accused of sitting on an incendiary list of 102 companies and individuals who hired rogue private eyes. It is dominated by law firms, but also includes debt collectors, oil companies, venture capitalists, pharmaceutical firms and two celebrities. The list was compiled in 2008 but Soca only released it to the Commons home affairs committee last month – and police are insisting it remains confidential. MPs suspect that those on the list have been protected from public scrutiny over their actions because it remains secret. Scotland Yard and the Serious Organised Crime Agency have been criticised over their response to the blue-chip hacking scandal . They are concerned that they have not been investigated with the same vigour police show in pursuing journalists who broke the law to obtain private information. Mr Briggs is responsible for Operation Tuleta, one of three inquiries set up in the wake of the News International phone hacking scandal. A team of 16 detectives and one civilian are investigating ‘criminal acts that intruded on individual privacy’. They are examining claims that private investigators were employed to steal personal information for corporate clients and individuals. The other linked inquiries are Operations Weeting and Elveden, which are examining allegations of phone hacking and bribing public officials to obtain stories respectively. Speaking yesterday, Mr Briggs said Tuleta detectives have arrested 20 suspects and interviewed 11 more under caution. In one notorious case, a private eye is accused of using a virus to hack to the computer of former Army intelligence officer Ian Hurst. Mr Briggs’s comments raise the prospect that police are unlikely to penetrate the wall of silence around the blue-chip hacking scandal. Last month dozens of law firms refused to discuss if they used private investigators or what steps they take to ensure they do not break the law. Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said officers cannot demand answers from private eyes or others without information to suspect they have broken the law. Speaking about Operation Tuleta yesterday, Mr Briggs said five further names were withheld from the 102 on the MPs’ list as they are under criminal inquiry. Officers have seized 100 computers and are examining a mass of digital material.","Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs said 'impossible to estimate'

Public-spirited: Former nurse Joan Edwards left her fortune to the Government to spend 'as they may think fit' The Tories and Lib Dems stood accused of ‘robbery’ yesterday after pocketing a £520,000 bequest to the nation left in an elderly spinster’s will. When she died aged 90, former nurse Joan Edwards left her fortune to the Government to spend ‘as they may think fit’. But instead of using the money on the Health Service, schools or to ease the national debt, the Coalition shared it between them as a party donation. Party spin doctors were accused of misleading journalists by insisting Miss Edwards had bequeathed the money to ‘whichever party’ was in power when she died. But their claim unravelled spectacularly when the Daily Mail tracked down a copy of the will – which made no mention of any party. Last night the Tories and Lib Dems faced demands to repay the cash. They were also struggling to explain how a gift intended for the public good from an ‘intelligent’, church-going woman with ‘little interest in politics’ had ended up in their coffers in the first place. It is not uncommon for people to leave a bequest to the nation. In 2010-11, members of the public gave more than £1million to the  Government specifically as a gift to the nation, almost all of it left in wills. Executors of the estates write a cheque made out to ‘HM Treasury’ and it goes into the country’s coffers. By contrast, bequests to political parties usually involve a specific clause in a will. Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, added: ‘I am surprised they were so desperate that they took the money in the first place. ‘I am surprised that a political party would want to take this money in circumstances when there is any doubt of the deceased person’s intention. ‘If they are in any doubt, they should take legal advice and consider giving the money back to the estate.’ Generous: Miss Edwards left her entire £520,000 estate to the Government . Home: Miss Edwards had lived in the same three-bedroom semi-detached council house (pictured) since 1931, when she moved in with her parents . Unions continue to account for the bulk of big donations to the Labour party. The . Unite union, which went to war with Ed Miliband over plans to curb . union influence, gave £722,195 from April to June this year. New . figures reveal that even the Lib Dems have raised more from individual . non-union donors than the Labour party since the election. Unions have tightened their grip on Labour and are now responsible for three-quarters of all big donations to party coffers. The . Unite union, which went to war with Ed Miliband over plans to curb . union influence, gave £722,195 from April to June this year. New . figures reveal that even the Lib Dems have raised more from individual . non-union donors than the Labour party since the election. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: . ‘Despite Ed Miliband’s promise of change, these independent figures . prove his Labour Party is still dominated by the trade unions. ‘They choose the candidates, pick the leader and remain Labour’s biggest donors - providing three quarters of the party's money.' John Lister, from the pressure group Health Emergency which campaigns against NHS cuts, said: ‘How far different is what they have done to stealing off an old lady? ‘We have a massive crisis in emergency services, thousands of NHS jobs are being squeezed out – and they decide to spend it on their party rather than services for the public.’ The donation came to light when the Electoral Commission issued a quarterly update yesterday on the funding of the political parties. It revealed that the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats had shared a £520,000 donation from a ‘Joan L B Edwards’, who died last year. The fact that the Tories and Lib Dems share power caused some confusion, but the sum was eventually divided between them based on the number of ministers and MPs, with the Conservatives taking a £420,000 slice of the pie. Yesterday morning spin doctors from both parties insisted Miss Edwards had wanted them to have her money. A Tory source briefed: ‘This money was donated out of the blue. It was a bequest to the party of the government of the day.’ But what Miss Edwards had actually stipulated in her will was that all the proceeds of her estate were to be paid to ‘whichever Government is in office at the date of my death for the Government in their absolute discretion to use as they may think fit’. Somewhere along the line, somebody . decided what she meant by this was for her hard-earned cash to fund the . Conservatives’ and Lib Dems’ campaigns to win the next election. Friends . of Miss Edwards – a churchgoer whose career as a nurse included spells . as a midwife and a school ‘nit nurse’ – suggested this was the last . thing she would have wanted. Next-door neighbour Lucy Sanders . said: ‘I would think she would have wanted the Government to do . something good with her money, something to do with looking after . children like she did. ‘She never talked about politics. She wouldn’t dream of saying who she voted for. She was old-fashioned that way.’ Miss . Sanders, 47, added: ‘She delivered hundreds of babies in her career. She was the best neighbour you could ever wish for. She was a very . private woman, and very polite.’ Born in Bristol in 1921, Miss Edwards never married and died there on September 22 last year, after a fall. 'We have a massive crisis in emergency . services, thousands of NHS jobs are being squeezed out - and they decide . to spend it on their party rather than services for the public' - John Lister, from Health Emergency . She had lived in the same three-bedroom semi-detached council house since 1931, when she moved in with her parents. She was described by neighbours as . frugal, with little interest in fashion or luxuries, and ‘highly . intelligent’. She refused to have central heating installed, but . eventually relented over double glazing. Another . friend, Joan Seville, said she thought Miss Edwards had been a . Conservative, and had made her money buying and selling shares. When she wrote her will in 2001, Labour were in power, having just won their second term in a landslide victory. Mrs Seville added: ‘She was a “Victorian” lady. Very old-fashioned and very polite.’ The . public-spirited Miss Edwards is even understood to have refused the . offer to buy her £160,000 council house when it was offered to her and . her elderly mother for just £2,000. 'Surprised': Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said he was 'surprised they were so desperate that they took the money in the first place' Labour MP Paul Flynn (left) said it did not look like Miss Edwards intended the money 'for party political purposes'. Meanwhile, UKIP leader Nigel Farage (right) said Miss Edwards would have made it 'clear' if she had wanted to fund a political party . Last night Labour MP Paul Flynn said: . ‘It certainly sounds that this was a generous gesture for the benefit . of nation, and doesn’t look like she intended it for party political . purposes. ‘To suggest it should go to the party coffers of parties in power seems a perverse judgment.’ UKIP . leader Nigel Farage said: ‘If she had wanted to fund a political party . itself, she would have made that clear and probably backed a particular . one. ‘At least, for . the first time, the Coalition agreed on something – shame it took half a . million quid to bait them into consensus.’ 'I would think she would have wanted the Government to do . something good with her money, something to do with looking after . children like she did' - Next-door neighbour Lucy Sanders . Last night the blame game was in full swing. Tory and Lib Dem sources claimed the executors of Miss Edwards’ will, two West Country solicitors, initially contacted the Government’s Treasury Solicitors department to ask where to send the cash, and that both the Treasury Solicitors and the office of Attorney General Dominic Grieve – a Conservative MP – then ruled it was a ‘party political donation’. This was flatly contradicted by the Attorney General’s Office, which said: ‘The executors of Miss Edwards’s estate contacted the AGO about her bequest but the Attorney provided no advice. ‘The Treasury Solicitors replied on behalf of the Attorney General’s Office setting out further steps the executors may wish to take to identify the correct recipient of the bequest. ‘It did not, nor could have, advised to whom the bequest should go.’ A Tory party spokesman said: ‘The solicitors for the deceased, acting as the executors, informed the Conservative Party that it was a beneficiary of the will.’ A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘The Liberal Democrats were notified that the party was a beneficiary of Miss Edwards’s will.’ Backer: James Palumbo, founder of the Ministry of Sound, gave £65,000 to the Lib Dems in the weeks before being made a peer . David Cameron's party received a total of £4,116,006, including major donations from businessmen. The . largest gifts to the Conservatives were £280,770 from co-treasurer and . hedge fund boss Michael Farmer and £263,600 from investment banker James . Lupton. Labour said the . Tories received £1,042,970.93 in the last quarter from donors who . attended private dinners with Mr Cameron and other senior ministers. It . included £694,370 from donors in the financial sector. Sadiq . Khan MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, said: 'The Tories have . raked in over £1 million from private dinners with David Cameron and . senior Ministers in the last quarter. 'And more than two thirds of that comes from the City – the bankers and hedge fund bosses whose taxes David Cameron cut. 'Hardworking . families are seeing their living standards squeezed, with prices rising . faster than wages. Meanwhile David Cameron shows how out of touch he . is, standing up for the millionaires who fund his party.' Meanwhile, . the new figures show the Ministry of Sound gave £65,000 to the Lib .

Leading Blairites called on Ed Miliband to recall Labour’s ‘grown-ups’ to frontline politics yesterday as he was accused of lacking a ‘coherent’ economic policy. Former minister Chris Mullin said the Labour leader should recall big beasts such as former Cabinet ministers Alistair Darling and Alan Johnson to help rescue the party. He said Mr Miliband needs ‘a strong, coherent case’ and ‘a credible message’. Step up: Labour leader Ed Miliband is under pressure to improve the party's economic message after weeks of silence from his frontbench . Grownups: Many in the Labour party would like to see Alistair Darling (left) and Alan Johnson return to the frontbench . Describing them as ‘grown-ups’ he . said on Radio 4 that Mr Darling was ‘a very good chancellor and still is . a very credible witness on the economy’ and Mr Johnson was ‘an . immensely credible figure’. Mr Mullin said Labour needed to . counter the ‘vast lie’ that Britain’s economic problems were primarily . caused by the previous government. He said the ‘only thing’ the party had to apologise for was not ‘regulating the banks sufficiently’. Former spin doctor Alastair Campbell also demanded that Mr Miliband get on the front foot over the economy. In a blog on his website, Mr Campbell . wrote: ‘The very good record of the last Labour government has been . blunted if not lost as a political weapon. Labour must be more robust in . defending the record, including the Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling . handling of the global financial crisis.’ Former minister Tony McNulty also . said: ‘If we have little confidence defending [our] record, why should . anyone believe our forward offer?’ Mr Miliband has spent the last three weeks on holiday, sparking unease in Labour ranks about the deafening silence of his frontbench. With signs the economy is recovering, a growing list of MPs and advisers have warned Labour needs to up its game. Former Blair spin doctor Alastair Campbell warned Labour 'must be more robust in defending the record' of its time in government. He claimed Labour have played into Tory hands on this, and there needs to be an admission of that, so that even at this late stage, a proper debate and a proper reckoning of the record can be had'. Message: Former No.10 spin doctor Alistair Campbell said Labour had failed to challenge Tory claims it was to blame for the financial crash . Gordon Brown's former pollster Deborah . Mattinson warned that Labour was ‘slightly lurching from one announcement to the next, or complete silence’. ‘What . voters need to hear is some real clarity about what Labour stands for, . what Labour believes, how Labour now would be different from how Labour . has been before. And that needs to be set out with absolute clarity in a . language that people understand.' It comes after shadow health secretary Andy Burnham complained that Labour must 'shout louder and speak in a way that captures how people are feeling and thinking'. Veteran backbenchers George Mudie and Graham Stringer have also warned Mr Miliband;s policies are 'confused'. However Tom Harris, who stood down from the Labour frontbench this year, likened Mr Miliband to Margaret Thatcher and insisted he was a 'ruthless b******' with the grit to win. 'The kind of steel within Ed Miliband is what the Tories needed nearly 40 years ago and it's what our party needed in 2010. We still need it today. And by 2015 we’ll need it more than ever,' he wrote in an article for the Telegraph. From April to June the economy grew by 0.6 per cent, double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first quarter of 2013. New . Bank of England governor Mark Carney last week raised growth forecasts . for this year from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from . 1.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent. At the same time Mr Cameron and George Osborne have almost doubled their lead over Labour for stewardship of the economy. Economic competence: The Tory lead over Labour for running the economy has soared from nine points in June to 16 points in August . PM David Cameron, left, and Chancellor George . Osborne, right, have seen a sharp rise in their economic credibility, . according to the survey . According to a survey, 40 per cent . believe the Prime Minister and Chancellor are more capable of managing . the economy than Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. Just 24 per cent said the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor have the right answers – giving the Tories a 16 per cent lead. It is a dramatic increase from a lead . of just nine points last month, and will send shockwaves through the . Labour party as Mr Miliband prepares for another relaunch. Senior Tories have been careful not to declare they can see ‘green shoots’ of recovery, with Mr Osborne insisting the economy has moved only from ‘repair to recovery’. With growth up and unemployment down, Labour has been forced to re-rite its attacks on the government, having previously accused ministers of cutting ‘too far, too fast’. Pressure: After three weeks of almost complete silence from the Labour leadership, the poll will be another blow for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls (right) Mr Miliband's frontbench have instead claimed that the recovery is only being enjoyed by the wealthy. But the new message has done nothing to stop voters swinging in behind the Tory leadership’s economic strategy. According . to the latest ICM survey for the Guardian, the Conservative lead for . ‘competence’ on the economy is at its highest level since December 2012. To make things worse for Labour, the same survey shows that while the party is ahead overall, it is only just. On . voting intentions Mr Miliband’s party leads by just 3 per cent, with 35 . per cent saying they will vote Labour compared with 32 per cent for the . Conservatives. Factoring in the margin of error – of plus or minus 3 per cent – shows that the lead may in fact be non-existent. The Tories have fallen four points over the last month and Labour has gone down 1 per cent. The . poll is the latest blow for Mr Miliband, who is expected to return to . the political fray this week with an attack on the government for . falling wages in real terms. He has faced criticism for three weeks of all but total silence from his frontbench, leaving the coalition to set the political agenda. A much-hyped speech on immigration by frontbencher Chris Bryant turned into a fiasco when large sections attacking Tesco and Next had to be rewritten after the retail giants hit back at errors in pre-briefed extracts. The ICM poll shows UKIP has seen its rating rise from 7 to 10 per cent. The poll also shows 17 per cent of people think their personal financial circumstances have improved in the last year, compared to 43 per cent who say it has become worse. A quarter believed their situation would improve in the next year.","Call for Alan Johnson and Alistair Darling to return to the frontbench .

He was also paid $28,000 (£18,000) to clean an elderly lady's house that had been overridden with her cats for years. 'It took two weeks to clean up,' Mr O'Brian said.

'Brains are comprised of 12 per cent fat - essentially they're cholesterol - which hardens when it dries. 'You have to hydrate it with CVC - a chemical that can kill every germ known to man.' Mr O'Brian prepares his students for the genuine article by making the scene as realistic as possible. He makes them breathe in the odour of stale blood and forces them to handle bedding wriggling with maggots. Mr O'Brian tells his students: 'I want you to get familiar with the smell. 'It's the smell of death and you need to know how to identify it. 'With mattresses you cut them with a utility knife - wherever you see blood cut it out.' Despite the grisly nature of his job, Mr O'Brian said that families of the deceased can become attached and feel a bond with him because he has been responsible for restoring some order to their devastated homes. But you have to take a step back, he said, and not get involved. 'You have to detach. They'll want to talk. Don't have long conversations,' added Mr O'Brian. 'Don't tell them anything personal - you're there to work despite being their knight in shining amour.' He added: 'This is a good job - for the right people. 'There's nothing glamorous about this.

Determined: Home Secretary Theresa May has staked her reputation on kicking foreign criminals like Abu Qatada out of Britain . Efforts to deport a Thai murderer . have failed because judges have ruled it would be 'stressful' for him to . be returned to his home country. An . immigration tribunal ruled that returning the man who moved to the . UK from Thaliand at the age of 13 would breach his right to family life under Article 8 of . the European Convention on Human Rights. Instead it ruled that he should be . allowed to stay in Britain indefinitely even though he stabbed a friend to death in . what the immigration tribunal called an 'unprovoked attack.' Tribunal judges also ruled that the man's identity should be kept secret to protect him despite his criminal past and potential threat to the community. The 48-year-old killer moved to Britain with his mother in 1978 as a young teenager when she got a job at the Thai embassy. Twenty years later he took a knife from the family home and a stabbed a friend to death in a drink and drug fuelled attack. He admitted manslaughter at the Old Bailey and was sent to to a secure mental health unit but was released into the community in 2008 after serving less than a decade for the killing. Two years later he suffered a 'relapse' and was returned to care. But in 2011 he was freed again and now lives in supported accommodation. Now efforts by the Home Office to deport him have been blocked because it was judged that he had lived in the UK for too long to be expected to go home. The tribunal heard that as a result of his 36 years spent in Britain he had 'extinguished' links with his home country and that the move would cause him 'stress.' It said: 'Adjusting . to life in Thailand was likely to be a significant challenge for the . appellant  after 36 years in the United Kingdom . 'He was vulnerable to stress and the social impact of a move to Thailand was likely to destabilise his illness.' The Home Office appealed the decision to keep the killer's identity secret but this too was rejected on the grounds that there was 'no evidence' the man posed a risk to the public. Hate: Terror suspect Abu Qatada represents one of the most infamous examples of criminals being protected by Human Rights legislation, it took eight years and almost £2million of legal fees to get him finally deported in July this year . Speaking yesterday a spokesman from the Home Office confirmed they had no plans to further challenge the judgement but said: 'We do not routinely comment on individual cases.' The news comes just a month after it was revealed that police forces up and down the country are defying national guidelines and protecting the identity of prisoners. Violent: Polish Teresa Rafacz pleaded guilty to stamping her husband to death and was jailed for two years but has been allowed to stay in the UK . More than half of forces in England and Wales do not publish mugshots of offenders unless they have been jailed because of concerns and about data protection and the criminals’ human rights. This means that only a tiny proportion of the 1.2million convicted in criminal courts each year have their photos published. This despite the fact that it is widely acknowledged that publicity can link offenders to other crimes and even prevent more from being committed. In one well known case from 2007 Derbyshire Constabulary refused to release photographs of two murderers who had fled from an open prison. They argued that the pair were likely to have left the area and therefore posed no risk to residents so there was no need to identify them. Pictures of Jason Croft and Michael Nixon were eventually published by another force. In April this year the country's most . senior immigration judge ruled that a polish woman who killed her . husband by repeatedly stamping on his head could not be deported from . Britain because it would breach EU rules. Theresa . Rafacz, who arrived in the UK in 2007 claimed she 'lost control' when . she returned home to find her alcoholic husband drunk when he was supposed to be caring for their three-year-old son. Mr . Rafacz died from blunt force trauma to the head in 2009 after his wife . repeatedly stamped on his face and neck, breaking his nose and . spattering her own clothing with his blood. Chief Constable of Derbyshire Police, David Coleman, believed pictures of escaped murderers should not be published because it was likely they had left the county and did not pose a risk to locals . She pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was jailed for two years.Last year she was assessed as posing a 'medium risk' of re-offending.But . Mr Justice Blake ruled that she could stay in Britain because her crime did not . cross a 'seriousness threshold' under European law on the grounds that . EU citizens can only be ordered out of the country if they have . committed crimes in 'exceptional circumstances. Last month the Home Secretary Theresa May finally won her battle to deport Jordanian hate preacher Abu Qatada after an eight year legal fight that cost British taxpayers around £1.7million. The costs, revealed in a letter by Miss May to the Home Affairs Select Committee in June included Qatada's legal aid costs of £647,658. Qatada – once dubbed Osama Bin Laden’s right hand man in Europe – lost his appeal against deportation in 2007 but has repeatedly used human rights laws to thwart his removal to face terrorism charges in his homeland. Miss May on the other hand staked her reputation on being the Home Secretary that would eventually get rid of him. She finally secured his deportation by signing a fair trial guarantee treaty with Jordan in March and after more legal wrangling he was flown home from RAF Northolt in July.","Killer moved to Britain at 13 when his mother got a job in the Thai embassy .

Row: Karen Jackson, Chief Executive of Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust, has taken a 20% pay rise despite being placed in Special Measures . The chairman of a failing hospital trust due to be taken over by an NHS 'hit squad' said today it would have been a 'grave mistake and a false economy' not to boost the chief executive's salary by £25,000. Karen Jackson is in charge of Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals Foundation Trust, which was put in special measures last month after a major national review of high mortality rates. Yet she received the inflation-busting rise from £145,000 to £170,000 in April last year. That increase makes her paid £27,500 more than the Prime Minister, whose salary is £142,500. Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced the trust, which serves a population of 358,000 people from three main sites in Grimsby, Goole and Scunthorpe, was one of 11 to be placed in special measures following the Keogh Review into high mortality rates. The critical review found: a lack of clinical changes being made to improve care; ambulance staff were caring for patients in some cases at the A&E department at Grimsby Hospital; concerns over staffing levels and skills; and that the trust was breaching national standards on mixed sex wards. But Andrew Allison, national grassroots co-ordinator of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the revelation 'adds insult to injury' following the findings of the  Keogh review. 'Mrs Jackson has been rewarded handsomely for failure - there is not other way to describe it. 'Despite her assurances that patient safety and quality of care is always her top priority, it appears pocketing masive pay rises has been at the top of her list. 'I can’t see how local residents can have any confidence in her,' he said. Scandal: The Diana Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby is one of the hospitals due to be taken over by an NHS hit squad over mortality rates, which is run by Karen Jackson . Nevertheless, Mrs Jackson's pay increase was justified, the trust chairman felt. A cash-strapped council has been blasted after all 44 councillors voted for a nine per cent pay rise - while workers will receive just a one per cent wage increase. The controversial deal will see Stoke-on-Trent City Council leader Mohammed Pervez receive an extra £4,000 bringing his pay packet to £48,000. Councillors’ pay will increase by £1,000 to £12,000, while cabinet members will enjoy a £2,000 rise to give them £24,000. Members voted against immediately accepting the increase last year as council staff were subject to a pay freeze. But the ruling Labour group agreed on the nine per cent rise at a private meeting this week because employees have since accepted their own one per cent rise. Deputy Leader Paul Shotton, whose allowance will rise by £2,500 to £30,000, defending the decision. The Labour councillor said: 'These rates are set by an independent panel. The councillors have not given that rise to themselves.' Council worker James Withers, 45, said: 'It is disgusting that councillors are giving themselves such a bumper pay rise while the rest of us see our salaries pretty much stay the same'. Dr James Whittingham said: 'The remuneration committee is responsible for agreeing the executive management team's salary bands and uses a national system to determine its decisions on pay. 'The bands are reviewed every year and a variety of factors are taken into account, such as comparative salaries in the NHS, individual performance and market forces. 'The executive salaries at this trust are either in line with or below those at similar trusts. 'It is important that we pay salaries which are commensurate with the job to attract and retain high calibre people. 'Karen Jackson's starting salary in 2010 was set below the agreed rate as it was her first chief executive post, and she declined a pay rise after her first year in the role. 'She is now receiving a salary that is roughly in line with the average for trusts of this size and type. 'The remuneration committee always strives to keep a balance between competitive pay and the need for financial restraint in what are challenging times and I fully believe we have achieved that. 'It would be a grave mistake and false economy to pay so far below the market rate that executives leave their posts or are impossible to recruit.' Members of the remuneration committee whose salaries are being discussed by the committee do not participate in these discussions, the trust said. The chief executive joined in autumn 2010 on a salary of £145,000, she declined a rise in 2011 and it was increased to £170,000 in April last year in line with similar roles, a trust spokeswoman said.","Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Trust under review over high death rates .

And with the row being over the increasing height of Dale Woolley’s conifer trees, Mr Elliot has been on the losing side... until now. After years of complaining that the trees, as high as 20ft, blocked out the sunlight and harboured flies that would fly into his house, officials have finally come down on Mr Elliot’s side and ordered that Mr Woolley’s ‘personal forest’ in Cannock, Staffordshire, must be cut down. Personal forest: Ken Elliot has blamed his neighbour for allowing the conifers to grow so high they block out his light . Gloomy: Mr Elliot stares out from one of the upstairs rooms, which has been in the shadow of his neighbour's conifers for years . Mr Elliot, 55, said: ‘It is quite ridiculous. My wife and I feel like prisoners in our own home. 'We cannot open the windows as there are too many bugs and we don’t get any natural light in our living room.’ He said the row began in 1996 when he spoke to his neighbour about uprooting a hedge and building a wall to separate the two properties. Mr Elliot said Mr Woolley agreed, but then planted eight large conifer trees. ‘I was gobsmacked', said the ex-miner, 55. ‘It is was if he did it out of spite for getting rid of the hedge.’ Two years ago the Elliots noticed cracks appearing in their wall and took legal action. Overshadowed: The grandfather from Cannock in Staffordshire demonstrates how high the trees are . Feud: The dispute first started back in 1996 when Mr Elliot made a gift of two miniature conifers to his neighbour . When a local newspaper contacted Mr Woolley’s home, his son Tristan said they liked having their own ‘private forest’. Now Cannock Chase Council has made an order under the Anti-Social Behaviour Act that the two main conifer trees be cut to 5ft by September 28 and should never exceed 6ft 6ins. Mr Elliot said: ‘I understand people have the right to live how they want but you need to be reasonable. I cannot wait to be able to finally open my windows and have a bit of sunlight through them. Order: Cannock Chase Council has now ruled Dale Woolley has to lop the 20ft trees back down to the more reasonable height of 5ft .","Two conifers given as a gift have sparked a war between two neighbours .

Tory activists launched a coded attack on Conservative Party Chairmen Grant Shapps and Andrew Feldman yesterday, demanding the right to pick their own chairman. The Conservative Grassroots group - a collection of former constituency chairmen and council leaders - said new blood is needed to inspire Tory activists to campaign for the party. They accused senior Tories of alienating ordinary party members and warned that the collapse in Tory Party membership will not be arrested if senior figures keep ‘insulting’ party members. Under fire: Conservative Party Chief Executive Andrew Feldman (left) and chairman Grant Shapps (right), have been accused of alienating ordinary party members . Lord Feldman, an old friend and tennis partner of David Cameron, was accused of branding Tory activists ‘swivel-eyed loons’ earlier this year. The Prime Minister’s support for gay marriage has been blamed for halving Tory membership since the general election. Some Tories in Westminster are also gunning for Mr Shapps, with several MPs and advisers predicting he might be replaced if the Tories finish behind the UK Independence Party in the European elections next May. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Education Secretary Michael Gove, Energy Minister Michael Fallon and Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, are all touted as possible replacements. The intervention comes after Party membership is believed to have collapsed to just 100,000, the lowest level since the Second World War. Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling are among those being touted as possible replacements . The group warns that if the dramatic fall in party membership is not reversed, there will be no one left to deliver leaflets, knock on doors, or raise money to support election campaigns. Robert Woollard, Conservative Grassroots Chairman, said: ‘Mr Cameron must take decisive action if the current situation is to be reversed and this must include allowing members a real say in electing a new Party Chairman. In a swipe at Lord Feldman, Mr Woolard said the PM ‘ must take action against any party official, or parliamentarian who thinks it is fine to insult ordinary members by calling them “swiveled eyed loons”.’ He called on Mr Cameron to ‘stop promoting unpopular policies such as same-sex marriage, HS2, uncontrolled fracking and on shore wind farms’, if he wants to ‘re-engage with ordinary people and party members. ‘He also should take immediate action to honour the manifesto commitment to give married couples a realistic tax break in order to help to strengthen the family and stop penalising stay-at-home mothers.’ In an attack on Mr Shapps, who some Tories see as a captive of Downing Street, Ed Costelloe, former chairman of the Somerset and Frome Conservative Association said party bosses ‘at national and regional level must do more to represent the views of the grassroots rather than being absorbed by the Prime Minister’s circle.’ Mr Woolard added: ‘To secure a majority in the 2015 general election the Conservative Party must re-establish its local grassroots support. Otherwise the numbers will not be there on the ground to do what needs to be done. ‘A General cannot win a war without experienced troops on the ground.’","The Conservative Grassroots group accused senior Tories of alienating ordinary party members .

The British Younghusband expedition to Tibet began in December 1903 and lasted until September 1904. At the start of the 20th century the then viceroy of India Lord Curzon viewed Tibet as a threat to British interests. Even herdsmen encroaching into the British border territories could provoke a diplomatic incident. Fearing Tibet had decided on war with India, and were relying on support from Russia and the Chinese, Lord Curzon sent  an emissary to Lhasa to negotiate with the Dalai Lama. In the summer of 1903 Colonel Francis Younghusband, with a military force of about 200 Sikhs, crossed the border. They waited in Khamba Jong for what they expected to be a large Tibetan and Chinese representation. The expedition fought its way through the country reaching the township of Guru where thousands of Tibetans walked as a mass into machine gun fire. It was a massacre. Younghusband and his expedition entered the capital of Lhasa in August 1904. The Dalai Lama had fled to safety, first in Mongolia and then later in China. A month later Younghusband signed an agreement that gave the British trading advantages and excluded, in theory, others from Tibet.","Shocked owner delighted as heirlooms fetch record price at TV auction .

The Institute for Public Policy Research estimates there are  640,000 16- to 24-year-old Neets (Not in Education, Employment or Training). This comes at a time when there are 529,000 job vacancies, up 56,000 in a year, and raises fears there are now vast numbers of unemployed who have never learnt the basic work ethic needed to get a job. Crisis: The Institute for Public Policy Research estimates there are 640,000 16- to 24-year-old Neets (Not in Education, Employment or Training) Spencer Thompson, an economic analyst at the IPPR, a Left-wing think-tank, said: ‘We know from countless surveys of employers that they value employability and that those skills are lacking among young people. They need people who turn up on time, look presentable and know how to present themselves in an interview.’ A separate report, from the  British Chambers of Commerce, also reveals how many bosses are ‘disheartened, if not downright frustrated’ by school leavers. John Longworth, of the business lobby group, said the education system was letting down young people. He added: ‘Businesses I speak to up and down the country want to work with young people and are happy to train and employ them. ‘But . they are often disheartened if not downright frustrated to find school . leavers and graduates do not have the minimum skills they need to join . the workforce. The research raises fears there are now vast numbers of unemployed who have never learnt the basic work ethic needed to get a job . ‘The most common problems include poor literacy and numeracy, and behaviour and attitudes that don’t meet business expectations.’ Examples include having no idea how to make a telephone call, such as having a polite telephone manner, failing to dress appropriately and a lack of punctuality. Other common faults include  having the wrong manner at work, such as being ‘too matey’ with  senior executives, or simply not even turning up for a job interview. Mr Longworth said: ‘The Government must stop fixating on exam results alone and ensure that soft workplace skills are taught in our school. If not, young people will continue to be left out in the cold.’ Despite the large number of young people who are not working, official figures show the number of job vacancies has reached the highest level since the end of 2008. The IPPR said many youngsters struggle to get jobs if they have never worked, a problem which is particularly acute if they have few qualifications. One in three young people with less than five GCSEs with grades between A* and C and no experience of work are unemployed, compared to only one in six who have work experience. Mr Thompson: ‘A lot of families are better off than they used to be and there is less reason for young people to go out and get part time jobs. There is also been an intangible cultural change. ‘More people are going to university and there’s more emphasis on academic study over the work side of things.’ He added: ‘Very few employers take account of young people with no experience of the workplace. ‘Young people who haven’t had exposure to work are disadvantaged in the recruitment process even for quite low level jobs. The kind of jobs that are available are mostly customer-facing. ‘In the old days, you could stick a young apprentice at the back of the factory. But when you are talking about customer facing jobs in supermarkets or service industries, you have to have some social skills.’ The IPPR said the number of out of work young people who have never worked – 640,000 – is only just below the number who have worked at some point – 650,000. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We are reducing bureaucracy so it is easy for employers to offer work experience. ‘In addition, our new Traineeship programme will make sure young people are work-ready. Changes to college funding mean they will now be paid for the time students spend on work experience.’","Neets are 16- to 24-year-olds  (Not in Education, Employment or Training)

Commuters face a New Year hammering with rail fares to rise by 4.1 per cent. Latest inflation figures used to set increase in ticket costs hit 3.1 per cent last month, and train companies can add an extra one per cent to price rises. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who sets the rules on fares, said it would be another two years before inflation-busting increases would come to an end as he admitted: 'Nobody likes to see rail fares go up. I don't like to see it and passengers don't like to see it.' Campaigners say January's rise will be the sixth time in seven years, as rail fares have outstripped wages . Protests against rail fare rises were held across the country today, as it emerged that the cost of train . travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008. Campaigners say January’s rise will be the sixth time in seven years rail fares have outstripped wages. Although . ticket prices will have risen by 40 per cent since 2008, average . earnings are only expected to have increased by 15 per cent. Mr McLoughlin said: 'Running the railways is a very expensive business. The taxpayer overall is contributing a lot and I am afraid that the passenger has to make his contribution. He does it as a taxpayer and as a passenger as well.' Mr McLoughlin said he hoped above-inflation rises would end by 2015 in line with estimates by the Office of Budget Responsibility's estimates. But his Labour opponent Maria Eagle said:  'David Cameron’s cost of living crisis is leaving families struggling and yet another year of inflation-busting fare rises will just add to the pressure on household budgets. Big money bonuses are needed to coax Network Rail bosses into improving services, the Transport Secretary insisted. Patrick McLoughlin was challenged over why extra payouts were needed for the firm which runs the nation's rail tracks. Chief executive Sir David Higgins and four other Network Rail directors could be paid more than £11million over the next three years – £5million of it in bonuses if they meet performance targets. Sir David intends to leave next year, and is likely to walk away with a severance pay and bonus pot worth up to £1million. But Mr McLoughlin told BBC Radio 4: 'Bonuses is one way which is a reward for delivering those services and has been seen across the front. 'I think there are certain people in the BBC who get bonuses too.' Mr McLoughlin added: 'There's a bit more than just doing their job. We are talking about some very, very complicated engineering works that are going on.' 'At a time when wages are stagnant or falling, it is completely out of touch for Ministers to allow fares to go up by as much as 9.1 per cent again, yet allow private train companies to walk away with £305 million from passengers each year. 'Labour would ban train companies from hiking fares beyond a strict one per cent above inflation limit, introduce a legal right to the cheapest ticket and crack down on rising car parking charges at stations.' The TUC and the Action For Rail campaign group planned to stage demonstrations at almost 50 stations to mark the publication of the latest retail price index (RPI) inflation figure, which is used to calculate next year’s rail fare rise. While the average rise in fares will be capped at 4.1 per cent, the TUC warned some season tickets could rise 9 per cent against forecasts of a 2.4 per cent increase in average earnings next year. It said rail privatisation was costing taxpayers £1.2billion a year despite ‘minimal’ investment in trains and stations. General secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Every year, hard-pressed rail commuters have to hand over an ever greater share of their earnings just to get to and from work. ‘Wage-busting fare rises are not even going on much-needed service improvements. Instead, passenger and public subsidies are lining the pockets of the shareholders of private rail companies.’ Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ‘Getting to work is the biggest single monthly outgoing for many commuters, more than food, more than housing. ‘One of the surest ways of stamping on any green shoots of recovery is to price people off the trains and out of the jobs market.’ Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, said: ‘The increased costs of travel, and the inability of some to afford to travel, contrasts with the increased profits made by train companies.’ Julia Long, of the Unite union, said: ‘The current system of privately-owned operators is haemorrhaging enough cash each year to cut fares by at least 18 per cent without reducing staff or services. Yet every year we see fares soar way beyond the inflation rate.’ Protests against rail fare rises will be held across the country today as it emerged that the cost of train travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008 . But Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ‘Government determines how the average season ticket price rise is set each year. Since 2004, it has been Government policy to allow regulated fares to rise above inflation to support investment in more trains, better stations and faster services. ‘This is helping to drive passenger satisfaction to near record levels while seeking to reduce taxpayers’ contribution towards the cost of running the railways. ‘To help limit future fare rises, the rail industry is working with the Government to find ways of providing services even more efficiently.’","Cost of train travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008 .

So he decided to test his skills on some unique vehicles which have gone down in movie and TV history. Scroll down for video . Jerry Patrick, a car enthusiast from Newnan, Georgia, has created amazingly accurate replicas of iconic vehicles such as the Batmobile . Jerry has been building cars for the last three decades, but a few years ago he got bored with the usual Camaros and Mustangs, so he decided to test his skills on a different type of car . Now his garage houses accurate . replicas of iconic cars like KITT from Knight Rider, Scooby Doo’s . Mystery Machine and the Batmobile. A few years ago, Jerry Patrick decided . it would be a great idea to combine his love for cars with his passion . for films, so he started building functional replicas of some of the . most popular vehicles from the movie and TV over the decades. Starting his search for old cars on . eBay, Craiglist or by word of mouth, Jerry then gets to work on them, . transforming them from shells into dream rides that movie buffs would . snap up in a second. Jerry's collection also includes Herbie the Love Bug, a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle . David Hasselhoff is sure to be impressed with this replica of KITT, the artificially intelligent and nearly indestructible car which helped him fight crime in TV show Knight Rider . 'We've been doing cars off and on for the last 25 to 30 years and it came a time that we had seen enough Camaros and Mustangs at car shows and it was time to bring out some iconic stuff that people could actually touch and feel,' Jerry said when speaking to wsbtv.com. Jerry's collection includes replicas . of Herbie the Love Bug, KITT from Knight Rider and the car driven by . Danny Zuko in Grease's famous race scene. His Batmobile is the most impressive of the extensive fleet and is always guaranteed to turn heads wherever it goes. Complete with retractable machine guns, it also pumps fire and smoke out the back. Fans of the John Travolta and Olivia Newton John hit movie Grease will recognise this car, which was raced along Thunder Road at the end of the film . A copy of Ford Mustang Eleanor from Gone in 60 Seconds has pride of place in Jerry's garage. Eleanor is the only Ford Mustang to receive a star title credit in a movie . Jerry's version took three years to . build. All aspects are custom made and it is almost identical to the original. And it's not just for show, you can actually drive it, although Jerry says it's not easy. 'That Batmobile is a little bit harder to get out on the street for the simple reason there are so many people just taking videos and pictures and it's hard to change lanes, it's hard to speed up or slow down,' Jerry said. 'We normally have to have a chase vehicle (in) front, back and sides of it just to keep everything safe. Heads are often turned when they see Jerry's Batmobile and The Mystery Machine driving around the street of Newnan . The experienced builder juggles between 25 to 35 cars at one time as his projects usually require parts from multiple vehicles to create the finished replica . Jerry puts as much effort into the interiors of the cars as he does the exteriors, as you can see from the inside of The Mystery Machine . 'Of course if we drive it, we try and keep the machine guns down inside the car.' The experienced builder is often . juggling between 25 to 35 cars at one time as his projects usually . require parts from multiple vehicles to create the finished product. So which movie will provide Jerry with his next burst of inspiration? His upcoming projects include Mater from the movie Cars, an A-Team van and Bumblebee from Transformers. Building the replicas mostly for fun, Jerry says he loves the reaction from kids and film fans. He also carries out custom work for clients to help pay the bills. But his labour of love is not always easy, especially when it comes to getting parts for unique cars. He said: 'It's hard to go to Walmart and buy parts for the Batmobile. So you end up making everything for it.'","Jerry Patrick from Newnan, Georgia has built a fleet of cars from the movies .

A warehouse worker who stole a £760 bottle of designer perfume bound for duty free shoppers at Heathrow is facing jail today. Hasmik Blaszyck, 35, helped herself to the high-end scent while working at World Duty Free’s warehouse in Runnymede last summer. But she picked the wrong bottle – a limited edition Swarovski perfume that was one of just 500 produced, and was easily traced back to her. Facing jail: Hasmik Blaszcyk, pictured on her mobile phone outside the Old Bailey (left), was found guilty of theft after stealing a limited edition Swarovski perfume (right) The unique number on the empty perfume box that she had left behind matched that stamped on a crystal bottle found in a wardrobe at her home. She had tried to claim that a workmate had stolen the perfume and that she only received it after it had been taken. But a jury at the Old Bailey found her guilty of theft today. She will be sentenced next month. Judge Stephen Kramer QC, warned Blaszcyk that she could face a jail for the theft. He said: 'I make it clear that, the jury having found you guilty of theft, this is a very serious offence and all sentencing options will be open on September 10 to me.' The court heard that Blaszcyk stole the perfume, Swarovski Aura Prestige Edition,  between May 17 and July 2 last year having started work at World Duty Free's warehouse two years previously. Discount store: The perfume was meant to go on sale at the World Duty Free store at Heathrow Terminal 3 . Each bottle of the Swarovski Aura Prestige Edition is adorned with 11 crystals and only 500 bottles of the fragrance were made. The bottle, which has a lace veil design enhanced by flowers, is presented in a luxurious leather case. According to Swarovski, the bottle has 'pure, futuristic lines' and 'is designed like a long sheath of gleaming metal that envelops the glass'. The perfume's notes say that it is a blend of fragrances including lychee, green tea, peony, lotus and white musk. Prosecutor Ben Irwin said that a stock check at the firm's Perfume Gallery store in Terminal 3 at Heathrow had uncovered the missing fragrance. He said: 'What should have been in place was three bottles of perfume because three had been ordered from the distribution centre. 'One of the three had been sold. The other two were still believed to be in the perfume store. 'When they were checked the boxes were there as you would expect, but one had been opened and the bottle of perfume was missing. 'It had been taken from the box and the box left behind. In fact it was very distinctive because this was a limited edition perfume. 'That bottle - number 255 - was then found at Ms Blaszcyk's home address, in a wardrobe.' She gave no comment when she was interviewed by police. Blaszyck was bailed ahead of the sentencing hearing on the condition she lives at her home address. She had denied theft and an alternative charge of handling stolen goods.","Hasmik Blaszyck stole a crystal bottle of Swarovski Aura Prestige Edition .

Getting rid of your superfluous stuff doesn’t just leave you with empty cupboards, it’s a way of purifying your life. A fresh start. Over the past couple of years, since my son went to university, I have been gradually clearing out the detritus of several decades. At first it was easy but now I’m left with the tough stuff: baby clothes, childhood paintings and — hardest of all — old letters, which seem to demand a more dignified end than the recycling bin. A recent survey for the Royal Mail claims that the art of letter-writing is in terminal decline, replaced by email and social networking. So it is a sign of my age — I’m 54 — that having resolved to eradicate the bit of my past that my letters represent, I’m obliged to dispose of a physical archive. Jane says looking at her old letters has been unsettling - but she can't bear to throw them away . My 20-year-old son, whose correspondence is vast, but entirely electronic, could delete the lot at the press of a couple of keys. It is strange to think that when I was a student, the only way my friends and I could make contact was by letter. There were no mobile phones in the 1970s, no email, no Facebook. So we used to write constantly: an endless stream of notes, all of which I seem, inexplicably, to have hoarded. When I decided to throw out my . letters, I thought I had better look through them first. I hadn’t . realised that reading old letters is like time travelling — a journey . over terrain that seems deceptively familiar but turns out to be . stranger than you remembered, and more hazardous. Plaintive . notes from would-be suitors — ‘Where ARE you?’ — were all muddled up . with brave, funny letters from my grandma, postcards from my tutors . enquiring after undelivered essays, long letters from friends suffering . agonies of boredom during the interminable university vacations, and . reams of juvenile poetry. 'It is strange to think that when I was a student, the only way my friends and I could make contact was by letter' Sifting through this pile of soon-to-be waste paper, I began, fatally, to read. And from the fragments of writing, a long-buried image began to emerge of the person I used to be. And I didn’t like her at all. This earlier me seemed selfish (all those missed appointments with friends who had made the long, dull journey to my distant college room), lazy (all those unwritten essays) and unkind. The love letters made particularly painful reading. The youthful me didn’t strike me as someone who deserved the tenderness and affection that those letters expressed. 'When you write letters you write your life story, and . one rarely emerges well from the account. But it is the human condition to be ridiculous, and I may as well embrace it.' Looking back from a distance of 30-odd years, I know that my younger self was about to become very lonely and unhappy for quite a long time, and I’m afraid it served her right. Between the painful letters of my early 20s and the next batch there is a gap, during which the serious business of living took over. My friends and I survived the hectic period in our 30s while we were juggling work and children with our friendships intact. But for a while there was no time for letter-writing. We were like fogbound ships, hoisting desperate signals, ‘I AM STILL HERE — ARE YOU?’, and hoping that we’d still be in contact when the cloud of busy-ness and exhaustion lifted. When it did, something had changed. I had become a writer, and I began to get letters from strangers in response to things I had written. When the letters were kind and interesting, it seemed only polite to reply. By degrees I accumulated half-a-dozen regular correspondents — people I’d never met but who felt like friends. And then there was email: the perfect hybrid of conversation and letters. It has been predicted that personal letters will soon no longer exist — killed by email and texts as surely as horse-drawn carriages were superseded by the internal combustion engine. But I am not convinced. We may think ourselves more emotionally spontaneous than our letter-writing forebears, but human nature has changed surprisingly little across the centuries. 'I can destroy my half of the correspondence, but I can¿t make the whole thing vanish. If any of my correspondents has kept my letters, that version of me is out there on the loose, capering mockingly beyond my power to control her' (posed by model) ‘My dear Cassandra,’ wrote the novelist Jane Austen to her sister on Saturday March 5, 1814. ‘Do not be angry with me for beginning another Letter to you. I have read [Byron’s poem] the Corsair, mended my petticoat and have nothing else to do…’ To me, that line seems as fresh as though it were written two minutes ago, rather than two centuries. Like the correspondents of 200 years ago, we still crave scandal, reassurance, tenderness, news. Jane Austen’s letters, with their excited updates on the latest fashions and their savage comments about her neighbour’s killer bad breath, may be written in ink on paper, but they are the emails of their time. What you don’t get from email is the satisfying physicality of a letter. Not many people of my son’s age, I imagine, will ever experience the clutch of the heart caused by the sight of an envelope addressed in a longed-for handwriting; nor find themselves unexpectedly reduced to tears when an ancient love letter falls out of a long-unread book that they have idly taken down from  the bookshelf. You can’t fall asleep holding an email. Or mark your place in a book with it. You could print it out, I suppose, but that isn’t quite the same. The way we communicate today means we're in touch constantly, almost no matter where we are in the world . Today’s 20-year-olds won’t miss what . they never knew, but I notice that I still revert to pen and paper when . it comes to serious stuff like love and death. When . I look through my old letters, I have no idea what I wrote that . produced those replies of exasperation, tenderness, amusement or despair . — and I find it disturbing. I can destroy my half of the correspondence, but I can’t make the whole thing vanish. If any of my correspondents has kept my letters, that version of me is out there on the loose, capering mockingly beyond my power to control her. As for my electronic archive, I could wipe my hard disk and hurl my computer into the Thames (as once I planned to drown the letters of a faithless lover), but it wouldn’t make any difference. Each of my email correspondents has the full record of our exchanges, and I can’t take a word of them back. It is a thought that should make me resolve to give up correspondence. But somehow it does not. When you write letters, whether by email or on paper, you write, without knowing it, your life story, and one rarely emerges well from the account. But it is the human condition to be ridiculous, and I may as well embrace it. I . confess, too, that I may even be having second thoughts about throwing . out my correspondence. While re-reading my 30-year-old letters was . upsetting, it made me think about friendship. Most . of those notes are from people I still know and love (though who on . earth was John, who wrote such fervent letters in the Trinity term of . 1977?). The two people I loved best — my grandmother and an old university friend — are dead, and now that I’ve seen their handwriting again, I’m not sure I can bear to throw their letters away. But if I save those, what about the beautiful letter I had from a military historian, saying that my first book made him cry? Or the generous note from a fellow writer, praising my second book? I was so proud to get those letters. Are they really going out with the rubbish? Cupboard space is precious in a house as small as mine. But so are memories. And just at the moment, I can’t decide which I need more.","Jane says it is strange to think how she communicated by letter as a student .

Anthony Nelson has been jailed for four years and eight months after pretending to be a 14-year-old girl on Facebook to groom victims . A paedophile who posed as a 14-year-old schoolgirl on Facebook to groom victims was caught out in a double-bluff by a police officer pretending to be an 11-year-old, a court has heard. Anthony Nelson, 52, was jailed for four years and eight months for inciting a child to have sex, attempting to have sex with a child and possessing hundreds of indecent images of children. The recluse, who lived life over the internet, set up a Facebook profile using a picture of a 14-year-old girl, Teesside Crown Court heard. Using the fake profile, he then befriended an 11-year-old girl and tried to incite her to get in contact with his fictitious character’s mother’s boyfriend Craig. The girl became concerned and told her parents who contacted police. An undercover officer, given the pseudonym Detective Constable Si Fleming for the court case, took over the victim’s Facebook account and monitored Nelson’s increasingly twisted messages. Martin Towers, prosecuting, said: 'In effect, there were two older men communicating with each other in the guise of schoolgirls.' Nelson, from Shildon, County Durham, switched from Facebook to text to communicate with who he thought was a child. Even when the defendant was told the girl he thought he was grooming was 11, he carried on. He even demanded a threesome with the girl, the court heard. Nelson, using the same schoolgirl profile, also tried to groom a 15-year-old from the Thames Valley area. That girl stopped contact when 'it started to get a bit out of control', she later told police. He sent both girls sexual messages, the court heard, but never met either of them. Carl Swift, defending, said Nelson’s long work-hours effectively made him a recluse. 'Accordingly, . he led most of his life on the internet. That kind of lifestyle drifted . into what he accepts was quite disgusting criminal conduct that was . ultimately uncovered by the officers in the case,' he said. Teesside Crown Court (pictured) heard how Nelson also tried to groom a 15-year-old from the Thames Valley area . After he was arrested, police seized computers and found 1,400 indecent images of children and four films of bestiality. Judge Peter Armstrong sentenced him to four years for inciting or attempting to have sex with children and eight months consecutively for the indecent images charges. He told Nelson, who kept his head bowed throughout the proceedings, that the undercover officer deserved praise for the long hours he spent posing as a child. 'That officer is to be commended for his work in bringing together the case against you,' the judge said. 'No doubt there was considerable upset and distress and that officer clearly did an excellent job in bringing you to justice.'","Anthony Nelson set up Facebook profile using picture of a 14-year-old girl .

Mr Gekoski, 33, said: 'I met Gemma whilst I was living in Mozambique. She was setting up swish hotels in Europe but had recently retrained in photography, her passion, and decided to make the move to Africa' They were charged at by wild elephants in northern Mozambique, lived with an Amazonian tribe, swam among killer whales and bull sharks and were chased through Namibia's Skeleton Coast by seal clubbers.

Reminiscing about their colourful exploits, Mr Gekoskisaid: 'We were filming with the shark fin fisherman and had dived down 20 metres, when the fisherman started hauling their nets up around us. Everything, all our equipment got caught in the net. 'It was pretty terrifying; I had to pull out a knife and cut us free. We were very close to being in serious danger. 'In Mozambique, we saw some commotion in the water and decided to jump in and take photos of what was going on.

Miss Catlin added: 'I guess you could call mine and Aaron's meeting serendipitous. Our strengths and weaknesses compliment one another enormously. All the work and constant moving we do is pretty draining - both emotionally and physically - and having my best friend and partner there with me somehow makes it all feel possible. I guess you kind of have to become each other's home. 'Ecomentaries is our little way of reminding people there are still ways we can make a difference and that we shouldn't wait until it's too late to turn things around. 'It's about understanding the way the world works, how our shifting economy and desires are changing it and if there's anything we can do to help. 'Wildlife is often the focus of our stories, but we mustn't forget it's usually man that has created the crisis. Ultimately, our planet wasn't built to cope with so many people, and the rate in which things are changing is staggering - the land is suffering, the wildlife is suffering and the people are suffering.

Sarah Msika appeared before the Nursing and Midwifery Council today accused of leaving a pensioner on the floor with a broken leg . An elderly man died three days after an agency nurse left him lying on the floor with a broken leg, a tribunal has heard. Sarah Msika failed to spot the pensioner was injured when she visited his home near Norwich, Norfolk, it was claimed today at the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Msika allegedly left the patient’s incontinent wife lying in her own faeces in the kitchen propped up against a table leg. Healthcare assistants found the couple lying ‘in the same positions’ on the floor later that day and rushed them to hospital. The elderly man died three days later while his wife passed away six months after the incident. When Msika visited the couple on August 3, 2011, and did express concerns about the absence of food and the smell of urine in the house. David Clark, for the NMC, said: ‘On that visit both Patient A and her husband, Patient B, were siting in chairs and behaving normally. ‘Msika visited the couple again on the following day, and was met with a very different scene. ‘She found both Patient A and Patient B on the floor in different rooms. Patient A was in the kitchen, sitting partly propped up either against a table leg. ‘Her husband Patient B was in the living room and he too was on the floor. ‘He said that he was alright and he would get up in his own time. ‘She (Msika) did not carry out an investigation, she didn’t check for injury, she didn’t ask him if he was injured in any way.’ It later emerged that the elderly man had fractured his leg, the hearing was told. ‘The registrant then went into the kitchen and dealt with Patient A,’ said Mr Clark. ‘She made some attempts to clean the patient and she went and got some clean clothes for her. 'She did not carry out an investigation, she didn't check for injury, she didn't ask him if he was injured in any way' David Clark, Nursing and Midwifery Council . ‘It is our case that those attempts were inadequate and what she did was effectively leave the 79-year-old woman, half-sitting, half-lying on the kitchen floor in her own faeces’, Mr Clark said. Later that day, healthcare assistants visited the couple, finding them in the same positions on the floor, the tribunal heard. ‘Very sadly, the male patient - the husband - suffered a pulmonary embolism and died shortly after the event on August 6’, Mr Clark said. Patient A died in January 2012, the panel heard. A ‘relatively brief’ police investigation was mounted, but no criminal charges were brought against Msika, the hearing was told. If she is found guilty of misconduct, she could be suspended or struck off. The hearing, at the Nursing and Midwifery council, continues . Msika, who is attending with her mother, admits leaving the couple on the floor, failing to call for assistance, failing to recognise Patient B had a broken leg and failing to escalate the situation. She denies leaving Patient A sitting in her own faeces, failing to adequately documenting the incident and not communicating to her colleagues that the couple remained on the floor.
