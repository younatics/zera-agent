"Marc Albrighton has been released by Aston Villa with Premier League newcomers Leicester City his likeliest destination. The winger has been with Villa since he was nine but his contract expired this summer and, as Sportsmail revealed on May 9, the Championship winners are understood to be keen on bringing him to the King Power Stadium on a free transfer. Albrighton, the former England Under-21 international, would receive an improved wage at Leicester with Villa failing to offer fresh terms despite his positive end to the Premier League campaign. Moving on: Marc Albrighton (left) is set to leave Aston Villa for Leicester City after his contract wasn't renewed . Better terms: Albrighton could command a higher salary at Leicester, who have just been promoted to the Premier League . The 24-year-old was sent on loan to Wigan for a month last October, only making four appearances, but returned and was one of the brightest playerâ€™s under Paul Lambert during the survival run-in. Leicester need to strengthen in the wide areas with experienced Lloyd Dyer, 31, looking elsewhere when his contract expires next month. Albrighton matches the profile of players manager Nigel Pearson looks for given his youth, fitness, and level-headedness. He would compete for a starting berth with Anthony Knockaert and Riyad Mahrez. Leicester are also poised to bid for Sheffield United's teenage striker Diego de Girolamo. The 18-year-old is an Italy Under 19 international but was born in Chesterfield. Striker Nathan Delfouneso has also been deemed surplus to requirements by Vila boss Paul Lambert. Gone: Nathan Delfouneso (centre) has also left Aston Villa . Lambert said: 'We wish Marc the best in his future career and acknowledge the contribution he has made to the club over the past several years having graduated from our academy.' Delfouneso, another academy graduate who spent last season on loan at Coventry, departs after 50 appearances following his debut, aged 17, in the UEFA Cup tie against Icelandic side FH Hafnarfjorour in August 2008. Lambert added: 'We also wish Nathan the best for his career and thank him for his efforts since he, too, graduated from our academy.'","Newly-promoted Foxes interested in signing winger on free transfer .

Last year it emerged that, while confined to the basement of a CIA secret prison in Romania about a decade ago, Mohammed, who had earned his bachelor's in mechanical engineering, asked his jailers whether he could design a vacuum cleaner. The agency officer in charge of the prison called CIA headquarters and a manager approved the request, a former senior CIA official told The Associated Press. Mohammed had endured the most brutal of the CIA's harsh interrogation methods, including 183 water boardings, and had confessed to a career of atrocities.","Hirsute  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed featured in advert for Epila products .

"A teenager is to receive an award after going through his entire school career without having a single day off sick. Thomas Kent, 16, of Salendine Nook, in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, never missed a day through primary or secondary school. And not even a broken arm he once suffered, and needed an overnight stay in a hospital, could keep Thomas from his classes - it conveniently happened during his school holidays. Thomas, aged 6 left, and now, right, said he hadn't been aware he had never missed a day throughout school . The teenager said of the award: 'I'm delighted. 'It is something of which I can be proud forever. 'I was conscious of it as I went through school but never realised it would stretch from reception class to college'. Proud mother Karen, 48, also a teacher, said: 'It's great he is receiving some recognition. To have a 100% attendance record over 12 years is a fantastic achievement.' Thomas was a pupil at Reinwood Infant and Junior School before moving up to Salendine Nook High School. He left in the summer with a perfect record and the praise of teachers ringing in his ears. Now studying for A-levels in maths, physics, chemistry and medieval history at Greenhead College, Thomas will return to Salendine Nook next week for the school's annual awards night. Thomas, pictured right aged 6, in the early days of school and, left, in final days with 100% attendance record . Thomas - deputy head boy last year - will receive two awards: one for his 100% attendance record and the other for Outstanding Contribution to School Life. Mrs Kent, a supply teacher at Reinwood, said Thomas had always been fit and healthy despite being born prematurely and weighing just 4lb 6oz. 'He was very small and born at just 32 weeks,' said Mrs Kent. 'He was in the special care baby unit for three weeks but it never held him back. 'He's had the odd cough and sneeze but we've always dosed him with Calpol and sent him off to school telling him to see how it goes. Fortunately, he's always stuck it out.' Thomas caught chickenpox from his sister Emma, before starting school and when he had an accident on a zip wire and broke his arm two years ago he managed to maintain his record. 'It was Spring Bank week so even then he didn't miss any schooling,' said Mrs Kent. Thomas, who is a young leader with Oakes Cubs and Beavers and also an Explorer Scout with Northern Stars at Salendine Nook, hopes to go onto university but doesn't know what career he wants to pursue yet. Ahead of next week's awards ceremony, former teachers have lined up to pay tribute. Karen Butler, head at Reinwood Infants, said: 'I do remember his attendance and attitude towards learning was fantastic and he was presented with a 100% attendance award whilst in year two. 'He was a delightful young man and I'm sure his thirst for knowledge and enthusiasm for learning spurred him on to attending every day!' Nathan Kirby, head of year at Salendine Nook, said: 'From Thomas's first day to his last he was a model pupil. He will be a student I will hold up as an example to others for years to come.' His form tutor at Salendine Nook, Ken Moore, added: 'Tom was brilliant. For me he was the go-to guy. 'If ever I needed to know what was going on regarding school life, and by that I mean stuff I was supposed to know being a form tutor - I went to him and he knew! 'A model pupil. If they were all like Tom the job would be worth doing for free.'","Thomas Kent is now lined up for an award for his 100% attendance record .

"The Hampstead 'set' from more than 150 years ago was captured by a pioneering woman photographer offering a rare glimpse of 19th Century intellectual suburban life. Long-forgotten Victorian photographer Emma Johnston documented the activities of her immediate circle and the many influential visitors to the family home, Manor House. Her pet dog Juno even gets a walk-on part making it perhaps one of the earliest pet portraits in existence. Starting around 1858, Emma Frances Johnston systematically recorded her friends and extended family, capturing them forever on film . Her portraits include William Wardell, the architect of St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney and St Patrick's in Melbourne, Frederick Edwards the geologist-palaeontologist, George Waterhouse, the curator at London Zoo, as well as painters, diplomats and artists' models. The photographer, who pre-dates one of the most renowned of the Victorian era Julia Margaret Cameron, is said to be one of the lost figures of Victorian photography. Not much is known about the Hampstead, middle-class photographer other than her life can be best understood through her photographs which cover the years 1858-1864 . But not much is known about the Hampstead, middle-class photographer other than her life can be best understood through her photographs which cover the years 1858-1864.

Head of Books Mathew Haley said: 'Emma Johnston stands in a great tradition of Victorian women photographers. 'Unlike her famous contemporaries, Lady Hawarden, admired for her technical and artistic achievements and Julia Margaret Cameron, who gained recognition for her celebrity portraits, Emma was chiefly concerned with the daily round of her own social circle which may explain why this most talented of amateurs has been unjustly neglected.'

"Huddersfield chairman Dean Hoyle passed up the opportunity to sign Rickie Lambert for just £750,000 in 2009 as his age 'didn't represent good value for money'. The England international was a target for Huddersfield in 2008-09 before he joined Southampton from Bristol Rovers, which led to a £4million return to his boyhood club Liverpool this summer. Although the 32-year-old is almost certain to be part of England's World Cup squad, Hoyle decided not to pursue the club's interest in Lambert at the time.

Dean Hoyles didn't sign Lambert from Bristol Rovers because he wasn't 'good value for money' Speaking to the Huddersfield Examiner on July 7, 2009, Hoyle said: 'A move for Rickie Lambert is a no-no. 'No disrespect to a very good player, but it’s a simple matter of economics. Any deal would cost a minimum of £750,000 plus add-ons for a player who is 27 and who would want a three-year contract. 'Even if he scored 30 goals a season for those three years, by the time the contract is at an end, the player would be 30, and therefore there would be little or no resale value. Red alert! Lambert has since completed a £4million move to his boyhood club Liverpool . 'That means that even before meeting wage demands, the signing would cost £5,000 a week, and this club cannot do that kind of business. 'If Rickie Lambert was 22 or 23, it would be a different matter, but he’s not and suggestions that we will sign him are nonsense.' The Huddersfield chairman may regret those words after seeing Lambert complete his dream move to Liverpool where he will be challenging for the Premier League title while playing in the Champions League next season.","Huddersfield could have signed Rickie Lambert for £750,000 in 2009 .

'Another possibility is that I may choose to have a break and enjoy watching and observing football throughout the world. What I do know for sure is that I have moved on.'

"Ello, the ad-free social network dubbed a 'Facebook killer' after its huge initial popularity, has raised $5.5m in funding. The site shot to popularity earlier this month, with over 40,000 people signing up every hour at its peak. It's founders say the money will allow them to expand - but pledged to remain ad free. Ello says over 45,000 people an hour sign up at peak times . As a Public Benefit Corporation, Ello is legally obligated to take its impact on society into account in every decision it makes. 1. Sell user-specific data to a third party; . 2. Enter into an agreement to display paid advertising on behalf of a third party; and . 3. In the event of an acquisition or asset transfer, the Company shall require any acquiring entity to adopt these requirements with respect to the operation of Ello or its assets. In other words, Ello exists for your benefit, not just to make money. 'Ello is a simple, beautiful, and ad-free social network,' the team wrote. 'There has been some speculation in the press since our launch eleven weeks ago that Ello will someday be forced to allow paid advertising on its network. 'We understand some of this cynicism: with the Internet turning into one giant billboard, and with virtually all social networks relying on advertising to support themselves, it can be hard to imagine that there can be a better way. 'But 2014 is not 2004, and the world has changed. 'Ello’s explosive growth over the last few months proves that there is a hunger to connect with friends and see beautiful things — without being manipulated by ad salesmen, boosted posts, and computer algorithms that don’t always have our best interests at heart.' Investors have pledged $5.5m (£3.4m). 'We’ll either build a business that doesn’t rely on third party advertising or the selling of user data or we won’t build a business,' said Seth Levine of Foundry Group, one of the firms backing Ello. 'Our belief is that there are products and features that Ello can develop that users will be willing to pay for. 'While the price points may be low, as part of a much larger ecosystem with millions of users, will provide an economic model for the company which supports the business and our investment.' The firm has also taken the unusual step of becoming a Public Benefit Corporation . 'To assure in the strongest possible way that Ello stays focused on its mission to be a different kind of social network, Ello has converted to a State of Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC),  a special for-profit company in the USA that operates to produce a benefit for society as a whole. Ello looks like a cross between Twitter and Tumblr, using the @handles more commonly associated with former. It has already proved popular among consumers . It was created by California-based designer Paul Bundnitz who came up with the design after feeling ‘fed up with other social networks.' ""The Internet is turning into one giant billboard, and with essentially all social networks relying on advertising, data mining, and selling user data, it can be hard for some people to imagine a better way. At Ello, we're building it,"" he said.

"Landon Donovan has been left out of the USA squad for next month's World Cup in Brazil. The 32-year-old, who has 156 international caps and 57 goals to his name, has been left out by coach Jurgen Klinsmann, but Sunderland's struggling striker Jozy Altidore has been selected. It means Donovan will not get the chance to play in his fourth World Cup - a record that would have put him alongside Pele and Bobby Charlton - a tournament in which he has scored as many goals as Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie combined. Scroll down to read Landon Donovan's statement on his omission from the squad . Omitted: USA legend Landon Donovan has been left out by Jurgen Klinsmann . Included: Jozy Altidore is going, despite scoring just one Premier League goal all season . Mocked: Klinsmann's son Jonathan tweeted after finding out about Donovan, though he later apologised . In fact, the forward - who has had two loans spells in England with Everton - has more international goals than any other player going to the Brazil except for Didier Drogba and Miroslav Klose. Donovan released a statement via Facebook on Thursday night expressing his disappointment at Klinsmann's decision. Alongside Altidore, Premier League stars Tim Howard, Brad Guzan and Geoff Cameron have all made Klinsmann's final 23, as well as other notable names DaMarcus Beasley, Michael Bradley and Clint Dempsey. Klinsmann's son Jonathan then caused more controversy by mocking Donovan on Twitter. Jonathan, . a goalkeeper who has been in the USA Under 18s squad, posted: . HHAHAHAHAHAHAH DONOVAN HAHAHAHAA I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE UNTIL MY PHONE . NOTIFIED ME HAHA'. Message: Seattle Sounders midfielder left this message for Cristiano Ronaldo after not making the squad . He later apologised and deleted his account. 'Yes, I deleted the tweet, Yes, I realize it was VERY classless,' he said. 'But again, My sincerest apologies to everyone who was offended.' Another midfielder who didn't make the squad was Brad Evans of the Seattle Sounders - though he had a rather more humorous reaction when informed. He tweeted to Ronaldo: 'You got off easy this time.' USA start their campaign against Ghana on June 16, before playing Portugal and Germany in their remaining Group G games. To my fans, . It . has been an honor and privilege to have represented the US National . Team in three World Cups.

"New Barcelona coach Luis Enrique warned that the wind of change would soon be blowing through the club as they try to make up for their worst season in seven years. 'Players need to know that at Barcelona things move on. We have to be as competitive as we possibly can and there could be changes in all parts of the team,' said the 44-year-old coach. He refused to rule out signing a more conventional centre forward after years of Lionel Messi operating as the club’s ‘false 9’ and said he would speak to Barca’s four-time Ballon d’Or winner after the World Cup. Welcome back: New Barcelona boss Luis Enrique makes his way on to the Nou Camp pitch . New place: Enrique takes up what will be his seat next season . Talks: Enrique will speak with Lionel Messi after the World Cup, but has not ruled out signing a centre forward . 'I am delighted to have the best player in the world at my disposal. He’s just signed a new contract and he has said he wants to stay for life. 'It’s true his level this season has not been as incredible as other seasons but only by the standards he has set. We will work to get the best out of him with Andres Iniesta and with Neymar and with the young players coming through.' There was no mention of Pedro and Alexis Sanchez and he sidestepped a question over whether Cesc Fabregas would be considered ‘untransferable’. All three are understood to be on a list of players the club are open to listening to offers for. Asked about captain Xavi he said: 'He is a friend and a former team-mate but he has an important date in Brazil first and then we will talk.'

Future: Neymar will play a big role for the new manager next season . Welcome: Enrique shakes hands with Barca president Josep Bartomeu (left) and sports director Andoni Zubizarreta . Luis Enrique was also pressed on his ability to handle big egos after stories of fall-outs with Francesco Totti at Roma. He said: 'On my last day at Roma he was one of the few players who came to see me off. There are so many stories about me falling out with Totti I even had my own mother asking me: ""What’s happened with you and Totti?"" There was never a problem between myself and the Roma players. You fall out with players, you make up and you carry on. 'I had a good relationship with Totti. I know how to manage a group and I know how to manage egos, I know how to prepare for matches. A coach has to be a leader and I am ready for that.' New look: Enqrique and his coaching staff take a walk around the stadium . Falling out: Enrique denied a rift between himself and Roma talisman Francesco Totti when he was boss . The new Barcelona manager said he welcomed the reincorporation of Gerard Deulofeu, who spent last season at Everton and who he knows from his last era at the club. 'I want to build a new Barca that wins things and everyone loves to watch,' he said. 'I always said when I left Barca B it was more a, ""See you soon"" than a ""Goodbye"" and that is the way it has turned out. I always thought it was better for me to go elsewhere and come back with experience and now I’m ready to prepare for a great season.' There was a message of support to his former team-mate Pep Guardiola, whom Barca are hoping he can emulate. Old new methods: Enrique said he will not use some of the training routines he used while at Celta Vigo . 'He has worked wonders in another league and I know how hard that can be,' he said. A self-confessed cycling nut, marathon runner and triathlete he also said: 'I’m not going to get the bicycles out. We won’t be doing anything strange. It will be all about the ball and about everyone enjoying training again because this is a wonderful profession.' Asked if he will be using his famous scaffolding tower to observe training sessions as he did at Celta Vigo he said: 'I used it at Roma too. It helps me have a better vision of the sessions but I have an excellent stand here at Barca so it won’t be necessary.'","New Barca boss Enrique is preparing to make changes after the club had their worst season in seven years .

"There is nothing quite as pleasing as arriving on a wet Friday evening off a busy commuter train to a glowing cottage with a kitchen stocked with local treats. A tot of cider brandy, anyone? We need it after that journey. We are staying in pretty Chapel Cottage in Somerset, which is cosy - with its wood-burner in an inglenook fireplace. The taller among us have to mind our heads. This is chocolate-box territory. Shelter from the storm: Chapel Cottage sits just outside the picturesque Somerset village of Blackford . We plan on battening down. But the lovely surrounding countryside and diminutive village of Blackford at the end of the lane (19th-century church, a sprinkling of houses, horse-riders and hearty walkers) begs to be explored. It is hilly, with signposted walks. There’s plenty to see - but a lot of it depends on the weather. Even the sweeping Dorset coastline (within an hour’s drive) can be a little dispiriting in the winter drizzle. Instead we opt for Salisbury, an hour’s drive away. The cathedral is rightly the main attraction. Built in the early 13th century, it is an ornate place of worship, and boasts England’s tallest spire. At 414 ft, it has held the title since the 16th century. All very cosy: The cottage sleeps up to six people, but can also be a splendid location for a couple's weekend . Oh the weather outside is frightful: Chapel Cottage's fireside lounge makes a fine retreat from the rainiest day . If you have a head for heights, you can take a tower tour and see the wood scaffolding erected in the 14th century for repair work. Outside are views of the surrounding landscape from which Constable painted one of his most famous late works, Salisbury Cathedral From The Water Meadows. Next door is Salisbury Cathedral School. It’s an attractive city to wander around, especially when the houses are decked up in their Christmas finery. Back at the thatched cottage, there is a ring binder full of recommendations for local pubs, but we are happy to do no more than settle in by the fire with that cider brandy. Premier Cottages (01963 441311, www.premiercottages.co.uk) has a week’s stay in Chapel Cottage from £595 for up to six people. A three-night short break is from £350.","Chapel Cottage is a discreet hideaway in the lovely Somerset countryside .

"A teenage girl will be charged with a drug-related offense after she handed out marijuana-laced lollipops to her classmates at Enfield High School in Connecticut this week, according to police. Enfieild police said the girl from Connecticut confessed that she had given her classmates the pot-laden candy, making some students ill and leaving one in hospital.

School: The resource officer at Enfield High School, pictured, became aware of the incident after a female student became ill and went to hospital . The girl told detectives that she had received the candy from California. The incident only  came to light when a school resource officer became aware of a 16-year-old female student going to the hospital according to NBC Connecticut. Chris Drezek, deputy superintendent of Enfield Public Schools, said that a student had gone to the nurse's office and the school nurse first thought that she had developed an allergic reaction.

"Everyone knows that break ups can be hard. But if you thought the end of your last relationship was awkward, spare a thought for these former lovers whose text messages to their ex-partners have been shared with the world via a new Instagram feed. Texts From Your Ex promises the spurned lovers, or the ones who broke their hearts the chance to share the most cringeworthy, angry, and sometimes heartbreaking messages sent by their one-time paramour. Promising 'real texts from real exes', the account invites former boyfriends and girlfriends the chance to vent their anger, or share their amusement, by sending screenshots of the SMS conversations in via email, or through Instagram. Already the account has nearly 85,000 followers, with 44 posts uploaded to the photo-sharing site since it was set up a month ago. Here are some of the best... and worst. At least he has his mother: This boyfriend failed to win back the affection of his one-time flame by sharing that his mother had made him a 'delicious' meatloaf out of a gift of meat from his ex before their split. Sadly Kayley was not impressed . Not so pukka: Handing back each others possessions can be one of the hardest parts about a break up. And this former flame seems to want to give it one more shot before requesting the return of a Jamie Oliver book . Got the message yet? This former spouse's request to meet up for a drink didn't go down too well, and was followed by a question on the correct way to refer to divorce proceedings... before their conversation was shared with Texts From Your Ex on Instagram . Polite request: This goodnight message was met with more than a little anger from 'Adam's girlfriend', but she was kind enough to offer him up to her love rival when she is finished with him . B is for bad break up: Telling your ex they smell and look like a Sesame Street character might not go down too well a year after the end of your relationship, even if they do remind you of Cookie Monster . That clean feeling: After seven months you might think this ex-partner would have replaced their toothbrush . Anger: This spurned lover seems more than a little angry at their ex's advice to 'chill' and subsequent apology . Short and to the point? The anger behind this text message seems to be coming through loud and clear . Trying to make it work: Not even the promise of a wedding and a baby is likely to get this man back in his ex-girlfriend's good books after taking money from her wallet . Unsubscribe: This former partner's hopes of dealing with their ex-love in much the same way as an unwanted email does not appear to be working . A change of heart: Most exes find it a struggle to remember not to drink and text, and this drinker's attempt at covering their texting tracks wasn't much of a success either . Devil in disguise: Calling someone Satan is perhaps a little mean, but this former partner didn't seem to be picking up on the fact their ex did not want to talk . Heartfelt: Perhaps it took this ex-partner a long time to figure out their former lover wasn't really interested .","Texts From Your Ex gives former partners to hit back via Instagram .

"A close-knit family, with an urge to return to their European roots, have given up their beach-side Sydney luxury life and sold everything they own in order to move into a run-down French castle. The Bromley family, from Mosman in Sydney's northern beaches, have taken it upon themselves to restore a romantic 14th century French chateau to its former glory and share it with romantics everywhere by transforming it into an affordable boutique hotel. Sher Bromley told Daily Mail Australia that she and her husband, their three children, their son in law and two of their grandchildren have been sleeping on air-mattresses since arriving at the Chateau Le Mung in the south west of France two and a half months ago. The Bromley family, from Mosman in northern Sydney, have moved into the Chateau Le Mung in the south west of France . Sher Bromley (left) told Daily Mail Australia that she and her husband, their three children, their son in law and two of their grandchildren (right) arrived at their new home two and a half months ago . The family of gyprock workers, who bought the property for two million euros and set aside another million for the renovation, are entirely dedicated to turning the 20 acres of land and its buildings into the romantic fairy-tale it once was, but they have a lot of hard work ahead of them. 'It wasn't quite like the advertisement. The outside has been a bit of challenge – I'm not a gardener and this is like having a garden or steroids,' Mrs Bromley said. 'Initially, it was the complete opposite of what we were expecting. The outside is completely overgrown – you couldn't see the outhouses and the summer house was also completely overgrown. 'It sits on 20 acres, so there's a lot of clearing. There's these horrible thorny bushes called brambles and they're taller than me so we've had to get a lot of heavy duty tools to cut and slice through them. We also have to put in a new septic tank. They will spend the next few years restoring the castle and its 20 acres of land and turn it into a romantic boutique hotel . Mrs Bromley said she and her family uncover the chateau's historical secrets each day. Pictured: the original 13th century staircase in the main tower which remains in a 'superb condition' for its age . 'So, all that is happening at the moment and we still have to throw all this stuff out before winter comes so that we can work on the inside.' Within, the 16 bedroom, two-story castle  has also suffered extensive damage and minor deteriorations through ageing, and will require a great amount of re-patching and restoring. 'Inside, the ground floor was the worst, because they haven't cut the tress away for some time it got very damp and so there's a lot of rotten panelling and plaster – but all the problems are just cosmetic. The building is still sound,' Mrs Bromley said. Underneath the cracked paint and peeling plaster, Mrs Bromley said that the Chateau's history continues to peek through the more they clear. The front part of the dovery on the property which has had the wild shrubs recently cleared up . The original tiling on the bottom floor of the castle (left) and the original condition horse stables (right) 'We know that it was built in 1301 and that because it's by the river traders used to come here to pay their pass so they could trade at the time. I also know that an Irish sailor married into royalty and they lived in the chateau,' Mrs Bromley said. 'But there is a big gap in the history of is ownership, right in the middle. A family lived here just before the [second world] war, and the gardener and chauffer lived in the cottages, but after that we don't know. A lot of things were taken over by the Germans at the time, especially big houses and castles, but we don't know what happened or who moved in.' She said the family keep discovering more and more as they continue to fix up the castle, including the original stables, winding circular staircase and cellar. 'We found stuff everywhere. The ground floor has the original floor tiles and they're beautiful and still completely intact. We also found through cutting back all the shrubberies, the water tower and wells are all originals. There's also a laundry which has a sunken floor where the water came in and they washed inside a big bath tub - the whole room is like a paddling pool - and the old taps are still there,' Mrs Bromley said. The Bromley family have started their restoration from the outside and are currently taming the wild bushes and plants that have become overgrown . Once winter arrives, Mrs Bromley said the family will begin to work on restoring the inside of the chateau and its outhouses . 'A lot of the walls inside –  they used to put materials on the wall, not plaster, and some have been hand painted so we are going to have someone come in and restore them and clean them.' By May 2015, Mrs Bromley and her extended family plan to have a small sectionof their 16 bedroom hotel ready for the public . 'We're eventually going to have the oldest part of the building- the first thing ever built, which is the tower – made into a wedding bridal suite, but because there's six bedroom in the whole tower we'd like to offer it to their families as well, so they can have everyone stay in the area. And just on that side at the bottom we have an old chapel, so we want to offer for people to get married there,' she said. 'All the other rooms will be suits that can accommodate families. We also have a lot of land we can't touch so we are thinking of building a golf course on that in the future and we're going to build a swimming pool just near the summer house too.' Built in 1301, the French castle has a mysterious and long history. It is not known who owned the property after the second world war . Before and after: 'The old pump house and water tower, it was a challenge but definitely worth it!' the family wrote on their Facebook page . The other 19 outhouses on the property will be built into homes for Mrs Bromley, her children and grandchildren so that 'the whole family is together'. Nearby, the closest town is Le Mung, with a population of 260 people and so small that Mrs Bromley said 'if you blink you'll miss it'. 'The mayor lives down the road from us and everyone is so supportive because this it the biggest thing they have and it has been neglected for so long – they call it The Sleeping Beauty and now she's finally alive and kicking.' The property will eventually also include a gold coarse and a large swimming pool for hotel guests . Although they've left everything and everyone behind and even have had to learn French from scratch, Mrs Bromley says she and her family regret nothing . Although they've left everything and everyone behind and even have had to learn French from scratch, Mrs Bromley says she regrets nothing. 'In the beginning it was very exciting and as the time to move came closer and you get rid of your furniture and you're jobless, homeless and car-less, it's very scary and you panic because you think ""is it the right thing to do?""' she said. 'But even with the really hard work, and we have got a lot in front of us, I still have no regrets at all. 'Every time you come up that lovely driveway it takes your breath away and you go ""yeh, I did the right thing"".'","The Bromley family, from Mosman in Sydney, left their beach-side life for the French countryside two months ago .

"It's one of the most iconic bridges in the world, and so a known spot for grand gestures. But if ever you find yourself propopsing on New York's rickety Brooklyn Bridge, hold on to the all-important engagement ring - as one Canadian couple find out the hard way last month. Olivia Fader and Mal Zee vacationing from Halifax, Nova Scotia, with some friends on August 9 when Mal decided to propose to her girlfriend. The couple were walking along the busy thoroughfare when they stopped to take part in the famous 'love lock' ritual - only Mal's padlock had a ring attached. Going to the chapel: Canadian couple Mal Zee (left) and Olivia Fader (right) were vacationing in New York when Mal decided to propose to her girlfriend while walking along the iconic Brooklyn Bridge . 'Dont freak out': Mal surprised Olivia at the famous love lock section of the bridge, with the engagement ring on a padlock with a message asking her not to freak out . Overwhelmed: Olivia was in complete shock when her girlfriend got down on bended knee ... ... And ofcourse she said yes. However neither realized the drama that was just about to unfold . But, no sooner had they put they key into the lock that the diamond fell down onto the wooden platform, slipping straight through the gaps. 'Within seconds we were all on our hands and knees, our eyes pressed between the wooden planks, searching for the delicate diamond ring – a diamond in the rough,' Olivia wrote on a blog she set up about the experience. '(Then) 40 feet below us, on an industrial platform inaccessible to the public, we spotted the ring.' One of their friends ran to some nearby NYPD officers, Matthew Manley and William DeFazio, who came to assess the situation, according to The New York Post. 'They were confused at first, but soon understood our plight and committed to getting the ring back to us if it was in their power to do so,' Olivia wrote. New York's finest: Thankfully, two nearby officers agreed to help, and hatched a plan to get the ring back . Rescue-in-progress: The two officers walked back to Brooklyn, got in there car, drove to the spot where the ring fell, and parked . Success!: After a few minutes, officer Manley emerged with the ring and a big thumbs up . 'After much deliberation about their method, they walked back to Brooklyn, drove across the bridge, and stopped Saturday afternoon New York traffic so they could park and make their descent. 'A few minutes later, officer Manley emerged with the thumbs up. The ring was in his hand. The cops then met the women back in Brooklyn, where they were reunited with the ring. Mal then re-proposed to Olivia on firm ground, and she said yes. 'There's a lot of hatred and negativity towards our community; we're certain it will be generations before that is eradicated,' Olivia put in the blog post. 'That's why we felt it important to share our story, to provide a bit of hope that there is good out there too.' Congratulations: The women could not thank the two officers enough for getting the ring back .","Olivia Fader and Mal Zee were visiting New York from Nova Scotio last month when Mal decided to propose .

"Large swathes of the West African population may be immune to the deadly Ebola virus, ravaging the region. The current outbreak, the worst on record since the virus was discovered in 1976, has claimed the lives of 4,493 people, infecting 8,997, the World Health Organisation said yesterday. But a team of scientists in the US believe the Ebola virus may be silently immunising a significant portion of the population, who never fall ill or infect others, protecting them from future infection. These people will never show the tell-tale signs of the disease, the high fever, headaches and flu-like symptoms. Scroll down for video . Experts in the US believe large swathes of the West African population may be naturally immune to the Ebola virus, having been infected but never falling ill.

The scientists at the universities of Texas and Florida if this immunity can be identified it could revolutionise the way public health authorities are tackling the epidemic in West Africa. Red Cross members are pictured removing the body of an Ebola victim from his home . Mambodou Aliya, 35, died in his home. Red Cross volunteers move his body from the house in Monrovia, Liberia . The US experts urged the world's health authorities to focus efforts on identifying those people with natural immunity, saying it could help slow the spread of the disease . They will never succumb to the extreme vomiting, diarrhoea, nor the deadly internal bleeding. If this immunity can be confirmed and identified, it could, a team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas say, change the strategy for fighting the disease. They suggest those found to be naturally immune to Ebola could help slow the spread of the disease in two important ways. Firstly they can be recruited to work as health workers and caregivers, helping treat the most contagious patients and high-risk communities. And secondly their natural immunity may make them prime candidates for donating blood for transfusions to help treat victims. Dr Steve Bellan and Dr Lauren Ancel Meyers of the University of Texas, have called on public health authorities conduct studies in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - the three worst-affected nations. That research would aim to determine how commonplace it is for people to be infected with Ebola without ever developing the symptoms, or spreading the disease. Then, they say, it can be established whether those individuals will be protected from future infection. Dr Bellen said: 'Ultimately, knowing whether a large segment of the population in the afflicted regions are immune to Ebola could save lives. 'If we can reliably identify who they are, they could become people who help with disease-control tasks, and that would prevent exposing others who aren't immune. 'We might not have to wait until we have a vaccine to use immune individuals to reduce the spread of disease.' Led by Dr Bellan, the team, which also included Juliet Pulliam, an assistant professor at the University of Florida, looked at studies conducted in the aftermath of past outbreaks. One showed 71 per cent of people who had close contact with an Ebola patient and tested positive for the virus did not fall ill. Another revealed 46 per cent of people who came into close contact with a victim and did not get sick, had evidence of infection with the virus. Dr Pulliam added: 'We want to know whether people who are infected without getting sick become immune. 'If these people are protected from future infections, this would open up new opportunities for controlling the disease.' People with natural immunity could be recruited as health workers, helping to treat victims of the disease . And the scientists said those with natural immunity could pave the way for people to offer blood transfusions to those infected with the virus . A healthcare worker is sprayed with disinfectants after working at a treatment centre in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone . Health workers wear protective gear before entering a treatment centre in Freetown, Sierra Leone . She added: 'If infection without disease protects people from future Ebola infections and illness, the epidemic should decline sooner than currently predicted and affect a smaller number of people.' But it is not yet known whether such infection provides immunity. The scientists conclude that resolving the question of whether asymptomatic infection provides immunity could be critical. The outcome, and subsequent identification of naturally immune individuals, could help shape public health efforts to contain the disease, as well as allowing for accurate estimates for the likely spread of the disease. Professor Meyers said: 'Understanding the prevalence and immunological effects of these silent Ebola infections is critical to making reliable epidemic projections and improving control efforts. 'We believe that we can and should investigate this phenomenon as soon as possible.' Dr Pulliam added: 'If we can take advantage of natural immunity within the affected communities, we may be able to impact the course of the epidemic even before a vaccine becomes available. 'Even if current projections overestimate how big this epidemic will become, its effects are devastating, and a global effort to control the spread of Ebola within West Africa remains imperative.' The scientists' published their thoughts in a letter which appeared in The Lancet medical journal on Tuesday.","Experts in the US say a  study into a past Ebola outbreak found 71% of people who had close contact with a victim and tested positive never fell ill .

"UEFA Under 17 European ChampionshipsWednesday - Ta'Qali Stadium, Attard, Malta . Kick-off 6pm (UK time)Live on British Eurosport . If England's Young Lions need any inspiration ahead of Wednesday night's UEFA Under 17 European Championship final with Holland, they only need to cast their minds back four years. For a certain Ross Barkley - then 16 - stood in their shoes back in 2010, running the midfield as England beat Spain 2-1 to lift the trophy. Now, the Everton man is heading to next month’s World Cup in Brazil as the country’s latest great hope and living proof that dreams can quickly be realised for talented young players. Shot at glory: England's Under 17s celebrate their European Championship semi-final win over Portugal, setting up Wednesday night's final with Holland . Dancing a jig: Tafari Moore (left) and Joshua Onomah (centre) join Dominic Solanke (right) in celebrating the latter's goal in the 2-0 win over Portugal . GROUP STAGE .

May 18Portugal 2-0 (Solanke, Roberts) John Peacock’s side will line up . against the Dutch at the Ta’Qali Stadium in Malta hoping to guide . England to a second win in this competition and take another step up the . ladder. The captain Ryan Ledson, coming through the ranks at Everton, is particularly keen to follow in Barkley’s footsteps. ‘Ross . has gone from this level to the World Cup squad so quickly and he’s . someone we all look up to,’ he said. ‘He’s an inspiration to everyone in . the team.’ It is a . sentiment echoed by coach Peacock, also in charge back in 2010 when the . team featured the likes of Connor Wickham, Saido Berahino and Josh . McEachran. ‘You hope someday that these players will go on to bigger and better things,’ he said. ‘The . World Cup is just around the corner and we have experiences of players . that have come through our system and are now ready to play a part in . Brazil. I think that’s what it’s all about.’ Watching on: Coach John Peacock is hoping to lift the European Championship trophy for the second time . Young Lions: England line up before the semi-final - (front row, L-R) Adam Armstrong, Jonjoe Kenny, captain Ryan Ledson, Tafari Moore and Lewis Cook; (back row, L-R) Isaiah Brown, Dominic Solanke, Joseph Gomez, goalkeeper Frederick Woodman, Taylor Moore and Patrick Roberts . Peacock . has one injury concern for the final in Newcastle United striker Adam . Armstrong, who is rated 50-50 after hobbling out of the 2-0 semi-final . win over Portugal with an ankle problem. His . team have already suffered defeat by Holland at this tournament – 2-0 . in a dead rubber final group game after they had already qualified for . the last four. Wins over . Malta and Turkey had by that point set up a semi-final with Portugal, . where second-half goals from Chelsea forward Dominic Solanke and Fulham . midfielder Patrick Roberts sealed their progress. Delight: Dominic Solanke (left), Freddie Woodman (centre) and Patrick Roberts celebrate England's progress to the final. Solanke and Roberts both found the scoresheet . Inspiration: Ross Barkley was in the Under 17 team when they beat Spain to win the trophy in 2010 and is now in the senior World Cup squad . Having . already encountered Holland once, Peacock knows what to expect. 'I . think there are two very good teams in the final, and two attacking . teams. I would expect that it will be a real good game of football,’ he . said. 'Holland have done . well over the last few years, especially this age group, and they are . doing exceptionally well in their development work.' But . he added an optimistic note: 'Back in England it is the same, and . reaching this final will give everybody a lift. That’s the biggest plus . point. Reaching this stage is a massive achievement for these players . and will be a massive experience.' Ledson expects a tough assignment too. He said: 'Holland are a good attacking side but it's a challenge and it's a great game for the lads to be involved in. We'll give it our best shot.' GOALKEEPERS . Freddie Woodman (Newcastle United) - 17-year-old stopper who has established himself as No 1 at this age group during qualifying and has maintained that status at this tournament. Freddie is the son of former Northampton Town and Brentford player Andy Woodman, now goalkeeping coach at St James’ Park. Calling the shots: Goalkeeper Freddie Woodman issues instructions during the semi-final win over Portugal . Sam Howes (West Ham United) - 16-year-old keeper who has already progressed to West Ham’s Under 21 side, making three appearances this season. Made his first England Under-17 appearances against Belgium at St George’s Park back in January. DEFENDERS . Jonjoe Kenny (Everton) - Everton Academy product who can play right across the back four. The 16-year-old has demonstrated that impressive versatility in his 12 outings for Everton’s Under 21 side this season and that good form has continued in Malta. Even got himself on the teamsheet in the 4-1 win over Turkey. Taylor Moore (Lens) - A rare . example of an England international who plies their trade abroad, . Walthamstow-born Moore moved to France with his parents aged seven and . is a member of the Lens Under 19 team. Made his debut in the Algarve . Tournament back in February and can also play in a midfield role. Delivered an excellent ball from the half-way line to set Dominic Solanke free to open the scoring against Portugal in the semi-final. Driving force: Taylor Moore (right) takes on Portugal's Diogo Goncalves during the last four match on Sunday . Mandela Egbo (Crystal Palace) - Right-back who has stepped up from the England Under-16s to the Under 17s this season and featured in qualifiers against Gibraltar and Albania. Dael Fry (Middlesbrough) - Tall centre-half who names Jonathan Woodgate as his inspiration. Played out of his natural position at left-back during the qualifying win over the Czech Republic back in March, having made his Under 17 debut against Belgium two months earlier. Joe Gomez (Charlton Athletic) - Tall, 16-year-old centre-half who played in five out of the six European Championship qualifiers, during which England conceded just the one goal. Has a good chance of making Charlton's first team next season and has furthered his case here. Big man: Joseph Gomez closes down Portugal's Goncalo Rodrigues during England's last match . Tafari Moore (Arsenal) - Dreadlocked right-back who plays regularly for Arsenal’s Under 21 team and was a member of their Under 18 squad that made the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup this season. Played every minute of the Elite Round of qualifiers. MIDFIELDERS . Lewis Cook (Leeds United) - Tough tackling 17-year-old who will help protect the defence. Has been a regular in John Peacock’s squads for some time and part of the England youth set-up for three years now. Ryan Ledson (Everton) - The England captain features in all the qualifiers and is skilled in both the defensive and offensive aspects of his central midfield position. Was involved in 17 matches for Everton’s Under 21 team this season and was named on the bench as an unused substitute by Roberto Martinez for the recent Premier League matches against Southampton and Manchester City. Skipper: Ryan Ledson (right), of Everton, in action for England during their final group match against Holland .

"Harry Redknapp junior has followed in his grandfather's footsteps and joined AFC Bournemouth. The seven-year-old has signed an academy contract with the south coast club and will feature for the Cherries' Under 9's next season. All smiles: Harry Redknapp junior (right) has joined Bournemouth's academy for next season . The starlet is the latest Redknapp to join Bournemouth's academy after his uncle, and former Liverpool and England international midfielder, Jamie rose through their ranks. Described as ""direct, strong and a good little goal scorer,"" the club's techinical development officer Matty Holmes is excited by the potential of the seven-year-old. 'Harry was playing for Moordown locally so we had an eye on him,' he told Bournemouth's official club website. 'A few scout reports came back saying he was progressing very, very well, so we bought him into our Academy sessions around November last year. Starlet: Redknapp's uncle Jamie (left) came through Bournemouth's academy before playing for England . 'He's been playing with the top under 8s we've got and he's shown really good progression. He's improved his technical work and his receiving and passing skills have come on no end. 'So with that in mind, and the fact that he comes from a footballing family background, we feel he has a great chance of progressing in our system and that's why we have offered him a contract.' Current QPR boss Harry Redknapp enjoyed two separate spells with the Cherries as a player and a manager - with the 2-0 FA Cup victory against holders Manchester United in 1984, as Bournemouth boss, still hailed by supporters.

"Manchester United are already making moves to bolster their defensive options by triggering a £24million release clause for Atletico Madrid's Miranda, according to reports in Spain. The 29-year-old centre-half played in the Champions League final extra time defeat against city rivals Real in Lisbon on Saturday. Miranda was a mainstay for Diego Simeone's La Liga champions last season and is set to link-up with Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford after being offered a four-year deal. Incoming! Manchester United have triggered Miranda's release clause of £24m at Atletico Madrid . Key man: The Brazilian has been important for Diego Simeone during their La Liga title last season . Age: 29 . Height: 6ft 1in . Position: Centre-back . Club: Atletico Madrid . Apperances last season: 45 . Brazil caps: 7 . Clauses are mandatory for all players in Spain, and with United seemingly operating with a blank chequebook this summer, the hefty fee hasn't deterred them. Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari didn't pick the big defender in his World Cup squad - a decision that has come as a surprise given Miranda's recent performances. Spanish newspaper AS claim that he has been in Manchester looking at schools in the area ahead of a potential deal. Van Gaal has identified the heart of his . defence as a problem area, particularly after the departures of Rio . Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic has left the squad devoid of numbers. And Miranda, despite his age, appears a safe choice after enjoying a renaissance on the continent since moving to Vicente Calderon three years ago. What a picture! New boss Louis van Gaal has identified central defence as a problem position at Old Trafford . Target: Manchester United have joined a host of clubs in chasing PSG youngster Adrien Rabiot (right) He did move back to Brazil with Sao Paulo in 2006 after ill-fated one-season spells with Coritiba and Sochaux. United have also continued to keep tabs on Paris Saint-Germain's Adrien Rabiot, who wants to leave the club over a lack of games. The 19-year-old is highly thought of in France and is the source of interest from Premier League clubs including Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea. He is one half of the best central defensive partnership in Europe and if Manchester United do manage to land him they will have some player. Think Ricardo Carvalho in the John Terry/Carvalho partnership in Jose Mourinho’s first spell at Chelsea. Diego Godin is Atletico's Terry – the brave leader heroically throwing himself in front of shots, sliding into tackles and heading in set-pieces - while alongside him Miranda is the cool head; the perfectly positioned partner who often goes unnoticed because he barely puts a foot wrong. You don’t need the dramatic lunge if you are always in the right place at the right time. Most commentators in Spain believe Miranda has been the best defender in La Liga this season and no one can quite understand why both he and his Atletico team-mate Felipe Luis have been left out of the Brazil squad – all the better for United who will get a player who has rested throughout the summer having put in the season of his career. Six times Lionel Messi faced Miranda this season and the Argentine failed to scored, played out of the game by the 29-year-old who was consistently voted best defender in Brazil before Jorge Mendes helped bring him to Atletico Madrid from Sao Paolo in January 2011. As well as being impeccable defensively he knows how to get forward and score important goals, giving Atletico the Spanish Cup last season by notching the winner at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid. The fact that his outstanding displays have caught everyone’s eye this season extends to Spain coach Vicente del Bosque. The World Cup-winning manager enquired over the defender’s international status. Unfortunately for Spain, he had already played full internationals with Brazil and can’t follow Diego Costa in making the switch to Spain.","Brazilian defender set to clinch four-year deal at Old Trafford .

"A vaccine to protect millions from the Ebola virus decades after it was first detected does not exist because the disease previously only affected poor African nations. The head of the World Health Organisation's scathing conclusion came as nearly 5,000 people have lost their lives to the hemorrhagic fever - the majority in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO, criticized drugs companies for turning their backs on 'markets that cannot pay'. She said the current outbreak - the most deadly in history - has exposed two WHO arguments 'that have fallen on deaf ears for decades'. Scroll down for video . A vaccine to protect millions from the Ebola virus decades after it was first detected does not exist because the disease previously only affected poor African nations, the director general of the World Health Organisation has said. The first Ebola drug trial in Africa has started with three healthcare workers in Mali, pictured . Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO, said: 'Why are clinicians still empty handed, with no vaccines and no cure? Because Ebola has historically been confined to poor African nations' Three Malian health workers have been given the experimental vaccine, as 37 more prepare to take part in the trial. It is hoped the first results of the trials will be available at the end of next year . There are also vaccination trials ongoing in the US and UK, and GlaxoSmithKline, who are working on developing the drug, are producing 10,000 doses, which, if the first phase of the trial prove successful, will be available to vaccinate front line healthcare workers in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea early next year . Addressing the regional committee for Africa in Benin yesterday, Dr Chan said: 'Ebola emerged nearly four decades ago. Why are clinicians still empty handed, with no vaccines and no cure? 'Because Ebola has historically been confined to poor African nations. 'The R&D (research and development) incentive is virtually non-existent. 'A profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay. 'WHO has been trying to make this issue visible for ages. Now people can see it for themselves.' She highlighted an 'urgent need to strengthen long-neglected health systems', in Africa. 'When heads of state in non-affected countries talk about Ebola, they rightly attribute the outbreak's unprecedented severity to the ""failure to put basic public health infrastructures in place"",' Dr Chan said. 'Without fundamental public health infrastructures in place, no country is stable. No society is secure. 'No resilience exists to withstand the shocks that our 21st century societies are delivering with ever-greater frequency and force, whether from a changing climate or a runaway killer virus.' She added: 'The Ebola outbreak that is ravaging parts of West Africa is the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times.' Professor Peter Piot, one of the team who first discovered the Ebola virus in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic Congo, in 1976, has warned the current outbreak is unlikely to be brought under control in the absence of a vaccine. Nurses prepare to carry the body of an Ebola victim for burial in a community on the outskirts of Monrovia . A Red Cross worker picks up the body of a suspected Ebola victim, removing it from a township in Monrovia, ready for burial . Giving a seminar at Oxford University last month, he said: 'In theory Ebola is very easy to control, but it has got completely out of hand. 'This is no longer an epidemic, it is a humanitarian crisis. It may be we have to wait for a vaccine to stop the epidemic. 'The good news is I think this is the last Ebola outbreak where we only have isolation and quarantine to treat. 'Hopefully we will have a drugs and vaccines to offer in Africa.' Development of vaccines typically take up to 10 years, but in August WHO took the unprecedented decision to fast-track clinical trials of those drugs in development. The most promising vaccine is GlaxoSmithKline's ChAd3 drug. The pharmaceutical giants are working with the US National Institues of Health to develop ChAd3, which is currently the subject of clinical trials in the USA, UK, Mali and Switzerland. Initial results from the phase one trials are expected by the end of next year, the company said. The UK-led trials are taking place at the Jenner Institue in Oxford, supported by a £2.8million grant from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the Government. Funding from the consortium supporting the vaccine is enabling GSK to begin manufacturing around 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine in preparation. A Liberian burial team collect the body of a victim at a motor vehicle garage in Paynesville on the outskirts of Monrovia . Health workers stand in an area used for Ebola quarantine after caring for two-year-old Fanta Kone, who died at an Ebola virus center in  Kayes, Mali - the first death in the country . It means if the phase one trials are a success, the next stage of the clinical trial can begin early next year, involving the vaccination of thousands of frontline healthcare workers in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. GSk said: 'If the vaccine candidate is able to protect these healthcare workers as we hope it will, it could significantly contribute to efforts to bring this epidemic under control.' Another potential vaccine, VSV-EBOV, is being developed by scientists at Canada's Public Health Agency, supported by a £3.1million grant from the Wellcome Trust. Animal studies have suggested the vaccine is 'very effective', and clinical trials began in the US last month. Professor Peter Piot said the current outbreak will not be brought under control until there is a vaccine . The first results are expected by December, and there are plans to trial the vaccine in Europe, Gabon and Kenya. In August the Canadian Government announced a donation of the experimental drug to the WHO. The first shipment - which will ultimately total 800 vials of the vaccine - was sent to the WHO in Geneva in October, where partners and the health authorities from the affected nations will determine how the vaccine should be distributed and used. Since Professor Piot and his colleagues first uncovered the deadly disease in 1976 there had been 25 outbreaks until the current epidemic. In the virus' 37-history, there had been around 1,500 deaths, confined to central Africa, until a two-year-old child in a remote Guinean village died from Ebola in December, sparking this crisis. Equating to around 40 deaths a year, Professor Piot said Ebola was not considered a big public health problem. As a result there had been little interest from pharmaceutical companies and governments around the world in focusing on developing a vaccine. Professor Piot, said: 'We always thought it would be an accident of nature, and that now and then people would die. 'Most of these outbreaks have been in central Africa. There was one in Ivory Coast but that was a different strain from 1976. 'They have mostly been contained to the Congo, Uganda and South Sudan. 'That is why there wasn't much interest in this outbreak at the start, because it wasn't really a big issue. 'All that changed this year.'","Dr Margaret Chan, director general of WHO said there is no Ebola vaccine  because it had only affected poor African nations .
Speaking at the regional committee for Africa in Benin, she criticised drugs companies for turning their backs on 'markets that cannot pay'
Dr Chan said current outbreak had exposed two WHO arguments 'that have fallen on deaf ears for decades'
She highlighted an 'urgent need' to strengthen African healthcare systems .
Professor Peter Piot, who helped discover Ebola in 1976, warned the current outbreak will not be brought under control under there is a vaccine .
Two promising drugs are in development are there are trials taking place in the US, UK, Mali with plans to extend them in Europe, Gabon and Kenya .
First safety and efficacy results are expected by the end of next year .
Healthcare workers in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea could receive the trial drugs as part of the second phase of trials in January ."
"Three men posed as police officers to force their way into a house and drag a father-to-be from his bed before they stabbed him to death in front of his pregnant fiancee, the Old Bailey heard. Danny Gough, 24, was dragged to the floor and stabbed so many times by Sam Monteith, Stephen Dougherty and Paul West, 30, it was impossible for him to survive. The court heard the three men had surveyed Mr Gough's fiancee's house for days and equipped themselves with an axe, machete and possibly a sword for the attack. Danny Gough, 24, was hacked to death in front of his pregnant fiancee after being dragged to the floor . They were the kind of weapons that could be used 'silently but lethally', said Mark Heywood, prosecuting. The trio were caught after they left a Jiff lemon bottle, containing ammonia, behind which they used to spray in the eyes of Mr Gough so he could not protect himself. His pregnant fiancee Kareena Modashia was also sprayed so that she could not identify them. Mr Heywood said: ‘This case concerns a truly vicious killing, one motivated by vengeance and the need to remain in criminal control.' Mr Gough, 24, was stabbed with an axe, machete and possibly a sword until he was dead lying on the floor . The court heard Mr Gough had been involved in an ongoing feud with Stephen Dougherty, 36. Mr Gough's friend Leanne Meredith was involved in a fight with Dougherty and Monteith, 33, in a pub. Mr Gough took revenge by breaking into Monteith’s home in Wallington, Surrey, with two others. Mr Gough was hacked to death in front of his pregnant fiancee, Kareena Modashia, (left).  A series of violent threats from the trio included having him raped in front of his mother Debbie Gough (right, arriving at the trial) Monteith was attacked with ammonia and knives, leaving a 10cm cut across his face - a scar clearly visible at court today during his trial. During the attack Mr Gough and the two others took Monteith’s phone, the court heard. In revenge Dougherty then called Mr Gough to make a series of threats in the weeks leading up to the killing. Paul West, 30, is accused of murdering Mr Gough . Dougherty told Gough he was going to have him raped ‘in front of your ugly mum,’ it is claimed. The men then carried out surveillance of Miss Modashia's house, watching neighbours and monitoring Mr Gough's condition so they could ensure the attack would occur when people were less alert. Mr Heywood said: ‘They had the information from someone close by, they dressed for the business and armed themselves with the kind of weapons which could be used silently but lethally, weapons with only one purpose - an axe, a machete and a long-bladed instrument, possibly a sword.’ The court heard the men then put their plan into action in the early hours of December 14 2010. Mr Heywood told the jury: ‘They went to his door, shouted police as a distraction, as a cover, they forced their way through the door and using information they went up the stairs and into the bedroom that he occupied with his girlfriend Kareena Modashia. ‘They dragged him from his bed, pulled him to the floor and hacked and stabbed at his body causing so many serious wounds that he had no hope of survival. ‘They left only when one of them said ‘he’s dead.' Mr Heywood said the trio then left quickly and quietly, disposing of anything that may link them to the killing. He added: ‘They left only one thing behind by mistake, it was dropped in the final moments when other members of the house heard and were awoken - it was a Jiff lemon bottle filled with ammonia. ‘It was used to spray into the eyes of the deceased so that, although he was sleeping and naked, he was unable to defend himself. ‘They also sprayed the others, his girlfriend and her mother so that it disabled them from identifying the attackers.' Dougherty, of no fixed address but formerly of Mijas, Spain; West, of Eaton Avenue, Slough, Berks, and Monteith, of Brighton Road, Sutton all deny murder. The trial continues.

"The customized Captain America chopper Peter Fonda allegedly rode in Easy Rider has sold for $1.3 million despite claims that it is a fake. Bidders rushed to snap up the Harley Davidson when went under the hammer in Calabasas, California, this week after auctioneers claimed it is the only remaining motorcycle built specifically for the film. But the lucrative sale was sullied after Texan collector Gordon Granger claimed he owns the chopper used in the film, insisting he bought it from Dan Haggerty, an actor with a bit part in the 1960s counterculture classic. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sold! This is the chopper that has sold for $1.3 million at auction in Calabasas despite claims it is a fake . 'There's a big rat stinking someplace in this': Even the 74-year-old Oscar nominee, who wrote and starred in the 1960s classic, called on Profiles in History auction house to cancel the 'embarrassing' sale . The actor spoke out to quell the rumors, telling the Los Angeles Times that he has authenticated and sold two Captain America bikes - and the real one sold at the auction. The chopper features a forward-angled front wheel and handlebars, fishtail exhaust pipes and a teardrop-shaped gas tank where the movie's protagonists stashed their cash. It was designed with input from the movie's writer and star Peter Fonda who insisted on it being decorated with the American flag. Easy Rider is a 1969 road film about two drug-using, long-haired bikers, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper), who go on a cross-country odyssey to New Orleans in search of personal freedom and easy money. Four motorcycles were created for the movie, but only one is known to have survived. It was used in the climactic crash scene in which Fonda is thrown off the bike. Fonda sketched the original design but doesn't want to take a side. 'I'm no expert, and I can't tell you which one is real,' he said. 'I know there are two bikes out there that are both authenticated by Haggerty. That's not right.' However he did authenticate the bike up for auction after a brief examination and even signed its gas tank. Auctioneer Brian Chanes holds a photo of Peter Fonda on the iconic Harley, which Fonda helped design himself . The real deal? Actor Dan Haggerty, who had a bit-part in the movie, sits on the chopper he claims he rebuilt after its crash in the final scenes of 'Easy Rider'. He spoke out to quell rumors that it is a fake, insisting it is real . He says that until a few years ago when he learned to the other possible Captain America motorcycle he had no reason to doubt Haggerty's word. Now he regrets endorsing the bike. 'It's embarrassing, and infuriating,' he said. Earlier this week, he called on Profiles In History auction house to cancel the sale. 'There's a big rat stinking someplace in this,' said the 74-year-old actor, who co-wrote Easy Rider. The chopper's owner Michael Eisenberg, a Los Angeles real estate agent and collector of Hollywood memorabilia, bought the bike earlier this year from John Parham, a Midwestern motorcycle parts magnate who had purchased the bike from Haggerty 12 years earlier. Fonda signed one Harley's gas tank before he knew that there was as controversy over authenticity . Conflict: Haggerty did not deny that he signed  authenticating documents for another chopper but now says he signed something inaccurate. Granger has refused to accept Haggerty's revelation and is sure his is real . Eisenberg insists his bike is the real one, because Haggerty says it is. 'Dan Haggerty is the only guy who knows,' Eisenberg said. Haggerty did not deny that he signed Granger's authenticating documents. He now says he signed something that simply was not true. 'That was my mistake,' Haggerty said. 'It's not the real bike.' Granger, furious at the prospect of this weekend's auction, insists he owns the genuine article. 'They know damn well they don't have the real bike,' Granger said. 'I own the original remaining Captain America bike. The one to be auctioned is a replica.'","Bidder paid $1.3m for Captain American chopper 'ridden by Peter Fonda'

"Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick said the mix of resource, population and Government policy pressures was a significant factor in the 'rapid deterioration' in safety . Fights and assaults are a daily occurrence in the nation's prisons with unprecedented levels of violence, a damning report has warned. The chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick also found suicides behind bars are at a 10-year high. And he suggested that the rise in problems in jails could be linked to government reforms and spending cuts, a claim disputed by the government. In his annual report, Mr Hardwick said prisoners are increasingly clambering on to the netting between wing landings in an attempt to be moved to a safer prison. So-called incidents of height - described as 'a one person riot' - nearly doubled in 2013-14 to 1,007 from 591 in the previous year. Inmates climb on to the netting or railings in the hope they will be taken to segregation units and then 'shipped out' of the prison to a safer jail, where conditions appear better or where they will be closer to home, the report added. Mr Hardwick said the mix of resource, population and Government policy pressures was a significant factor in the 'rapid deterioration' in safety and increase in violence at prisons in the period. Elsewhere, the report said the number of assaults involving adult male prisoners increased by 14 per cent on the year before and was the highest for any year for which there is data. There was also a 38 per cent rise in the number of serious assaults. Mr Hardwick said: 'In all establishments there were fights and assaults almost every day.' But the inspector said 'of most concern' was the 69 per cent increase in the number of self-inflicted deaths from 52 in 2012013 to 88 in 2013-14, the highest figure in 10 years. Mr Hardwick said the deterioration in safety and rise in violence was set against a backdrop of £84 million cuts to public sector prison running costs and £88 million saved as a result of the closure of older prisons. In addition, planned staffing reductions involved in these changes resulted in a significant loss of more experienced staff as old jails closed. Meanwhile, the total prison population rose from 84,083 at the end of April 2013, which was 96 per cent of the usable operational capacity, to 85,252 at the end of March 2014, 99 per cent of the usable operational capacity. And ministers are pushing through a significant policy agenda, the inspector said, including Government plans to transform rehabilitation. Prisons Minister Andrew Selous said: 'The last year has seen the Prison Service manage major organisational change to create significant savings for the taxpayer - it has been challenging for staff and I thank them for their hard work and dedication. 'During this time we have always had enough staff to deliver decent and safe prison regimes, and this will continue to be our top priority. 'We remain committed to reducing violence and understanding the reasons for the recent rise in self-inflicted deaths. 'But this is a complex issue and the Chief Inspector has failed to provide any evidence to support his assertion that this is linked to the reforms made under this Government.' There was a 69 per cent increase in the number of suicides in prisons from 52 in 2012-13 to 88 in 2013-14, the highest figure in 10 years . A Prison Service spokesman said: 'There is no evidence to link staffing levels, or crowding levels, to the number of self-inflicted deaths across the estate. We always closely monitor any possible trends.' Responding to the Chief Inspector's report, a Downing Street spokeswoman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'Our priority is keeping the British public safe and making sure our prisons are run in a safe and decent way. 'We will always ensure there are enough staff to deliver safe and effective prison regimes, and we will always keep looking at what more we could be doing. 'If you look at the facts and what prison staff have done in recent years, assaults are lower, numbers of positive drugs tests are lower, numbers of escapes from custody are lower, so we are making progress.' Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'Safe and decent prisons are a mark of a civilised society. 'From the Chief Inspector's shattering, incisive overview it's clear that our deteriorating prisons are less safe and less decent than even a year ago.'","Nick Hardwick blamed cuts, rising numbers and reforms for problems .

"Ireland stalwart John O’Shea backed Roy Keane to thrive in the Glasgow goldfish bowl if confirmed as Celtic’s new manager. The centre-back offered a glowing appraisal of his former Manchester United team-mate as speculation over Keane’s future intensified. With every indication pointing to him being appointed Parkhead boss early next week, Martin O’Neill expects to learn in the next 72 hours whether he will lose his assistant from the Irish national team set-up. In the limelight: Republic of Ireland's John O'Shea talks to reporters ahead of the friendly against Italy . There is rival interest in Keane – with West Bromwich Albion thought to be in the frame – but sources in Dublin remain confident he will take up the challenge of replacing Neil Lennon. Keane travelled with the Ireland squad to London on Friday ahead of their friendly against Italy at Craven Cottage. It is expected he will hold further talks with Dermot Desmond, the major shareholder at Parkhead, once that game is out of the way. Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell stressed that Keane had not yet been offered the job and that the Premiership champions were speaking to ‘between five and 10’ candidates in total. O’Shea, though, expects the 42-year-old to end up at Parkhead. Having worked with him at both club and international level, he has no doubt Keane’s temperament could handle the intense scrutiny of life in Glasgow as Celtic boss. ‘I think he’d cope very well,’ said O’Shea. ‘His appetite since he’s come into this job will have increased. Team talk: Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill (left) chats to assistant Roy Keane during training . ‘He’s obviously learned from Martin along the way, too. He’ll relish the challenge. If it does happen, Celtic will be getting a very hungry and determined manager.’ Asked if he thought that would be the outcome, he added: ‘Yeah, it looks very much like it now. ‘It was mentioned at the start of the week and slowly but surely it’s snowballed into having talks with Celtic. So I’d very surprised if it doesn’t get across the line.’ Ireland head to America on Wednesday for further friendlies against Costa Rica and Portugal. O’Neill expects Keane’s situation to be clarified before they cross the Atlantic. ‘I imagine that in the next few days the situation will resolve itself,’ he said. ‘Whether it goes into Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, we are not actually leaving until Wednesday. On the ball: Keane (right) takes the opportunity to sit down during Ireland training in Malahide . ‘So I would imagine that the situation would be sorted by then. Celtic are actively seeking a manager and they have a certain number of days to try and do something because they will want a man in place for when they come back for pre-season.’ O’Neill also insisted Keane was in wider demand, adding: ‘As I have said before, I would have expected him to step into management eventually because I think that was something that was still burning within him. ‘But I did not think it would happen so quickly, that he would have offers - a number of offers – on the table. And I am not talking about Celtic, I am talking about other teams.’ Lawwell confirmed Keane was a leading contender but insisted other options still remained under consideration. Making his mark: Ireland captain O'Shea signs a fan's shirt after the training session on Friday . ‘Roy has played here and is a Celtic supporter,’ said the Parkhead chief executive. ‘He is a first-class guy, like the others are. We have between five and 10, a lot of great candidates, and we’ll wait and see.’ Asked if Keane had been offered the job, Lawwell said: ‘No, he’s not. We put a statement out saying we are looking at a number of exceptional candidates. ‘We are going through a process. Hopefully, it won’t take too long but I’m sure you’ll understand there is not much more we can say when we’re midway through that process. ‘Clearly we want to do it as soon as we possibly can but you can’t put a time on these things. ‘You just have to do your work properly. As soon as we get there we will let our supporters know. You don’t want to get it wrong by going too fast. You need to take your time and make sure you get the right guy.'

"Resplendent in elaborate feathered headdresses, flowing gowns and bizarre bejewelled make-up, it looked as if Halloween had come early as the Mao Geping Make-up Trends Launch show got underway in Beijing. The biannual China Fashion Week pulls in crowds of fashionistas from across Asia and the Pacific and showcases the work of some of the country's biggest designer names, among them NE TIGER and Wang Yutao. But this time around, all eyes were on make-up artist Mao Geping, who is famous for his outré take on cosmetics and the dramatic couture-style shows he puts on each time. Scroll down for video . Spectacular: Models on the runway at Mao Geping's make-up trends launch in Beijing sported a variety of elaborate looks . Inspiration: For his show, Mao Geping, who is China's most famous make-up artist, looked to the pasty for inspiration . Bold: Not even male models were allowed to go unadorned, as this gold-leaf heavy look demonstrates . Silver style: Pale bejewelled lips and elaborately decorated eyebrows are set to be big trends in 2015 according to Mr Geping . Striking: Mr Geping's opulent make-up looks were combined with elaborate feathered hats and dramatic flowing gowns . While last season saw him put his unique spin on Victorian dewy prettiness, this time it was China's Ming empresses who got the Geping treatment, with models sporting elaborated bejewelled hairstyles and colourful feathered eyelashes. Others were sent down the catwalk bearing pale beaded lip art, while more still wore brightly coloured jewellery woven into their eyebrows and stuck in swirls to their eyelids. Spectacular though Mr Geping's work was, he had serious competition in the shape of NE TIGER, who also referenced China's imperial past in his couture collection. The opening show of China Fashion Week, the new collection from the Beijing stalwart featured a spectacular series of dresses, many in red and gold, as well as a series of dramatic evening dresses, many of which made use of traditional Chinoiserie prints. Glamorous: Along with beaded and feathered eyes, glittery red lips appeared repeatedly on Mr Geping's catwalk . Pink perfection: A model shows off a striking pale pink couture gown during the Mao Geping show in Beijing . Elaborate: Hair was also given the Geping treatment and was fashioned into elegant plaited buns and sculptural up-dos . Keeping it simple: Not every look featured glitter galore. Others, such as this one, offered relatively simple smoky eyes and red lips . Bejwelled: It wasn't just eyes that that got the beading treatment - hair too was given a glamorous twist courtesy of some crystals . Stunning: This beautiful beaded headdress referenced China's Ming Dynasty - as did the opulent bejewelled eye make-up . Colourful: According to Mr Geping, navy blue enlivened with pink are the new smoky eye colours du jour . Swirl: This pretty bridal look comes complete with bold scarlet lips and elaborately bejewelled eyes . Lovely: In addition to Mr Geping's spectacular take on make-up, models were given a series of pretty hats to wear . Spectacular: This elaborate design, complete with bejewelled and feathered eyebrows, was one of the standout looks of the show . Other highlights from Beijing so far include Shenbai Peng Jing and Galatea Ren Chunhua's glamorous take on bridal wear, while hipster label EVE'S TEMPTATION also proved a hit with local critics. China Fashion Week, which continues until Sunday and includes 66 shows, also features designers from foreign shores, among them Denmark which sent Kopenhagen Fur to fly the flag for Danish style. Highlights scheduled in for later in the week include Wu Huanran's hotly anticipated new collection for URBAN EQUIPMENT and Watermark Deng Zhaoping's latest offerings. Highlight: Mr Geping's collection is one of the highlights of China Fashion Week, which is now in its 17th season . Big news: China Fashion Week is building an impressive international reputation and also hosts designers from other parts of the world . Popular: Denmark and Russia both sent designers to China, with Kopenhagen Fur flying the flag for Danish style . Low key: While some looks, such as this one, are pared down, much of the fashion on show in China is notable for opulence . Smooth moves: Along with Mr Geping's efforts, other highlights of China Fashion Week include NE TIGER and Wang Yutao . Thinking alike: Like Mr Geping, NE TIGER showed a Ming Dynasty inspired collection during his show on Saturday . Loved: The event, which features work by 66 different designers, is enormously popular with China's fashion set . He might not have been striding down the catwalk but Polish novelist Michał Witkowski, 39, made sure all eyes were on him as he appeared front row at Fashion Week Poland sporting a bizarre hat that came complete with live maggots. Mr Witkowski was attending a show in Lodz when he appeared in the hat, which also featured a series of tubes and hypodermic syringes, and was held in place by a piece of white netting. The novelist, who is famous for his 2001 debut novel Copyright and the 2004 follow-up Lubiewo, completed the all-white ensemble with a fringed handbag containing a substance that looked suspiciously like urine. Unusual look: Michał Witkowski accessorised his maggot hat with a fringed bag containing something that looked suspiciously like urine . Live and kicking: Despite being confined to a hat festooned with syringes, the maggots appeared happy with their lot .","Models took to the catwalk in the Mao Geping Make-up Trends Launch show on day three of China Fashion Week .

"CEO Mary Barras has outlined a campaign to help GM move on from a troubled 2014 and reamain America's number one automaker . General Motors is recalling more than 117,000 cars and trucks in North America for a defect that could cause the vehicles to stall. The automaker said it is unaware of any crashes, injuries or deaths related to the defect. Some 117,651 vehicles have been recalled, but the company estimates only roughly 1 per cent of the recalled vehicles suffer from the problem. The issue involves the the chassis control module, which is a part of the vehicle's electronics system linked to the braking, steering, and suspension. The defect can cause the chassis to be short-circuited by small metal fragments, potentially causing the car or truck to stall. GM's announcement yesterday is the latest in a series of blows to the US's largest automaker's reputation. In 2014, GM has recalled an unprecedented number of vehicles, after disclosing a fatal ignition switch flaw that went unreported for a decade. On February 13, it announced the recall of more than 780,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s (model years 2005-2007). Two weeks later it added 842,000 Ion compacts (2003-2007), and Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007). All of the recalled cars have the same ignition switches. According to CBS News, at least 23 people have been killed in crashes linked to faulty ignition switches. GM said the ignition switches can wear from heavy, dangling keys. If the key chains are bumped or people drive on rough surfaces, the switches can suddenly change from the 'run' position to 'accessory' or 'off'. Scroll down for video . In 2014, GM has recalled an unprecedented number of vehicles. Without counting the results of yesterday's announcement, the automaker has recalled 29.4 million cars and trucks this year . This cuts off power-assisted steering and brakes and can cause drivers to lose control. The air bags also may not inflate in a crash and protect the driver and passengers. GM is urging people not to put anything on their key rings until the switches are replaced. The latest recall involves: . The company has admitted knowing about the problem switches for at least 11 years, despite not recalling the vehicles until this year. It scrutinized its older vehicles for the fault and announced more than 60 recalls. Without counting the results of yesterday's announcement, the automaker has recalled 29.4 million vehicles so far in 2014. The news of the most recent recall comes after top executive of GM outlined the company's campaign to ensure the automaker stays at the top. CEO Mary Barras said: 'In the nine months that this leadership team has been together, we have spent a significant amount of time setting our goals for the future of GM and developing a specific action plan,' 'Our strategic plan is a pathway to earn customers for life and create significant shareholder value in the process,' she added. 'Every chance to connect with a customer is an opportunity to build a stronger relationship.'","The automaker is recalling more than 117,000 vehicles in North America .

"Manchester City face an increasingly difficult battle to explain Yaya Toure’s bizarre behaviour this summer after the Barclays Premier League champions’ star player claimed he would be open to a move to Paris Saint-Germain. Toure has cast a cloud over City’s post-season title celebrations with some peculiar antics over the past week. First, the Ivorian midfielder’s agent Dimitry Seluk claimed that Toure had been upset City didn’t give him a birthday cake when he turned 31 recently. Then Toure - who had actually received two cakes from the club  admitted he would consider a transfer back to former club Barcelona. Speculation: Yaya Toure has fuelled rumours he will leave Man City by saying PSG move would be 'an honour' Fans favourite: Toure scored 24 goals in 49 games for Man City last season . Now City’s top earner has given an . interview to a French publication in which he reveals a transfer to the . French champions would also appeal. Toure told France Football: . ‘Given the goals of Paris, how could you not be interested in a club . like that? PSG have become one of the strongest teams in Europe. It . would be an honour to one day play for a club like that - if I can be of . service. ‘Given the magnificent season Manchester City have had, . everyone talks about me and everything is open. My agent is hanging on . the telephone and he knows what he has to do, I have complete confidence . in him. ‘Nobody knows what can happen tomorrow, my attention is on the World Cup and we will see afterwards. ‘Yes, I have said I would like to finish my career at Barcelona. You never know because football moves quickly.’ Seluk . said last week that he rated Toure staying at City as ‘50-50’ and the . player’s comments about PSG will only increase speculation he is looking . to move on. City are viewing the whole charade in its true . perspective, given that Seluk is prone to these bizarre tactics whenever . he feels his star client is due a new contract. No comment: Toure failed to respond when asked where he would be playing next season . Toure - who earns . around £250,000-a-week at the Etihad Stadium - got himself a new deal . last summer but won’t be so lucky this time. In all likelihood, he . will merely have to explain his comments to manager Manuel Pellegrini . when he joins City for pre-season training in America after the World . Cup. All City’s World Cup players will be given a month off from the . day they exit the tournament, so it appears likely Toure will catch up . with Pellegrini in New York unless the Ivory Coast progress beyond the . last eight. Birthday-gate: Man City posted a picture of the cake that was presented to Toure on his birthday . Seluk, meanwhile, continues to veer erratically from one . standpoint to another. Yesterday he suggested Toure would even accept a . backroom role at City once his career is over. This is highly . unlikely, especially as Toure’s stock among supporters begins to fall. Yesterday, for example, the Manchester Evening News expressed the view . that this latest episode has tarnished Toure’s standing for good. Seluk . said: ‘A role at City after his (playing) career? Of course. Like Real . Madrid have done with Zinedine Zidane, for example. Zidane played there . and afterwards began working for the club. ‘Yaya will need a club in . the future. We do not want more money or a longer contract, anything . like that, just the right attention. More attention on Yaya and that he . feels happy at the club — that is the most important thing. We do not . need more money.’ Comments: Toure's agent Dimitri Seluk has been in the public eye over the last week .

"A Halloween horror cruise 'turned into a real nightmare' after the ship  ran aground and started severely tilting – forcing almost 1,000 costume-clad passengers to evacuate. The Bahamas Celebration cruise was heading back to Palm Beach, Florida, when passengers said they heard a loud 'bang' and felt the 600ft tall ship shake before the vessel lost power.

'It was like an actual Halloween horror cruise turned into real life,' said passenger Daniel Fana. Passengers initially thought it was a Halloween joke, but once they were told to put life jackets on and wait to be evacuated, many started to panic.

"Julian Assange has found a way to escape asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy, and preach his causes, without getting arrested by British authorities. The infamous founder of WikiLeaks used hologram technology to appear on Sunday for a speech at The Nantucket Project, a Massachusetts conference similar to TED talks. The 43-year-old Australian native has been able to speak at several events from his self-imposed house arrest thanks to Skype, but Sunday marked the first time he has appeared as a hologram. The hologram event was organised from inside the Ecuadorian Embassy by London-based British billionaire Alki David, whose company Hologram USA owns the technology which made the transmission possible. Documentary filmmaker Eugene Jarecki interviewed Assange at the project, which also saw Secretary of State John Kerry, former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers and poet Billy Collins this weekend. Scroll down for video . Futuristic: Julian Assange appeared via hologram to give a talk at the Nantucket Project on Sunday. The 43-year-old founder of Wikileaks has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012 . Assange talked about life in asylum, which makes it difficult to do his work finding sources willing to divulge documents. Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, when the UK decided to extradite him to Sweden where he is wanted on charges of sexual assault. He went on to slam Google's privacy policies, promote his new book, and defend his stance to release the Chelsea Manning papers four years ago. As for the Chelsea Manning leaks, Assange says he doesn't regret publishing them on WikiLeaks, even though they compromised American military secrets. Home: Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy after the British government decided to extradite him to Sweden where he is wanted on sexual assault charges . In person: Julian Assange speaks from the balcony of the Ecuador embassy in Knightsbridge in 2012 . At the ready: The embassy is guarded around the clock by British police officers in case Assange tries to flee the coop . He says he expected 'a hard time for maybe five to seven years' but felt the good in publishing the papers outweighed the negatives. Assange's book 'When Google Met WikiLeaks' is set to hit book stands this week, at the same time as 'How Google Works' - a book penned by Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt. 'If you see Eric Schmidt’s book, the cover of it is remarkably similar to the cover of this book,' Assange said, holding up a hologram of his book. 'So similar that I’m not sure the timing was a coincidence in publication.' The two have been engaged in a back and forth public debate, with Assange this past week calling Schmidt's Google a 'privatized NSA'. The Google exec responded by calling Assange 'paranoid'. Assange said that Google tries to pass itself off as a company run by 'fluffy graduate students' or rather 'not even a company at all, but something that gives free services'. He argued that Google is a normal company that needs to be viewed and held to the same standards as such. However, he says Google is more than a normal company in the sense that it tries to 'collect as much information about the world as is possible, store it, index it, make predictive models about people’s interests, and use that to sell advertising.' Assange ended the interview by giving moderator Jarecki a hologram high-five.","The 43-year-old founder of WikiLeaks spoke at the Nantucket Project on Sunday via hologram .

"Tourists and residents are pouring out of the New Jersey shore ahead of Hurricane Irene’s arrival this weekend as the state governor warned: ‘It’s time to get out.’ Summer resort towns are emptying as officials ordered mandatory evacuation of the popular tourist areas along the state's coastal barrier islands. The mandatory evacuations cover all of the state's barrier island beach resorts and at least hundreds of thousands of people are affected by the orders. Convoy: Sport utility vehicles pulling pleasure boats drive in lines of traffic headed north on the Garden State Parkway across the Great Egg Harbor Bay Inlet Bridge on Friday near Ocean City, New Jersey . Getting out: A police officer is on duty outside a convention centre on Friday in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which is being used as an evacuation center for hundreds of city residents fleeing the hurricane's approach . They included evacuation of such heavily visited towns as Wildwood, Ocean City and Avalon, all in Cape May County where the summer tourist population is typically around 750,000 people. ‘This is not like anything you’ve seen before,’ Governor Chris Christie said. ‘I’ve heard some dopes on television today saying a Category 2 hurricane is nothing more than a bad thunderstorm. ‘You stay there at the risk of your life. It’s that simple,’ he added. ‘Now, I want to be really clear to the folks in Cape May, and Atlantic, and Ocean County on the barrier islands. You have to get out.’ In the shore town of Ventnor, also under evacuation orders, veteran visitors and long-time residents said they had never before evacuated for a hurricane, even though the town regularly floods. Well protected: Workers put plywood over windows at the Pilot House restaurant near Washington Mall in Cape May, New Jersey, on Friday, as the town prepares for Hurricane Irene . Helping out: John Dollinger, of Brooklyn, New York, rushes to board up the windows at the Cape May, New Jersey, home of his sister and mother on Friday in preparation for Hurricane Irene . Irene was bearing down on North Carolina on Friday and New Jersey was braced for a weekend battering from the storm, with winds between 96mph and 110mph and storm surges of 6ft to 8ft. ‘This is not like anything you’ve . seen before. I’ve heard some dopes on . television today saying a Category 2 hurricane is nothing more than a . bad thunderstorm. You stay there at the risk of your life. It’s that simple’ New Jersey Governor Chris Christie . Marvin Levey, 75, was unloading sandbags from his car to weigh down the lawn furniture in his Ventnor yard before heading home to Philadelphia. ‘I've been coming down here for over 30 years and never evacuated before,’ he said. ‘I came down to put away anything I could put away.’ Casinos and hotels in Atlantic City were closing down and emptying out as well, with Atlantic County included in the mandatory evacuation order. Governor Christie on Thursday declared a state of emergency for New Jersey ahead of the storm. Mocking signs: Barry Tischler and his wife Susan Tischler move some plywood sheets to board up store fronts on Washington Mall in Cape May . Serious: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has warned: 'This is not like anything you've seen before' With heavy traffic leaving the Atlantic shore areas, tolls were suspended on the Atlantic City Expressway, which heads directly to Philadelphia. ‘I've been coming down here for over . 30 years and never evacuated before. I came down to put away . anything I could put away' Marvin Levey, 75, of Ventnor, New Jersey . Not everyone felt the pressure to leave, said Michael Holland, 24, a lifeguard at a Ventnor beach. ‘We're supposed to tell people to leave, but they're kind of indifferent to it,’ he said. Nearly a million people could have been covered by the mandatory evacuations depending on how many tourists were in each affected area. All 11 of Atlantic City's casinos are shutting down as the hurricane moves toward the resort city and the rest of New Jersey. It's only the third time they have closed en masse. They will have to shut by noon Saturday. The city's casinos have closed down only twice before - in 1985 for Hurricane Gloria and in 2006 because of a state government shutdown.","Governor Chris Christie warns New Jersey citizens ahead of Hurricane Irene .

"When Lee Garrels rushed to hospital to help after hearing a young man from her close-knit community had been electrocuted on a building site, she had no idea of the horror that was awaiting her. Ms Garrels, a nurse educator from the small town of Clermont, in Central Queensland, was heartbroken to discover the critically injured patient was her son, Jason. It was just weeks before his 21st birthday. Jason Garrels (centre) died after being electrocuted on a building site in Clermont, Queensland. His devastated parents, Michael (right) and Lee (left) rushed to hospital to see him . A memorial to Jason Garrels, who his father described as a 'typical young Australian' Childhood: Jason Garrels, pictured left, as a youngster. Her husband, Michael, also rushed to the hospital - and they watched their son, a trainee electrician, die. Clermont is a small, tight-knit community, and the people who were working to save young Jason's life knew him well. 'Everyone that worked on Jason knew him,' Mr Garrels said. 'It was terrible.' Jason was electrocuted at a local building site. But two years and many months since the incident, the family still does not have the full picture of what happened because there has not been a coronial inquest to confirm the facts of his death. 'Not in a million years,' Mr Garrels said, would they have thought it would take this long. Younger days: Jason Garrels. Under Queensland law, an inquest cannot be held until outstanding court matters have been resolved. In Jason's case, one cannot go ahead until a case involving his employer, Daytona Trading, is resolved. Mr Garrels has described Jason as a polite young man who 'couldn't do enough for people'. He was a 'larrikin' who would taking delight in 'putting s*** on dad'. 'He was what you would describe as a typical young Australian,' Mr Garrels told Daily Mail Australia. He believes an inquest could make findings that could save the life of someone like Jason. And he has amassed a huge amount of support in his campaign to have the Coroners Act changed. He said: 'It (Section 29 of the Coroners Act) is a bastard of a law. 'It's no longer relevant.' A petition on Change.org had garnered nearly 70,000 signatures at time of publication. 'This family needs to be given the opportunity to start to heal and that won't happen until they get answers to why their beautiful son was lost in such tragic circumstances,' wrote one signatory. Another added: 'Every parent should know the details of the death of their child.' Mr Garrels recently met Queensland's top legal officer, Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie. In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Bleijie said Garrels' death was a tragedy. 'We do not tolerate unsafe workplaces and, following an investigation by my department into the incident, nearly $100,000 worth of fines have been issued, contractor licenses have been suspended and one matter is still before the court,' he said. While he would not comment on any matters before a court, Mr Bleijie said he was currently considering advice from the Coroner, including reviewing the appropriate section of the act. Mr Garrels is hopeful the law will be changed. 'We have already tabled a petition from the Clermont community about Section 29,' he said. 'I think the Newman Government has stated they feel they need to listen to people more.' 'They've changed a lot of legislation with a lot less backing than what I have now on Change.org,' he said .","Jason Garrels was electrocuted at a construction site in 2012 .

"Adidas have been criticised by animal rights groups following the release of a new advert promoting the World Cup. The German sports giants have filmed a host of football's top stars holding a bloody cow's heart in the advert alongside the slogan: 'During the World Cup, I will give my heart to the cause.' The campaign features Germany's Lukas Podolski, Spain striker Diego Costa, Holland winger Arjen Robben and Brazil defender Dani Alves. Hand on heart: Lukas Podolski is pictured holding a cow's heart in a new adidas advert . Heartfelt: Diego Costa is also part of the ad campaign, pictured for one of the first times in a Spain strip . The advert has received negative publicity in Germany with a spokesman from animal rights group Four Paws saying that the advert reflects badly on Podolski and adidas. 'He says he’d give his heart but it wasn’t his heart was it. It was the heart of an innocent animal,' the spokesman said. 'If this was supposed to be some sort of PR stunt, then it misses the point. It’s bad enough that animals are slaughtered for food but to parade a heart, dripping blood and gore, is hardly a good way to advertise a sporting goods firm.' The image surfaced after appearing on Podolski's Instagram account, but he has defended his decision to take part in the ad. He said: 'I don’t find it disgusting. It just shows my promise to give my heart in our bid to win the World Cup. I and the rest of the team will give it all for Germany.'

"Manuel Pellegrini has won his first battle over Louis van Gaal by capturing Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna. The France full back has agreed a three-year deal at Manchester City worth - inclusive of add-ons and bonuses - £150,000-per-week after choosing them ahead of neighbours United. Sagna travelled up to Manchester on Monday morning to finalise his move to the Etihad Stadium - news exclusively revealed by Sportsmail. Moving on: Bacary Sagna has agreed to join Manchester City on a free transfer from Arsenal . And Pellegrini was forced to fend off late interest from United to secure Sagna's services after Van Gaal made an 11th hour attempt to hijack the deal. City's move for the Frenchman was at such an advanced stage at the point of United's first contact with the player's representatives that barring a total collapse in talks, City were always in pole position to sign Sagna. He becomes the latest Gunner to move to the Etihad - following in the footsteps of Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri, Kolo Toure and Gael Clichy.

Get the Kim look: Mrs Kardashian West is doing her bit for charity by auctioning off this Balenciaga dress with bids starting at £0 - so you're in with a chance of getting her thousand pound look for less . Supporting sustainability in fashion, the campaign launches with a style insiders charity auction giving fashion lovers the opportunity to pick up unique pieces from their favourite celebrities and designers' very own wardrobes. Opening up the wardrobes of world's most stylish women and men, StyleCycle launches with a charity auction featuring pieces from 50 global style influencers ranging from fashion royalty such as Helena Christensen, to designers including Tamara Mellon and celebrities like Suki Waterhouse. Charitable: Kim has chosen Dream Foundation - the only national dream-granting organisation for adults and their families suffering life-threatening illness - as her charity and proceeds from the auction of her dress will go towards making an ill person's dreams come true . The proceeds of each item sold by celebrities, including Rachel Weisz, Laura Bailey, Stella Tennant and Hailee Steinfeld, will be donated to a charity of the style insiders' choice.

On the charity's website, it states: 'For families who have been financially devastated by medical expenses, a dream is the comfort of knowing the heating bill will be paid…For those with young children, it’s creating happy memories and having fun. 'For young adults, a dream can be meeting a personal hero. And for children facing the impending loss of a parent, a dream is receiving support and compassion. 'Our dreamers have received a life expectancy of one year or less, and lack the resources to achieve their dreams on their own. While we cannot cure their diseases, we can dramatically impact the quality of their fragile lives with the joy experienced from a dream come true.' Stylecycle carried out some research ahead of the auction launch and found that almost 30 per cent of clothing in the average wardrobe hasn’t been worn for over a year, whilst the average lifespan of a garment is currently estimated to be a mere 2.2 years. Extending the lifespan of a garment by just nine months will make a substantial difference to its resource impact, they claim.

"Eight parking spaces in central London have gone on sale for £2.25million, or £281,000 per space, which is nearly £10,000 more than the average British home. The spaces are on a tarmac-covered forecourt under a block of flats in Mayfair, one of the capital's most exclusive, and expensive, districts. Estate agent Carter Jonas is marketing the whole forecourt, which can host eight cars - as long as they're not billionaire's favourite Maybachs - on a 900-year lease. Scroll down for video . The forecourt is open to the elements and costs £2.25million but is in the smart central London area of Mayfair . The £2.25million price tag divided by eight equates to £281,250 per space, which is £7,250 more than the £274,000 national average house price. And given that it is merely a lease on the parking spaces that is being sold, the new owner will still have to pay £100 a year in ground rent. The spaces, which are close to the heavily-guarded US Embassy and Berkeley Square, are underneath an apartment block where the last recorded sale was £2.3million for a three-bed flat. And while the spaces are in a central location, they don't offer much in the way of security for any expensive cars parked there - there is just a metal chain skirting the forecourt's boundary. The estate agent says the space can fit eight cars, as long as they are not the billionaire's favourite Maybachs . The estage agent's property listing says: 'A rare opportunity to purchase an entire private forecourt consisting of eight parking spaces in prime Mayfair. 'Located just off Charles Street on a landmark building and held on a 900-year lease, this unique plot is for sale as a whole, not as separate lots.' Another estate agent, Thackerays, describes the property as having a 'minimum of seven' spaces and highlights a £100 ground rent. This summer, three spaces went on a sale in a car park in nearby Park Lane for a total of £255,000, or £85,000 each. According to the Parkopedia website, parking in the surrounding streets costs £4.40 an hour, which works out at an annual cost of £38,544. House prices reached a new all-time high of £274,000 on average in August after surging by 11.7per cent year-on-year, according to official figures. Growth in property values in London continued to outstrip the rest of the UK, with prices in the capital leaping by 19.6per cent year-on-year to stand at £514,000 typically in August, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data showed. Average house prices in London pushed over the £500,000 mark for the first time in July. Prices across the country jumped by 0.6per cent month on month in August, which was a weaker increase than a 1.6per cent monthly uplift recorded in July. House prices reached a record high in August but the market is said to be softening, particularly in London . Many other reports covering developments in the housing market in recent weeks have pointed to the pace of house price growth softening, particularly in London following the capital's strong run of increases. These reports have suggested that speculation over interest rate rises, tougher mortgage lending conditions and potential buyers baulking at some of the prices being demanded by sellers are prompting the start of a calmer phase for the housing market in the coming months. A first-time buyer typically faces paying 12.9per cent more for a home than they did a year ago, with the price of a starter home now standing at around £210,000, the ONS figures showed.","The tarmaced forecourt lies under an apartment block in London's Mayfair .

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was one of several celebrities taking courtside seats for the anti-climatic ending to the men's tennis season at the  ATP World Tour Finals. A packed audience at the O2 Arena in London had expected to see a classic between the world's best players - Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer - before learning that the Swiss was forced to withdraw with an unconfirmed injury.

As for the final, Murray managed to win more than the single game he had claimed in his final match against Federer but was still beaten 8-5 by the reigning world No 1. Djokovic came onto court ahead of playing Murray to receive the trophy, which was understandably a low-key occasion.

"An adventurers club which celebrates men who have climbed some of the world's highest mountains and stood atop of the North Pole has upheld a ban on women becoming members. The venerable LA institution 'The Adventurers' Club of Los Angeles' in California, has banned women from being among their ranks for nearly 100 years. And on Thursday they  decided to uphold their 93-year-old tradition and remain a 'gentlemen's-only club.' Men only: Men meet at the Adventurers Club of Los Angeles and listen as an attendee tells a story about his past achievements . Safe place: Martin Bloom, Adventurers Club of Los Angeles president, walks past a stuffed polar bear in the main meeting room in Los Angeles . If the members opted to change the bylaws to admit women they would have required a two-thirds yes vote. Marc Weitz, the group's former president, said that Thursday's balloting fell short of that, although he couldn't say by how much. One of their bylaws also prohibits revealing anything about vote totals. Weitz, who lobbied to let women in, says he's disappointed in the decision and might raise the issue again next year. The club's members include men who have sailed around the world, run marathons on every continent and undertaken numerous other adventures. The club itself displays artifacts and pieces of history collected by Club members from all over the globe, commemorating their international expeditions. Story time: Adventurers Club of Los Angeles member Jay Foonberg talks to a room full of men in the club that's banned women from becoming members . It describes itself as a private gentlemen’s club, tracing its roots back to Teddy Roosevelt and friends in a 1908 meeting. The Club was founded by Captain Jack Roulac in 1921, and was incorporated in 1922. It is dedicated to world-wide adventure and traveling off the beaten path. On its website, it says club members have met nearly every week to share their exotic tales of adventure. And members have 'traveled from the Oceans greatest depths to outer space and the many wondrous places between.' But they do not appear to think that their ban on women members is sexist. The club states that women who have done the same type of adventures as the men are occasionally allowed to attend as guests.","The venerable LA institution is called the Adventurers Club of Los Angeles .

"One of the owners of Amy's Baking Company, the Scottsdale, Arizonia restaurant which featured in an infamous episode of reality show ‘Kitchen Nightmares’ earlier this month, is facing deportation. Salomon 'Samy' Bouzaglo, an Israeli citizen, is being investigated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials regarding information about his past that he didn't tell them prior to immigrating to the United States. The restaurant, which Bouzaglo runs with wife Amy, gained instant notoriety after featuring on the TV show where celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay offers his professional advice to struggling businesses. Controversial couple: Samy and Amy Bouzaglo (pictured), owners of Amy's Baking Company, made headlines after appearing on reality show Kitchen Nightmares in May - and being accused of stealing their servers tips . Amy’s Baking Company is the first restaurant that Ramsay has said he couldn’t help after repeated clashes with the owners. After the episode aired, the Bouzaglos posted a series of unhinged messages on their Facebook site resulting in further negative publicity for their business. Earlier this week the restaurant had its grand re-opening, but now Azcentral.com reports that Samy Bouzaglo could have residency status revoked after immigration authorities discovered that he hadn't disclosed important information about his past. Azcentral.com alleges that the information relates to documents that show he is banned from France and Germany and has a history of drug and extortion charges. Scottsdale immigration lawyer David Asser confirmed that the deportation process has been going on for two years and has nothing to do with the couple's appearance on 'Kitchen Nightmares'. Records indicate Bouzaglo has no criminal convictions or civil judgments in the U.S. Under pressure: Chef Gordon Ramsay walked off his first ever episode of Kitchen Nightmares after being unable to get through to Samy and Amy Bouzaglo about the problems with their Scottsdale, Arizona bistro. However, they say THEY stopped filming. After the episode aired on May 10, online criticism for Amy's Baking Company flowed forth - causing apoplectic reactions from the Bouzaglos. Filming at the restaurant before Ramsey arrived showed diners waiting more than hour for their meals, with Amy cooking each meal one at a time. One told the Phoenix New Times: 'You could hear Amy yelling in the kitchen and Samy was running all over the dining room. 'Other tables were complaining and people were leaving because they were waiting so long for their food. My partner and I had reservations for 6:45. By 9:30, we still hadn't received our pizza.' And when one customer confronted Samy about the fact he still had not been served he as told to 'go f--- yourself.' Ramsay, who has made millions in the . restaurant business and holds 14 Michelin stars, was filming his 82nd episode at Amy's Baking . Company in Scottsdale, serving up his typical no-nonsense . advice of the venture's failings to the owners. Rage: The owners of Amy's Baking Company Bakery Boutique & Bistro respond to their 'haters' on Facebook after the episode of Kitchen Nightmares aired on May 10 . Threats: The owners of the restaurant appeared to lash out at criticism via social media . Fury: The post came shortly after the episode of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares featuring the Scottsdale restaurant aired . However even the fiery British chef . was left open-mouthed by the chaotic goings-on at the bistro -  which . included a young waitress being fired for asking a question and Mrs . Bouzaglo . threatening to call the police on a customer who tried to leave after . waiting an extra long time for his pizza. When Ramsay tried to give the husband . and wife team some pointers as to where they were going wrong, he was . met with open aggression from Samy and complete denial about the quality . of the food from Amy. When Ramsay tells diners that the . owners are keeping their waiting staff's tips, the chef ends up close to . trading blows with Mr Bouzaglo. It later comes to light that the couple have fired more than 100 employees - in a year. During a morning meeting to clear the air, the tense situation once again escalates with Amy threatening to walk out. Finally, Ramsay wishes the couple good luck with their business but tells him he cannot help them and leaves. Claims: Days after the abusive messages appeared, the owners claimed that the social media accounts of the restaurant had been hacked . Shortly before the Kitchen Nightmares episode aired, the Bouzaglos wrote on Facebook: 'We do not feel the need to make any excuses for our behavior on tonight’s show.' They also challenged ex-employees to come forward with evidence that they had stolen their tips as was claimed in the episode. After . the show aired, hundreds of negative comments appeared across social . media sites, slating the owners' attitudes, their treatment of staff and . the quality of food. Negative comments appeared on Reddit, . Yelp and Facebook, calling the restauranteurs 'incredibly immature, . rude, unprofessional' while another added: 'these people were so . arrogant that they couldn't see that a Michelin-star chef was trying to . help them'. In response, the husband and wife team allegedly . began posting torrents of abuse directed at commentors on their business's Facebook . page. First fail: Gordon Ramsay was forced to walk off the 82nd episode of Kitchen Nightmares after being unable to work with the owners, who have courted controversy ever since the episode aired . A message appeared on Monday on the Amy's Bistro Facebook page: 'TO . REDDIT. I FORBID YOU FROM SPREADING YOUR HATE ON THAT SITE. THIS IS MY . FACEBOOK, AND I AM NOT ALLOWING YOU TO USE MY COMPANY ON YOUR HATE . FILLED PAGE.' It was quickly followed by: 'This is . Samy. I am keeping note of all names here. We will be pursuing action . against you legaly [sic], and against reddit and yelp, for this plot you . have come together on. you are all just punks.' Another . read: 'To all of the Yelpers and Reddits: Bring it on. you are just . p******. come to arizona. you are weaker than my wife, and weaker than . me. come to my business. say it to my face. man to man. my wife is a . jewel in the desert. you are just trash, reddits and yelpers just . working together to bring us down. pathetic.' The . war of words rolled on for several days, before coming to an abrupt . halt with this message on Tuesday: 'Obviously our Facebook, YELP, . Twitter and Website have been hacked.

"After a slack defensive performance in game one of the Eastern Conference finals, NBA analysts Reggie Miller and Greg Anthony are expecting the Miami Heat to enter game two against the Indiana Pacers with a renewed focus. The Pacers beat the Heat 107-96 on Sunday night, with two-time defending champions Miami suffering a number of defensive breakdowns that allowed the Pacers to score their highest total of this year's post-season. Paul George led Indiana with 24 points, while five other players scored in double figures. LeBron James scored 25 points for the Heat and Dwyane Wade 27, but the rest of their squad struggled to get going offensively and defensively. The King: Four-time league MVP LeBron James (L) knows his Miami Heat team need to improve against the Indiana Pacers . The Pretender: Paul George (R) scored 24 points as his Pacers beat the Heat in game one of the Eastern Conference finals . 'We're all waiting for the Heat to go into that extra gear,' said Miller, an 18-year NBA veteran who is now in the Hall of Fame and an analyst for TNT. 'A season ago they had a stretch where they won 20 plus games in a row, but we haven't seen that extra gear yet. It's not a light switch, you can't turn it on and off, but at the end of the day they have LeBron James on their team. 'When their backs are against the wall, like they were in the Brooklyn series, he went for 49 points - I would not be surprised if he came out tonight with one of those types of performances.' Anthony, another former player turned . NBA analyst, said this version of the Miami Heat are not as good as the . teams that won the Larry O'Brien trophy in 2013 and 2012. Must improve: Chris Bosh was neutralised in the opener and must play better if the Heat are to level the series . 'That supporting cast is not nearly as supportive,' said Anthony, who played for six teams in a 10-year career. 'The things that they've thrived on in the past - their ability to make threes and their defence - they're not as good at it. Indiana played great offense to win game one, but they're not a great offensive team. 'They were able to exploit a lot of weaknesses of Miami's defence and also Miami offensively, that suporting cast is not where it's been in the past. Chris Bosh is going to have to play better, he was neturalised in game one and Wade and James are going to have to play at an even higher level for this team to have a chance.' Game two tips off on Wednesday at 1.30am . and the Indiana Pacers know a second win at their home arena will put . them in pole position by the time the series moves back to Miami on . Saturday. Presence: Roy Hibbert put in an excellent defensive peformance against the Heat in game one . No 2: Dwyane Wade (R) top scored for Miami with 27 points but he might have to be even better . Anthony believes that game two is bigger for Indiana than it is for Miami. 'If Miami comes out and wins tonight then the entire conversation of the series is going to change,' he said. 'In a lot of ways this is a bigger game for Indiana to win than it is for Miami, because this is a game where the Pacers can take full control of the series. 'Miami are going to win a game in Indianapolis before the series is over, the question is will they have to win two in order to advance to the finals.' Miller, who played his whole career for the Pacers, agrees that a win tonight will be huge for the Pacers, but expects Erik Spoelsta's Miami Heat team to be much better. He said: 'Erik Spoelstra's team were out of character. I think we're going to get a better effort defensively, they've got to be better. But I think we're all waiting for the Heat to go to that different gear, we've not seen it all year. Ray Allen - Supporting cast: Ray Allen and Miami's other reserves must make more of an impact game two . 'I want to see that gear from the Heat. If they win tonight then the emphasis of this series changes becuase all they want to do is win one, then they go home and try to maintain and hold on and win their two games. 'Tonight will show me a lot. A young hungry team in Indiana who have been screaming ""we want Miami"" all year have a chance to put them in a 2-0 hole. 'There are not a lot of teams who have done that to this team with the big three, who are two-time defending champs with the best player on the planet.'

"Call me chairman! the BBC Trust's first female boss Rona Fairhead starts work today . The first female boss of the BBC Trust insisted on being called chairman not chairwoman as she started work today. Rona Fairhead, who will be paid £110,000 a year for a three day week, has taken over from former cabinet minister Lord Patten who stood down in May. But in an  email to all BBC staff this morning she confirmed there would be no change of title. She wrote: 'Dear Everyone, Today is my first day as Chairman and I wanted to write to say 'hello' and to say how excited I am to be joining this great organization. I feel privileged to be here and can't wait to get started'. The chairman has taken over after torrid few years that have seen the corporation lambasted for its handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal, and a Newsnight investigation that led to the late Lord McAlpine being wrongly accused of child abuse. The BBC was also heavily criticised over excessive payouts given to senior staff including £470,000 to former director-general George Entwistle after only 54 days in the job and £680,000 to former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson. Deputy director general Mark Byford departed the BBC with a total payout of £949,000. In her email  she said she had spent time with director-general Tony Hall and other senior executives in recent weeks. She said: 'They are under no illusions about the challenging environment; the changing viewing patterns, the explosion of choice and the rapid changes in technologies and markets. They understand that they need to operate efficiently and to rectify some of the high profile issues of the past, while building this compelling future.' The former chief executive of the Financial Times group also said in her email she would 'defend vigorously the BBC's independence while holding it accountable to its audience'. She will have to deal with pressure to scrap its traditional funding method - the licence fee - which has been much criticised by politicians, performers and former corporation staff in the run-up to the renewal of its charter, which expires in 2016. Mrs Fairhead, whose husband Tom is a private equity boss and former Conservative councillor, was also asked about a £1.1million severance payment she received last year from Pearson, the parent company of the Financial Times. Asked whether it would compromise her ability to crack down on excessive payoffs at the BBC, she said: 'I would hope not. It is clearly a lot of money. But I have to say those were relatively standard within my industry for the level of the role that I had and for what I had done. It was done entirely within contractual terms. 'I'm not going to apologise that I came from the private sector.' Scandal: The resignation of George Entwistle is one of a number of crises the BBC has faced in recent years . Statement: In an email to staff Mrs Fairhead said bosses 'understand that they need to operate efficiently and to rectify some of the high profile issues of the past' In August Mastermind was accused of gender bias after it emerged most of its questions last week were about men. During the first episode of the latest series, screened in August, host John Humphrys asked 81 general knowledge questions to the four contestants. Of those, only five were about real or fictional women, 38 were about men and the rest were about things. The imbalance quickly attracted the ire of some viewers on the BBC's own Points of View Messageboard, an online forum on which diehard fans air their views. One posted: 'Was it just tonight or do Mastermind questions always overwhelmingly refer to men or things but rarely women?' John Inverdale has been axed from his role covering Wimbledon for BBC Radio 5 Live after he sparked a sexism storm. In the summer of 2013 the BBC was bombarded with complaints when Inverdale suggested French player Marion Bartoli - who went on to become women's champion - was 'not much of a looker'. Just days after Inverdale claimed the gaffe was due to hayfever, the corporation announced Clare Balding would be replacing him on the radio station for this year's tournament. Mrs Fairhead has been criticised for owning almost £5million worth of shares in Pearson because the company has a deal to publish BBC branded educational books. She said she would sell them if she was advised it would be a 'clear conflict of interest' not to do so. Defending her £110,000 BBC salary for a three-day week, she said: 'It's the salary that I was told had been decided by the Government, so it's a given. I know that if I stayed in the private sector a chairman role would attract a much, much larger salary.' Becoming the BBC Trust's first female chairman is a landmark moment. In the past the corporation has been accused of 'absurd political correctness' linked to gender equality, including recently cutting the word 'girl' from a documentary about the Commonwealth Games, fearing it might cause 'offence'. Last year veteran journalist Selina Scott described the BBC as having a 'sexist culture' for decades where 'when a woman's age exceeded her bra size she was finished'. 'Those of us who have worked at the Corporation over the past three decades know this once-great institution has been open to many forms of corruption – including sexual,' she told the Mail on Sunday. 'Over the years I have often returned to the BBC to work on programmes and my observations of the sexist culture have always been the same. That some of the often Oxbridge- educated powerful male elite behave in a predatory way towards attractive and ambitious women seeking to move up the Corporation's greasy pole'.","Rona Fairhead, who will be paid £110,000 a year, started work today .

"Just 24 hours earlier, she was left sobbing when a basic error shattered her hopes of gold. But an emotional Victoria Pendleton found redemption in the Velodrome last night, claiming the Olympic medal she had dreamt of for four years. After the heartbreak of her effective disqualification on Thursday, one of the poster girls of London 2012 powered to a thrilling win in the keirin, to the delight of 6,000 frenzied home supporters. She's done it! Victoria Pendleton celebrates after winning gold in the women's keirin . Wheels of fire: Victoria Pendleton flies the Union Flag after her gold medal triumph tonight . Sweet: Victoria Pendleton sends a message of love to her boyfriend Scott Gardner from the podium after securing keirin gold . There was ecstasy and relief as ‘Queen Victoria’ hugged members of her backroom team, a Union Flag draped around her shoulders. A hug and kiss were lavished on her fiancé Scott Gardner, a sports scientist whose relationship with her has caused scandal. That was because he was on the staff of the cycling team and such liaisons were frowned on. The fallout – which saw him quit his job – was forgotten last night as Pendleton powered home to gold. Following her victory, she said: ‘I was searching for him desperately in the crowd, I didn’t know where he was ... I am so glad I found him. ‘I can hardly believe it, I just had to focus really hard and the crowd was fantastic, it really helped me. I didn’t look for their race, I just raced my own and showed what I have got.’ With remarkable understatement she added: ‘When it is your moment, you just have to go.’ Tears of joy: For double Olympic gold winner . Pendleton, it was an emotional moment when she received her medal in . front of her home crowd . Moment to treasure: Pendleton brushed off the disappointment of her team sprint disqualification to wrap up gold . The win makes the 31 year old the most successful British woman track cyclist. Growing up in Bedfordshire, her father Max – a champion racer himself – first put her on a bike aged six. When they went riding he would cycle far ahead forcing her to catch up. Pendleton, who has an elder sister Nicola, grew up competing with her twin brother Alex, which gave her a competitive edge. While he was faster and better technically, he did not have her desire – honed and hardened from an early age under their father’s tutelage. After graduating in sports science from Northumbria University, Pendleton became a full-time professional, winning her first national title in 1998. Fourteen years later, she has said that this Olympics would be her last competition. A champion in the Beijing Games of 2008, the charismatic, but sometimes moody, star of women’s cycling had been at fault on Thursday when she and Jess Varnish had been demoted for a technical error in the team sprint. Last night she was determined to make amends and there were no sign of nerves as the Velodrome, known as The Pringle because of its distinctive shape, became a cockpit of noise and excitement. Last-gasp: Pendleton had snatched keirin gold by a fraction of a second ahead of Shuang Guo of China . Fight to the finish: An Omega photo finish shows just how small Pendleton's margin of victory was in the keirin . Double glory: Pendleton found redemption in the . Velodrome tonight following her disqualification just 24 hours earlier. Afterwards she found a moment to embrace with fiance Scott Gardner . The keirin – in which six riders follow a motorcycle around until the speed reaches 45km an hour and are then released to race – is not Pendleton’s specialist event. But she overtook her great rival Anna Mears of Australia and held off the Chinese rider Guo Shuang in a desperately tight finish. Mears appeared to have sprinted too early and when Pendleton made her burst with barely two laps left the Australian was boxed in and unable to respond. Competing in her third Olympics – she almost gave up after disappointing performances in Athens in 2004 – Pendleton has a final chance of gold next week in the individual sprint. She and Mears are favourites to win the event which was claimed by the Briton four years ago in Beijing. That victory brought fame and wealth and she has appeared on the front cover of dozens of magazines and in TV commercials as well as being photographed naked for a modelling shoot. In her glittering career, she has won nine world titles – including a record-equalling six in the individual sprint – in addition now to golds in London and Beijing. Take That’s the Greatest Day and Chariots of Fire rang out as she prepared to pick up her gold at the victory ceremony. Pendleton formed a heart shape in front of her chest with her fingers as she waited behind the top step of the podium. While the accredited seating areas soon emptied after the race, thousands of fans in the stands stayed waving their flags and cheering.","Dismay at team sprint disqualification all forgotten as she grabs keirin gold .

"Customers have returned bags worth almost $20,000 to iconic bag makers Hermès after complaining that the expensive accessories smell of marijuana. The bags have been returned from shops to boutiques in Paris after staff at the luxury fashion brand noticed there was a problem with a 'badly tanned' batch of leather from a supplier. It is believed that the tanning process can make the leather bags smell like cannabis when it is warmed up in a hot car or when left in direct sunlight. Exclusive: Victoria Beckham is a customer of Hermès, whose leather bags are said to smell of marijuana . Hermès iconic bag, the Birkin - named after singer and actress Jane Birkin - is one of the bags which are affected and can cost up to $18,900. Crocodile skin versions of the bag can cost up to $60,000 but are not thought to be affected by the problem. A source told Page Six: 'Owners are returning the Hermès bags back to boutiques across the US, including the Madison Avenue store, saying they smell of skunk. English actress and singer was sat next to Hermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas on a flight from Paris to London in 1981. She was putting her straw bag in the overhead compartment when the contents fell on to the floor. She told Mr Dumas that she could not find a leather bag that she liked, so he had one personally made for her. The bag is now a symbol of wealth, with some types of Birkin selling for up to $100,000. At one point, customers faced a six-year waiting list to get their hands on the exclusive handbag. 'The bags are being sent back to Paris as nobody knows quite how to deal with this embarrassing situation.' The marijuana-smell could be a worldwide problem as Hermès are distributed to boutiques in limited quantities and are often on back order. The bags affected include the Birkin, which can cost up to $18,900 in leather, the Kelly, costing up to $9,250, and the Elan clutch, worth $4,580. Hermès has a reputation for making the best bags on the market, with customers including the likes of Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian. The smell is said to affect bags purchased in 2013 and this year. Customers have been told that Hermès that the bags have to be returned to the company's headquarters in Paris so the bad-smelling leather panels can be removed and the entire bag rebuilt. Customers' bags are reportedly being returned to Hermès head office in Paris to be rebuilt without the bad-smelling leather panels . Hermès iconic bag, the Birkin - named after singer and actress Jane Birkin - is one of the bags which are affected and can cost up to $18,900 . The pungent smell has become such a problem that fashion-loving women have taken to internet forums to discuss the issue. One owner of a Hermès Kelly bag posted on PurseBlog: 'After riding in the car with her for about 30 minutes, I smelled what I thought was a dead skunk. 'Another 30 minutes later I could still smell the dead skunk, and I thought it was odd, but never imagined it could be my bag. 'I keep [it] in an armoire... When I opened the cabinet door this morning, the smell hit me, and I immediately knew it was the bag.' Hermes did not comment.","Hermès customers have complained their leather bags smell of marijuana .

"A New Jersey nun credited with curing a boy's eye disease moved a step closer to sainthood Saturday in what church officials said was the first beatification Mass held in the United States. A beatification Mass for Sister Miriam Teresa Demjanovich, who died in 1927, was led by Cardinal Angelo Amato at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark. Beatification is the third in a four-step process toward sainthood. Demjanovich is credited with curing a boy's macular degeneration in the 1960s, the Archdiocese of Newark says. The boy, Michael Mencer, was given a lock of the nun's hair and prayed to her. The effects of the eye disease soon began to fade, Roman Catholic Church officials say. Made history: Sister Miriam Teresa Demjanovich is shown has been dead for more than  80 years but she was beatified on Saturday after helping to cure a boy's eye disease . Beatification: A painting of Sister Miriam Teresa Demjanovich, center right, is displayed during a beatification ceremony at Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart on Saturday in Newark New Jersey . Honoring her memory: The umbrella canopy of a woman flips up in the wind as she shelters herself the weather while approaching Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart for the beatification ceremony ' 'Within a period of six weeks, it was totally reversed,' nsaid Sister Mary Canavan of the Sisters of Charity, the order to which Demjanovich belonged. Mencer, who is now 58 and lives in Nebraska, and members of the Demjanovich family were among the hundreds of clergy members, nuns and worshippers who attended the beatification Mass. He said was happy that Demjanovich was getting the recognition she deserves. ""I was dug in thinking, this was going to take 100 years,"" he said. Mencer also reflected on the moment when he first realized his eyesight was improving. ""I was walking and I looked up, and I thought I was looking at the sun because at first it was just the light,"" he said. ""Then I was able to focus on the sphere and I thought `oh, that's the sun' but it didn't hurt, I didn't tear up or anything and then I looked back down and there it was, the hair."" Mencer said he returned home and handed the hair to his mother.

In the audience: Michael Mencer, who credits Sister Miriam Teresa Demjanovich with healing him of macular degeneration, attends the mass of her beatification in the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart . ""And then then I just went out to play,"" he said. ""I actually ran, it didn't dawn on me then. I just ran to my friend's house."" Mencer's younger brother, Mark, said he was thrilled to attend the Mass. ""This is something that's been in the making for decades,"" Mark Mencer said. ""My mother has been in contact with Rome for a long time. I'm glad to see such great success come from this."" Mark Mencer, who now lives in Las Vegas, said he was about 4 years old when his brother's vision began to improve. ""I heard the stories including the one of him walking into a tree because he couldn't see so well,"" he said. ""It's amazing because he had no medical intervention. It's a true miracle of God."" The beatification comes less than a year after Pope Francis certified Mencer's improved eyesight as a miracle, though church officials started the process in 1945 when the bishop of Paterson began studying Demjanovich's life and virtues, according to the Sisters of Charity. Demjanovich was born in Bayonne, southeast of Newark, and was a Sister of Charity for only two years before succumbing to complications of appendicitis at age 26. During her short time in the order, she was best known for her virtue and her mature writings. At the time, students also noted that whatever was said in confidence to her was not spoken to anyone else, Sister Diane Collesano said. 'The sisters saw in her that a person who had insights far beyond the average 20-some-year-old person,'Collesano said. Beatification requires evidence of one miracle that happened after the candidate has died and as a result of a specific plea to the candidate. Sainthood requires a second miracle, though candidates deemed martyrs need only one for canonization. Traditionally, beatifications have taken place in Rome. But several years ago, Pope Benedict XVI said beatifications could take place in the country and diocese from which the blessed person came.

"As usual, Louis van Gaal wasn’t going to accept criticism. When a journalist persisted in a line of questioning about the shortcomings of the new system Holland had adopted during their friendly with Ghana, Van Gaal finally lost patience. ‘I’ve been assigned to win. I need to get the best out of this team. That and nothing else,’ he snapped back. He then added, lest anyone be in any doubt as to who was in charge: ‘I make my own decisions on what formation I play. No director says how I play. I choose a team and a system that I think has the best chance of success.’ One's enough: Robin van Persie scored the only goal as an experimental Holland triumphed 1-0 over Ghana . Bombardment: Wesley Sneijder (above) took it in turns with Arjen Robben to attack the Ghana penalty box playing behind Robin van Persie . Wasteful: Holland's winning margin over Ghana could have been much more had Robben not squandered a number of chances . ‘Total Football’ it wasn’t, but Holland had emerged from their penultimate World Cup warm-up game with a 1-0 victory, secured when Robin van Persie tapped in after just five minutes, and Van Gaal was happy enough. As he pointed out, Holland had created six good opportunities at the De Kuip in Rotterdam and Ghana had created not one. They would have been home and dry by half-time had Arjen Robben not been so wasteful. It was an open secret that Van Gaal was set to trial a new formation in this match and those who didn’t know could easily have guessed it from Friday’s training session which was attended by 5,000 fans. The accent was on flying wing-backs - on this occasion, Daley Blind of Ajax and Daryl Janmaat of Feyenoord - in a 5-3-2 formation that could quickly shift to a 3-4-3 when Holland were on the attack. Blind and . Janmaat were encouraged to bomb forward at every opportunity and they . contributed assists for Robben’s two squandered chances in the . first-half, showing the potential effectiveness of the system. In . the midfield, Nigel de Jong and Jonathan de Guzman offered cover for . the defence against any Ghanaian counter-attacks and, up front, Robin . van Persie spearheaded a forward trio of Robben and Wesley Sneijder. Plan B: Holland boss Louis van Gaal deployed a 5-3-2 formation which morphed into a 3-4-3 during the win . Lead role: Van Gaal's new system is set to fit at Manchester United next season, with Van Persie likely to spearhead the attack . Strong support cast: Wayne Rooney (right) and Juan Mata would play off Van Persie in the formation . It was a formation that certainly has the potential to be exciting and the critical tone of some of the questions in the post-match press conference would surely have been avoided if Holland had won 3-0 or 4-0 like they should have done. Van Gaal said he had devised the system as a means of playing Spain at their own game, of fighting fire with fire, when they meet in their opening World Cup group match on June 13. He also hinted that it could be a set-up he brings to the Premier League when he takes over as Manchester United manager next season - or ‘after the World Cup final’ as he put it. If that . happens, we’ll certainly be in for some fun and games at Old Trafford. Van Gaal will need two attack-minded wing-backs to thunder up and down . the flanks and deliver effective crosses. Luke . Shaw’s £27m move from Southampton looks set to be confirmed any day and . the teenager will be given a licence to attack in the United tradition . regardless of the formation. Blind is also on the Old Trafford radar and . could also serve in his natural defensive midfield role. Van . Gaal will then need someone identical on the right-hand side, either . Rafael or the likes of Dani Alves, whose time at Barcelona is reportedly . drawing to a close, or Serge Aurier, the buccaneering Toulouse player . who is interesting Arsenal as Bacary Sagna’s replacement. Pulling the strings? Long time Manchester United target Cesc Fabregas (left) would be an ideal fit in midfield . Versatile: Daley Blind featured against Ghana at left-back and the Ajax star can also play as a defensive midfielder . Closing in: Manchester United are hoping to complete a £27million deal for Southampton and England left-back Luke Shaw . A timid Ghana side, which contained a number of second string players in the first-half as coach Kwesi Appiah makes the final call on his 23 for Brazil, failed to trouble the Dutch back line, but that will be a different story in the Premier League. Accordingly, Van Gaal is targeting Mats Hummels of Borussia Dortmund and Miranda of Atletico Madrid to strengthen his defence. United’s midfield were regularly embarrassed last season during the David Moyes tenure and reinforcements are desperately needed here too. Van Gaal will look at compatriot Kevin Strootman, who was very impressive for Roma before a cruciate ligament injury curtailed his season. He would certainly be in the Dutch World Cup midfield if not for this misfortune. Barcelona’s Cesc Fabregas would fill the vacancy with style but United face stiff competition for his signature from Arsenal and Manchester City. Up front, it would be Van Persie leading the attack ahead of Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata. There’s a strong possibility that Rooney is heading for a midfield role under Van Gaal and he’s likely to be overlooked for the captain’s armband in favour of Van Persie, who gets on very well with his national team manager. But on the evidence of the match with Ghana, this does not necessarily mean that Rooney will cut a frustrated figure as he sits backs in the midfield. Sneijder and Robben took turns to try and break into the penalty box, while Van Persie was not shy in dropping back to try and win the ball. The goalscorer would often by found trying to win the ball aerially close to the touchline from goal kicks and long balls from defence, with Janmaat a willing outlet out wide. Van Gaal fervently believes his new system will deliver the Dutch success at the World Cup. How about defending champions Spain as the acid test?","Louis van Gaal tried experimental formation in Holland's 1-0 win over Ghana .

"A dog-loving couple have adopted a golden retriever they found stabbed and left for dead while they were on holiday in Greece. Carol and Les Stones were so upset when they saw the dog they organised an animal charity to fly him to their house in Greater Manchester as soon as they arrived home. The dog arrived and the couple and their family aptly called him Chance. He was just hours from death when he was plucked from the streets of Laganas in Zante and taken to a vet. Carol Stones said Chance has now settled in with the rest of her family pets at their home near Bolton . Mrs Stones was on holiday with her husband Les, 57, and son Matthew,  24, when they spotted Chance living on the streets. 'It was heartbreaking,' she said. 'The first time we saw him he was sheltering under a car from the sun and the driver almost ran him over. She just drove off and was not bothered at all. 'I whistled him over and gave him something to eat and drink. He was starving and very thirsty. We saw him a few times and we noticed he had got this injury the day before we came home, we tried to get him some help. I thought he had been bitten by another dog. When they eventually found him, they said he was quite poorly and the wound had got infected. Mrs Stones is pictured feeding Chance on a Zante beach after they found the dog thin and living on the streets . Mr and Mrs Stones said Chance has settled in  with the family and the rest of their pets at their home in Bolton . The Stones family found Chance in the resort of Laganas, near to where they were staying, and visited him . 'It's an awful way of life for the stray dogs.' The family caught up with Chance several times during their holiday and were devastated to leave him when they returned to Farnworth. 'We had tried to find out how to rescue him but weren't able to do that while we were there,'added Mrs Stones. Chance was rescued and flown to the UK from Zante . On their return to England Mrs Stones, 60, contacted Holbrook Animal Rescue, in Sussex, who visit Zante regularly to rescue dogs and asked if they could find Chance. 'At first they were unable to find him but then, one day, they contacted me to say they had found him,' she said. 'I felt as if I had won the lottery. I was elated.' Chance was taken to a local vet and found to have a very serious wound - thought to have been caused by stabbing. 'I was told he was very close to death and lucky to have been rescued,' said Mrs Stones. Chance was flown to England and now lives with the family and their other pets; a Newfoundland called Oscar, Carter the German Shepherd and shih tzu Daisy, as well as three cats. The dog is fed four times a day to help build his weight up and receives a lot of care and attention from the family after his ordeal. Mrs Stones added: 'He is absolutely brilliant. We've had him two weeks now. He was quite timid when he first came, and very unsure. He was sort of on guard with other dogs, especially during feeding time. He has lived on the streets and any scrap of food was valuable. I was worried that we had taken on too much. 'But he's a totally different dog. He's quite a confident dog now. He is happy and wagging his tail. 'He never knew what it was to play with another animal.' The family went on holiday in July and had to wait almost three months to get Chance back home. They contacted Holbrook Animal Rescue, which took around a week to find him, and the dog then had to treated by a vet before he could be flown home to them.","Carol and Les Stones spotted golden retriever living on streets in Greece .

"Jailed: David Messom, 29, was convicted of fraud and handed a two-year jail term . An aggressive conman was branded 'the lowest of the low' by a judge after tricking pensioners into thinking their mobility scooters and stair lifts needed servicing. David Messom, 29, pocketed more than £400 in August last year by duping vulnerable and fragile old people into paying for pretend repair works. The crook, already in prison for fraud, was handed a two year concurrent jail sentence yesterday after admitting two counts of fraud at Derby Crown Court. Judge Stuart Rafferty QC said: 'These offences are the most despicable kind. 'You have previous similar offences and others of using aggressive sales techniques. 'People who prey on the elderly are the lowest of the low. 'You have had more justice than you deserve. 'If you come back before a court you will be waving goodbye to a very large part of the next chapter of your life. 'If you come before me with an offence like that, the starting point will be four years.' Sarah Slater, prosecuting, told the court an 81-year-old woman received a phone call saying her mobility scooter needed a service. She said: 'She queried it because she said she had just had her mobility scooter serviced. She was told the law had changed and they now required two services a year.' The pensioner, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, was quoted a figure of £120 and replied: 'I'm 81, I can't afford it.' But after Messom offered her a price of £80, the elderly woman alerted the authorities because she thought it was a scam. In the second offence, an 84-year-old woman received a phone call from a female saying her stair lift needed a service. Messom turned up at the woman's home saying he was going to carry out the service. Slammed: Judge Stuart Rafferty QC told Messom: 'People who prey on the elderly are the lowest of the low' at Derby Crown Court (above) He gave her a bill and suggested she should add an extra £300 as a guarantee which would provide free breakdown repairs. A cheque for £410 was found in Messom's pocket when he was arrested. Emma Coverley, defending, said Messom was already serving a prison sentence of two years and nine months. He is likely to be released in June next year but the latest sentence will extend this for a few months.","David Messom pocketed hundreds of pounds targeting victims in their 80s .

"The concept of the entire TV show is built around their boundary pushing and daredevil lives in the outback. But when millionaire Milton Jones towed his teenage son Beau on a wakeboard across a murky river with his helicopter, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority decided the Keeping Up With The Joneses star had gone one step too far. Now he has won his chopper licence back, with CASA declaring he should be allowed to fly again after more training on rules and regulations, the Courier Mail reports. However, the wakeboarding incident was slammed during an Administrative Appeals Tribunal, held in Brisbane on 31 October, and other dramatic stunts in the show were embarrassingly unearthed as fake. Scroll down for video . Milton Jones (right) went to an Administrative Appeals Tribunal after the Civil Aviation Safety Authority suspended his helicopter licence . The millionaire towed his teenage son Beau on a wakeboard across a murky river with his helicopter in one episode of Keeping Up With The Joneses . Senior tribunal member Bernard J McCabe said: ‘It all looked very exciting, and it made for excellent television. It also demonstrated alarmingly poor judgement.’ The Northern Territory farmer was initially pulled up by the authority after they spotted a number of worrying incidents on his reality TV series. The Channel 10 show follows his family’s life on a cattle station, in Coolibah, 600 km south-west of Darwin, where they muster cattle and wrestle crocodiles. Mr Jones also owns a scenic flight company called Coolibah Air, the tourism arm of his North Australian Helicopters fleet which has been operating since 1993 with bases from Katherine, Victoria River, Cape Crawford and Darwin. Mr Jones appealed against the decision to ban him from flying and during his tribunal McCabe listed the offences that CASA alleged Mr Jones committed in Keeping Up With The Joneses. When Mr Jones was alleged to have used a helicopter to harvest crocodile eggs, Mr McCabe said: ‘The incident was staged. There was no crocodile nearby. The eggs were placed there before the cameras rolled. The Northern Territory farmer was initially pulled up by the authority after they spotted a number of worrying incidents on his reality TV series . His teenage son Beau was also at the centre of the wakeboarding incident . ‘Mr Jones explained in his evidence that it was the wrong time of year for crocodile egg harvesting, so it was necessary to pretend. He justified the role-play for the cameras by saying it accurately represented the way he harvested crocodile eggs.’ CASA also pulled Mr Jones up on his low-flying in the show, which they said he needed a special permit for. He claimed he did have a permit but he lost it and the tribunal stated ‘I have no reason to doubt his claim’. However, Mr McCabe pointed out that even if Mr Jones had a special permit that doesn’t mean it was OK for him to tow his son on a wakeboard while flying low. ‘There were a number of instances shown in Keeping up with the Joneses where Mr Jones was shown flying low in circumstances that were plainly unrelated to his agricultural and sling load operations,’ he said. ‘The scene in which he hovered above a watercourse while baiting a bull-shark is one example; so, too, the scene in which he hovered above a waterhole attempting to snare and tow an enraged crocodile. CASA pulled Mr Jones up on his low-flying in the show, which they said he needed a special permit for . Mr Jones said he does have a permit but he has lost it. The tribunal said they believed this to be true . ‘Even more dramatically, there was a scene in which Mr Jones flew low over a stretch of water as he raced his brother-in-law on a jet ski, and another scene in which he towed his son Beau on a wave board,’ Mr McCabe said as he ruled Mr Jones ‘failed in his duty’. Mr Jones was also rapped for leaving his helicopter unattended with the engine running and in some cases with his children still in it. He argued that to stop the engine was dangerous in remote areas as if it didn’t start again he would become stranded but Mr McCabe pointed out that the cattleman was never alone in the filmed incidences – he had a whole Channel 10 film crew with him. When it came to a scene in Keeping Up With The Joneses where Mr Jones raced his brother-in-law Hamish who was on a jet ski, Mr McCabe said: ‘While I accept the magic of television can affect perception of distance and proximity, it is clear enough from the edited and raw footage I saw that the helicopter was flying substantially under 500 feet during the scene, and at some points as close as tens of feet from the surface.’ In Keeping Up With The Joneses Mr Jones raced his brother-in-law Hamish who was on a jet ski . The reality show followed the life of a family on a Cattle Station, Coolibah, 600 km south-west of Darwin . He warned that ‘if something untoward had happened, the aircraft might have impacted the surface. That would have had disastrous consequences for Hamish and perhaps the spectators on the riverbank – and for Mr Jones himself.’ Mr McCabe blasted the stunt and said ‘there was no margin for error. Moreover, it was completely unnecessary to run the risk’. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Jones for comment. When the NT News asked him about the CASA investigation in 2011 he said it was  a 'witch-hunt'. And he described the waterskiing incident as 'a bit of fun' and 'perfectly safe'. Mr McCabe concluded that Mr Jones contravened the law on several occasions during the production of two series of Keeping Up With The Joneses. But he recommended that if Mr Jones got the necessary certification before the date on which the suspension is scheduled to come into effect, his licences will not be suspended.","Millionaire Milton Jones was banned from flying by CASA in 2011 .

"Chelsea striker Fernando Torres has revealed the pain he caused Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard when he told him he was leaving Anfield for Stamford Bridge three years ago. The striker signed for Chelsea in a £50million deal in January 2011, on the same day Liverpool signed Andy Carroll from Newcastle for £35m. Torres scored 81 goals in 142 games for the Reds, playing arguably the best football  of his career and even though his form dipped at the end of time there, the Anfield faithful was understandably miffed to see him leave - as, it seems, was Gerrard. VIDEO Scroll to watch How many attempts does it take Torres to score past Reina? Good times: Fernando Torres (left) and Steven Gerrard celebrate a goal during the Spaniard's time at Liverpool . Euphoria: Torres says he doubts that he'll ever find a team-mate as compatible to his style of play as Gerrard . 'One day, Steven Gerrard came to say to me, ""Fernando, now, you have to think of yourself. Do what you have to do"",' Torres told French magazine So Foot.'But when I went to tell him that I was going to accept the Chelsea offer, it destroyed him. Announcing my departure from Liverpool to Gerrard was one of the most difficult moments of my career. 'He was my best team-mate and I am not sure of finding another like him in the future. We were made for each other.' Torres added that he felt he had to leave Liverpool at that time in order to win trophies. Key departures: Torres says Liverpool failed to replace Javier Mascherano (left) and Xabi Alonso adequately . 'At Liverpool, I had almost everything but titles. There, I felt like a king but the team was falling apart. 'The directors had sold [Javier] Mascherano to Barca, then Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid without investing any of the money to compensate for the departure of these two key players. 'I was 27, I wanted to know what it was like to lift the Champions League and I had the feeling it was not going to happen with Liverpool. 'Then they were in full transition, the club was being sold and in that case, unless you are Manchester City or PSG, it can be a long road before you are again competitive.' Struggle: Despite winning the Champions League, things haven't worked out at Chelsea for Torres . And even though Torres went on to realise his dream of lifting the Champions League with Chelsea, his form has been patchy and as a result, he was in and out of the team under the management of Carlo Ancelotti, Andre Villas-Boas and Roberto Di Matteo. 'At the time, David Luiz and myself went to see Ancelotti together because we had been the last arrivals, we were told we would be important, but, in reality, we weren't playing. They finished by saying to us: 'We are going to finish the season with the team that started it'.''I understood nothing of what had happened. I started to know the experience of the bench. I reassured myself by saying things would soon change. Villas-Boas arrived, then Di Matteo but it was always the same: one day I played, the next not.'","Fernando Torres says his decision to leave Liverpool in 2011 for Chelsea 'destroyed' Steven Gerrard .

"Ruth Blair, a farmer, and James Mackie, a fruit and veg company boss, had rescued the giant horse, who was being badly mistreated and heading for the meat trade. After carefully nursing him back to health, Lincoln, now stands at more than 20 hands or 6ft 10in from shoulder blades to hoof, and is thought to be the biggest horse in Britain.

One day he could even rival the biggest horse in the world, which is currently just three quarters of an inch taller than him.

With eleven minutes remaining, Liverpool's Sterling became the 13th England player to receive his marching orders after a wild sliding tackle on Manchester United counterpart Valencia sparked a late brawl. Substitute Sterling had only been on the pitch for 15 minutes before launching into a flying challenge near the touchline which got the ball - but took Valencia out afterwards.

"From the forest elephants of Africa, to India’s tigers and even our own harbour seals, wildlife is losing the battle for survival all over the world. Exotic mammals such as the magnificent big cats are under the greatest threat, but even here in Britain numbers of once-familiar species have collapsed. And responsible for this dramatic decline is man. In fact, humankind’s ever-growing need for land and resources, coupled with hunting and poaching, has halved the number of wild animals in world in just 40 years, according to a shocking report. The Living Planet Report by WWF and the Zoological Society of London has found that wildlife populations around the globe have declined by 52 per cent on average since 1970. Scroll down for video . The authors compiled data on 10,380 animal populations, including 3,038 different species, as an index to judge how global wildlife is faring as a whole. It shows that British animals have not escaped the global decline. The audit, which is published every two years, found that 90 per cent of corn buntings, a bird once often seen perched on fences, have disappeared from our countryside. Endangered: There are only around 3,200 tigers left in the wild - the predators' numbers have declined by a huge 97 per cent in the last 100 years . Worldwide problem: Fewer than 100,000 forest elephants now remain, as their numbers have dropped by 60 per cent in just 12 years . The number of northern lapwings – another once-familiar sight on farmland – have fallen 60 per cent and grey partridges have halved in number. Harbour seals have declined by 40 per cent in the last decade alone in Orkney and Shetland, killed off by disease and measures to protect salmon farms. British snakes, such as the adder, have plummeted in number as open fields are taken over for housing. The global picture is worst for freshwater creatures such as amphibians, river fish and mammals, with average population declines of 76 per cent between 1970 and 2010, says the latest data available. Land-dwelling animals declined by 39 per cent over the same period and sea creatures fell 39 per cent, the report found. The authors said the main threats to wildlife are loss or damage to their habitat and exploitation through hunting and fishing. Closer to home: animals are dying out on British shores too, including the harbour seal, which has been threatened by disease and salmon farming . Nowhere to live: Britain's birds, like this corn bunting, are also under threat - largely from the loss of bushy field edges for nesting in . They also warned that humans are using resources faster than the planet can provide, cutting down forests too quickly, overfishing and pumping out pollution faster than the world can cope with it. Professor Ken Norris, director of science at Zoological Society of London (ZSL), said: ‘The scale of biodiversity loss and damage to the very ecosystems that are essential to our existence is alarming. This damage is not inevitable, but a consequence of the way we choose to live.’ David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK, said: ‘The scale of destruction highlighted in this report should be a wake-up call to us all. We all have an interest, and a responsibility, to act to ensure we protect what we all value: a healthy future for both people and nature.’ Under the sea: The threat to our wildlife is not just limited to land animals - the short-nosed common dolphin and leatherback turtle are also dying out . Mr Nussbaum said consumers could reduce their impact on wildlife by choosing products which were sustainable, for example fish with the Marine Stewardship Council and timber with the Forest Stewardship Council certifications. He said that they could also look at reducing their meat and dairy consumption. Professor Jonathan Baillie, director of conservation programmes at ZSL, said people should think about everything they do, from recycling to putting pressure on political and industry leaders, and getting their children outside to reconnect with nature.","Mankind's need for land and resources, combined with hunting and poaching, are causing our wild animals to die out .

"Oscar Pistorius could face another murder trial after South African authorities admitted they had 'an appetite' to challenge his conviction on a lesser charge. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel is holding urgent meetings with the country's most senior legal experts to seek support of a possible appeal. Professor James Grant, who was one of the first to be consulted, is urging Mr Nel, to have Pistorius' case looked at again and offering support to make the case for a murder conviction. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius was handed sentenced to five years in prison for the shooting of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . Pistorius leaves court and heads to prison after receiving five year sentence for killing Steenkamp . 'We desperately need another look at this case – there should be an appeal and I have agreed to assist with it, ' Professor Grant said. The disabled sprinter is just three days into a five year jail sentence for the culpable homicide – or manslaughter – of Reeva Steenkamp. Under sentencing guidelines, the 27 year old could spend just ten months behind bars and be allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. Today, the National Prosecuting Authoriy confirmed it now had an 'appetite' to appeal Judge Thokozile Masipa's decision. 'We have always stated first and foremost that we disappointed with the conviction,' spokesman Nathi Mncube said. 'There is an appetite to appeal, and we have 14 days to consider the law and ensure the facts and the law allow us to appeal,' In order for the verdict in Pistorius' case to be challenged, the earlier case would also have to be appealed. Above, the athlete holds the hands of family members as he leaves court following his sentencing . Professor Grant said he thought an appeal was now 'more likely than not', but it would not be straightforward. The high profile nature of the Blade Runner's trial had raised questionable legal precedents that academics argued against for years, he added . A ruling on a case heard before South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal more than 30 years ago set a precedent that now limits the state's right of appeal. In order for the verdict in Pistorius' case to be challenged, the earlier case would also have to be appealed. Pistorius' lawyers were due to visit him today at Kgosi Mampuru jail, pictured, to ensure he is getting all the medical support – for his disability and his fragile mental health – that he needs . There was widespread criticism of Judge Masipa's acquittal of Pistorius on a murder charge last month – including by Professor Grant, who said it highlighted the illogicality in the interpretation of criminal negligence and criminal intent in key cases on which the judge based her ruling. In her judgment explaining why she could only convict him on culpable homicide, or manslaughter, the 67 year-old judge acknowledged that a 'reasonable' person with Pistorius's disabilities would have foreseen that shooting into the door may have killed the person inside. However, she said South African legal precedents warned against automatically assuming that because a perpetrator 'should have' foreseen the consequences of his actions that he actually did. She said that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the double amputee foresaw the fatal consequences of his actions when he shot at the door, meaning she could not convict him on a murder charge. 'These issues have demanded attention for decades, and now thanks to the Pistorius trial, they have been brought to the attention of a lot of people. 'Resolving these issues will benefit everybody – no matter how much they have paid for their legal teams.' Pistorius' lawyers were due to visit him today at Kgosi Mampuru jail to ensure he is getting all the medical support – for his disability and his fragile mental health – that he needs. With the state looking increasingly like they are not prepared to let Judge Masipa's verdict lie, the disgraced athlete will come under pressure to build a fresh 'war chest' for the legal battles ahead. The National Prosecuting Authoriy confirmed it had an 'appetite' to appeal Judge Masipa's, pictured, decision . At his sentencing hearing, his lawyer, Barry Roux, told the court that his 'broke' client was already struggling to pay legal fees incurred since the Valentine's Day shooting of Miss Steenkamp, 29. It would take at least a year for any appeal in his case to reach a higher court, Professor Grant said. The national prosecuting authority have until Monday 3 November to make their final decision. Pistorius' team could also appeal his conviction or sentence, but Arnold Pistorius, the track star's uncle, told reporters that his nephew was embracing his period in jail as an opportunity to 'pay back to society'.","Prosecutors have met with a criminal law expert to discuss an appeal .

"The mother of a barman who died after taking part in the NekNominate online drinking craze wept today as she told his inquest that he would still be alive if it were not for the game. But Melissa Richardson, whose son Isaac collapsed after drinking at the hostel where he worked in Woolwich, south east London, said she did not blame his friend who nominated him. The inquest heard that Mr Richardson consumed an estimated 30 units of alcohol when he drank a 1.5-litre cocktail containing rose wine, vodka, beer and whiskey from a pitcher 'in one go' in two minutes after asking a friend to film him on a smartphone. Barman Isaac Richardson, pictured, died after taking part in the NekNominate online drinking craze at the hostel where he worked in Woolwich, south east London, an inquest heard . The 20-year-old collapsed and fell unconscious minutes later and died at hospital in the early hours of February 9 despite the efforts of paramedics and people at the hostel to resuscitate him. Pathology tests found he had drunk a 'very high' amount of alcohol which was 'within the range to induce a coma', the court heard. Mrs Richardson told Southwark Coroner's Court: 'We feel very strongly that it is no one's fault. 'He would not have wanted anyone to be singled out or blamed for something that was his decision. 'I don't blame his friend who nominated him or the friends who were with him that evening. It is a comfort to know that he was not alone.' But she added: 'If it were not for this craze and his nomination, my son would still be alive.' The NekNominate game involves participants filming themselves downing alcohol, nominating someone to continue the game, and posting the video on Facebook. It became an online craze earlier this year after originating in Australia and has seen players consuming alcohol with dog food, engine oil and live goldfish. Mrs Richardson said in a statement referred to in court that the NekNominate craze had reached its peak at a time when her son had 'too much idle time and too little focus in his life'. Melissa Richardson (right), the mother of Isaac Richardson (left) told his inquest that he would still be alive if it were not for the Neknominate game . Her son died of acute alcohol intoxication and coroner Dr Andrew Harris recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: 'Mr Richardson chose to accept a NekNominate challenge and drank about one and a half litres in about two minutes, shortly afterwards collapsing unconscious.' The court heard Mr Richardson, 20, was one of three people nominated on Facebook by his friend Ross Burton. In a statement read by the coroner, Mr Burton said: 'I confirm that at no point did I tell anyone what to drink. The first time I found out about the drinks Isaac had drunk was through the papers.' Detective Sergeant Roy Black said police determined that the death was not suspicious and no crime had been committed. He said the nomination was made without any 'pressure or force' and the coroner said in his verdict that there was 'no question of any unlawful action'. An inquest heard how Stephen Brookes died after taking part in the NekNominate . The NekNominate game involves participants filming themselves downing alcohol, nominating someone to continue the game, and posting the video on Facebook. It became an online craze  after originating in Australia and has seen players consuming alcohol with dog food, engine oil and live goldfish. Earlier this year an inquest heard how rugby fan Stephen Brookes died after downing almost a bottle of vodka during a challenge. The 29-year-old was six times over the drink-drive limit when he collapsed after drinking more than a pint of the spirit 'in seconds' while being filmed by a friend. His distraught family said today he would still be alive today but for the NekNominate craze. In February two young men died in Ireland, both suspected victims of the drinking craze. Ross Cummins, 22, was found unconscious in a house in Dublin in the early hours of the morning and died later in hospital amid reports he was drinking spirits at the time of his death. Hours later, the body of Jonny Byrne, 19, was discovered floating in the river at Milford Bridge in County Carlow after apparently jumping in as part of a nomination. Mr Byrne's family later pleaded with people not to take part in the drinking game. Mr Richardson had been drinking at O'Conners pub below the hostel before heading upstairs to complete his challenge. Robert Howard, a friend of Mr Richardson who was with him on the night he died, said: 'I saw him in the evening at about 9 o'clock, he had been drinking - I suppose he drank quite a lot but I don't and even when I want to get drunk I don't need to drink that much, so I can't gauge how much it takes for other people.' He added: 'He said he was going to do a NekNominate because he had been nominated but he didn't tell me exactly what he was going to do.' He described Mr Richardson mixing wine, beers and spirits into a pitcher and thinking that he was going to pour it into a glass. But he watched him down the whole thing in less than two minutes. Mr Howard said he helped get Mr Richardson to the toilet so he could throw up, but realised something was really wrong when he stumbled away from the toilet and collapsed on the floor. He gave his friend CPR while waiting for the ambulance to arrive but was unable to revive him. Mr Richardson (pictured left) had been drinking at O'Conners pub (pictured right) below the hostel before heading upstairs to complete his challenge . Dr Harris praised Mrs Richardson's 'courage and objectivity' in saying that she did not blame anyone for her son's death. After delivering the verdict, he asked whether she had any suggestions about any further action on the potential risks of the NekNominate phenomenon. She said: 'It was my son's decision to do what he did. He would not want me to use him as an example.' Earlier, the court heard Mr Richardson was a former grammar school pupil of 'great intellect'. He left school with 'numerous As and Bs' but began to attend parties regularly and his mother said he was drinking heavily in the months before his death. She said: 'He worked really hard and played really hard. He would get silly drunk.' Fighting back tears, she told the court: 'I did get fed up with him but we never fell out. It just wasn't in him to hold a grudge. ' She said Mr Richardson was 'susceptible to a dare' but he was 'never one swayed by others' and he could resist peer pressure.","Isaac Richardson died after taking part in online NekNominate drinking craze .

"An American couple convicted in Qatar of child endangerment has spoken out about their situation. Parents Matthew and Grace Huang of Los Angeles will receive a final verdict on their appeal on November 30, a Qatari judge announced October 20. The Huangs, of Los Angeles, were originally jailed on murder charges following the January 2013 death of their adopted daughter Gloria. The Huangs recently spoke to Katie Couric in an interview for Yahoo! News. 'I believe that the authorities in Qatar suspected foul play because we are Asians and we adopted three children from Africa, who are black, and this country does not understand adoptions,' Matthew Huang said during the interview. Scroll down for video . Parents: Grace and Matthew Huang are appealing their child endangerment conviction with the Qatari government - and the prosecution has also appealed, asking for the death penalty . Murder? The prosecution alleged that the couple had denied food to Gloria and said the child was locked in her room at night . Grace Huang further explained, 'It's just not done here. They don't even have a word for adoption. I was asked over and over whether I was the ""real mom.""' Yahoo News! reported that 'authorities arrested the couple and accused them of killing their daughter in order to sell her body parts on the black market.' The Huangs were released from prison last November, but banned from leaving during the trial. In March, the court sentenced them to three years in prison for child endangerment. Speaking about their imprisonment, Grace Huang said in the Yahoo! News interview 'It was incomprehensible to us. We were put in prison and taken back and forth to court every two weeks and we did not understand what was happening. Things were not translated. I was not allowed to see Matt or the kids.' The Huangs have remained out of prison during their appeal. They have insisted that their daughter, who was born in Ghana, died of medical problems complicated by unusual eating habits. However, Matthew Huang said in the Yahoo News! interview 'A lot of her struggles were from malnourishment from when she was younger.' At one point, Matthew Huang said in interview 'We appealed our three-year sentence, and so we are in an appeals court. The government prosecution appealed our three-year sentence and is requesting a death penalty, so we have been tried again on the same charges as we were before.' Appeal: Matthew and Grace Huang of Los Angeles will receive a final verdict on their appeal on November 30 . The case has raised concerns about possible cultural misunderstandings in Qatar, where Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare . Grace Huang then said to Couric 'I can relate to you not understanding the purposes of these hearings, because a lot of times I don't, we don't, understand why it just keeps going, and going, and going and going and they keep bringing the same things up over and over again, the same things happen over and over again. It just has no end.' Matthew Huang earlier told reporters outside the courtroom on October 20 'It feels like there is no end to this. The Qatar government is ignoring the calls of the U.S. government for our release.' Matthew Huang also spoke of a fear of being outside during his interview with Couric. 'I'm fearful of this country, I'm fearful of the government. I feel trapped and I don't trust that this government is able to do the right thing.' He also spoke of a fear of reprisal for giving the interview. 'I'm very fearful,' he told Couric. 'I'm scared of this court. I'm fearful of many things and I'm scared. I'm scared of this court. I'm scared of what the authorities might do to us.' Family: The couple has two other African-born adopted children who left Qatar during the trial to live with relatives in the United States . The couple has two other African-born adopted children who left Qatar during the trial to live with relatives in the United States. Washington has urged its Gulf ally to lift their travel ban. The couple met with U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Dana Shell Smith on October 19. The prosecution alleged that the couple had denied food to Gloria and said the child was locked in her room at night. The girl was pronounced dead when the Huangs took her to the hospital in January 2013. The case has raised concerns about possible cultural misunderstandings in Qatar, where Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare. An investigative report by the Qatari police had focused partially on why the Huangs would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits', according to the family's website. The Huangs will be able to take their case to a higher court after the appeals verdict, though Qatar's highest judicial body traditionally rules in favor of the lower court's rulings.","Americans Matthew and Grace Huang of Los Angeles were convicted in Qatar of child endangerment .

"Britons using cash machines on their holidays paid more than £180 million in bank charges in the past 12 months, according to new research. A survey of 2,353 British adults found that 61 per cent of those who went overseas last year took money out at a cash point that charged for the privilege. The average charge per ATM use, based on customer responses, was found to be a hefty £5.13. Britons spent more than £180,000 on overseas ATM fees in the past year, says VoucherCodesPro.co.uk . 1) Ran out of spending money - 43% . 2) Forgot to take cash, but needed it (for tips etc.) - 40% . 3) Didn't want to use budgeted money for specific purchases - 32% . 4) Lost some money / wallet - 31% . 5) Wanted extra money just in case - 23% . Source: VoucherCodesPro.co.uk . On average, the research says, the 57 per cent of those surveyed who went on holiday abroad used a cash machine twice during their break. This makes the total average spend simply to take out money was £10.26, according to money saving website VoucherCodesPro.co.uk. By the researchers reckoning, 28,785,902 UK adults went on holiday in the past year making the total hit to the hip pockets of ATM abroad-using Brits added up to at least £180,159,446. When asked how they manage their money while away, 39 per cent of respondents said they took out a large sum of money, divided it and took out with them only what they needed for the day. The next most popular method was the carry all approach, with 31 per cent of travellers taking all their cash out with them and spending it as needed while 14 per cent used a pre-paid travel card. Brits abroad use an ATM on average twice per trip away with their fees incurred adding up to £10.26 each . VoucherCodesPro.co.uk's founder and CEO Nick Swan said he was surprised by the findings. 'This is a complete shock,' Swan said. 'Whilst the odd £5 bank charge here or there may not seem like a lot, the charges really can start to add up - particularly when you consider the collective charges for UK adult holidaymakers. Think about what else you could do with that £10, or what we as a country could do with over £180 million. 'It's understandable that there's going to be times when you run out of money or have to use your card for whatever reason, but you're being charged for taking your own money out of your own bank - it's silly. Some people don't like carrying lots of money around, or like to keep a reserve for emergencies, but that's what hotel room's safes are for.'","Research by VoucherCodesPro.co.uk looked into cash habits abroad .

"As celebrities and some of the world's best known figures they often build their profiles on being positive, engaged and entertaining. But now some of Britain's personalities have revealed they are actually giving out messages of anxiety, arrogance and anger. An analysis of tweets posted by celebrities and politicians has revealed that some are betraying their hard-earned public images by revealing their emotions in their posts to their thousands and millions of followers. Scroll down for video . One Direction's Harry Styles scores as highly for angry as he does upbeat according to analysis of his tweets . While X Factor judge Simon Cowell may be known for his caustic comments to contestants on the talent show, his tweets reveal he is predominantly upbeat, analytical and personable. One Direction's Harry Styles on the other hand, known for his cheeky persona, appears to be angry. Analyze Words, a website developed by researchers, uses the posts of Twitter users to reveal the main emotions they are portraying. The tool analyses the most recent tweets to rate them for emotional, social and personal style and gives scores for 11 traits including how worried or angry celebrities are, as well as how upbeat and 'plugged in' they appear. Each person is then given a score from very low to very high for each of the categories. Taylor Swift scores highly for depressed using the tool, as well as upbeat, following her more recent posts . Some of the findings are quite surprising and challenge the public image of well-known figures. The most pronounced trait for Stephen Fry is one of arrogance or distant, with the comedian and presenter scoring very high for this category compared to a low score for personable. Harry Styles, perhaps surprisingly, is almost as angry as he is upbeat according to the tool - which rates him 'very high' for both attributes.

Madonna scores one of the highest for angry, with a very high rating for her 91/100 score in the category. She rates low for personable and analytic. While Kim Kardashian's finely tuned image appears to be paying off, as she achieved high scores for upbeat and how plugged in, or how relevant to popular culture, her posts are. David Cameron may also be looking to improve his connection with voters following the results, as the Prime Minister scores highly for arrogant/distant. But he has achieved an almost 100 per cent score for being upbeat.

"This exceptionally rare moment nearly ended in disaster. Chris Okamoto, a freediver who was spearfishing off the Santa Barbara, California, coast, came face-to-face with an angry sea lion. Thankfully, quick-thinking Chris used the butt of his speargun to scare the animal away - just seconds after it charged towards him with its mouth open. Chris Okamoto, a freediver in California, experienced an exceptionally scary - and exceptionally rare - moment as a pasing sea lion attacked . The day started out harmless enough. Chris was enjoying a peaceful dive, along with his camera, used to capture the lovely underwater views, when a colony of sea lions swam toward him. One sea lion seemed particularly curious about Chris and, after swimming by several times, made his move. Quick-acting Chris, however, used his spear to push the animal away, before the sea lion could charge him. 'I am guessing the sea lion were patrolling in the open ocean and were attracted to the bait fish that were nearby,' Chris said. 'At first, it looked like they were just curious and approached me from the blue water. One of them made several passes and then as it got closer, it rushed towards me with its mouth open. While spearfishing yellowtail off the coast of Santa Barbara, Chris was greeted by a colony of sea lions . The encounter began peacefully enough, but one particular adult sea lion tore away - and charged toward Chris . Thinking quickly, Chris brandished the aggressive animal with his spear gun, sending it into retreat . 'I was not hurt at all, just a bit shaken when it first occurred. I've had them do mock rushes before where they blow bubbles in your face, but this one came much closer and as soon as it rushed toward me, I swung the butt of my gun up and it stopped short. I wasn't sure if it was going to rush me again, so I swung the gun back up with the muzzle towards the group and they took off.'","Freediver Chris Okamoto came face to face with an aggressive sea lion .

"It's no secret that advertising is often targeted to online users, but it may surprise you to learn the extent to which pricing is also personalized. According to a study by computer scientists at Northeastern University, many major e-commerce sites personalize prices per customer, depending on what software they use or their browser history. The difference in costs can be as large as ten per cent, and most sites don't even warn you when they are using price steering techniques. Scroll down for video . Different person, different price: According to a new study, major e-commerce sites like Travelocity and Home Depot personalize prices per customer, depending on what software they use and their browser history . One of the culprits guilty of 'price discrimination' - customizing the prices of products - is travel-booking website Orbitz. Researchers found that users who are logged onto the Orbitz website are charged an average of $12 less than those who are not logged on. The same goes for online travel services company CheapTickets. Neither CheapTickets nor Orbitz tells customers that prices alter depending on the user. Websites also discriminate based on what devices customers are logged onto. For example, Travelocity offers an unspoken $15 discount for people using Apple's iOS operating system. Home Depot, on the other hand, suggests products that are about $100 more expensive to customers using a mobile device, as opposed to those on a desktop computer. Expedia and Hotels.com, both under Expedia Inc, steer people to more expensive products at random with a method called A/B testing. For example, one group of users in the study was shown an average hotel listing price of $187. Another group using the same search terms was shown prices that were $17 cheaper. And travel discount site Priceline personalizes search results based on a user's history of clicks and purchases. The researchers monitored the results of 300 real online users as well as creating hundreds fake profiles to reach their results. As they explain in the paper, user personalization can be beneficial in many ways. 'For example, when a user searches on Google with an ambiguous query such as ""apple,"" there are multiple potential interpretations,' reads the paper. 'By personalizing the search results (e.g., by taking the user's history of prior searches into account), Google is able to return results that are potentially more relevant (e.g., computer products, rather than orchards).' But when these personalized results are such that they manipulate the user into spending more money, it falls in something of an ethical grey area. Expedia spokesman Dave McNamee explained to the Wall Street Journal: 'Presenting different booking paths and options to different customers allows us to determine which features customers appreciate most. Pricing is not manipulated by Expedia.com.' And Stephen Holmes, a spokesperson for Home Depot, said the findings are accurate but that the company is not 'intentionally steering search results'. Lead researcher Christo Wilson admits that when it comes to online shopping, things do get complicated. 'In the real world, there are coupons and loyalty cards, and people are fine with that,' he said. 'Here, there's a transparency problem. The algorithms change regularly, so you don't know if other people are getting the same results.'","Orbitz, Home Depot, CheapTickets and Expedia are just some of the websites that use price-steering or price discrimination techniques .
Some sites show pricier results depending on what device you are using, while others alter the prices at random ."
"Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos claims his side are underdogs for this weekend's Champions League final against Atletico Madrid following the Rojiblancos' Primera Division success. Real head into the match having won the European Cup a record nine times in their history and been runners-up on a further three occasions, whereas the only time Atletico have previously got this far was in 1974 when they lost to Bayern Munich. Real have also dominated the head-to-head record between the clubs in recent times, and were unbeaten against their arch-rivals for 13 years up until last season's Copa del Rey final, which Atletico won 2-1. Ready to go: Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric train ahead of the Champions League final . Training hard: Cristiano Ronaldo should be fit to play in the final . Good news: Ronaldo gives the thumbs up to the cameras . Atletico followed that up with a 1-0 league win at the Bernabeu in September, but since that match Real have won two of three meetings between the two while drawing the other. However, despite those records, Ramos believes it is Aletico who are favourites to lift the title in Lisbon this weekend after they pipped Barcelona and Real to the Primera Divison - their first since 1996. 'We are up against a great team in Atletico Madrid who, from my point of view, are the favourites,' the Spain international said on Tuesday. Good feeling: Gareth Bale is expected to play in the final . Letting it slip: Ramos and Madrid saw the title slide away . 'They are the deserved current league champions and deserve credit for reaching the Champions League final. 'But that doesn't mean they are going to be the champions of the Champions League.' Real may have won the competition a record amount of times but they have not been crowned champions since 2002 - something they are desperate to change this weekend. Ramos added: 'The final is for the fans. It's a competition which after so many years really excites both us and the fans. 'It's going to be a very hard-fought final. We're expecting a very physical match which will be won by whoever commits the fewest mistakes.'Â .","Atletico pipped rivals to La Liga title .

"Welcome to the old person's home for dogs - who are all waited on hand and paw. Oaklies Oldies, the Dogs Trust's rehoming centre in Shrewsbury, West Midlands, is a sanctuary for abandoned mature dogs. Eight years ago, the house was converted into the perfect respite for the 'OADs' with boxes of toys, cushy couches and a large garden to play in. But the noise of the washing machine and volunteers putting the kettle on provide a welcome comfort to the pets used to the sounds of a normal home. The centre can house as many as a dozen dogs at a time and caters especially for pooches over the age of seven who have been left behind by their owners. Home sweet home: Simba, an 11-year-old Aspo gets tender loving care at a Oaklies Oldies retirement home for dogs in Shrewsbury . Extra touches: Each room is customised for the pets' comfort, with donated pet pillows, dog cushions and toys . Cuddle time: Biscuit is enjoying the attention from Canine Carer Jo Peel at the converted home for mature abandoned dogs . Some of the older dogs entrusted to the Dog's Trust cannot cope with the kennels after a lifetime in a family setting. These pets are treated to a stay in the snug shelter as they wait as long as six weeks to be adopted. Each room is furnished perfectly for the pets, with donated cushions, dog beds, and a personal patio to roam outside. One musical puppy even had a piano in its room for him play by running on. The dogs have been turned out of homes as their owners get older or the pets become too troublesome to look after. Some of the residents have a long list of ailments and medication they require. Lee Pogson, supporter relations officer for the Dog's Trust, said the staff and volunteers do their best to treat the dogs to make them feel at home. She said: 'We have one dog here that needs medication and is very choosy with his food. He only eats fish pie - so we go out and get him fish pie and mix up his medication in there. Take us home: Simba, left, an 11-year-old Aspo, and Lurcher, right, who is 15, are staying at the home while they wait to be adopted . Noisy: Washing machines are run to give the sense of a normal home. Pictured, 10-year-old Molly in the kitchen at Oaklies Oldies .

Dennis and Wyn broom take Sir Jasper for walks out in Shrewsbury while he is staying at the home for abandoned dogs . 'If a dog needs fish pie, we'll get him fish pie. We will spoil them to the best of our ability.' Despite their age, there is a long list of people waiting to adopt the abandoned pets. No dog is too old and a 17-year-old was recently adopted into a loving home. Lee said: 'A lot of the dogs find themselves in our care through no fault of their own. 'If they find themselves here we want them to enjoy themselves as much as possible. 'We've made Oakfield Oldies as close to a home environment as possible, they are old dogs and are used to a nice comfy sofa. 'When people think of dogs homes they think it's a dark place but it's a bright, happy place which is run by dogs - it's like a real home.' Comfy: Each room is furnished perfectly for pets, with donated cushions, dog beds, so they are comfortable .

"Rachael, pictured at 37, has written a book about her life as an escort girl during her 20s . A mother of three from Manchester has turned down a writing scholarship so she can publish her first book - about her former double life as a high class call girl. Rachael Webster, 41, had been offered a place on a prestigious creative writing degree at Ruskin College in Oxford after impressing academics with her skills as an author. But she rejected the offer and instead has written a book lifting the lid on how she used to earn £3,000 a week offering sexual services to the rich and famous in London's West End. During her former life as a high class escort named Sam she claims that she wore the best designer clothes, frequented the Ritz and Claridges and regularly shopped at high end ladies boutiques. She eventually quit after she was struck down by a depressive illness sparked by the death of her mother Lyn from cancer aged just 63. As part of her recovery Rachael, who left school without any qualifications, began penning her memoirs at an adult education centre. Her imaginative writing skills led to her being offered a degree place at Ruskin which specialises in providing educational opportunities for adults with few or no qualifications. Today Rachael said: 'I was so flattered but decided not to take the offer up because I wanted to start writing my own book there and then. 'I knew it was a gamble but it's paid off. It has been really therapeutic to get everything down on paper. 'It was quite tiring leading a double life, it wasn't always as glamorous as it seemed. It's not a line of work I'd want my daughter to go into but my life has been fascinating. And it certainly gave me a lot to write about.' Rachael was a full time mother-of-one living in a council house when in 1994 she answered an advert in her local paper saying 'girls wanted' after reading about an escort in women's magazine. Rachael, pictured drinking with friends in August 2009, used to 'live the high life' during her days as a call girl . Rachael would send a lot of the money back up to her mother, with whom she is pictured as a baby . For her first job she got £50 and she . moved to London where she was earning up to £12,000 a month and . regularly sending money back home to her her mother who was left to care . for her small child. Rachael said: 'For years I was basically living a double life, a part time high class call girl and a part time loving mother to my eldest daughter. 'In London I was very glamorous with my make-up perfectly done, my Jimmy Choo heels and Chanel bags but at home I had my hair tied back and my jeans and t-shirt on. 'I was just a girl that came from . Manchester and yet I was living a life of luxury. I'd gone from having . threadbare carpets in a council flat to earning £3,000 some weeks, it . was incredible. 'To be able . to buy my daughter the clothes and toys she'd always wanted was the . best feeling in the world and it gave me a rush to know she could have . anything she wanted. 'At the same time I often felt bad that I worked away a lot and watching her become closer with my mum than she was with me was hard.' 'I'd leave my daughter with my mum and I would go to London for a week or so to 'work' and then go back home again. In the end I did confess what I was doing to my mum but she said she'd already guessed. 'She was terrified thinking I was going to get hurt but that kind of thing never really bothered me. I was working for an agency and they would get clients for me. Sometimes people would ring up randomly asking for blondes or brunettes and other times they would ask for me. Rachael, pictured at age 38, was a high-class West End call girl earning up to £3,000 a week . 'You were with people that have a lot of . money and were pretty well known - but also people who were criminals . and gangsters. My clients included a wealthy record producer who once . asked me to marry him. Also the brother of a very famous actor and the . son of a very well-known man. 'I also had gangsters ask for me so I . had to have my wits about me. The money was great - I was earning . thousands each week but the hardest part was knowing that  my daughter was . missing out on me being her mum. 'I was partying really hard - sex, drugs, rock n roll. My life is very different from how it was.' Rachael . initially returned to Manchester and met a man, settling down and having two . more children but returned to vice when they split up. Rachael Webster, 40, lived a double life for many years throughout her 20s and has now written a book (r) Then in 2010 her mother Lyn died from breast cancer and within a few months Rachael, who was heartbroken, suffered swelling of the brain and nearly died from an illness called Broken Heart Syndrome. Rachael penning down her memoirs, called The First Floor and available on Amazon.co.uk, in 2011 and took a creative writing course at Crisis Skylight. She said: 'I started writing my memoirs after I gave up escorting and thought about putting it all into a proper book. I took a creative writing course at Crisis because I thought I needed some kind of therapy and to tap into my creative side. 'I just knew I wanted to tell my story before I died. I went to Rushkin College through the charity Crisis and did a short creative writing course for five days. I did well and I was offered a scholarship place at the Ruskin College to do a creative writing degree. 'The stress of mum's death almost killed me but thankfully I survived to tell the tale. One of the worst things is I had fallen out with her once and didn't speak to her until she told me she had four weeks to live. 'I made sure I made up for it after then. I was so relieved I built bridges before it was too late. I think since she died my children and I are a lot closer.'","Rachael Webster, 41, became escort after reading magazine article .

"King’s Road, Chelsea, is the home of swagger. So it is fitting that two men with perhaps the most impressive struts in European football will go head-to-head just a stone’s throw away at Stamford Bridge next month. Chelsea against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-finals means only one thing: Jose Mourinho versus Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Mourinho, the self-styled Special One, and Ibrahimovic, the man who said: ‘I don’t need the Ballon d’Or to know I’m the best.’ Time to deliver: Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side have been drawn against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, which means he will be up against one of his former players, Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Mutual respect: Ibrahimovic, left, and Mourinho worked together while the pair were at Inter Milan . Here I come: Ibrahimovic will be aiming to knock Chelsea out of the Champions League with PSG . Will London and Paris be big enough for the both of them? We are about to find out thanks to Friday’s draw. We . know they can work together, having seen them forge a strong bond . during their time in tandem at Inter Milan — so much so that the Swede . wrote in his autobiography: ‘Mourinho would become a guy I was basically . willing to die for.’ But what happens when these two heavyweight egos exchange blows? Mourinho will certainly fancy his chances of seeing Chelsea qualify for a third consecutive European semi-final. Speaking . before yesterday’s draw, he said: ‘The most difficult opponents you can . get in European football are all in the draw. Maybe all the teams want . to face us. I believe so. ‘Chelsea are maybe the biggest outsiders… maybe us and Manchester United. Swede talent: Ibrahimovic, seen here with PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi, is one of the best strikers in Europe on current form . Giving direction: Mourinho shouts instructions to Inter Milan Ibrahimovic at the San Siro in 2008 . ‘You . have the two finalists from last season (Bayern Munich and Borussia . Dortmund); you have the two Spanish giants (Barcelona and Real Madrid); . you have Atletico Madrid, a fantastic team over the last couple of years . and you have Paris Saint-Germain. ‘Maybe they look at us and United, because they are not having a great season, and consider us the two clubs they all want.’ Chelsea faced PSG in the group stages in 2004-05, drawing 0-0 at home and winning 3-0 away. The . Portuguese’s mind games have become a feature of his second stint at . Stamford Bridge — with his assertion that Chelsea are not serious title . contenders, despite being top of the Premier League, the most baffling . of all. Mourinho seems . intent on doing everything to relieve pressure on his players. He will . no doubt insist PSG are favourites to win the tie — and there is a . strong argument to back that claim — but he will still fancy his . chances. Thanks to their . Qatari  owners, PSG’s squad is one of the most expensively assembled on . the continent. However, as Chelsea’s Roman Abramovich can testify, money . cannot buy everything. Having . spent a fortune, the Russian still had to wait nine years and endure . numerous nights of heartbreak before Champions League success in Munich . in 2012. Silver service: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy in 2012 nine years after buying the club . Blockbuster clash: Ibrahimovic, left, and Mourinho will go head-to-head when PSG take on Chelsea . PSG have not gone . past the quarter-final stage since 1995, when they lost in the . semi-finals. Mourinho, on the other hand, knows exactly what it takes to . go all the way — as do his players. Two consecutive UEFA trophies prove . that. So, in the end, this tie could be decided by two larger-than- life characters. Can . Mourinho’s tactical  acumen nullify Ibrahimovic’s threat? Or will the . Swede’s sheer talent be too much for Chelsea? We are about to find out. Meanwhile, get ready for those egos to be inflated just a little bit . more . Jose Mourinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are no shrinking violets, so there is every expectation of fireworks now that these two are drawn on a collision course, writes Andrew Magee. On the Chelsea job: 'If I wanted to have an easy job I would have stayed at Porto. Beautiful blue chair, the UEFA Champions League trophy, God, and after God, me.' On God: 'He must really think I’m a great guy, otherwise He would not have given me so much. He must have a very high opinion of me.' On his ability: 'Please don’t call me arrogant, but I’m European champion and I think I’m a special one.' On nicknames: 'I am the only one who has won the three most important leagues. Maybe instead of the ‘Special One’, people should call me the ""Only One"".' On his looks: ‘If they made a film of my life, I think they should get George Clooney to play me. He’s a fantastic actor and my wife thinks he would be ideal.’ On trials: 'Arsene Wenger asked me to have a trial with Arsenal when I was 17. I turned it down. Zlatan doesn’t do auditions.' On versatility: 'I can play in the 11 positions because a good player can play anywhere on the pitch.' On injury: 'An injured Zlatan is a pretty serious thing for any team.' On what to get his wife for her birthday: 'Nothing, she has Zlatan.' On being marked by Stephane Henchoz: 'First I went left, he did too. Then I went right, and he did too. Then I went left again, and he went to buy a hot dog.' On Jose: 'Jose Mourinho is a big star. The first time he met my wife he said: ""Helena, you have one mission. Feed Zlatan, let him sleep, keep him happy."" He says what he wants. I like him.'","Chelsea boss and PSG striker to go up against each in quarter-final .

"An amateur space enthusiast hoped to have finally discovered life on Mars after spotting what looked like a crocodile roaming the red planet. Unfortunately, the jawed beast spotted by keen-eyed amateur astronomer Joe White, from Bristol, was nothing more than a chuck of rock. Nasa has been beaming photos from space since mobile robot Curiosity landed there in August 2012. An amateur space enthusiast hoped to have finally discovered life on Mars after spotting what looked like a crocodile roaming the red planet . The chunks of rock bore an uncanny resemblance to the long jaws of a crocodile . Mr White, 45, a space video journalist,  has been eagerly watching the images for signs of alien life. But he has been more successful at spotting familiar items in the rock formation. He said: 'I was playing another game of 'interplanetary I spy when I found the crocodile looking thing just sitting there on Mars. 'Compare the nose and mouth morphology.' Mr White runs the You Tube channel ArtAlienTV and trawls through Nasa's images every day to find unusual shapes. The image was shot from the six-foot-high right hand side mast cam on the Curiosity Rover earlier this year. There have been rocks that look like traffic lights, and even a perfectly rounded stone discovered on the surface of Mars. Another of the latest bizarre formations appears to show a rock in the shape of a cannon. Nasa has been beaming photos from Mars since its Curiosity rover landed in August 2012. Another picture appears to show a cannon (pictured left) Mr White said: 'I think it looks like a gun - as in an artillery piece - but it's way too small for that really.' Last month, a perfectly rounded rock was also spotted on the Martian surface, and continuing the cannon analogy, it looks similar to a cannonball. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 900kg (2,000lbs). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. The same week, a rock shaped like a traffic light was also spotted as Curiosity roamed around the base of Mars' Mount Sharp. In the image, a set of three large rocks - admittedly with a larger fourth one as well - are shown being stacked on top of each other. They bear a striking resemblance to traffic lights on Earth. But it’s highly unlikely this same feature was built by a martian civilisation. The image was shot from the six-foot (1.8 metre) high, left-hand side mast cam on the Curiosity Rover. The 'traffic light' rock was also spotted by Mr White, who runs a YouTube channel called ArtAlienTV. ‘I saw this one and I thought “hang on, that looks a bit strange”. I think it looks like a traffic light. ‘It is hard to tell how big it would be without any point of reference, but I would estimate it was about 12 inches [30.5cm]. ‘I posted it on the internet and people said they thought it looked like a set of traffic lights too - although some people did say it looked like a totem pole.’ The Curiosity rover recently spotted a rock that looks like traffic lights on Mars (shown in the red ring in this image). Washington-based Nasa is yet to comment on the latest discovery. The finding highlights just how weird and wonderful some of the rock formations on Mars can be . The 'traffic lights' (left) were spotted by Curiosity (right) on its way to the base of Mount Sharp, a geologically fascinating region that could explain how Mars lost its wet and habitable environment. Other people have said the strange looking rock resembles a totem pole . The rock was spotted by space video journalist Joe White. Mr White said: 'I saw this one and I thought ""hang on, that looks a bit strange"". I think it looks like a traffic light' (stock image shown). The image from Curiosity is just one of many fascinating rocks on the red planet that resembles something we are familiar with on Earth . Just days earlier, Curiosity spotted the ball-shaped rock on the surface of Mars. Nasa said it was likely an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter, according to Discovery News. Curiosity is currently at the base of Mount Sharp, which has been the target for the mission since it landed just over two years ago. The area is geologically fascinating as it contains layers that may provide an insight into the history of Mars. And, scientists hope the region might reveal how and why Mars lost what was once thought to be a habitable environment, with water flowing on its surface. This, in turn, may provide answers on the future of Earth. The discovery follows another intriguing image that showed an almost perfectly round rock on the Martian surface (shown). Nasa said it was likely an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter. Continuing the cannon analogy, it also looks like a cannonball .","The Curiosity rover has spotted a rock that looks like a crocodile on Mars .

"Nothing comes between a sea lion and their fish. A group of tourists enjoying a lovely boat ride in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, got a rather delightful surprise when a sea lion began chasing down the boat, this as they were travelling 25mph in the Pacific Ocean. Things got even crazier however when one of the skippers on the boat opened the back of the vessel, and the sea lion hopped on-board. Scroll down for video .

Open the hatch: The skipper opened up the back of the boat after he noticed the lion keeping up with the boat . Welcome aboard: The lion then hopped on-board and joined the delighted tourists . It seems this was not a social call for the sea lion however, as he was instead after one of the large fishes on the boat. And so he got a nice big catch from the skipper, and then headed back into the ocean. Feed me: It was not a social call however, as the sea lion was actually looking for some of the fish he saw on the boat . Getting it in: The lion looks delighted after being tossed a fish . Bidding farewell: Having been fed and no doubt exhausted from following the boat, the lion leaves to go eat . It is not certain if this sea lion is the infamous Pepe, known for chasing boats around and snatching fishes, but no mater who it is, they are very well fed right now. Pepe meanwhile did strike recently, being captured on video as he snuck up on two fisherman proudly showing off their catches and snatched one right out of a man's hands.","A hungry sea lion chased down a boat going 25mph in Cabo San Lucas, surprising everyone when he suddenly hopped on-board .

"Two high school students have been suspended after posting a photo of themselves posing with replica guns online just hours before their homecoming dance. Tito Velez and his girlfriend Jamie Pereira, both 16, decided to pose with 'unique props' ahead of the event at Bristol-Plymouth Regional Technical School in Taunton, Massachusetts. Donning formal attire, they picked up two Airsoft guns - replica firearms that look deadly, but can shoot only plastic pellets - and took a picture. Scroll down for video . Suspended: Tito Velez and his girlfriend Jamie Pereira, both 16, have been suspended from high school after posting this photo of themselves posing with replica guns online just hours before their homecoming dance . They later posted the image on Facebook, where it was viewed by hundreds of fellow students, leading to 'significant disruption' the next day at school, according to officials. Now, Mr Velez and Miss Pereira have been suspended for up to 10 days pending a hearing as to when or whether they will be allowed to return. Defending his decision to take the  photo, Mr Velez, who regularly participates in Airsoft team games as a hobby, told WCVB: 'We wanted something unique and different instead of using flowers like everyone else. We were like, ""let’s use something we like to do on the weekend as a prop"".' Pointing to one of the replica rifles, he added: 'This isn’t dangerous, you can’t kill someone with it. We didn’t shoot anyone, we were pointing them at the floor.' Controversy: The students (pictured speaking to TV crews) decided to pose with the Airsoft guns - which can shoot only plastic pellets - ahead of the event at Bristol-Plymouth Regional Technical School in Taunton . Replica firearms: Pointing to one of the replica rifles (pictured), Mr Velez said: 'This isn’t dangerous, you can’t kill someone with it. We didn’t shoot anyone; we were pointing them at the floor' Miss Pereira toldCBS Boston she understand why school officials had expressed concern over the image, but said: 'I think they took this way too far. Suspending us for 10 days and possible expulsion is way too much.' The students, who posted the photo online last Friday, were pulled out of school on Monday as they headed to a track meet for long-distance runners. They were then quizzed by police officers. Miss Pereira's father, Jailes, said the school's reaction to the image was 'ridiculous' and blown out of proportion, adding that it went against the couple's freedom of speech at a 'private house'. Hobby: Mr Velez (circled in red) and his girflriend regularly participate in Airsoft team games as a hobby . Institution: The students, who posted the photo online last Friday, were pulled out of the school (pictured) on Monday as they headed to a track meet for long-distance runners. They were then quizzed by police . But defending his decision to suspend the students, Superintendent Richard Gross said: 'It has nothing to do with free speech. Their behavior caused a significant disruption in the school' 'We had our homecoming event on Friday and following that the students were looking at Facebook and, of course, it caused a tumult in the building.' He added that the photo had been uploaded to an online album titled 'Homecoming 2014', meaning it was directly 'tied' to one of the school's events. Dressed up: The teenage couple are pictured posing in another - less controversial - photo before the dance . It comes just days after teenager Jaylen Fryberg shot five classmates in the cafeteria at Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington State, killing two girls and injuring the three others . The unsuspecting teens were all seated at a lunch table when 15-year-old Fryberg pulled out a .40-caliber Beretta handgun and shot each one, before committing suicide.

"Diego Costa was left in tears after being forced off with a hamstring injury during Atletico Madrid's 1-1 draw with Barcelona, which sealed the La Liga title for Diego Simeone's men.

"The England team are taking no chances with their security even while staying in the luxury Mandarin Oriental Hotel on man-made Brickell Key Island in Miami this week. There are 17 security personnel guarding the players even though the hotel in the financial district of Miami is already well protected from intruders. FA security chief Tony Conniford had only three assistants among the massive England party of over 70 who arrived in Miami on Sunday night. Checking in: Wayne Rooney and Luke Shaw arrive at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Miami on Sunday . Fully guarded: England have 17 bodyguards at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Miami . But they are supported by a six-strong security team from the company who guard St George’s Park; the six have flown to America purely for their protection role in Miami. In addition, the hotel employs another seven guards to look after the England party. The task force operates in shifts guarding the entrance to The players’ floors. So the chance of Miami’s answer to comedian Simon Brodkin, whom Conniford bundled away at Luton airport, trying to gatecrash the team rooms is slim indeed. James Milner reacted far better to questions about the spoof Twitter account @boringmilner than former BOA chief executive Andy Hunt intended to do about his Olympic Games parody Twitter, RandyShunt. Milner amusingly said he wished his foundation Twitter account had as many followers as the boring one. In good spirits: James Milner was able to joke about his spoof Twitter account @boringmilner . Hunt had wanted to tell the media he found RandyShunt totally disrespectful until persuaded otherwise by his communications team. Freddie Flintoff, who is due to make his dramatic T20 return for Lancashire on Friday, has given up alcohol for four months. Flintoff, renowned as a big boozer from his drunken Ashes 2005 celebrations and The 2007 World Cup pedalo episode, has really cut down his drinking since training to be a boxer. Sports science advances have pinpointed alcohol as responsible for slowing recovery from soft-tissue injuries. Taking it seriously: Freddie Flintoff quit alcohol four months ago . David Beckham is one of the world’s most popular sportsmen, everywhere it seems apart from Miami, where he wants to build a new stadium for his MLS franchise. Not only is there significant opposition from locals but even Miami Marlins baseball manager Mike Redmond started swearing this week when asked about Becks wanting to bring ‘soccer’ to the city. Hard work: David Beckham coming up against opposition to his plan to build a stadium in Miami . Andy’s winter base . The England press conferences were held at The Four Seasons Hotel in Brickell - near the team hotel - whose state-of-the-art gym Andy Murray always uses as part of his winter training time in Miami. Murray was so engrossed in a work-out there last December that he turned up late for his live interview before he won The 2013 Sports Personality of The Year. Training camp: Andy Murray stays at the Four Seasons hotel in Miami during the winter . This was also the location for the botched award ceremony the year before when Lennox Lewis missed his cue to hand over the third-place trophy to Murray. And another famous tennis player, Caroline Wozniacki, has been working out at The Four Seasons this week. The England players settling into their luxury Mandarin Oriental Hotel will appreciate the facilities and water views. But it’s a 25-minute taxi ride from Miami’s financial district to The South Beach party zone. And the choice of hotel was connected with keeping players well away from the art deco fleshpots with no plans even for a night out. However, music lover Leighton Baines was delighted to find Morrissey was staying in the England hotel and the full back had a long chat and a selfie photo with The Smiths frontman. Music fan: Leighton Baines took his guitar with him to the World Cup . On tour: Morrissey is staying at the same hotel as the England squad in Miami . The second edition of Graeme Swann’s video diaries ended abruptly when England began losing Ashes Tests last winter. Sponsors Yorkshire Tea had to be compensated for the lack of content. Yet England sponsors Vauxhall have signed up Gary Cahill for a daily video diary from Miami. However, perhaps fortunately - especially if England start losing and judging by the content of Cahill’s first Miami episode - the diary will cease when the team arrive in Rio because of FIFA digital rights.","Security personnel guarding players at luxury Mandarin Oriental Hotel in city's financial district .

"A mother of six has claimed she was threatened with a criminal record for taking her children out of a school for a family holiday. Amanda Moss, 42, of Liverpool, and her company director husband Simon, 49, wanted to take their six children on a 17-day trip to Israel for their elder son's bar mitzvah, which they'd booked soon after he was born 13 years ago. She said that while the primary school her younger children attend agreed to let the children take nine days off school for it, staff at the high school attended by her older children warned her she could be prosecuted for aiding truancy. Scroll down for video . Amanda and Simon Moss, of Liverpool, got into trouble when they took their six children on holiday in term-time . The Moss family, from Liverpool, went on their holiday anyway but were told they might face prosecution . Mrs Moss, a fashion designer, booked the £5,000 trip for her son, Saxon's, bar mitzvah ceremony at Jerusalem's Western Hall during term-time after discovering it would cost up to £10,000 in the school holidays. The parents informed the teachers at King David High School by letter a month before the trip and then  flew to Israel on 17 April with their children Saxon, 13, Honey, 12, Floyd, ten, Albany, eight, Darling, five, and Ezme, 13 months. She said: 'We didn’t ask permission, we said we are taking this time off for a very significant family occasion and the kids will be missing school on these days. 'We booked it 13 years ago because that is what you have to do.  The primary school said it was fine but the high school didn't give us permission. 'It's a Jewish school and they said ""Can't you change the date to out of term-time?"" 'But you can't just change the date on something like this - people book years in advance for the ceremony at the Western Wall and travel from all over the world.' Mrs Moss said she received a letter from the school saying their application for a holiday had been turned down, which she said left her 'really offended'. 'It said we might be subject to fines for not complying. We were furious - we weren’t just going on a jolly to Magaluf.' The trip to Jerusalem was for the bar mitzvah of Saxon, 13, left, pictured with his ten-year-old brother, Floyd . After the holiday the school wrote to them saying that staff there were within their rights to refer them to the local authority, and prosecution might follow. 'The fact that a parent faces criminal action because they want to spend time with their children on holiday for a reasonable price is disgusting,' Mrs Moss said.  'How is it justifiable? 'What the travel companies, airlines and hotels are doing is disgusting and the government is complicit - parents are now priced out of holidays so they are for the elite only. 'The government should be regulating these companies, not fining hard-working people who want to spend time with their children without it costing an arm and a leg.' After the Moss family complained to the Jewish Board of Deputies and to the Jewish press, the school backed down, and did not refer the Moss family to the local authority. New legislation means that parents who do not ensure their child attends school may be referred to the education welfare officer and fined. If fines are not paid, parents can be prosecuted, resulting in a fine of up to £2,5000 and up to three months in prison. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Evidence shows allowing pupils to regularly miss school can be hugely detrimental to a child's education. 'The most recent figures show we are making progress, with 130,000 fewer pupils regularly missing school under this government.' Brigid Smith, head teacher at King David High School, said: 'We follow the guidance from the Department for Education and the local authority. 'As such, only in the most exceptional circumstances can an absence in term-time be authorised.'","Amanda Moss, 42, and husband Simon, 49, booked family holiday to Israel .

"Floyd Mayweather will have his next fight on September 13, ruling out a potential meeting with Amir Khan. Fresh from beating Marcos Maidana and unifying welterweight titles two weeks ago, Mayweather Promotions chief executive Leonard Ellerbe confirmed a to-be-determined opponent. Khan, who impressed on the Mayweather undercard with an excellent win over Luis Collazo, is unable to fight in September because he observes Ramadan. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Khan: I'm the one to beat Mayweather but not in September . Wealthy: 'Money' Mayweather received around £19m after his fight with Marcos Maidana . Impressive: Khan was excellent against Luis Collazo but can't fight in September because of Ramadan .

'Obviously, Las Vegas is his home and the MGM Grand is always the leading candidate but we will take a look at our other options.' Ellerbe added the undefeated Mayweather has no intention of moving the date to face Khan. He said: 'If Amir Khan wants to flight Floyd Mayweather, we're going to fight on September 13.' Time: Khan is worried time is running out on a meeting, but the date won't change to accommodate him . Speaking earlier this month Khan said he was worried that time was 'running out' for a potential bout. ‘I think time might be running out,’ admitted Khan. ‘You always fear a little bit that the fight may not happen, but then I think to myself that at least the world knows I wanted it to happen. ‘It’s a fight I really want and if it never happens I’ll be upset because he is the best out there. If he’s not ready or confident then the fight isn’t going to happen. Even if the world says fight Amir Khan next, if he says ‘no’ then it won’t happen. ‘I really do believe I have the style to beat him. I don’t think he is scared of me but he has said he is scared of getting beaten and I think he sees something in my style which would cause him a lot of problems.' Potential: Maidana may be in line for a rematch after his showing in the MGM Grand, Las Vegas . Maidana may get a shot at a rematch with Mayweather, with the welterweight champion saying in the aftermath of the win that he would consider fighting him again. 'He's definitely in the mix,' Ellerbe said. 'He's a very dirty fighter. He used a lot of dirty tactics, but Floyd handled him easily and he gave the fans a great fight. But there's a long list of opponents. Everybody wants to be in the Floyd Mayweather sweepstakes. Several guys have made it clear they want to be next.'

"Yaya Toure has added fuel to the speculation that he may be on his way out of Manchester City this summer by declaring it would be 'an honour' to play for Paris Saint-Germain. The midfielder has been at odds with his current club since his agent spoke out over a perceived lack of respect for the midfielder from the club owner's on his 31st birthday two weeks ago. And when asked about whether he would ever consider switching to the current French champions, Toure was far from ambiguous in his response. Speculation: Yaya Toure has fuelled rumours he will leave Man City by saying PSG move would be 'an honour' Fans favourite: Toure scored 24 goals in 49 games for Man City last season . 'When I . think about objectives of Paris Saint-Germain, how can you not be . interested in a club like that?' he told France Football. 'PSG have become a European power. It'd be an honour to be part of such a club one day... if I can be of use.' The former Barcelona player was one of the stars of last season, scoring 24 goals in 49 games, and Manchester City fans will be concerned that he has once again intimated at a potential switch away. In the buildup to the Champions League final on Saturday, Toure was asked by Richard Keys on beIN sports whether City fans could expect to see him in their sky blue colours next season, Toure replied: 'That’s a good question. I think, to be honest with you now, there’s been a couple of rumours, a couple of things going out, but as a player you always want to focus and keep calm. 'As well as that, the fact that the fans look up to you and the people love you, they always want to question you and they always want an answer from you, but for my part I have come to Qatar to try and recover from an injury and to prepare myself for the World Cup. 'After the World Cup I will make a statement but there is a lot of things in the media and as a player that’s sometimes difficult and I have to manage that. The World Cup is very important for my country and I need to focus on that.' No comment: Toure failed to respond when asked where he would be playing next season . Birthday-gate: Man City posted a picture of the cake that was presented to Toure on his birthday . Comments: Toure's agent Dimitri Seluk has been in the public eye over the last week . Toure is currently on international duty with Ivory Coast ahead of the World Cup, and any potential move is unlikely to take place until his involvement in Brazil has ended. The midfielder has 82 caps for the national team, scoring 16 goals, and is hoping to have a big impact on the tournament after disappointing group stage exits for his country in the last two World Cups.

"West Ham co-owner David Sullivan believes the club can compete with the best and target a top-six finish in the Premier League next season. The club struggled in a relegation battle for much of the 2013/14 campaign, with Sam Allardyce's position as manager under threat. But when confirming Allardyce was to stay, Sullivan and David Gold said that they were aiming for the top 10. Optimistic: David Sullivan says West Ham can finish in the top six in the Premier League next season . Up for the challenge? Sam Allardyce was under pressure at the club, who were in a relegation battle in 2013/14 . And in fresh developments, Sullivan now says he wants to look beyond the top half the table and kick on with some new signings. 'We start next season with three competitions, two of which we can win and we have to be dreaming of winning the third one,' Sullivan told the Evening Standard.'I don’t want to just aim for top 10. We should be aiming for top six. I want to be looking down the table not up it next season.' The Hammers had to look to the loan market in January to improve a depleted squad, and Sullivan also admitted that many players were lined up, especially those for the future. 'We have got five or six players lined up,' he said. 'Most are young players — the youngest is 19 but has already played top-level football in two countries, while the oldest is 27.

"A man kissed and spoke to his wife's feet after shooting her dead to collect her $1 million life insurance plan, police officers have testified. Conrad Truman, 32, is on trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, 25-year-old Heidy Truman, who was found shot dead in their Orem, Utah home in 2012. Although Truman has claimed that she either committed suicide or was gunned down by someone outside the home, officers testified at his trial that his bizarre behavior raised suspicion. Officers had raced to the home after he made an emotional 911 call on September 30, 2012. Scroll down for video . On trial: Conrad Truman, center, enters court for his murder trial, which started last week. He is accused of shooting dead his wife in September 2012 in order to collect $878,000 from her life insurance . 'There's so much blood. If they don't get here right now, she's gonna die,' he wailed in the 911 call, which was played at his preliminary hearing last year. 'I don't know what happened. I really don't know what happened, I swear to God. She was in the shower, she came out of the shower and I heard a pop, and there's blood, and she's in blood.' Later, he shouted on the call: 'If you don't get here quick, my wife's life is on your head. My wife.' After officers arrived, they found the home in disarray and Mrs Truman naked with a single bullet wound to her head. An investigation found the gun had been shot at close range. In court this week, officers said that her husband's reactions aroused their suspicions. Killed: 25-year-old Heidy Truman was found bleeding from a single gunshot to the head inside her home . Suspicions: Truman said his wife might have committed suicide but officers said they found he was acting suspiciously. Officer Chris Watson testified in court, pictured, that Truman was speaking to her feet . 'He was talking to her feet and kissing her feet and saying he was sorry,' Officer Chris Watson testified, ABC News reported. Officer Art Lopez added that Truman was threatening to kill the officers if they didn't save his wife. 'I have been in law enforcement for 20 years. I've never seen anyone until this time threaten to kill the officers,' Lopez said. Officers added that Truman had allowed the couple's dogs to walk through evidence and he went to the bathroom without a police officer, the court heard. Prosecutors allege that he killed his wife so he could collect her $878,000 life insurance policy. No evidence has been presented to show they had a troubled relationship but he has told officers they had an alcohol-fueled argument before she left for a shower, the Daily Herald reported. Accused: Truman, pictured in court last year, refused to answer investigators' questions but was eventually arrested during a traffic stop in July 2013 - nearly a year after his wife was found killed . Scene: Truman suggested that someone might have shot his wife from outside as she took a shower . Before the shooting, Truman and his wife of three years had been watching the television show 'Dexter', which is about a serial killer, and drinking. His defense team has argued that the reason he gave confused accounts of what had happened is because he was drunk and had just found his wife shot dead. But after giving conflicting accounts, officers later tried to question Truman - but he failed to return their phone calls and refused to speak to them at his workplace. Following an investigation into the death, he was eventually arrested during a traffic stop in July 2013, nearly a year after his wife died. Truman has pleaded not guilty.

"Jose Mourinho says the amount of jobs football generates for the community is justification for the astronomical wages paid to its superstar players. The Chelsea boss was announced on Tuesday as a UN ambassador against hunger as part of the World Food Programme, with his first call of duty set to be a trip to Liberia to witness the ravages of hunger first-hand.

Mourinho is referring to figures such as the 842 million people - 66 million of them school-age children - in the world who go hungry every day. When asked how one can justify the wages involved in football when so many around the world don't have food on the table, he put his hands up. 'I don’t run away from it,' he said. 'I justify that. I try and one of the reasons I find to justify is that football gives jobs to thousands of people. 'Football is not about managers and players. It gives jobs directly and indirectly related to the football industry. 'There are jobs and jobs and families and children and mouths and football becomes a big industry.'

"Last week a video of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain mimicking Daniel Sturridge’s notorious goal celebration surfaced on the FA’s World Cup website. Soon enough, when the tournament gets under way in Brazil, Sturridge will be hoping to show the world how it really should be done. Dancing King: Sturridge having a dance after scoring against Denmark earlier this year . Hitman: Daniel Sturridge should be England's main main up front at the World Cup in Brazil . ‘In a World Cup, if I was to score a goal... if I can score one goal I would be happy because I have come a long way,’ he admitted. There is a maturity about Sturridge, a growing sense of belonging at the highest level of the game after an outstanding season with Liverpool. After their final fixture, when his attention turned to the World Cup, Sturridge was flicking through the record books when he came across the name of an England great. ‘I looked at Gary Lineker’s stats and he scored 10 goals in the World Cup. I thought, “Wow, that’s a huge task for anyone to get anywhere near that”.’ Lineker’s name conjures images of his goals at the Mexico World Cup, when he wore a plaster cast on his left wrist as England progressed to the quarter-final. Four years later Lineker scored four at Italia 90 before the heartbreak of defeat against West Germany in the semi-final. ‘When I look at that, 10 goals in two World Cups that he played in, that is incredible. If I can score even one goal I’d be happy because I have come a long way.’ Fancy footwork: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain tries to recreate Daniel Sturridge's famous dance . Strutting his stuff: Daniel Sturridge's shows off his famous goal celebration . It has all fallen into place for the Liverpool striker, a key part of Roy Hodgson’s World Cup plans as they prepare for their opening game with Italy on June 14. He hopes to hit the bullseye. ‘Somebody can say, “I’m going to win this game of darts”, but when they play they might not win,’ he added. ‘It’s easy to say when you’re going to do it, but more difficult to do it. I’m thankful to God for allowing me to have a decent season. The World Cup is a different level of football to the Premier League. ‘You have to understand it’s everyone’s dream to play in a World Cup as a kid. I’m just excited about it.’ He has every right to be optimistic. This season, with the backing of his Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, he scored 21 times in the Barclays Premier League. It has forced Hodgson’s hand, right at the front of the queue for a place in  England’s forward line. He is flourishing at every level. Partners: Sturridge (left) says that he is confident that he can work well with Wayne Rooney (right) ‘I’ve just been given the opportunity and that’s what I’ve asked for in the past,’ he added. ‘I don’t think the manager needs to give me a confidence booster and say, “You are my main man, you are the best”. ‘Everyone wants to play. Even if you’re 15 and in the youth team you believe you’re good enough to play in the first team.’ He has taken the long way round to international football, finally establishing himself as a regular international under Hodgson. There was frustration at Manchester City and Chelsea before he finally found a manager who truly believed in his goalscoring instincts. Rodgers cherishes him. Lethal: Sturridge (right) formed a deadly partnership with Luis Suarez (left) this season . ‘It’s down to the clubs which players . they want to give a chance to and the philosophies they choose,’ he . added. ‘I can’t speak for Chelsea or City and say they are wrong. When . you’ve money to spend it’s very easy to buy someone worth £50m rather . than say, “I’ll play this 20-year-old English player”. ‘You can only roll the dice and see how they perform. I’m thankful for everything that happened at those previous clubs. City put me on the map in terms of giving me a chance to play in the first-team environment and Chelsea also helped me to improve mentally and as a footballer. I won trophies there. Sometimes people change clubs. I would never regret anything.’ Everything has happened so quickly since the end of the season that Sturridge hasn’t had time to dwell on the title race. He has ‘boxed it off’, in his words, putting it to one side until he gets a chance to reflect on it after the World Cup. International: Daniel Sturridge (centre) in action for England against Denmark earlier this year . ‘You’ve got to move on. It wasn’t a . great feeling, but we set ourselves the target of getting into the . Champions League, so everybody’s content. But sometimes you get so . close, feel like you’ve almost won it and then don’t achieve that, it’s . disappointing. ‘It’s about moving forward, performing at the World Cup and enjoying it. There’s no favourite at the World Cup — people didn’t expect Liverpool to qualify for the Champions League.’ Even though they were eventually beaten to the Premier League title by City, Sturridge’s partnership with Luis Suarez flourished. The Uruguayan, who still hopes to face England in Sao Paulo on June 19 despite a knee injury, scored 31 times in the league. Prolific: Gary Lineker scored 10 World Cup goals for England, playing in 1986 and 1990 . There are those who believe Sturridge . is very much the junior partner in that Liverpool forward line, but he . has had a remarkable season. ‘If Luis is world class, Luis is world class,’ added Sturridge. ‘That’s everyone’s opinion and that’s how they feel. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. ‘For me I am just working every day on the training field the same way that Luis works. We work to reach the optimum level our bodies can reach. At the end of the day I am happy performing the way I am performing. I am working harder to improve even more and that’s the most important thing for me. ‘Everyone has their own opinions on what footballers they like. I like Ronaldo, some people like Messi. It is down to individual preferences.’","Sturridge admits he'd love to score just one goal at the World Cup .

In parts, it was like a Union Jack . jukebox - a medley of tracks from the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, . David Bowie and Queen, the Specials and the Jam, the Stone Roses and . Eurythmics, and what seemed like dozens more. The list spanned generations, from . The Who’s My Generation right up to live performances from two of the . hottest homegrown acts of the moment. A dramatic section featuring 75 bikes . representing the traditional doves which were released at Games from . ancient times to signal peace, was accompanied by the music of the . Arctic Monkeys, including their No. 1 hit I Bet You Look Good On The . Dancefloor . Stand out: Bright neon colours on the dancers' costumes made an effective scene . Dancing feet: A montage of songs were played as brightly-coloured dancers took to the stage . As . they played to thousands of people in the stadium and millions around . the world, fireworks surrounding the East London arena lit up the sky. In a reflection of British humour and the East End there was a version of I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles. UK Grime MC Dizzee Rascal took to the stage singing his hit song Bonkers - he is a local boy brought up in the East End. He said: 'It is exciting to be part of . the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony. It is a good time for . the UK and I am glad they asked me to perform one of my greatest tracks . to represent the country. 'Huge respect to all the athletes who are taking part and let's get the party started.' Emeli . Sande who sang the hymn Abide With Me said: 'I am extremely proud and . humbled to be part of the amazing ceremony which will allow the world to . see some of the best up-and-coming and established talent the UK has . produced.' It was written by Henry Fancis Lyte in 1847 and he died three weeks after completing it. The hymn has been sung at every FA Cup final since 1927. It is also a regular tune heard at Rugby League internationals. Singing to millions: Emeli Sande sang the hymn Abide With Me - it was written by Henry Fancis Lyte in 1847 . National treasure: UK Grime MC Dizzee Rascal took to the stage singing 'Bonkers' The musical melange continued during . the athletes parade, with members of the 204 national teams circling the . track to everything from West End Girls by the Pet Shop Boys and . Rolling in the Deep by Adele. The British squad entered to a roar . of applause - and Bowie’s anthem-like Heroes, while Pink Floyd played . during the fireworks display. A thousand drummers beat out their . rhythm across the stadium and 80 musicians, aged from seven to 17, . captivated the crowd as they joined the London Symphony Orchestra for a . performance of Nimrod by Edward Elgar. A young male chorister moved the audience to tears last night with a stunning solo during his choir’s rendition of Jerusalem. Despite a global audience of four . billion, he kept his composure as he led the Dockhead Choir, from . Southwark, South East London. Dressed in yellow striped tops, the . choir sang a note-perfect version of the song, often associated with . patriotism and based on the short poem by William Blake. Looking bored: The London Symphony Orchestra played Chariots of Fire as Mr Bean - actor Rowan Atkinson - took to a keyboard . The Bean way: Half-way through the performance Mr Bean took out his phone and then proceeded to sneeze, while playing one . key repetitively . Musician Frank Turner took to the . stage with a band before the opening ceremony. The English singer folk . singer played 'I Still Believe' as actors dressed in period clothing . walked out on to the green scene. He had previously practiced twice at the venue this week before he made his Olympic debut to the crowd. Another act during the night was funnyman Mr Bean. The London Symphony Orchestra took . centre stage playing Chariots of Fire as Mr Bean - British actor Rowan . Atkinson - took to a keyboard. The performance cut to a video of Mr Bean running down the beach made famous in the opening scene of the 1981 film. British ceremony: God Saave The Queen was sang by the Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children . Singing out: The pyjama-clad choir ranged from young children to teenagers . Past bedtime: Artists perform on beds during the Opening Ceremony . Oscar winner Boyle, the man . responsible for the the remarkable transformation of the stadium where . the athletics will take place, said: 'Tonight's a warm-up act for the . Games. 'That's one of the things you have to keep remembering. 'You . big it up for different reasons, and you hear it bigged up or slammed . or whatever it is and you've got to keep remembering we're the warm-up . act.'

"Arsenal fans have accused Ashley Cole of being obsessed by money ever since he left them for Chelsea - and on this occasion, they could have a point. Cole met his former Chelsea and England team-mate Shaun Wright-Phillips met for lunch in a Hollywood hotel and the defender paid for the meal from an envelope stuffed with cash. The 33-year-old is a free agent after seeing out his contract at Stamford Bridge and was dropped from England's World Cup squad, prompting his international retirement.

Cash: Ashley Cole (right) holds an envelope stuffed with cash as he meets Shaun Wright-Phillips for lunch . Counting: Cole gives his wad of cash a check after settling down in the Hollywood hotel . Stuffed: Cole is without a club and has been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal, Man City, Man United and Real Madrid . Arsenal supporters have labelled Cole 'Cashley' ever since he moved across London in 2006 and was paid £90,000 a week by Chelsea. When he played for his new club against Arsenal for the first time, some Gooners held up fake £20 notes with his face on. Even before his transfer supporters were . angry with him due to a clandestine meeting with Chelsea boss Jose . Mourinho. Cole eventually moved to Stamford Bridge as part of a £5million deal . which led to William Gallas going the other way. Revelations (in his own autobiography) of Cole's wage demands also did not help his perception among ordinary football fans. The passage in his book about his agent's contract negotiations with Arsenal chairman David Dein, was savaged by supporters and the media. Cole was not happy to be offered £55,000 a week instead of £60,000 and wrote: 'When I heard Jonathan (Barnett, his agent) repeat the figure of £55k (a week), I nearly swerved off the road. “He is taking the p***, Jonathan!” I yelled down the phone. 'I was so . incensed. I was trembling with anger. I couldn’t believe what I’d heard. I suppose it all started to fall apart for me from then on.' The money shot: An Arsenal fan prepares to greet Cole with a fake £20 note bearing his image . Power couple: Cole and Cheryl Tweedy (before their marriage) promote the National Lottery .

Chelsea (2006-2014) Games 339 Goals 7 . England (2001-2014) Caps 107 Goals 0 . And he . received wider public notoriety when stories emerged that he cheated on his . former wife Cheryl, at the time a much-loved high-profile presenter on . The X Factor. This . animosity led to him being booed by England fans during a match at . Wembley against Kazakhstan, as well as being a poster boy for everything . that was wrong with the game (although it should be pointed out, for balance, that he was named England fans' player of the year for 2010). He was seen as mocking the FA's Respect campaign in 2008 when he deliberately turned his back on Mike Riley in an act of dissent as the referee was trying to caution him. The perception of him as the crass modern footballer was not helped when, in 2011, he accidentally shot and wounded a 21-year-old student on work experience at Chelsea's Cobham training ground. He . did not endear himself to the football authorities in 2012, either, . when he sent out a hastily deleted tweet labelling the FA a 'bunch of . t****'.

His lunch partner in LA, Wright-Phillips, might find it a bit more difficult to find a new club. He made just 13 appearances for Queens Park Rangers last season and failed to score.

"A trainee teacher sent home on her first day at a Catholic school because of her tattoos has abandoned her dream of a career in the classroom. Charlotte Tumilty, 26, was turned away from her trainee role at a strict Catholic school when staff took exception to her body art. The mother-of-two has now decided to quit her place on a teaching training course to care for her family instead. Charlotte Tumilty, 26, has decided to quit being a teacher after being sent home because of her tattoos . Miss Tumilty had been on a level two teacher training course at Hartlepool College of Further Education . Miss Tumilty, from Hartlepool, said: 'I've quit the college, I have no idea what I will do, to be honest - probably just concentrate on my family. 'Since it's all blown out of proportion, my story has gone global. 'I've had a lot of support, although I have had a fair bit of negative feedback, mainly from the older generation.' Miss Tumilty had been offered the role at St John Vianney's Primary School in Hartlepool as part of her teacher training course. She was on a level two teacher training course at Hartlepool College of Further Education and was due to work at the school twice a week for a year. Despite passing an earlier interview, within a hour of starting the position she was told to go home and come back with plasters and bandages covering up her 'inappropriate' body art. She has a 'full sleeve' of tattoos on her arms and legs, smaller inkings on her fingers, hands, back and chest and an eye emblem on her neck. But Miss Tumilty said she was unable to cover them all up and there were no other placements available at other schools. Miss Tumilty said she will now concentrate on her family after deciding against a career in teaching . She then faced fresh controversy after erotic photos, some completely nude, appeared on a number of websites. Miss Tumilty admitted posing for some 'old' pictures when she was aged 18, but has refused to comment further. Appearing under the name of Charlie Horizon the photos show her in compromising and revealing positions. In some of the images she can be seen pulling down her trousers to expose her behind, while in many she is completely topless. Within an hour of starting her job at St John Vianney's Primary (pictured), she was told to cover up her tattoos . Under current legislation people with tattoos are not covered by the Equality Act 2010. Earlier this year a business executive was sacked from her job after having an inking of a butterfly design on her foot. Jo Perkins, 38, had the design on the side of her left foot when she started working for multi-million pound firm Salisbury FM. But after she started work, bosses brought in a ‘no tattoos on show’ rule – and terminated Miss Perkins’s contract when she could not cover up her inking. Similarly, Larissa Westcott said she was having a job interview with British Airways when she was told her application wouldn't be taken any further because of a tattoo on her foot. However, earlier this month, the army announced that it was lifting its ban on hand and neck tattoos in a bid to draw in more recruits.","Charlotte Tumilty, 26, has turned her back on a teaching career .

Booked: Edwards. Fleetwood Town: Maxwell, McLaughlin, Pond, Roberts, Taylor, Goodall, Blair (Parkin 74), Morris, Sarcevic, Ball, Hume (Murdoch 86). Subs Not Used: Evans, Schumacher, Matt, Jordan, Lucas. Goals: Sarcevic 75. Att: 14, 007 . Ref: Michael Naylor (Sheffield). Fleetwood’s rise up the  English football ladder has been remarkable. This third incarnation of the west Lancashire club was only born in 1997 when they entered the 10th tier of English football in Division One of the North West Counties Football League.With six promotions in the past nine years, their ascent has also been rapid. That success has come since chairman Andy Pilley took over in 2003. Back then, Town’s  Highbury Stadium had  windows falling in and Pilley’s first game in charge drew 80 spectators. Manager Graham Alexander, appointed in 2012, explained: ‘It all comes down to the ambition of the chairman. We’re always believing we can smash through any glass ceilings on top of us.‘We’re proving we can achieve. That’s what the chairman spoke to me about when I came here. It’s down to a lot of people  pulling in the same direction. You’ve got to have that drive.’ Tussle: Chris Hussey of Burton (left) battles with Callum McFadzean at Wembley . Fleetwood are based in a small fishing . town, five miles north of Blackpool, with a population of less than . 30,000. It took the club  just two seasons to make it out of League Two . after spending only two in the Conference. And when they went up to . League Two in 2012 it was the first time, since the club  originated in . 1908, that they had ever been in the Football League. Victory will be . celebrated on the Fylde coast but for Albion it was a terrible way to . lose such an important match — and Lyness will be keen to forget it . quickly. With 15 minutes left, Fleetwood won a seemingly innocuous . free-kick 35 yards from goal out on the left. Midfielder Sarcevic, who was at Manchester City’s youth academy between the age of seven and 15, sent a high ball into the box. Lyness dashed from his goal to claim it, ran too far and then could only flap at the ball as it sailed over his head and in.

Support: Fleetwood Town fans were looking for yet another promotion . Faithful: Burton fans cheer on their side ahead of the match at Wembley . It . was Sarcevic’s 15th goal of the season and probably the one he least . expected to see go in the net, but Burton manager Gary Rowett refused to . blame his keeper. ‘I told him to get his chin up,’ said Rowett. ‘Unfortunately, a lot of these games we’ve seen in the last few weeks — . play-off finals, the Champions League final — often a mistake dictates . the result and defines a close game. That’s what it did. ‘Dean’s been . excellent. I can’t be disappointed with him, he’s going to be . disappointed enough with himself. He’s got to learn from it.’ In the . end, it was a deserved win. Fleetwood were unlucky not to go ahead in . the opening two minutes when striker David Ball had a ferocious shot . pushed over. From the resulting corner he got his head to the cross . only four yards out but Lyness somehow got his body behind the ball to . keep it out.","Antoni Sarcevic scores with 15 minutes remaining at Wembley .

"They've been dating for just over a year but Dawn French said she knew she wanted to spend the rest of her life with Mark Bignell. Now that wish has come true after the couple married in an intimate – and lavish – ceremony on the Cornish coast. The comedienne, 55, rented out an exclusive eco-hotel – where rooms cost up to £430 a night – for a weekend of celebrations, described as a 'big' but 'very classy and understated affair'. Scroll down for video . You may kiss the bride: Dawn French has married her beau Mark Bignell in a secret ceremony this weekend . Guests included comedy friends Jennifer Saunders, Sue Perkins and Kathy Burke, and screenwriter Richard Curtis. Alison Moyet sang for the guests in . the evening, as did Miss French's daughter Billie, from her marriage to . comedian Lenny Henry, which ended three years ago. The wedding at the Scarlet Hotel, . near Newquay was held in a lounge overlooking a terrace with sweeping . views of the rugged coast. The hotel's 37 bedrooms were decorated with custom-made floral jam jar arrangements of peonies and Lily of the Valley. In the evening, guests were treated . to a firework display on the beach below, while red sparklers formed a . heart with the letters D and M inside in the hotel garden. After 25 years with Henry, Miss . French found love again with Mr Bignell, the boss of a Cornish charity . that her mother founded before she passed away last year. Beautiful bouquet: A Cornwall-based florist posted a picture of Dawn's bouquet to their Facebook page . Lavish: Wedding guests at the Cornish hotel were treated to a firework display on the beach below . They started dating in January last  year after Miss French lost almost eight stone by cutting out chocolate and carbohydrates. Speaking about being single, she . said: 'I thought oh god, what do I do now? Do I have to do dating? How . repulsive. I'll have to buy new pants. 'I did do some dating and it was excruciating and difficult as I'm not an accomplished flirter. 'Then, bang, I met somebody else. I started to claim my life back. It's a life with him. 'I know that I will make a good life . for myself with all sorts of things as armour. Including stuff my new . chap is teaching me that I never knew. 'Now my life is in Cornwall with him. I hope it is a life together.' Miss French revealed she had fallen in love with him when he wooed her with the Cocteau Twins' record Song To The Siren. The ex- factor: Dawn was married to Lenny Henry for 24 years before the pair divorced in 2010 . 'I knew when I heard the song it was an offer. You would fall in love if someone gave you that song,' she said. Mr Bignell, who has been married twice before, is the chief executive of . the Hamoaze House charity, which helps recovering drug and alcohol . abusers reintegrate into society. He has been working in the area for the past 20 years and has a daughter of 21 and a son of 18. Mr Bignell claims he did not know who Miss French was when they first met, to which she responded: . 'I'm not boasting, but you'd actually . have to have not watched television for the past 20 years to have . avoided me, and he'd managed to do just that.' To rent the Scarlet Hotel, couples . have to agree to a minimum spend of £29,000 – not including the band, . lighting, flowers or photography. The 'eco-hotel', which prides itself . on recycling and maintaining its green ethos, has a restaurant, three . bars, a spa and panoramic views of Mawgan Porth beach. Charitable: Mr Bignell, who has been married twice before, is the chief executive of the Hamoaze House charity . Dishes served at the hotel's . restaurant include Cornish hake with chicken skin and pork fillet, cheek . and belly with rhubarb, potato fondant, and white port sauce. A source said: 'The hotel looked stunning. They had rented out the whole place exclusively for the weekend. 'The wedding was up in the lounge with the white leather seats, looking out over the water. 'At about 9.30pm everyone went . outside and watched fireworks from the hotel. They were on the beach . below, big shells that went up to 400ft high in all different colours. 'Inside in the hotel garden there was . a red heart, five foot wide and high, with the letters M and D in white . in the heart. They all let off lanterns later. It was quite small – . probably about 100 people there – but it was a proper celebrity . wedding.' Florist Susanne Hatwood said she had . created a 'spring-woodland' theme for the table centrepieces using . delicate Lily of the Valley – but didn't know who for until she arrived . at the venue. 'I didn't have the slightest idea who the bride really was till the last minute,' she said. The Garden Gate Flower Company, which provided the hotel displays, described the weekend as 'amazing' and a 'secret wedding'. Miss French was unavailable for comment last night.","The comedienne, 55, rented out the Scarlet Hotel, .

"A woman who was allegedly raped by top defense lawyer Sanford Rubenstein woke up with bruises on her arms and surrounded by bloody condoms, her lawyers have said. The unnamed accuser says she was raped by Rubenstein, a high-flying New York attorney, in his penthouse apartment earlier this month after the Reverend Al Sharpton's star-studded birthday party. More graphic details of the alleged assault were put forward in a letter her lawyers hand-delivered to the Manhattan district attorney's office, demanding he be arrested and charged with rape. Accused: High-flying defense lawyer Sanford Rubenstein has been accused of raping a worker for Al Sharpton's National Action Network . Once close: Rubenstein, pictured above with Sharpton, met his accuser at the Reverend's birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan on October 1. Sharpton has since distanced himself from him . It described the scene as the woman, who works for Sharpton's National Action Network, woke up, 'bloody condoms laying around her'. Her arms were bruised and she was suffering vaginal bleeding, the letter, reported by the New York Times, said. The bruises were said to be evidence that she was held down during the encounter - which Rubenstein has insisted was consensual. Rubenstein has not been charged with a crime. The woman's lawyers - Kenneth J. Montgomery and Keith White - added that she later used a rape kit, and that the results were consistent with sexual assault. They demanded he be charged with third-degree rape at the least. Investigation: NYPD officers are pictured above removing bags of evidence from Rubenstein's apartment . The alleged attack took place after Sharpton's 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant, which was attended by New York mayor Bill de Blasio, Governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee . Rubenstein and his alleged victim met at the party and went home to his Upper East Side apartment along with a third person, who later left. After the allegations surfaced, NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan and reportedly collected 'biological evidence'. Allegations: Rubenstein has maintained the encounter was consensual. He is pictured above with a former client, one-time Playboy playmate Stephanie Adams . Denial: Rubenstein's own defense lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said the letter is 'offensive and patently false' Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy. Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. Sharpton has also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn't mean you're guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain't no place for that in our community. The district attorney's office told the Times the case was being investigated, and declined to comment further. Rubenstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, rebutted the letter, saying that 'all evidence to date points to consensual sex between two consenting adults, who were both active and awake throughout.' Brafman described the letter as 'offensive and patently false.'","Sanford Rubenstein is accused of raping woman after party this month .

"Thousands of protesters still camped out in the middle of Hong Kong are set to vote on whether to end their demonstration a month after it began. Hong Kong authorities have agreed to submit a report to Beijing detailing the activists' anger, and asking for reform in the city's upcoming elections. The leaders of the three main protest groups, which are still occupying the city's finance district, have agreed to hold a vote on Sunday before giving their reply. The news came as protesters scuffled with anti-Occupy demonstrators holding Chinese flags who came to the barricades to oppose the camp which is blocking the streets. Protesters said today that they will take a vote on dismantling their camp in Hong Kong, as tensions flared at one barricade as a man arrived carrying a Chinese flag to demand that they leave . A scuffle broke out between angry demonstrators and the man, who demanded they stop blocking roads in the city's finance district with their protest camp . The demonstrators, who have been on the streets for nearly a month, will vote on Sunday on whether or not to end their protest in return for more talks on elections . Policemen surround an anti-Occupy protester shouts by a barricade at Mongkok shopping district, Hong Kong . Activists were pictured in scuffles with several demonstrators, as police attempted to protect them. The student protesters are angry that a panel of 1,200 officials in Beijing will be allowed to hand-pick candidates for the 2017 elections. The students say the committee should either be scrapped or reformed to better represent the their city of 7.2 million people. While their camps have been greeted by widespread support in Hong Kong, tempers have flared between the activists and residents on several occasions. Hong Kong officials have also offered to hold regular talks with protesters about democratic reforms if they end their demonstrations. The Hong Kong Federation of Students, one of the main organizers behind the protests, has already rejected the government offer but still agreed to the Sunday referendum. Pro-China protesters are pictured shouting slogans at student activists in central Hong Kong today . Activists took to the streets a month ago after heavy-handed police tactics, including the use of pepper spray and tear gas, brought thousands on to the streets .

Elsewhere today, American jazz musician Kenny G - who was pictured in front of the protest camp making a peace sign two days ago - has said he does not support the activists. The sax player, who is wildly popular in China, sought to distance himself after posting the image on Twitter on Wednesday along with the message 'In Hong Kong at the sight [sic] of the demonstration'. Today he claimed it was 'unfair' that people were linking him to the protesters, saying the picture - which has now been deleted - was taken on an 'innocent walk' around the city. He wrote: 'I was not trying to defy government orders with my last post. I was in Hong Kong as a stop on my way to perform at Mission Hills. 'I don't really know anything about the situation and my impromptu visit to the site was just part of an innocent walk around Hong Kong. 'I only wanted to share my wish for peace for Hong Kong and for all of China as I feel close to and care about China very much.' Earlier this week, Tung Chee-hwa, the city's first chief executive after its 1997 transition from British to Chinese rule, said that the protesters' demands were not realistic and that they should accept a longer timeline for electoral reforms. 'Students, I hope you listen to what this old man is saying,' the 77-year-old said in a news conference. 'It's time to go home.'

"Click here to read Adam Shergold's match report from Craven Cottage . Gordon Strachan blamed end-of-season rust for the 90th-minute goal which sealed a nightmare evening for Grant Hanley and denied Scotland the scalp of World Cup qualifiers Nigeria. Leading 2-1 with seconds to play, his team looked certain to make it six wins in their last nine games after an outrageous goal from Charlie Mulgrew and a second-half own goal from Azubuike Egwuekwe. On a night to forget for Hanley at Fulham’s Craven Cottage, however, Michael Uchebo’s first-half equaliser took a wicked deflection off the centre-half – before he failed to clear his lines as substitute Uche Nwofor levelled in injury time. Bullish mood: Gordon Strachan was pleased with Scotland's attacking display against Nigeria . Joy: Scotland players celebrate Charlie Mulgrew's opening goal . ‘I liked a lot of things I saw there, the only thing we had a problem with was the fact some of the lads had not trained for three weeks,’ said Strachan, indicating that weariness was the only difference between a win and a draw. ‘Most of them had been on holiday somewhere. I’m not saying they weren’t looking after themselves, and the way they tried to switch on again at training was terrific. But we lost a wee bit of fitness in the last 15 minutes. 'During the game, we were one pass away from a really great move. We could have had four or five goals.  That’s the first time I’ve said that after a game - we had a lot of chances. ‘I’d put the fact we didn’t finish them off down to rustiness. In terms of what I saw and what we are trying do, in terms of movement and trying to get closer to the striker, I liked that. Tussle: Nigeria's Elderson Echiejile keeps Steven Naismith at arms length . 'The shape we had when we didn’t have the ball was good as well.’ Scotland . took the lead through an outrageous and audacious Mulgrew effort, the . Celtic star flicking out a heel to deflect a James Morrison shot into . the net. ‘Charlie’s . goal was terrific. It was luck in terms of the shot but he had to know . where to send it,’ said Strachan. ‘There is a lot to be proud of, I’m . just disappointed we didn’t get the win.’ Strachan admitted Hanley was disappointed with his failure to clear his lines for the last-gasp equaliser. Leveller: Michael Uchebo watches on as his strike finds the back of the net . Adamant the Scots had no failures, however, the Scotland boss also blooded Derby’s Chris Martin for the first time as a second half substitute. ‘The first Nigeria goal was unlucky for us. The ricochet might go in itself. But I thought Grant was terrific,’ he said. ‘Nobody has disappointed me. Chris Martin gave us a new dimension. Midfielders like it when the ball goes up to someone like that. It’s a new thing in football - the strikers are not scoring 40 or 50 goals a season. They score 20 or so but have to link up and let others score, too. He is good that way. Dejected: Grant Hanley struggles to hide his disappointment . Comeback kids: Nigeria celebrate snatching a draw late on to deny Scotland . ‘In terms of positive play, that’s as good as it gets. We have been terrific as a unit before and had a few chances, but overall there was a bit of flair and imagination against a really top side. ‘Andrew Robertson and Kech (Ikechi Anya) were terrific down that left side. With hardly any caps between them, they’re not physically big but they stood up and played the game. They didn’t let them get close to them. ‘Anya is terrific, a breath of fresh air.

That’s all you can ask for.’ Speaking out: A Nigeria fan hits back at claims of match-fixing prior to Wednesday's friendly .","Strachan says end-of season rust was to blame for conceding late on .

"Police in Mexico have found mass graves containing at least 15 charred bodies near where 43 students disappeared after a deadly police shooting last week. The burial pits were found Saturday on a hill in a community outside Iguala, Southern Mexico, the town where the students were last seen. Witnesses claimed that they had last been seen being led away by police. Twenty-two police officers were arrested in Guerrero today, accused of killing two students during the clashes last week. Scroll down for video . Mexican authorities are investigating a mass grave discovered on the outskirts of Iguala, the same city where 43 students have been missing for a week . A Mexican navy marine guards the road that leads to the site. Witnesses claimed that the students had last been seen being led away by police . A car from the forensic technician service Servicio Medico Forense (SEMEFO) is seen in the area where a mass grave was found, in Colonia las Parotas on the outskirts of Iguala, in Guerrero . Inaky Blanco, is chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero. He told a news conference in the state capital, Chilpancingo: 'We still can't talk about an exact number of bodies. We are still working at the site.' Reports from the scene  in the community of Pueblo Viejo  said at least 15 bodies were exhumed from the site. Iguala is about 120 miles (193 km) south of Mexico City in the increasingly violent state of Guerrero, the site of clashes involving students, police and armed men last week. At least six people were killed in a spate of incidents. Guerrero Governor Angel Aguirre said earlier this week that photos showed police had taken some of the students away. Several hundred students protested on Saturday night in front of Aguirre's residence in the state capital of Chilpancingo, expressing anger that some of their classmates may be among the bodies found in the graves. A car was overturned and several petrol bombs were hurled at the residence perimeter, where security outposts were lightly damaged. Authorities found the mass grave as police are scouring the area for nearly four dozen people missing after a rash of violence. Guerrero was the site of clashes involving students, police and armed men, which started in late September . The graves were found up a steep hill after some of the 30 suspects detained in the case told authorities about their location . If the students are in those pits, it would be one of the worst slaughters that Mexico has witnessed since the drug war intensified in 2006, leaving 80,000 people dead to date .

A police official said on Saturday that there was video footage of eight to 10 students being put into police trucks earlier in the week. Twenty-two police officers were arrested in Guerrero on Sunday, accused of killing two students during the clashes last week. Aguirre said on Saturday that a total of 30 individuals have now been detained in connection with the incidents. Local government officials criticized the police for showing an excessive use of force with the students in Guerrero, where gangs have evolved from a fragmented drug cartel and are fighting turf wars. Thirteen of an original group of 57 missing people re-emerged this week. Some had hidden, others had gone home. Dozens are still unaccounted for. Many mass graves have been found across Mexico in recent years and months, the legacy of drug gang violence that has killed around 100,000 people since 2007.

"Zach Galifianakis' weed-loving sketch comedy program Between Two Ferns wasn't President Barack Obama's first choice for his Obamacare-themed cameo this spring, duo Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele claim. In an excerpt of an interview with Entertainment Weekly for it's cover story this week, the Obama impersonator and his anger translator revealed that the president wanted to team up with them to promote the Affordable Care Act, but they were too busy. 'We had to turn him down,'  Peele told EW. 'We were making the season.' 'We literally couldn’t fit it in to our schedules,' Key added 'with regret,' according to the magazine. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Actors Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, a.k.a. President Barack Obama's anger translator Luther and President Obama, say POTUS wanted to do an Obamacare sketch with them but they turned him down . Instead, Obama appeared on Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis. Key and Peele left the door open to a future collaboration with the president, though . Peele went on to say that he and his acting partner 'actually had to relieve the president of his duties.' 'We couldn’t help him out on that one particular time,' he said, leaving the door open for a future collaboration with the nation's leader when the 2015 open enrollment period for Obamacare begins in November. 'But this is a country where we technically have status over our elected officials. So you gotta remember, Obama works for us,' he noted. Health and Human Services Secretary Slyvia Burwell sought on Wednesday to downplay a government report claiming that 13 million people will be eligible to for health care under the Affordable Care Act in the upcoming open enrollment period. 'One of things we are doing right now is applying analytics to how should we think about that goal,' she said, according to the LA Times. During the first sign-up period 7.3 million Americans signed up for Obamacare, surpassing the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office's estimate of 6 million. But HHS appears to be concerned that it won't be able to replicate its past success and nearly double the number of enrollees in 2015. Key and Peele are known for their portrayal of the president's anger translator Luther, played by Key, and President Obama, acted out by Peele, in skits on their Comedy Central show of the same name, Key & Peele. Last night the show launched into it's fourth season with a skit featuring 'Obama' at the end of a press conference, sans sidekick Luther, code-switching as he takes a different tone with white supporters than he does black supporters as he interacts with them. Key and Peele told Vulture over the summer that at some point this season they would unveil former Secretary of State and presumed 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's anger translator on the show, expanding on the popular bit that now includes impersonations of Michelle Obama, as well. 'Whereas Michelle’s translator Contendra felt like she owned a beauty salon, maybe somewhere on Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta, I think Hillary’s translator would be more trailer bait,' Peele told Vulture. 'We’re thinking deep Arkansas good ol’ gal who does not censor herself,' he said.","Instead, President Obama appeared on Zach Galifianakis' weed-loving sketch comedy program Between Two Ferns .

"To the locals who regularly enjoy a pint at the Old Boot Inn in Stanford Dingley, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are a familiar sight. A few miles from the £7 million Middleton family home in Bucklebury, the couple love the pub so much they even invited landlord John Haley to their wedding in 2011. But now their quiet country evenings could be under threat after news emerged that Mr Haley has applied for permission to turn the quaint village pub into a house. Scroll down for video . Home: Kate and William, seen here in the Middleton's garden with Prince George, often decamp to Bucklebury . Horrified locals have now mounted a 'save our pub' campaign - and hope the royal couple will lend it their support. Stanford Dingley is next door to Bucklebury, where the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge has been staying, while she recovers from a bout of severe morning sickness. Locals say they regularly see the royal couple arrive with their armed protection team for a quiet meal in the pub. Speaking ahead of the royal wedding in 2011, landlord Mr Haley said 'We’re used to seeing Kate in the pub. 'The first time she and William came in it was nerve-racking, but you soon realise they’re just a normal couple.' Under threat: The 300-year-old Old Boot Inn, a favourite haunt of the couple,  is at risk of closing . Popular: So loved is the Old Boot Inn by the couple, landlord John Haley was invited to the royal wedding in 2011 . Despite his royal clientele, Mr Haley now says he wants to convert the 300-year-old Grade Two listed building into a house. Residents opposing the idea say it would 'cause irrevocable damage to the unique character of this beautiful village' and they want West Berkshire Council planners to reject it. Mr Haley says the pub, which is still open, is no longer viable as a business. That claim has been questioned by some villagers, while Stanford Dingley Parish Council has taken the unusual step of calling for an independent review to assess the pub’s viability. A statement from the council says 'The closure of the Old Boot Inn would undoubtedly affect village life, and would prove a serious loss to many in the local community. 'The financial trading data on the Old Boot has been withheld from the Viability Report, and therefore it is impossible to conclude anything about the pub’s current viability, let alone its future prospects. Celebration: Locals are huge fans of the couple and regularly see them enjoying a quiet meal in the pub . Better: The Duchess has spent much of her time in Bucklebury while recovering from morning sickness . 'The review should involve discussions with members of the local community, and consider what investment might be required to sustain the pub in the future. 'Pending that review, our default position will be to oppose the change of use. We are also aware of what can be a very large differential between the value of the pub as a trading asset and its value as a residential dwelling.' Villager Paul Lemm said 'I object to this change of use application as I believe that the Boot is still viable as a pub. 'The Boot has been an essential part of this community for 300 years and should not be closed.' Close: The Duchess is very close to her parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, who live in the village . Simple pleasures: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are frequent visitors to the Old Boot Inn . Another resident, Andy MacKenzie, said 'The Old Boot Inn is a valuable village community asset and would be greatly missed. 'The pub is well used and famed for royal patronage. The pub is viable with all other pubs in the general area appearing to be thriving.' The pub was the second stop on The Kate Middleton Tour run by Hampshire-based coach travel firm Mortons to show people places where the Duchess has visited. Kensington Palace has been approached by the MailOnline for comment.","The Old Boot Inn in Stanford Dingley is a favourite of Kate and William .

"Louis van Gaal will be armed with a £6million-a-year salary and a £200million transfer budget to help him ‘make history’ as Manchester United’s new manager. The Holland coach’s appointment as David Moyes’ successor on a three-year deal was finally confirmed at 2pm on Monday, an hour after an internal email informed staff of the new managerial structure. In a move that could be viewed as paving the way for a possible succession, Ryan Giggs was installed as his assistant. Giggs immediately announced his retirement as a player to concentrate on his new role. VIDEO Scroll down for United target Toni Kroos' best Bundesliga goals .

The club still want to involve three other members of the Class of 92 - coaches Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes - but no clearly defined roles have been outlined to them as yet. Van Gaal will officially start work after the World Cup, but he has already begun shaping United’s fortunes for next season, by ordering a series of backroom departures and arrivals and drawing up a list of transfer targets. While Germany defenders Mats Hummels and Holger Badstuber, midfielders such as Toni Kroos and Arjen Robben and striker Mario Mandzukic are all under consideration, decisions have already been implemented on back-up staff. Goalkeeper coach Chris Woods, chief scout Robbie Cooke and analyst James Smith are among the notable casualties, while Van Gaal has decided against bringing Patrick Kluivert with him and will not be pursuing Danny Blind, who will be staying with the national team as assistant to Guus Hiddink. In addition to Giggs, Holland goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek and coach Marcel Bout, a specialist in opposition scouting, will join the backroom team. Though there are no plans to present the 62-year-old Van Gaal to the media, United released a reaction from their first-ever foreign manager that made it clear he was setting his sights high. 'It was always a wish for me to work in the Premier League,’ he said. ‘To work as a manager for Manchester United, the biggest club in the world, makes me very proud. 'I have managed in games at Old Trafford before and know what an incredible arena Old Trafford is and how passionate and knowledgeable the fans are. ‘This club has big ambitions. I too have big ambitions. Together I’m sure we will make history.’ Van Gaal can top up his basic salary with a hefty bonus for reaching the Champions League, and it was apparent from his demeanour that he intends cashing in at the earliest opportunity. Gunner-be? United could go back in for Barcelona star Cesc Fabregas, who is available for sale . Winged wonder: Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben is being considered by his national manager as a target . Targeted by United bosses in the immediate aftermath of Moyes’ sacking in April, the former Ajax, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar and Bayern Munich coach distanced himself from the chance to replace Tim Sherwood at Tottenham, once interest from Old Trafford became apparent. Kluivert had been the early frontrunner to assist him, but his fervent wish for a right-hand man with a deep knowledge and feel for United’s tradition and history tilted the balance Giggs’ way. After hanging up his boots to give his new coaching position his full attention, the 40-year old penned an open letter to United supporters, saying: 'I am immensely proud, honoured and fortunate to have represented the biggest club in the world 963 times. 'My dream was always to play for Manchester United, and though it saddens me to know I won’t be pulling on the United jersey again as a player, I have been lucky enough to fulfil that dream, playing with some of the best players in the world working under an incredible manager in Sir Alex Ferguson and, most of all, playing for the greatest fans in world football. In action: United also look set to reignite their long-standing interest in Toni Kroos . Acrobatic: Borussia Dortmund favourite Mats Hummels is being lined up for United's new-look defence . 'This is a fantastic day for Manchester United. Louis Van Gaal is a great appointment, and I am delighted to be working with someone of his calibre. He is a world-class coach and I know I will learn a lot about coaching from being able to observe and contribute at such close quarters. 'Manchester United has been a huge part of my life and I’m delighted to be able to continue that relationship in such a key role. His credentials are second to none, and I am positive the club will thrive under his leadership in the coming years.' United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said: 'In Louis van Gaal, we have secured the services of one of the outstanding managers in the game today. 'He has achieved many things in his career to date and Old Trafford provides him with a fitting stage on which to write new chapters in the Manchester United story. Right-hand man: But Patrick Kluivert will not be coming to Old Trafford with mentor Van Gaal . 'Everyone is very excited about this new phase in the club’s history. His track record of success in winning leagues and cups across Europe throughout his career makes him the perfect choice for us. 'People know him as a larger-than-life character but I have also been extremely impressed by his intelligence, thoughtful approach to the role and his diligence. I’m looking forward to working with him.' Club owners Joel and Avie Glazer are convinced Van Gaal is the right man for the job. Joel Glazer said: 'He has an outstanding pedigree as a coach, both as a man who motivates his teams to win trophies and as someone who believes in giving young players a chance to prove their worth. I am sure he will make a big impression on the club, the players and the fans.' Avie Glazer said: 'Louis joins us at an exciting time and has already communicated some great ideas for how the club can move forward. 'The board is right behind him in his plans and everyone here is already looking forward to the start of next season.'

"Manchester City will refuse to sell Yaya Toure to another English club, but Paris Saint-Germain are favourites to land the midfielder if he manages to engineer a move away. The 31-year-old's future at the Etihad Stadium is in doubt after a farcical episode on Tuesday where his agent, Dimitry Seluk, insisted he wanted out after being treated like a 'nobody'. Toure went on to back up his representative's claims and may leave the Premier League champions this summer.

Having a look: Laurent Blanc's PSG are favourites to sign Toure if he does leave the Etihad Stadium . The bizarre standoff derives from the Ivorian's birthday last week, where Seluk claims he wasn't handed a celebratory cake. Toure was in fact given two. City have kept their counsel up until . now and will block any attempt to lever a move but Toure himself has . confirmed that he wants out. Sportsmail understands that Manchester United and Chelsea - the only domestic clubs to have the financial clout to prise him away - would think twice before making an offer given Tuesday's soap opera, while City would block any move regardless. But - if tensions do not dissipate - the club may have to cash in, particularly given the player's age. The fact . that Toure is coming towards his twilight years would not deter Laurent .

"Paul Scholes wants England manager Roy Hodgson to throw caution to the wind at the World Cup finals and adopt Liverpool’s cavalier style. The Manchester United legend believes Hodgson should pick up to five players from his Anfield contingent to avoid a repeat of the turgid performances England produced under Fabio Capello in South Africa four years ago. Liverpool lost out to Manchester City in the Premier League title race on the last day of the season but were widely praised for their attacking style.

Going from strength to strength: Daniel Sturridge will lead the line for England as he does for Liverpool .

Former star: Scholes played 67 times for England between 1997 and 2004, scoring 14 goals including this one against Croatia at Euro 2004 . Former United and England midfielder . Scholes, who went to two World Cups, said: ‘It would be refreshing for . England to adopt Liverpool’s attacking mentality in Brazil. Really go . for it. That means certainly four and possibly five Liverpool players . starting against Italy on June 14. ‘South Africa in 2010 was so . negative, with boring draws. Nothing seemed to happen. England fans, and . myself as an England fan, would rather three-all games than dull 0-0 . draws. I’d love to see Roy be brave enough to play like Liverpool. The . thing I admired most was the swagger of their play and how they . terrorised opponents.

Johnson is a touch better going forward, but it’s a tight . call. ‘Henderson is a diamond of a lad who’s best described as . workmanlike. He’s a player others appreciate having around them on the . pitch. He’ll sacrifice himself for the attacking talent.’ Mistake: Scholes says Roy Hodgson was wrong not to pick Michael Carrick . Driving force: Scholes says England have made a mistake not choosing Michael Carrick (left), who has instead been going to events such as the Monaco Grand Prix and meeting the likes of Sebastian Vettel . However, . Scholes fears Hodgson may have blundered by not including his old United . team-mate Michael Carrick in the squad to play the ‘quarterback’ role . if Gerrard suffers an injury. ‘Not bringing Michael Carrick is a . mistake,’ he said. ‘If there’s an injury to Gerrard nobody jumps out to . replace him.

"As its 75th anniversary approaches, 'Gone With the Wind' is again being celebrated as a timeless movie classic. But now, even the film's distributor acknowledges the Civil War epic's portrayal of slavery is dated and inaccurate. 'Gone With the Wind' will be screened this weekend in 650 theaters nationwide, broadcast Monday by Turner Classic Movies and reissued Tuesday in a lavish home-video box set, including a music box, an embroidered handkerchief and more than 8 hours of bonus features. To produce something new for yet another 'GWTW' box set, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment brought in filmmaker and historian Gary Leva. As its 75th anniversary approaches, 'Gone With the Wind' is again being celebrated as a timeless movie classic even as the film's distributor acknowledges the Civil War epic's portrayal of slavery is dated and inaccurate . A documentary 'Old South/New South' drew a surprisingly frank conclusion for a studio-commissioned commemorative project . `There's been a ton of stuff about the making of the film,'' Leva recalls the studio telling him. ''Can you give us a deeper look at how the movie portrays the Civil War?'' Leva responded with the 30-minute documentary 'Old South/New South,' which drew a surprisingly frank conclusion for a studio-commissioned commemorative project: One of the world's all-time great films also has great shortcomings. In the documentary, which is included in the box sets out Tuesday, historians discuss how the film has perpetuated mythology dubbed 'The Lost Cause,' which proposes Southern involvement in the Civil War was solely for noble reasons, including defense of states' rights. In the documentary, which is included in the box sets out Tuesday, historians discuss how the film has perpetuated mythology dubbed 'The Lost Cause,' which proposes Southern involvement in the Civil War was solely for noble reasons, including defense of states' rights . 'But when you get right down to it, what state right are you talking about?' asks University of North Carolina history professor David Goldfield in the Leva film. 'You're talking about the right of individuals to own slaves.' Based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-seller, ""Gone With the Wind"" is fiction, about a spoiled Old South socialite, Scarlett O'Hara. But the real-life war that serves as her story's backdrop looms too large in the film for many to overlook. Based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-seller, ""Gone With the Wind"" is fiction, about a spoiled Old South socialite, Scarlett O'Hara and her struggle to survive the Civil War . Historians discuss how the film has perpetuated mythology dubbed 'The Lost Cause,' which proposes Southern involvement in the Civil War was solely for noble reasons, including defense of states' rights . '(Slavery) is such a component of the movie, and the characters who you are rooting for are oblivious,' noted film critic and TCM host Ben Mankiewicz. Actress Hattie McDaniel, who played Scarlett's devoted nanny Mammy, a slave, became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award. Nevertheless, the film's portrayal of black characters has been criticized ever since the world premiere in Atlanta on Dec. 13, 1939. '(Slavery) is such a component of the movie, and the characters who you are rooting for are oblivious,' noted film critic and TCM host Ben Mankiewicz . ""In `Gone With the Wind,' slavery is portrayed in the most benevolent terms,"" Leva said. ""Characters like Mammy are looked at like family members. And there's no hint at any sort of wrongdoing - the slave masters do nothing in the film that seems inappropriate."" At least the movie got one thing right: Tomorrow is, indeed, another day; Hollywood is finally offering a grittier, more honest view of slavery in films such as ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Django Unchained."" ""Compare `Gone With the Wind' and `Django' - very different films about the same period of time, with a lot of the same imagery, dealt with in very different ways,"" observed actress Kerry Washington. Nevertheless, the film's portrayal of black characters has been criticized ever since the world premiere in Atlanta on Dec. 13, 1939 . The ""Scandal"" star is one of the leads in 2012's ""Django,"" Quentin Tarantino's violent pre-Civil War saga, which includes such scenes as an owner forcing his slaves into gruesome death matches.Washington said the final scene in ""Django,"" a plantation in flames, is a direct reference to ""Gone With the Wind."" But she added 'GWTW' 'has a really important place in the history of filmmaking, and in the history of African-Americans at the Oscars, in the history of messaging and how we portray history. And all of that is worth talking about.' Leva, a Texan who said he considers himself a Southerner, acknowledged he's conflicted over 'Gone With the Wind.' 'For me, as a film, just looking at it cinematically, it is a masterpiece,' said Leva. 'But politically? ... If you were to do the film today, you wouldn't make the film nearly as romantic. You'd make the film much grittier. And you could show, I think, in a balanced way, that some Southern slave owners were, perhaps, kind human beings, and some of them were brutal.' Today Hollywood is finally offering a grittier, more honest view of slavery in films such as '12 Years a Slave' and 'Django Unchained' And that's precisely what director Steve McQueen did with this year's best picture Oscar-winner, '12 Years a Slave.' 'The fact that the 75th anniversary of `Gone With the Wind' comes in the same year that `12 Years a Slave' wins - it makes it, for a change, a little bit simple,"" Mankiewicz said. ""Like, `Look what kind of progress we've made?' And if somebody has, what, 6 1/2 hours to view both? That's a pretty good way to get a little cross-section of studying America and studying Hollywood simultaneously."" So what is McQueen's take on 'Gone With the Wind'? 'I haven't seen it,' he said.","Classic film will be screened at 650 theaters nationwide this weekend .
Lavish new home-video box set set to be released along with a broadcast Monday on Turner Classic Movies .
Producers admit that despite the film's other artistic merits its treatment of slavery is as best dated and inaccurate and at worst offensive and revisionist ."
"It took Real Madrid just five short, glittering years to win their fifth European Cup. The next five are taking rather longer. As they face their noisy neighbours, Atletico, in Lisbon this weekend it will be more than half a century since they wrapped up their monopoly of the first five editions of club football’s most glorious championship. Yet the impact of the grey evening of May 18, 1960 in Glasgow remains Technicolor vivid in the minds of those of us who looked on in wonder. Full house: Real Madrid's Luis Del Sol goes past Frankfurt defender Hans Weilbacher at Hampden in 1960 . It stays with us as the tantalising pinnacle to which all others – from Cruyff, Beckenbauer and Maldini, to Best, Charlton and Keane, to Keegan, Gerrard, and Lampard and now Messi, Ronaldo and Bale must aspire. A year after the day the music died in Buddy Holly’s plane crash, our impressionable generation of teenagers saw the magic come to life. So amazingly did Real Madrid revolutionise our understanding of the greatest game that it was if aliens had landed in Britain. For Men In Black, read men in white. After Real Madrid 7-3 Eintracht Frankfurt football would never be the same again. Not now our eyes had been opened to Alfredo di Stefano, Ferenc Puskas, Francisco Gento et al in their brillilance. The largest crowd ever to attend one of these Finals – almost 135,000 – were joined in awe by a television audience of some 70 million, myself included. The Continent of Europe was already enchanted by Real but this was the match which turned the shimmering, distant myth into reality for this, the birthplace of football. It also elevated to its plinth the tournament which was to expand into the Champions League. There had been stirrings of our imagination six years earlier when Puskas led Hungary on a six-goal invasion of England’s Fortress Wembley. The Galloping Major returned, to Scotland, to astound us again by scoring four of Real’s seven goals. Yet even that feat was surpassed on the night. World's greatest: Alfredo di Stefano was outstanding in the 1960 European Cup final . 1956 - Beat Stade Reims 4-3 at Parcs des Princes, Paris . 1957 - Beat Fiorentina 2-0 at Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid . 1958 - Beat AC Milan 3-2 at Heysel Stadium, Brussels . 1959 - Beat Stade Reims 2-0 at Neckarstadion, Stuttgart . 1960 - Beat Eintracht Franfurt 7-3 at Hampden Park, Glasgow . 1966 - Beat Partizan Belgrade 2-1 at Heysel Stadium, Brussels . 1998 - Beat Juventus 1-0 at Amsterdam Arena, Amsterdam . 2000 - Beat Valencia 3-0 at Stade de France, Paris . 2002 - Beat Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 at Hampden Park, Glasgow . A certain Di Stefano not only scored a hat-trick, also, but orchestrated the play with the imperious command of Von Karajan conducting at the rostrum. Here was Pele’s predecessor, the first world’s greatest footballer. Nor were the Germans he bewitched and bamboozled mere cannon fodder. Eintracht had put 12 past the substantial Glasgow Rangers team of the time over the two legs of their semi-final. They also took the lead against Real, in the 18th minute. Not that it lasted long. Di Stefano equalised nine minutes later and by the time Frankfurt scored their second, in the 72nd minute, they were 7-1 down. Fantasy football had been born of human genius. The wonder of the European Cup swept across the Channel and seven years later, in the same Stadium of Light to which Portugal’s World Cup hope Ronaldo returns now with Real, Celtic shocked Inter Milan to become Britain’s first winners. Seventh heaven: Di Stefano nets another in the famous rout . Even their own fans were so stunned . and so aware of being part of history that some just stayed on to live . in Portugal, working as builders, or even opening bars in and around . Lisbon. They all celebrated . as if there was no tomorrow, one so copiously that after being herded . onto the plane home with others wearing the green and white he woke up . upon landing in Glasgow to exclaim: ‘But my car’s outside the stadium.’ Another year on and Manchester United completed their rise from the ashes of the Munich air disaster to beat Benfica at Wembley. Bobby Charlton scored twice, then wept for the other Busby Babes who had perished. George Best romped away for one of the others to confirm that the Fifth Beatle was a big hit. Those finals were British epics, as was the Miracle on the Bosphorous when Liverpool staged the mother of all comebacks to shell-shock AC Milan. Comeback kings: Jamie Carragher (left) and Steven Gerrard celebrate Liverpool's 2005 Champions League triumph . Those clubs, those finals, those stars are legends. But it is Real Madrid who wear the crown. And it is Di Stefano who remains the most dazzling of its jewels, still one of the five greatest footballers of all time. Over to you, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale… . I defer to no-one in my admiration of Arsene Wenger and the stylish football which he refuses to compromise. But Arsenal’s celebrations at winning the FA Cup were so excessive that they spoke of desperation, not redemption. This, lest we forget, is a competition in which Wenger used to field a few reserves when the Gunners were winning the one that really mattered to them, the Premier League, and challenging for the one he still wants most of all, the Champions League. Up for the Cup: Arsenal celebrated wildly after they won their first trophy for nine years . After nine barren years it was high time Arsenal won something. But while the players and the fans were dancing in the streets last weekend, more sober judgement needs to be passed on where they stand today. At no time since Christmas did Arsenal look capable of winning the English title. The crown of  Europe was always beyond them and for a worrying time it seemed they might not re-qualify for that next season. And they made incredibly hard work of beating Hull City at Wembley. If that laborious victory has clinched a renewed contract for Wenger, it is no less than he deserves for his half-a-working lifetime’s body of work with Arsenal. Master of the art: Wenger has stayed true to his principles throughout his career . Yet his current team continues to look lightweight compared with his Invinvicbles of yore. So it is difficult to escape the feeling that the directors may be extending his term – and giving him the money to spend on new players – partly because top-class successors are so difficult to identify. Think Manchester United, David Moyes – and Louis van Gaal yet to manage in England. Think Roman Abramovic having to swallow hard and bring Jose Mourinho back to Chelsea when most else failed. But think, also, of the queue to grab Wenger if he were to leave north London. Perhaps what both he and Arsenal are really in need of is - a change. England manager Roy Hodgson opines that, given time, he could organise a pub team to put the blocks on Manchester United, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie included. Why not? Sir Alf Ramsey won England’s only World Cup with some lads from the local. Although, admittedly, he had some world class players in that Bobby Moore class of ’66 several were partial to a drink. And it was not unknown for them to slip out for a quickie on the night before a big match. 1966 and all that: Sir Alf Ramsey celebrates winning the World Cup with Bobby Moore and Nobby Stiles . Mind you I would have wished either of these fine managers luck trying to do anything with my old pub team in which, as a midfield clogger, I often had to play as a 5ft 7½in makeshift centre half. That said, perhaps Hodgson could do worse than take Stevie Gerrard and the lads out for few caiprinhas in Brazil before they play Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica.","Real won the first five European Cups, from 1956-60 .

"A part of a Thomas Cook aeroplane that 'fell off' shortly after departing Gatwick Airport has been recovered. The emergency escape slide was found in the village of Langton Green, Kent, and has been passed on to Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) by Kent Police. The Egypt-bound Thomas Cook aircraft with 237 passengers on board had to turn back and land at Gatwick Airport on Friday when the slide came off. Gatwick Airport (pictured) where the plane was forced to return. None of the planes in this picture were involved in the incident . A vicar found a metal object in the grounds of All Saints' Church, but Thomas Cook are refusing to say if this is linked to the emergency escape slide . Staff noticed the fault over Belgium, but the piece was believed to have fallen off not long after take-off from the West Sussex airport. The vicar at All Saints' Church in Langton Green found an 'unusual' 2ft piece of metal found in a churchyard, but Thomas Cook has not commented on whether this is linked to the escape slide. A spokesperson for Thomas Cook Airlines said: 'We are aware that the slide has now been located near Tunbridge Wells and we are working with the AAIB and local police to ensure that it is retrieved and made available to the investigation team', said a spokesperson for Thomas Cook Airlines. 'We are not able to comment further on the identity of the piece of metal found in the village.' Kent Police said officers picked up the item and handed it to investigators at the Civil Aviation Authority for it to be verified. A Thomas Cook Boeing 757 (pictured) takes flight. The airline have not yet revealed what kind of plane was involved in Friday's incident, which saw a flight forced to return to Gatwick after a part fell off . Rev Michael Gentry said: 'It was an unusual piece of metal, around 2ft long, so it may have been part of it. 'It was right by the gates, so it may have fallen in the road and someone placed it there out of the way. It had had an impact with something. Nothing was damaged in the churchyard.' The passenger jet TCX1638 left Gatwick Airport on Friday morning bound for Hurghada with 237 passengers on board. The AAIB is investigating the incident and Thomas Cook also said it had begun a full investigation. None of the passengers were injured. A Thomas Cook Airlines statement said: 'We can confirm that flight TCX1638, from Gatwick to Hurghada, returned to the airport after a short time into the flight after a fault was reported with an over wing slide. 'Whilst airborne, the slide unit has fallen from the aircraft and we are aware that local police have been informed. 'The aircraft landed safely at Gatwick Airport and we are now immediately undertaking a full investigation and working with the airline authorities. 'We'd like to apologise to our customers for the delay to their flight.' Passengers departed on a replacement flight that afternoon. The airline has not yet revealed what kind of plane was involved in the incident. A Gatwick Airport spokesman said on Friday: 'We can confirm that Thomas Cook flight TCX1638 returned to London Gatwick earlier this morning due to an issue with the aircraft. 'Passengers have now disembarked and are being helped by staff while the issue is investigated.' The AAIB confirmed: 'The AAIB has deployed a team to London Gatwick Airport to investigate an incident to an airliner.'","Flight left Gatwick Airport at 9am on Friday with 237 passengers on board .

"The Glazer family were welcomed at Manchester United by burning effigies and mass fan protest. But that has not stopped them largely overseeing a spell of success on the pitch at Old Trafford until last season's setback. David Moyes endured a nightmare 10 months before being sacked in April but, with serial winner Louis van Gaal now installed as replacement, United have one of Europe's most respected managers at the helm as they bid to recapture the glory days of Sir Alex Ferguson's time. Executive vice chairman Ed Woodward has vowed to help get the club back on track after last season's seventh place finish, with Van Gaal expected to revitalise an ageing squad by spending big this summer. After the passing of Malcolm Glazer on Wednesday and with another new era about to begin, Sportsmail takes you through the nine years since the Americans completed their takeover. Family matters: Kevin, Avram and Joel Glazer are pictured at Old Trafford last year . CONTROVERSIAL TAKEOVER . The Glazer family, led by father Malcolm, began their pursuit of United in 2003 and completed a £790million takeover in May 2005. But it was met with huge opposition from fans and the deal went through to the backdrop of supporter protests after debt used to buy the club was put back on its balance sheet in what is known as a leveraged buyout. Around 2,000 fans swarmed around Old Trafford when the news was announced, burning effigies of Glazer Snr and season ticket forms, holding placards saying 'Not for $al£' and there was even a sit-down protest, blocking a main road to the stadium. Unpopular: Manchester United fans hung an anti-Glazer banner as part of their green and gold protests of 2010 . Frustrated: United fans protest at the Glazers' ownership after the club was burdened with a large debt . Five men were arrested and two were charged with public order offences. A fan pressure group, Shareholders United, was set up a year previously in an attempt to block the Glazer family takeover. Chairman Nick Towle said at the time: 'I am very sad - I still love the club but I refuse to put a penny into the company. And I believe as many as 20,000 fans may also leave Man United.' Their attempts were futile and disaffected fans set up a new club FC United of Manchester, now in the seventh tier of English football. Opinionated: Fans hold a 'Hate Glazer, Love United' banner ahead of a Champions League clash with Debrecen in 2005 . RUNNING OF THE CLUB . In April 2006, only a year after the purchase was complete, Malcolm Glazer suffered a stroke and the day-to-day running of the club was handed to two of his sons, Joel and Avram. Glazer Snr never visited Old Trafford once to watch the side in the entire time his family have been in charge. He had virtually nothing to do with running the club since the very beginning, and his six children – Joel, Avram, Bryan, Kevin, Edward and Darcie Glazer-Kassewitz – have had ownership of the family's 90 per cent stake of club, with the other 10 per cent listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Staying away: Malcolm Glazer, who passed away aged 85 on Wednesday, never visited Old Trafford for a game . SUCCESS ON THE FIELD . Despite the family's unpopularity, space on the shelf in the United trophy cabinet has been steadily running out. In the nine years since they have been at the helm, the club have won 10 major trophies. Five League titles – including three in a row between 2006 and 2009 – a Champions League, three League Cups and the Club World Cup. Champions: Sir Alex Ferguson lifts the Premier League trophy in 2013 before retiring from management . Until last season's disastrous spell under Moyes, when they ended the season in seventh, they have not finished outside the top two in the Glazers' tenure, coming second the other three times. The first campaign under their ownership was slow. United crashed out of the Champions League in the first round, bottom of their group. They came second in the Barclays Premier League, but didn't end the season empty-handed, picking up the League Cup. Their first league win came in the second season, and they also got to the semi-final of the Champions League and were runners up in the FA Cup. Two trophies followed the next season, in 2007-08. They won back-to-back league titles and Champions League. Kings of Europe: United won their second Champions League title with a penalty shootout victory against Chelsea in Moscow in 2008 . More followed the next year in one of the most competitive campaigns in the club's history, fighting for silverware on seven fronts. They won a third successive league title, the League Cup and Club World Cup, they were runners up in the Champions League and Super Cup, and were FA Cup semi-finalists. In the next four seasons United won the league twice and the League Cup, before Moyes took charge. THE TRANSFERS . The then world record sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80million in July 2009 is the most notable transfer in the Glazer family reign. But when it comes to transfers they have hardly been the guy who miraculously can't find his wallet when it's their round. United famously pinched Robin van Persie from rivals Arsenal for £24m in 2012. Dimitar Berbatov came for £30.75m in 2008 and left for £5m four years later. Exit: United sold Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for a then world record of fee of £80million in 2009 . That was a club record until the purchase of Juan Mata from Chelsea for £37.1m in January, while they also shelled out £27.5m for Marouane Fellaini last season. They have welcomed Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra, Edwin van Der Sar and David de Gea. Michael Owen, long-admired by Sir Alex Ferguson, joined the club, although he continued the lacklustre end to his career. The infamous Bebe was brought in for £7.4m in 2010 and is somehow still a United player. Bar the sale of Ronaldo, the Glazers have not been known to let their best players be taken by domestic and european rivals. Big buy: The Glazers financed Robin van Persie's £24million move from Arsenal to Old Trafford in 2012 . Ageing stars Roy Keane, admittedly a shock departure in 2005, Phil Neville and Ruud van Nistelrooy were allowed to go. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes all retired. Scholes even came back and retired again. One oversight was allowing Gerard Pique to leave for Barcelona, where he has since gone on to become one of the world's best defenders. Carlos Tevez joined the club on loan in 2007 but left to controversially sign for local rivals Manchester City two years later. Big mistake: United allowed Gerard Pique to return to Barcelona for just £4million in 2008 . MANAGERIAL MISTAKE . Perhaps the biggest error of the Glazers' ownership has been to allow Ferguson to appoint his own successor. Although it is understandable why they put faith in the greatest manager in the game's history to have a keen eye for who should follow him. Moyes's 10 months in charge were nothing short of catastrophic. Nightmare: David Moyes was sacked in April after a disastrous first season in charge at United . It is unlikely he would boast about it, but the Scot did win the Community Shield in his first competitive fixture in charge. But exits in the quarter-final of the Champions League, semi-final of the League Cup and third round of the FA Cup and struggling even to make the Europa League proved too much for the Glazers to take. United are not exactly sinking yet, but they have certainly taken on some heavy water and the American owners will be hoping that tough taskmaster Van Gaal will be able to steady the ship.

"Mayor Alan Long, of Murrietta, California, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influece . The mayor of a California city was driving under the influence when he rear-ended a car and injured four cheerleaders, police said. Murrieta Mayor Alan Long, who was arrested on suspicion of DUI, was released Friday on $50,000 bail. Long, who is also a battalion chief with the Anaheim Fire Department, failed a field sobriety test Thursday, but passed a breathalyzer test. Police are awaiting blood test results, according to police Lt. Julie Hoxmeier. Long, 44, plowed into the back of the car carrying Murrieta Valley High School cheerleaders from a pep rally while it was stopped at a light, police said. The girls, ranging in age from 14 to 17, were taken to the hospital with moderate to major injuries. Andrea Williams and sisters Camille and Chloe Rogers were treated and released, KGTV reported. A fourth cheerleader, Melissa Reynolds, remains in the hospital. Mayor Long's attorney says he was going at 25mph when he rear-ended a car and injured four cheerleaders . Long will remain on duty with the Anaheim Fire Department as the investigation proceeds, said Lt. Bob Dunn, an Anaheim police spokesman. The mayor made national news in July when he encouraged residents to oppose a federal government plan to process Central American immigrants at the U.S. Border Patrol facility in Murrieta. Buses transporting the immigrants to the facility were forced to turn around when protesters blocked the road. Long's attorney , Virginia Blumental, says the mayor 'extends his sincere apologies,' the Riverside Press-Enterprise reported. 'Mr. Long has never been arrested before and has never been at fault in an accident,' Blumenthal said in a statement to the paper. 'It is my firm belief that while there has been an accident, there was no crime committed.' Long is running for a second-term in the November 4 election. The attorney, who says Long was traveling at 25mph at the time of the crash, said the mayor helped the victims at the scene and spoke to their parents after, according to the Press-Enterprise. 'No special favors were extended to the Murrieta Mayor by the city’s police department, and the mayor did not request any special favors in the handling of his case,' Blumenthal said in a statement. 'The police did their jobs as Mr. Long would expect them to do.' Long did not immediately return an email seeking comment. Calls to his office rang unanswered.","Mayor Alan Long, of Murrieta, was arrested on suspicion of DUI .

"I was walking down the corridor of The Grove, one of the nicest hotels I’ve ever been in, looking for my room. Across my arms I had some England training kit, I was a bit like the Gavin and Stacey character Smithy played by James Corden in that Comic Relief sketch when he stumbles upon the England squad. The important difference was that I was actually in the England squad. The painter and decorator from Bexleyheath had hit the big time. VIDEO Scroll down for Jimmy Bullard reveals his best pranks and wind-ups to Sportsmail . Called up: Jimmy Bullard with England team-mate David Beckham on international duty . I walked up and down the corridor, 292, 294 . . . aha, got it! Room 296. The temporary abode of England footballer Jimmy Bullard. I wiggled my key card into the door and turned the handle, but nothing happened. So I did it again. And again. And again. If I had to go back to reception carrying all this gear because I can’t get into my room, they’d probably throw me out for being too blinking thick. I gave it another go and, as I wiggled the card in the slot, I heard someone coming down the corridor — hopefully a member of hotel staff who could get me into my room. I couldn’t make out who it was from a distance, although they were also carrying gear so it must be another player. The figure finally emerged from the shadows of the corridor and my heart skipped a beat when I realised it was David Beckham. Goldenballs! He was going to think I was a right spanner. ‘I’ve heard about you,’ said Becks as he got close enough for me to hear him. ‘I suppose that’s my room, is it?’ ‘Naah, no, no . . . ’ I replied, but before I could say any more Becks looked up at the door number and down to the envelope for his key card and said: ‘It is my room!’ I looked at my envelope and saw that it said 269, not 296.

Heartbreak: But Bullard, training here with Wayne Rooney, never got on the pitch to win a Three Lions cap . BEND IT LIKE BULLARD by Jimmy Bullard is published by Headline Publishing Group at £16.99. What a . total donut. To make matters worse, I immediately felt guilty for no . reason. ‘I know you think I was going to do something in there, but I . wasn’t, honestly,’ I kind of pleaded. Becks grinned at me and replied: ‘Go on, hop it you!’ I was so embarrassed, completely mortified. As I went off towards my room I kept thinking: ‘He’s never going to believe that I wasn’t trying to pull some kind of prank.’ Becks and I had a little bit of previous which would certainly have raised his suspicions. It all stemmed back to a pre-season trip I’d been on with Fulham a  couple of years before. We were staying in the same plush hotel as Real Madrid, who Becks was playing for, and we were playing them in a friendly. For the entire six days I put everything - a round of golf, some golfing gloves, buggies for a few of the players, I even treated myself to a new Vokey wedge and lots of drinks - on our gaffer Chris Coleman’s room. I’d clocked his room number when we checked in. Room 206. I hadn’t been there long but I thought: ‘This will be a classic.’ Later, we were all in the bar and so were a few of the Madrid lads, including Becks and Raul. ‘Right lads, what are you all drinking?’ I said as I proceeded to order one of the most enormous rounds of drinks in history. Feeling . pleased with myself, I called Becks over for a chat, although my . team-mates were reluctant as if they were somehow scared of him. Pinpoint precision: Bullard was called up on three occasions following his displays for Fulham . Magic moment: Bullard celebrates avoiding relegation with Fulham team-mate Danny Murphy in 2008 . But they were soon back when I asked about the rumours that he’d had an affair with the Beckhams’ former nanny Rebecca Loos. ‘What’s happening with Loosy and all that then?’ I said to him. ‘Come on, open up!’ He started to laugh. ‘To be honest, she fancied Victoria, not me!’ was his reply. We all started to laugh. ‘That’s a great “Get Out of Jail Free” card, that is, Becks,’ I said. ‘Don’t give me that, what’s the true story?’ But he told us he was being serious. We laughed even more.

"From Victoria Beckham adding bee pollen to her daily smoothies to Miranda Kerr crediting noni juice for her flawless complexion, superfoods are the hippest way to stay healthy. According to the British Dietetic Association (BDA), 61 per cent of people have purchased a food just because it had been labelled a ‘superfood’ - M&S has even introduced a chia seed range - including bread and pitta – containing the ingredient to meet the rising demand. So popular are superfoods that Europe's first-ever bar dedicated to superfood cocktails has opened its doors and the new range of tasty tipples may even hinder a hangover. Scroll down for video .

One of her most popular requests is a drink called 'what the doctor ordered': a combination of vodka, lemon, beets, carrot, sweet potato, raw honey, ginger, lavender bitter and chia seeds. Originally found in Mexico, the tiny seeds have been dubbed ‘the running food’ and hailed as the ‘ultimate superfood’ by athletes and health advocates. They contain a wealth of antioxidants and minerals such as calcium and have higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than salmon. Omega-3 has been shown to help protect against a range of illnesses including heart disease and dementia. The seeds are also thought to help dieters as they contain few calories but are high in protein, making people feel full. And now, bartenders are claiming they may well help your hangover too. Green living: At Tanya's, you can get your morning green juice, which is cold pressed and organic or a pour over coffee with hazelnut milk, a plant-based burger and raw chocolate cake for lunch, then come evening you could share a vibrant cashew cheese platter and superfood packed cocktails - she even uses edible stinging nettles and plants to decorate her meals .

"Liverpool are on the brink of signing Rickie Lambert after they launched a shock £4million bid for the England striker. Brendan Rodgers is determined to add depth to his squad but the move for boyhood Reds fan  Lambert has come from left field. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lambert shoulder charging rugby pads in England training . Brazil bound: Lambert is currently training with England ahead of the World Cup next month . The 32-year-old is . with the England squad preparing for Friday's game with Peru, but he is . expected to be allowed to travel to Liverpool on Saturday for a medical . and the switch from Southampton could be completed early next week. The . initial £4m fee will rise according to the appearances he makes. Lambert, . who began his career at Liverpool’s academy, will be the first major . arrival in what is expected to be a busy summer for the club. He could . even be followed by two of his  team-mates from Southampton, as . Liverpool are still negotiating for £30m-rated Adam Lallana and have . also targeted Dejan Lovren to bolster their defence. Odds on: A flurry of bets had been placed on Rickie Lambert joining Liverpool on Thursday . Appearances/Goals . 1998–2000 Blackpool                 3           0 . 2001–2002 Macclesfield Town    44           8 . 2002–2005 Stockport County  98           18 . 2005–2006 Rochdale                 64           28 . 2006–2009 Bristol Rovers      128          51 . 2009–         Southampton          207         106 . They have also bid £16million for Sevilla left-back Alberto . Moreno and could send Spanish midfielder Suso in the opposite direction to . complete that deal, as Rodgers looks to bring in the numbers they will need to . cope with competing in the Barclays Premier League and the Champions League. Moreno, who has been watched by both Manchester clubs, is . Liverpool's number one target to strength a position that has given Rodgers . problems in the last 12 months. Lallana's move has been held up by the fact Bournemouth are . owed a 25 per cent sell-on fee and Liverpool have Bayern Munich's Xherdan . Shaqiri as alternative. Emre Can, the Germany Under-21 international, is another . target and Liverpool remain in talks with him over a £12million move from Bayer . Leverkusen. Ambition: Lambert will be the first major arrival in what is expected to be a busy period for Liverpool . On the move: Southampton striker Rickie Lambert is on the brink of a £4million move to Liverpool . Happy days: Rickie's sister Melanie revealed family joy although the tweet was no longer available later . Yet it is the deal for Lambert – who was released by . Liverpool when he was 15 famously worked in a beetroot factory – that has come . as such surprise but Rodgers has always been a fan. 'I think Rickie is a terrific player,' said Rodgers last . September before Liverpool faced Southampton at Anfield. 'I sent him a message, . a fax, when he made his England debut (against Scotland) as I know he is a big . Red. I sent it on behalf of the club and all Kopites. 'He is a Kirkby boy and I was just wishing him well, saying . we were all proud of him playing for England.' Target: Liverpool are still in talks with Southampton for £30million-rated Adam Lallana . Rodgers added: 'People look back now and say it was a . mistake (to let Lambert go), but there may have been something at the time that . was a factor. 'He just might not have been ready for what Liverpool was at . that time, but there is absolutely no doubt within development it cannot just . be about what the player is now. With young talent you always have to look at . what they could be. 'You see so many young British players who are thrown to the . garbage because maybe they are not strong or they are not quick when they are . going through growth spurts. The emphasis at younger ages should be technique. But I have been a big admirer of Rickie.' Interest: Liverpool have also bid £16million for Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno (right) Lambert worked for four months in a factory putting lids on beetroot jars when he was released by Blackpool in 2000 before going on to play for Macclesfield and Stockport. His incredible rise to fame began when Rochdale boss Steve Parkin moved him from midfield. Parkin recalled: 'I took him from Stockport for not much and shoved him straight up front. Career move: Lambert's incredible rise happened after he was shoved up front at Rochdale . 'First and foremost he was a big lad. I noticed he had a terrific shot and he was good in the air, either playing off someone or being a target man. 'I didn't think he'd come good in midfield, but he had exceptional touch and ability. He can see a move two or three passes before it happens so he's always one step ahead. He always had the ability to play up front but his midfield mindset makes him good at dropping off.' Lambert, aged 23 at the time, forged a formidable partnership with Grant Holt and they scored 27 goals in 24 matches before Holt was poached by Nottingham  Forest. But it got Lambert noticed, too, by Bristol Rovers director of football Lennie Lawrence. After one season he moved there for £200,000. Hitman: Lambert continued his fine form at Bristol Rovers, scoring one in every two games . 'It took four months to get him fit,' said Lawrence, now assistant manager at Bolton. 'He had all sorts of different little ailments, minor things. After we got him fit - boom. 'We always knew he could score. He strikes the ball so powerfully and he knows how to use his body, he's a clever player. He's a great lad. Unassuming, terrific, never arrogant. Just a bloody good lad and very popular.' Southampton signed him for £1million in 2009 and he has been top scorer every season since.","Lambert expected to undergo medical on Saturday before joining back up with England to fly to America .

"Gareth Bale has been 'like a kid at Christmas' at training this week according to Zinedine Zidane ahead of Real Madrid's Champions League final against arch-rivals Atletico on Saturday. Bale joined the nine-time European champions for a world record Â£86million from Premier League outfit Tottenham in September and is on the verge of achieving a dream double with his new side after having already won the Copa del Rey in April. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bale say Real will be ready for the final . Excited: Zinedine Zidane says Gareth Bale is 'like a kid at Christmas' ahead of Real's Champions League Final . The 24-year-old Wales midfielder has impressed Real and France legend Zidane with his enthusiasm ahead of the Lisbon showpiece, at Benfica's Stadium of Light, at a time when the beautiful game is shrouded by money. 'So much talk of modern football is about wages, and contracts, and transfer fees - that the raw love of the game is forgotten,' he said. 'You only have to come and see Gareth (Bale) in training this week - and you will see just pure love for the game - he is like a child waiting for Christmas in the build up to the final. The entire club is excited - but Gareth is new to all this and the anticipation is big for him.' Looking ahead to the all-Madrid final, Real coach Zidane added that the Bernabeu outfit are under no illusions of how difficult the task will be on Saturday as they look to win the much-fabled La Decima against the La Liga champions. 'It will be a tough game - anybody who has seen Atletico plays this season knows what a strong team they are,' he added.

"They are arguably our best-loved comedy characters, so casting Captain Mainwaring and co was always going to be something of a minefield. But the stars charged with the task of bringing Dad’s Army to life have now been announced – with one notable addition. Although the original TV series featured no women in leading roles, actress Catherine Zeta-Jones has been lined up to play a glamorous journalist in the new film. Hunger Games star Toby Jones will take on the role of Captain Mainwaring, originally played by Arthur Lowe . Blake Harrison, of Inbetweeners fame, will play the gormless Private Pike, a role brought to TV by Ian Lavender . The remake will begin shooting this month in Yorkshire and has been picked up by Universal Pictures, which means that it will be distributed worldwide. Toby Jones – who appeared in The Hunger Games – will play Captain Mainwaring, with Love Actually star Bill Nighy taking on the role of Sergeant Wilson. Starring alongside them will be Michael Gambon as the frail medic Godfrey, Tom Courtenay as Jones and Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison – who will play Private Pike. Michael Gambon is to step into the shoes of Arnold Ridley as Godfrey in the new film of the classic TV series . Bill Nighy will reprise the role of Wilson, which John Le Mesurier made his own in the original show . Bill Paterson, star of Criminal Justice, has the task of bringing Frazer to life, originally played by John Laurie . Catherine Zeta-Jones will play journalist Rose Winters who is sent to report on the Home Guard's efforts to out a spy . The bumbling teenager was originally played by Ian Lavender, who at 68 is the only one of the original cast still left alive. Frank Williams who played the Reverend Timothy Farthing, the vicar of St Aldhelm's Church, joined the programme in the second series and is going strong at 83. The film will be directed by Oliver Parker, whose previous projects include a remake of St Trinian’s, and produced by Damian Jones, whose credits include The Iron Lady. Along with the cast list, a few details about the film’s plot were released yesterday, revealing that the remake will be set in 1944 near the end of the Second World War, when morale among the Home Guard is low. The journalist played by Catherine Zeta-Jones proceeds to set the Home Guard’s pulses racing when she is sent to Walmington-on-Sea to write about their attempts to root out a spy. A statement detailing the plot’s outline explains: ‘Their new mission to patrol the Dover army base is a great chance to revive spirits and reputation, that is until glamorous journalist Rose Winters arrives to write about their exploits, putting the local women on red alert. ‘MI5 then discover a radio signal which was sent direct to Berlin from Walmington-on-Sea. ‘There’s a spy on the loose! The outcome of the war is suddenly at stake, and it falls to our unlikely heroes to stand up and be counted.’ Dad’s Army ran from 1968 to 1977 and attracted 18million viewers at its height, with the original cast making their own film in 1971. So far fans have been sceptical about the remake, with Adam Ward writing on Twitter yesterday: ‘You can’t remake Dad’s Army. Oh please don’t ruin one of our greatest ever comedy shows.’ Doctor Zhivago actor Tom Courtenay will replace Clive Dunn as Jones in the film, which will be set in 1944 . Danny Mays, who starred in The Bank Job,  revealed as the new Walker, originally played by James Beck . Paul Oscroft added: ‘Unbelievably great British cast for the new Dad’s Army film – but still dubious about a remake.’ But producer Mr Jones has promised that the film will remain faithful to the spirit of the original show, which is considered a classic of British comedy. The film will be a comeback for 45-year-old Zeta-Jones, whose career has taken a back seat recently while she sought treatment for bipolar disorder. The show ran from 1968 until 1977 and at its peak had 18million viewers, with an original film made in 1971 .","New film will be set in 1944 and follows Home Guard's attempts to out a spy .

"A couple surprised their friends and family with the ultimate double celebration by inviting them to a christening which became their wedding. The celebrations turned into wedding joy as the secret Dan Bryars and Lauren Turner had kept for more than six months was revealed. Since last October the couple, from Hoyland, near Barnsley, South Yorks, secretly planned their wedding but told only their parents and a few close friends. Surprise! Dan Bryars and Lauren Turner surprised their friends and family by inviting them to a Christening which doubled as their wedding . They got their family and friends together on May 5 at St Peter’s Church, Hoyland, on the pretext of their daughter Poppy’s christening - only revealing that it was a double celebration when Lauren walked up the aisle in her wedding dress. Lauren, 24, said: 'The guests thought they were attending Poppy’s christening...we told them I was running late as Poppy had been sick on me and when I got to the church, my dad walked me down the aisle. Double the celebrations: The celebrations turned into wedding joy as the secret they had kept for more than six months was revealed as she walked up the aisle . 'People were saying things like ""is that all she could find to wear?"" and ""why are they playing the wedding march?"" and then someone shouted ""They’re getting married!"" and everyone started clapping and screaming.

"Now that Manchester United have confirmed Louis van Gaal as their new manager, attention will turn to what the Dutchman is going to do to turn the club's fortunes around. Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic have already been shown the door, Patrice Evra also likes likely to leave and a cloud of uncertainty very much hangs over the likes of Nani, Ashley Young, Tom Cleverley and Javier Hernandez.

"It had to be perfect. Jonny Wilkinson played his last game of professional rugby on UK soil by producing a masterclass of goal-kicking that rolled back the years and crushed Saracens’ dreams. Wilkinson, the greatest points machine in English rugby history, ensured the money-men from the Cote d’Azur defended their title with crushing efficiency that will hurt the London club every bit as much as their semi-final defeat last year by the same side.

In truth, they were never really at . the races as Toulon’s galacticos showed they are more than just a . collection of big names on the team-sheet by crushing, squeezing and . then stabbing Saracens with two rapier thrusts either side of half-time. In . the end they simply had too much class for a Saracens team who . obliterated Clermont in the semi-final a fortnight ago but simply could . not gain physical dominance over a Toulon side full of world-class . quality. Last week Saracens . director of rugby Mark McCall described Toulon as being capable of . playing with opponents ‘like a cat plays with a mouse’ and this morning . he knows just how it feels to be the victim of their feline control. Every . time they attempted to attack they were smothered and thumped to the . floor while every time they made an error, Wilkinson was there to punish . them with a flawless goal-kicking display. Where have we heard that before? The . iconic World Cup winner will play his final game of professional rugby . next Saturday when Toulon take on Castres in the Top 14 final and it . would be a fool who bet against him ending his career with yet another . piece of silverware. His . fast-twitch fibres may not be quite as sharp as they once were but his . goal-kicking is as deadly as ever. Saracens knew it, but could do . nothing about it. ‘There’s a . lot of relief and excitement at the moment,’ Wilkinson said. ‘At the . moment I’m just trying to take it all in. Everything comes from all the . hard work of the team and that goes for Saracens as well. I couldn’t . have asked for more.’ On point: Toulon captain Wilkinson had a 100% success rate as he contributed 13 points in their win . Trademark: Fly-half Wilkinson's points haul against Saracens included a customary drop goal . All smiles: Juan Smith (left) scored Toulon's second try midway through the second-half in Cardiff .

"Republic of Ireland winger Aiden McGeady is targeting an assault on the Barclays Premier League's top four next season after a near miss. Everton passed up the chance to gatecrash the Champions League party at the end of a nevertheless hugely successful campaign, ultimately finishing in fifth place to claim a Europa League spot. However, McGeady, who joined the club from Spartak Moscow in January, is confident they can split the big boys next time around after launching new manager Roberto Martinez's tenure in style. Aiming to go one better: Aiden McGeady says Everton must look to break into the top four . He said: 'It was in our own hands and we slipped up. 'We beat Arsenal at home and then we lost to Palace, we lost to Southampton, games that we should have won or we should be winning if we want to be in the top four. 'But ultimately those two defeats cost us and Arsenal went on and won every single one of their games, so in the end they deserved to be there. 'But we were challenging the top four, so the challenge next season is to go one better and get into that top four. 'With the squad we have got there, the manager and the backroom staff, the potential that the players have got, especially seeing as how many of the players are 22, 23, 24, young players, that's got to be our aim.' Everton's achievement was somewhat over-shadowed by neighbours Liverpool's title challenge, which came up only just short on the final day as they were pipped by Manchester City. Good job: Roberto Martinez had an impressive start to his career as Everton manager . However, McGeady believes Everton's achievement was no less noteworthy. He said: 'We probably out-performed what everybody expected of us from the start of the season. 'At the start of the season, the first three games were draws and everyone was thinking, 'This is a different type of football, a different way of playing for Everton'. 'But gradually over time, the manager and the way we play, we have won everyone over. We play football the right way and I think everyone is enjoying it.' Plenty to smile about: McGeady says he enjoys playing for Martin O'Neill - who he worked with at Celtic . McGeady is currently on international duty with the Republic and desperate to make up for lost time after finding himself consigned to the youth team in the latter days of his spell in Russia and arriving on Merseyside somewhat rusty. The chance to work again under former Celtic boss Martin O'Neill as Ireland face Turkey, Italy, Costa Rica and Portugal in preparation for the start of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign in September, is one he is relishing. Making his way in the game: Aiden McGeady started his career at Celtic . He said: 'I have got a lot to thank him for. He gave me my debut at Celtic. I played a few games towards the end of that season, then the next season, I was only 18 and probably played 35 games that season. 'I was hoping to be coming on in games, but I was playing Champions League games.'","Roberto Martinez's Everton finished fifth in the Premier League last season to claim a Europa League spot .

"Sergio Ramos powered in one of the most important headed goals in history on Saturday night - the Real Madrid central defender storming from deep to force extra time in the Champions League final they eventually won. Its timing - the third minute of added time in a game Real looked destined to lose - was poetic and added to the occasion's drama. Here, Sportsmail celebrates some of the best headers ever. Have that! Sergio Ramos got Real Madrid back in the game against Atletico in the Champions League final . Luis Suarez (Liverpool) There wasn't much Suarez couldn't do for Brendan Rodgers' side last season, and he even managed to score a ridiculous header from the edge of the box against West Brom in October. The Uruguayan got on the end of a shallow cross, yanked his neck and thundered the ball past Boaz Myhill. Bullet: Liverpool's Luis Suarez scored a sensational header against West Bromwich Albion in October 2013 . Didier Drogba (Chelsea) Similarly to Ramos' strike on Saturday, Drogba etched his name into European folklore by equalising for Chelsea in the 88th minute of their Champions League final against Bayern Munich in 2012. A real striker's goal at the near post. They're back in it! Didier Drogba netted an 88th minute equaliser against Bayern Munich in the 2012 Champions League final and went on to score the winning penalty for the Bues . Henrik Larsson (Sweden) Only Zlatan Ibrahimovic can lay claim to being up there with Larsson in a Sweden shirt, with the ex-Celtic and Barcelona man one of the most lethal forwards in world football in his day. One of Larsson's best came in the 5-0 mauling of Bulgaria at Euro 2004. He latched on to an Erik Edman cross with a full-length dive to divert past the goalkeeper. No chance: Henrik Larsson netted twice against Bulgaria during Sweden's 5-0 mauling at Euro 2004 . Luis Garcia (Liverpool) The Kop end at Anfield on European nights is a strange place; it seems to suck some of the most breathtaking goals to grace the stadium, with Garcia's effort against Anderlecht in 2005 no different. Running from deep, the Spaniard simply spun his neck to whip a header beyond a helpless Sylvio Proto. The Reds went on to comfortably beat the Belgians 3-0. From deep: Luis Garcia found the net with a header from the edge of the box against Anderlecht in 2005 . Richard Walker (Blackpool) Added time of a game Division Three Blackpool really needed to win in 2001, and substitute Walker came from absolutely nowhere to bullet a late, late winner in from Tommy Jaszczun's desperate centre. Incidentally, a certain Mark Clattenburg was the referee that night and the Seasiders won promotion via the play-offs. Jared Borgetti (Mexico) Although in the eyes of some English football fans his career was tainted by a difficult spell at Bolton, Borgetti was one of the more inventive finishers in world football. The Mexican's crowning moment was perhaps a cute header against Italy at the 2002 World Cup. One for the purists. Improvise: Jared Borgetti scored a sumptuous header against Italy at the 2002 World Cup for Mexico . Luca Toni (Juventus) There looked very little on when a floated cross found its way towards the Cagliari area, but Toni had other ideas. The big Italian got in between two defenders and used all of his neck power to drill a header home. Keith Houchen (Coventry City) This may be one of the only things Houchen is remembered for, but it's not a bad one. An FA Cup final goal, and a diving header at that. He notched a second equaliser against Tottenham Hotspur on the day in 1987 at Wembley, with the Sky Blues going on to win 3-2. Allan Clarke (Leeds United) The . winner in a Cup final isn't half bad, but when it's a diving header in . the competition's centenary year against Arsenal it's bloody brilliant.

"It was better late than never for Mario Balotelli as he started Italy’s World Camp boot camp an hour after the rest of his team-mates on Tuesday morning. While the majority of Cesare Prandelli’s squad – England’s first opponents in Brazil on June 14 – started their first day of pre-tournament training in sunny Florence at 10.30am local time, Balotelli stayed indoors - perhaps the gym - before making his long-awaited appearance at 11.40am. Holding a bottle of water as temperatures reached 80 degrees, Balotelli sauntered on to the practice grounds before doing a few laps around the perimeter of the practice pitch. Feeling blue: Andrea Pirlo (left) and Mario Balotelli . Sprint training: Balotelli is put through his paces . Late arrival: Balotelli strolls on to the training pitch at Italy's Coverciano complex . Acclimatising: The sweltering conditions in Italy should prepare them well for Brazil . Options: Cesare Prandelli will not name his final 23-man squad until June 2 . Key man: The former Manchester City striker was Italy's star performer at Euro 2012 . Getting shirty: The heat is too much for Balotelli as he removes his training top . All smiles: The striker looks relaxed as he eventually joins in with the rest of the squad . Although the former Manchester City star hasn’t been in great form for AC Milan this season and is regarded as 'crazy' by most of Italy, there is no danger of Prandelli leaving him out of the final 23 because of his exploits at Euro 2012 when he and Andrea Pirlo were the major contributors to Italy reaching the final. Monday’s atmosphere at the Italian football’s national technical centre in Coverciano – think St George’s Park at Burton but a lot hotter – was full of intrigue with Prandelli ready to wait until the final deadline date of June 2 before whittling a provisional squad of 30 down to 23. Particularly anxious are the strikers. Former Manchester United star Giuseppe Rossi is battling with Serie A’s leading scorer Ciro Immobile - whose pitchside sprints on Monday belied his name – and Antonio Cassano to get on the plane with Balotelli. Prandelli may even take them all if he takes an un-Italian like gamble. Experienced: Parma striker Antonio Cassano, 31, is in the preliminary squad . Sweltering training conditions on Monday were tough going – good preparation for the England clash which takes place in the jungle city of Manaus. Italy’s 30-man squad includes four survivors from 2006, most notably Pirlo and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, and visitors to Coverciano couldn’t miss two giant pictures in reception of their last World Cup win; the first a team line-up before they played France, the second of goalscorer Marco Materazzi being mobbed by jubilant team-mates. Italy don’t expect to repeat that achievement in Brazil this summer but they will always cling to hope with wildcard Balotelli among them.","Balotelli starts Italy's bootcamp an hour after his team-mates .

"The survivalist marksman charged in a deadly ambush on a Pennsylvania state police barracks stowed guns including a Chinese-made sniper rifle and other gear in an abandoned airplane hangar near where he was captured after 48 days on the run, according to court documents released Wednesday. More than 100 items were recovered from the Birchwood-Pocono Airpark hangar following Eric Frein's arrest last week, including the sniper rifle based on a Soviet-era design, a second rifle of the type used by the former Yugoslavian army and a handgun used by the former Czechoslovakian military, court documents said. Investigators also listed a scope and mount, a bayonet and more than 200 rounds of ammunition along with survival equipment and other items that may show how Frein passed the time while on the run in the heavily-wooded wilderness of Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. Scroll down for video . Debris is strewn about the main room inside the airport hangar on abandoned Birchwood Resort grounds in Pocono Township where accused Pennsylvania State Trooper killer Eric Frein was arrested last Thursday. Frein evaded capture for 48 days as law enforcement officers combed the wooded countryside . Police officers search the hanger within the abandoned Birchwood Resort in Tannersville, Pennsylvania. The 31-year-old Eric Frein had copies of psalms and scriptures, DVDs, shortwave and weather band radios and a laptop computer, according to the five-page search warrant inventory . A mattress and sheet are seen in the hangar. Investigators found some evidence of sustenance in the hangar, including bottles of vegetable oil, soy sauce and seasoning, bags of rice and beans, salt and pepper and a spork . Eric Frein is escorted by police out the Pike County Courthouse after his arraignment in Milford last Friday. Frein, was captured seven weeks after police say he killed a State trooper in an ambush outside a barracks in northeastern Pennsylvania . Authorities said the 31-year-old Frein had copies of psalms and scriptures, DVDs, shortwave and weather band radios and a laptop computer, according to the five-page search warrant inventory. They said they also found a pair of storage drives, a solar power converter, earbuds and a wireless mouse. Frein told authorities he used unprotected Wi-Fi hotspots to connect to the Internet, according to court documents, raising the possibility he knew where police were focusing their search efforts each day. Prior to his capture, state police had surmised Frein was breaking into cabins and unoccupied vacation homes for food and shelter. Investigators found some evidence of sustenance in the hangar, including bottles of vegetable oil, soy sauce and seasoning, bags of rice and beans, salt and pepper and a spork, according to the inventory. They also found a kit for dressing hunted animals, rolls of toilet paper and paper towels, flashlights and dozens of candles and a propane stove. Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin released the inventories to the media on Wednesday but said neither his office nor state police would answer questions. Frein's lawyers did not immediately return a telephone message. Frein belonged to a military re-enactors group, playing the part of a Serbian solder. He had a small role in a 2007 movie about a concentration camp survivor and helped with props and historical references on a documentary about World War I. During the manhunt, trackers found other items they believe Frein hid or abandoned in the woods — including soiled diapers, empty packs of Serbian cigarettes, an AK-47-style assault rifle and ammunition. U.S. marshals happened upon Frein last Thursday while searching an open field near the former airpark. He was unarmed but told police he had weapons inside the hangar, according to an arrest affidavit. Frein allegedly opened fire on the Blooming Grove state police barracks on September 12, killing Trooper Bryon Dickson and critically wounding Trooper Alex Douglass. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Frein appeared at an arraignment the day after his capture but was not asked to enter a plea to first-degree murder and other charges, including possession of two pipe bombs discovered during the search, because he did not yet have a lawyer. Frein is being held without bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for November 12.

"One week after TMZ broke the story that a neighbour had made a sworn deposition that a 'glass crack pipe' was found following the fire that broke out in actress Ashley Greene's West Hollywood apartment last year, the Sheriff's investigators have debunked the claim. Building manager Adrian Mayorga is among several residents suing the Twilight star - citing respiratory damage - after her unit went up in a flames on March 22, 2013, which was originally said to have been caused by an unattended lit candle. But while Mayorga insists in his sworn statement that he was told by one of the men involved in the cleanup that a glass crack pipe had been found in the apartment, a report obtained by TMZ on Sunday that was filed by the Sheriff's Arson/Explosives Unit shows no such finding. Scroll down for video . Claim debunked: One week after Ashley Greene's former building manager claimed a 'glass crack pipe' was found following the fire that broke out in her West Hollywood apartment in March last year, a report filed by the Sheriff's Arson/Explosives Unit has dismissed the claim . According to the website, this could mean one of two things: that no such pipe exists or that it was simply missed in their filing. The documents also reportedly state that there was no evidence of arson and they do not rule out the cause as accidental. In initial reportings of the incident, Greene, her boyfriend at the time - alleged to be actor Ryan Phillippe - and her brother were said to have been sleeping in the apartment on March 22 when an unattended candle set a living room couch ablaze. Despite Mayorga's version of events, a source was quick to dispute his claim, telling Us Weekly that no crack pipe was found at the scene. Tragedy: Greene, Ryan Phillippe and her brother were reportedly sleeping in the apartment on March 22, 2013 when an unattended candle set a living room couch ablaze, with the Sheriff finding no evidence of arson and not ruling out the cause as accidental . 'It's all hearsay from unnamed sources - Mayorga's claiming he heard from a friend of an unidentified worker who may have entered the apartment,' said the insider. The blaze tore through Green's entire apartment and killed one of her two fox terrier dogs. Mayorga said in his deposition, obtained by TMZ, that he was the first person in the hallway after the fire broke out, and claimed he saw Greene and her companions looking 'disoriented' as they fled the apartment. He added: 'The only people I saw getting treated was Ashley Greene, her brother Joe Green, and her - the current boyfriend, Ryan Phillippe.' His side: Mayorga said in his deposition, obtained by TMZ, that he was the first person in the hallway after the fire broke out, and claimed he saw Greene and her companions looking 'disoriented' as they fled the apartment . Fire casualty: Greene holding her dog Theo and, left, her other fox terrier Marlo. Only one of the animals survived the blaze, although it is not clear which one . But sources tell TMZ that Phillippe submitted a sworn declaration to Greene's lawyer this week insisting he wasn't in the apartment when the fire broke out and had in fact never even visited the unit. Mayorga claimed in court documents filed last year that he was hurt while running through smoky hallways of the apartment building yelling for residents to flee. He alleged that he suffered exhaustion, dehydration and smoke inhalation and also was hospitalised, according to TMZ. Greene also has been sued by four residents in neighbouring units who claim the fire caused soot and water damage. Sources also tell the website that actor Ryan Phillippe - Greene's alleged boyfriend at the time - has denied claims he was present the night of the fire, the actor pictured earlier this month in NYC . Meanwhile, the apartment was finally sold in July for $1.1 million following some serious renovations costing $303,000, according to TMZ. TMZ reports that the building HOA’s insurance covered a complete remodel of the 1,800 sq ft apartment to help shift it, although by law the new residents had to be made aware of the incident. Sold!

"Paul Scholes insists England manager Roy Hodgson must copy Sir Alex Ferguson when it comes to stopping Andrea Pirlo when the two sides clash at the World Cup on June 14. Writing in his Paddy Power blog, the former Manchester United midfielder claims the Italian is the best playmaker in the world. But he believes United showed how to deal with him when they deployed Park Ji-Sung in a man-marking role against AC Milan in the Champions League in 2010. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pirlo star alongside Balotelli in Italy training and against Luxembourg . Main man: Andrea Pirlo remains Italy's dangerman ahead of their World Cup clash with England . ‘Pirlo is the world’s greatest playmaker – the complete footballer,’ writes Scholes. ‘Give him time and space and he will destroy you. He’s such a clever player and is so composed. If surrounded he’ll lay it off. If he’s got room he’s devastating.' England have first-hand experience of Pirlo having lost to his Italy side in Euro 2012. Scholes added: ‘Even though England’s Euro 2012 game against Italy finished 0-0, we paid nowhere near enough attention to him. Pirlo is not renowned for his athleticism, and he’s 35 now, but that day he ran 11.58km, more than any England player. He also had more passes (131) than England’s four starting midfielders.’ Scholes recalls how Ferguson learned from his mistakes when United played Milan four years ago. Man marking: Park Ji-Sung stopped Pirlo from performing when Manchester United played AC Milan . Tactics: Sir Alex Ferguson (left) masterminded United's win over AC Milan in 2010 . ‘In 2010 before Man United played AC Milan in the Champions League, Sir Alex gave very specific instructions on how to take care of Pirlo. Man-marking him was a huge part of our pre-game plan – I played against him when Milan beat us 3-0 at the San Siro in 2007. We didn’t man-mark him. He destroyed us. We learned, and it was painful,' he said. ‘Park Ji-Sung was the perfect man for Pirlo in 2010 and never gave him kick (in a 7-2 aggregate victory). You could even see Pirlo getting frustrated and having little kicks out by the end. ‘Pirlo spoke about Park in his book: ""They’d programmed him to stop me. His devotion to the task was almost touching. Even though he was a famous player, he consented to being used as a guard dog.” ‘For Manaus, we need an ‘English Park Ji-Sung’ – one England player designated to man-mark him. Looking at the squad, Danny Welbeck – a good defender who can nick the ball well – could be an option and would be a bold decision, one which gives England a creative outlet, and saddles Pirlo with defensive work.’ Slow start: Italy were held to a draw by Luxembourg in their friendly in Perugia on Wednesday .","Paul Scholes says Andrea Pirlo can 'destroy' teams .

Golubev, 26, is ranked 55 but has been as high as 33 and beat Wawrinka in Davis Cup in April.

"A cheap form of IVF that uses baking soda is to be trialled in Britain next month. It costs a third of the price of standard treatment as it does not involve costly drugs and equipment. In conventional IVF, the embryo is grown a mixture of nutrients in a large incubator with expensive carbon dioxide pumped through. A revolutionary IVF, called simplifed culture system and costs £1,000, will be trialled in Britain next month . But scientists from Colorado University in America found they could get the same effect using citric acid and sodium bicarbonate – baking soda. This enables the embryo to be grown in a far smaller incubator the size of a shoe box. The technique – called simplified culture system – has already resulted in the birth of 18 healthy babies in Belgium. As part of the trial next month, 50 British women under the age of 37 will pay £1,000 to undergo the procedure. The treatment will initially only be available privately but doctors hope that if successful, it will eventually be offered on the NHS. Standard IVF costs at least £3,000 meaning this version is a third of the price. Scientists found baking soda - or sodium bicarbonate - created same effect as conventional IVF methods . Dr Geeta Nargund, director of the Walking Egg Foundation, the charity overseeing it, said: ‘The initial focus was to develop a simplified low-cost procedure to provide IVF in the developing world. ‘However, the public funding for IVF in the UK is very limited and by reducing costs significantly through this method we can offer a realistic opportunity to end the current postcode lottery because more cycles could be offered within the existing NHS budget constraints.’ The trial in Belgium showed that the procedure had the same success rates of conventional IVF - about 34 per cent. It has led to the births of 18 babies and six women are pregnant. In the paper, published in March, lead researcher Professor Jonathan Van Blerkom wrote: ‘While the demand for IVF has shown no diminution since its formal introduction nearly 35 years ago, neither have treatment costs, which have progressively increased.’","Regular IVF uses mixture of nutrients, large incubator and carbon dioxide .

The evening, which included a dinner for guests put on by chef Marco Pierre White, raised a huge sum for charity. England's players will donate their World Cup match fees to the Foundation, which are then passed on to various causes which are decided upon by the players' committee. The Bobby Moore Fund is one of four charities which will benefit from the £362,000. The charity was set up in memory of England’s only World Cup winning captain who died from bowel cancer, aged 51.

"Yaya Toure is not motivated by money but instead by the pursuit of a long-term technical role at Manchester City, according to his agent. The Ivory Coast international seemed to express his unhappiness at the Etihad Stadium through Twitter on Tuesday after his agent Dimitry Seluk publicly claimed his client felt underappreciated and disrespected at City. Seluk suggested that one of Toure's main gripes was the club's failure to mark his 31st birthday last week. Ambition: Toure has been linked with a return 'home' to Barcelona after a lack of respect from City . Comments: Toure's agent Dimitri Seluk has been in the public eye over the last week . All smiles: Toure is now training in America with the Ivory Coast after his trip to Abu Dhabi with City . But in an interview with Sky Sports News broadcast on Thursday morning the Ukrainian claimed Toure would be more than happy to stay should he be promised a coaching position or sporting director's role beyond his retirement. Seluk said: 'Of course. Like Real Madrid did with (Zinedine) Zidane for example. Zidane played then after that he started working for the club. 'Yaya needs the club in the future. 'We don't want any more pounds, not a longer contract, nothing like this, only really attention. 'More attention (paid) to Yaya and Yaya must feel happy at the club - that's the main thing. 'I'll tell you one more time, we don't need one more pound in the contract.' Toure initially appeared to contradict claims from Seluk that he could quit the club this summer after his outspoken agent claimed City had failed to celebrate his birthday adequately. But the player quickly backtracked and made statements in favour of his agent. General: Former Real Madrid star Zinedine Zidane was handed a coaching role at the club . Peacemaker: Manchester City's director of football Txiki Begiristain will talk with Toure before the World Cup . Snub: Toure was upset by Pellegrini not giving him a birthday message . Slice it up: The controversial cake . £47million - Since making his big-money move to Barcelona in 2007, Yaya Toure has earned approximately £47m in wages alone. That includes contracts of around £40,000-a-week at Barcelona and a weekly wage of more than £200,000 at City. PS . It’s not just wages that Yaya pockets - in his time at City the midfielder has earned around £6m in image rights and £4m in bonuses. A video published by City last week in which Toure was presented with a birthday cake has since been widely circulated while many also pointed out that the club had tweeted a happy birthday message at the time. Seluk later clarified his remarks, saying that Toure was disappointed nobody from a senior position at the club wished him happy birthday. And on Thursday he added: 'Of course some players congratulated him (on his birthday) but not the sporting director, not the general director, not the chairman, nobody. '(The manager?) No, nobody. 'This is the question. If you don't even congratulate the player or send flowers to his wife or mother - these are just small things.' Return? Toure is also rumoured to be open to a move back to former club Barcelona . Sticking the knife in? Toure's cake was dwarfed by that of Manchester City's owners celebrating the title .","Yaya Toure's agent Dimitry Seluk claims the midfielder would like a coaching role at Manchester City .

Wright-Phillips enjoyed success this . season with QPR as they secured promotion back to the Premier League . although his future remains unclear.

Blonde star: The 28-year-old presenter and model was spotted striking a number of sultry poses in a teeny tasseled bikini, which failed to get much of Peter's attention . Carlos Tevez has also been sighted in America with the former Manchester City striker dpomg little to suggest that he has come to terms with his exclusion from Argentina's World Cup squad whilst on holiday in Miami. The Juventus forward was spotted last week at Miami Beach and his mood doesn't appear to have improved as he remains on holiday.

Juventus won Serie A in emphatic fashion this season and Tevez played a big role in their success, scoring 19 goals in Serie A. Tevez was the highest profile exclusion from Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella's squad for the World Cup but it came as no shock with Tevez's last international game coming in 2011. That match was in the Copa America and Sabella was hired after Argentina's exit in that tournament, meaning Tevez is yet to play for Sabella. Topping up his tan: The pair were also seen chatting to each other as Carlos enjoyed a refreshing beverage . Efficient: Tevez (centre) settled well in Italy, scoring 19 goals in his debut season in Serie A .

Speaking earlier this year about his international exile Tevez said 'I don't know if it's a political choice. I think it all depends on Sabella.' Argentina will be going to the World Cup with attacking options such as Sergio Aguero, Lionel Messi, Gonzalo Higuain and Ezequiel Lavezzi so it is unlikely that Tevez will be missed.","None of the quartet are involved in their countries' World Cup squads .

"AC Milan are set to fire coach Clarence Seedorf and replace him with youth team coach Filippo Inzaghi, according to reports from Italy. Seedorf is only four months into a two-and-a-half year contract and has overseen a considerable improvement in results, but rumours about the Dutchman's future have been rife for several weeks. His dismissal would leave Claude Makelele as the only black manager in a major European league, with the former Chelsea midfielder taking up the post at French club Bastia just last Saturday. Ousted: Clarence Seedorf is set to be sacked by AC Milan . Embrace: Even despite his popularity with the players and the improvement of results . Club president Silvio Berlusconi reportedly met chief executive Adriano Galliani to discuss the move late on Monday night. Seedorf, 38, who spent 10 years of his playing career at Milan, took over at the end of January to replace Massimiliano Allegri, who was fired after two-and-a-half years in charge. Former Italian prime minister Berlusconi had been chasing Seedorf for several months before finally appointing him, yet the Dutchman quickly fell out of favour. And despite having no previous coaching experience, results improved markedly under him with 11 wins in 19 league games, compared to five in the previous 19 under Allegri. Milan climbed up the table to finish eighth, missing out on Europa League qualification by one point. Icon: Filippo Inzaghi played 300 competitive games for the club between 2001-12 . Winner: Inzaghi scored both goals in Milan's 2-1 Champions League final victory over Liverpool in 2007 . However, they also suffered an embarrassing exit from the Champions League after losing 5-1 on aggregate to eventual finalists Atletico Madrid in the round of 16. Similar to Seedorf, Inzaghi has no previous experience of coaching a senior professional team. The 40-year-old spent 11 seasons playing for Milan, where he won two Serie A titles and two Champions League titles, and also won 57 caps for Italy. He has been in charge of Milan's under-19 team for the past two seasons. Ditched: Former boss Massimiliano Allegri was sacked by the club in January .

"As the saying goes, herding cats is a particularly difficult task. And one couple proved just that when they came to leave a hotel in Long Island, New York. Jeffrey Johnson, 55, and his wife, Shoshanah, discovered one of their beloved 17 felines - that they had transported to the pet-friendly Marriott Residence Inn in Islip with them - was missing. After spending hours searching for the cat, named Cotton, the pair reluctantly boarded their scheduled flight from John F Kennedy airport to Israel, where they were moving with their son. Missing: Jeffrey Johnson, 55, and his wife, Shoshanah, discovered their beloved cat Cotton (pictured) was missing when they came to leave the pet-friendly Marriott Residence Inn in Islip in Long Island, New York . Owners: After spending hours searching for their cat, the pair reluctantly boarded their scheduled flight from John F Kennedy airport to Israel, where they were moving with their son, 13 (pictured with his parents) However, prior to departure, they struck a deal with hotel staff to have the two-year-old animal taken to a vet, then shipped to Tel Aviv, for a fee if it was found,  the New York Post reported. Three days later, hotel manager, Kerri Black, reportedly sent an email to the couple saying she had located Cotton and was looking after the cat at her boyfriend's  house before shipping. 'No worries. I don’t know where she is though. She has been hiding somewhere. I just put food out... she ate them last night,' Miss Black allegedly wrote. But at the Ronkonkoma house, the feline slid behind a wall, where it hid undisturbed for nine days, before vanishing again - seemingly for good.

The couple - who reportedly have 31 cats in total - contend Miss Black went against instructions to take Cotton to a veterinarian so arrangements could be made to ship her to Israel. 'It has been traumatic. She’s a really special cat,' Mr Johnson, who now lives in Had Nes, Israel, said. 'Really, we just want Cotton back.' Following Cotton's disappearance in July, the Johnsons were reportedly handed a $460 bill for the two days their pet was missing at the hotel before it was discovered by staff.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cazorla stun De Gea in Spain training with a stunning free-kick . Below par: Fabregas has struggled to win over the Barcelona fans since his move .

"The infamous nude pictures of Jackie Kennedy Onassis on a beach that caused a media storm in 1972 were part of a widespread smear campaign by her own husband, a new book reveals. The former First Lady married Greek tycoon Aristotle 'Ari' Onassis  in 1968 after he wooed her with gifts and declarations of love. But throughout the turbulent four-year marriage Ari pursued his not-so-secret affair with opera singer Maria Callas - while allegedly using his press contacts to publicly humiliate Jackie for stepping out of line. Scroll down for video . Smear:  Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis tipped off media before Jackie stripped off on a beach, a book reveals . Turbulent: He wooed the former First Lady into marriage in 1968 (pictured) but it was rocky from the start . The revelation comes from noted Kennedy author Christopher Andersen in his upcoming book The Good Son: JFK Jr. and the Mother He Loved. The biography about Jackie's son describes how Ari bullied his new wife - constantly deriding her as 'The Widow' during interviews, according to an excerpt published by the New York Daily News. Anderson describes the fatal moment that crushed their relationship in 1972: tired of Jackie suing the media for invasion of prviacy, Ari gave ten photographers detailed maps and time plans of when 'The Widow' would be on the beach in Skorpios. The nude shots splashed all over magazines and newspapers worldwide, earning Jackie the moniker 'Billion Dollar Bush', and affording her children years of cruel bullying. Affair: He dined with  opera singer Maria Callas after Jackie's private letters to another man were exposed . 'His real wife': He started pursuing Callas within weeks of marrying Jackie and kept up the liaison throughout . In public: When photographers were about, Onassis played stepfather to John F Kennedy Jr (pictured) He then filed for divorce. It was the final hit after years of public disputes between the couple. From the moment they married, he left her alone and upset for two weeks as he jetted around Europe on 'business'. When Jackie's private letters to Roswell Gilpatric were exposed in 1970 - including one written days after their wedding - Ari publicly dined with Maria Callas in Paris, and tipped off photographers. Doomed: Ari left Jackie alone and upset for two weeks after their wedding day while he jetted about Europe . The last straw: He ended their marriage in 1972 after the nude images caused a global media storm . 'Dearest Ros,' she had written, 'I would have told you before I left - but then everything happened so much more quickly than I'd planned. I saw somewhere what you had said and I was touched - dear Ros - I hope you know all you were and are and will ever be to me - With my love, Jackie.' It hurt Ari's pride and he was fully aware that the pictures of him with Callas - 'his real wife' - would be snapped up by US newspapers. But he gleefully boasted about his own dalliances, once telling Johhny Meyer: 'Everybody here knows three things about Aristotle Onassis. 'I'm f***ing Maria Callas, I'm f***ing Jacqueline Kennedy - and I'm f***ing rich.'","Aristotle Onassis bombarded Jackie O with gifts and marriage proposal .

"Liverpool fans will be licking their lips at the prospect of signings galore to strengthen their squad for an assault on the Champions League. After guiding the Reds to a second-place finish in the Premier League, Brendan Rodgers is keen to bring in new faces with the likes of Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Emre Can and Alberto Moreno all linked with a move to Anfield. But... a note of caution. Rodgers has made 14 signings since taking charge of Liverpool back in 2012, and only a couple of those have wowed the Kop. Sportsmail's Sunni Upal assesses the Liverpool manager's signings so far. The only way is up: Brendan Rodgers is looking to strengthen the Liverpool squad this summer . Fabio Borini (from Roma, £10.5million) The Italian is a player Rodgers is keen on after the pair spent time together at Chelsea. Borini arrived at Anfield as a 21-year-old who looked to have a big future, but he managed just one goal in the first part of the 2012-2013 season, against Gomel in a Europa League qualifier. It was a nightmare first season and injury threatened to curtail it in February. The Italian returned ahead of schedule and finally scored his first Premier League goal in a 6-0 thrashing of Newcastle. Having impressed for Italy at the European U21 Championship, Borini spent last season on loan at Sunderland. With his transfer fee not exactly on the small side, it would be easy to label him as a flop. However, after scoring four goals in five games to help Sunderland to safety, there are indications the Italian could still make his mark in a red shirt. VERDICT - RESERVING JUDGEMENT . Potential: Fabio Borini celebrates after scoring against Gomel in the Europa League . Joe Allen (from Swansea, £15million) In an episode of the documentary series Being Liverpool, Rodgers referred to Allen as the 'Welsh Xavi'. Initially, the midfielder's range of passing was impressive but he soon lost his way and his only goals during his first season came against Oldham in the FA Cup and Zenit in the Europa League. Having rarely featured at the start of last season after falling behind Jordan Henderson in the pecking order, Allen has had to fight his way back into the team. One game in particular stands out, and that was the 3-0 win at Old Trafford, during which he was brilliant. The 24-year-old finished the campaign with a regular run in the team and finally scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool in a 3-3 draw at Crystal Palace. Next season he must continue his end-of-season form. VERDICT - RESERVING JUDGEMENT . On the mark: Joe Allen was given an extended run in the team at the end of last season . Oussama Assaidi (from Heerenveen, £2.4million) The Moroccan struggled to break into the first team at Anfield during his first season, playing just four games in the Premier League. Assaidi spent last season on loan at Stoke where he made much of an impact. His last-minute winner for Stoke against Chelsea was appreciated by Liverpool fans, but, realistically, the chances of him breaking through at Anfield are very slim. VERDICT - MISS . Outcast: Oussama Assaidi spent last season on loan at Stoke after failing to impress . Samed Yesil (from Bayer Leverkusen, £1million) The German was highly rated by Rodgers and quickly pounced upon. Still only 20 years old, Yesil hasn't forced his way into first-team reckoning. An anterior cruciate ligament injury ruined his season in the Under21 Premier League last year and he missed a lot of the season. There is still time for Yesil to show what he can do. VERDICT - RESERVING JUDGEMENT . Talent: Samed Yesil, pictured playing in the Capital One Cup, was signed for £1million from Leverkusen . Daniel Sturridge (from Chelsea, £12million) Instant hit. There's no better way to win over fans than to score goals. Sturridge did that straight away, registering in his first three games in a red shirt. After arriving in January, he scored 11 goals in the second half of the 2012-2013 season. Last year, though, he really made his mark. With Luis Suarez suspended for the first part of the season, Sturridge quickly lifted the mood with six goals in his first five games. When the Uruguayan returned the pair, labelled the 'SAS', were unstoppable. Sturridge finished the season with 25 goals in all competitions after finally being given an extended run as a striker. VERDICT - HIT . Revelation: Daniel Sturridge was one of the hottest striker in Europe last season . Philippe Coutinho (from Inter, £8.5million) Now, that price seems a bargain. The Brazilian is very similar to a Kop favourite from the recent past, Luis Garcia. His trickery, vision and incisive passing fit in very well with Rodgers' system. One thing often overlooked, though, is big goals he scores, as Garcia did so often. Coutinho's deflected effort at Fulham brought Liverpool level before Steven Gerrard's injury-time penalty secured a 3-2 win. Talking of 3-2 victories, who scored the winner against Manchester City in April? Yep, Coutinho. VERDICT - HIT . Vital: Philippe Coutinho scored the winner against Manchester City in a 3-2 win at Anfield . Tiago Ilori (from Sporting Lisbon, £7million) Signed for £7million last summer, Ilori arrived at Anfield as a young central defender with huge promise. The 21-year-old is yet to earn his opportunity in the first team and spent the end of last season on loan at Granada. With Liverpool's defensive problems, Ilori could fight his wat into contention. VERDICT - RESERVING JUDGEMENT . Push for the first team: Tiago Ilori (left) spent the end of last season on loan at Granada . Aly Cissokho (from Valencia, season-long loan) With Jose Enrique compromised by a knee injury, Rodgers moved to bring in the French left back on loan as cover. But Cissokho was never solid enough and soon fell behind Jon Flanagan, who is more naturally comfortable at right back. VERDICT - MISS . Cover: On-loan left-back Aly Cissokho lost his place to youngster Jon Flanagan . Victor Moses (from Chelsea, season-long loan) Jose Mourinho had no idea that he was loaning out Moses to a title rival and a team that finished above his Chelsea side. Moses started well with a goal at Swansea, but his opportunities were limited. That was largely due to the emergence of Raheem Sterling. VERDICT - MISS . Limited: Victor Moses was kept out of the Liverpool team by Raheem Sterling . Mamadou Sakho (from Paris Saint-Germain, £18million) When the Frenchman arrived on Merseyside, Liverpool hailed Sakho as a 'marquee signing'. It has been a strange first season for Sakho. He has found himself in and out of the team, almost on rotation with Daniel Agger. While Sakho still looks clumsy in possession and leaves fans with their heart in mouth every time he makes a challenge, there is talent there. After all, he captained Paris Saint-Germain as a teenager and is likely to start for France at the World Cup. VERDICT - RESERVING JUDGEMENT . Solid as a rock? Mamadou Sakho was hailed as a 'marquee signing' when he arrived at Anfield . Kolo Toure (from Manchester City, free) This initially looked like a good piece of business by Rodgers to bring in an experienced, hardened Premier League veteran on the cheap. But a couple of clangers in early 2014, most notably the own goal against Fulham and passing the ball across his own box to Victor Anichebe against West Brom, have reminded people how error prone he is. At 33 years of age, Toure is unlikely to be find himself as a starter again. VERDICT - MISS . Costly: Free signing Kolo Toure made a number of huge errors in the early part of 2014 . Simon Mignolet (from Sunderland, £9million) The Belgian had big shoes to fill at Liverpool. He stepped straight into a void left by Pepe Reina, who was first-choice goalkeeper at Anfield for eight years. Mignolet had a debut that dreams are made of, saving a penalty in the 89th minute to preserve Liverpool's 1-0 lead over Stoke. Mignolet is an excellent shot stopper but, much like his back four, prone to mistakes. He rarely looked comfortable when claiming crosses and his howler to let in Alvaro Negredo's shot consigned Liverpool to a 2-1 defeat by Manchester City in December. Looking back at the final standings in the title race, those points seem pretty costly now. VERDICT - RESERVING JUDGEMENT . Dream: Simon Mignolet saved a penalty on his Anfield debut that secured Liverpool three points . Iago Aspas (from Celta Vigo, £7.2million) Due to the excellence of Suarez and Sturridge, Aspas really hasn't had a look in since September. Having said that, the Spaniard was given a decent run at the start of the season with Suarez suspended but couldn't score. In fact, his only goal all season came in the FA Cup against Oldham. With Liverpool looking to strengthen and Lambert's seemingly imminent arrival, there is only one way Aspas is heading in the pecking order. VERDICT - MISS . Solitary: Iago Aspas's only goal last season came in the FA Cup against Oldham . Luis Alberto (from Sevilla, £6.8million) Alberto had the kind of season that left many wondering what his favoured role is. A forward? A midfielder? winger? No 10? The Spaniard has made just nine Premier League appearances this season with most of those being from the bench. He is still only 21, but will have to work incredibly hard just to get noticed next season with a number of signings expected. VERDICT - MISS .

"James Ward was unable to extend his winning run at the French Open despite a hugely creditable performance against 17th seed Tommy Robredo. The Londoner took the first set in pouring rain on Court 6 but Robredo hit back to win 4-6 6-4 6-2 6-4. Ward became the first British man to qualify at Roland Garros for 41 years when he beat Blaz Rola in the final qualifying round on Friday but the draw was not kind. Spaniard Robredo, a former top-10 player, is a man of significant clay-court pedigree and a quarter-finalist here last year, when he came back from two sets down to win three successive matches. Going home: James Ward took the first set but was eventually undone by Tommy Robredo . Although he has not been in great form this season, his movement and remarkable defensive skills are tailor-made for clay. Ward, who spent part of his junior days training in Spain, is also happy on the dirt and has pulled off some impressive wins, not least beating American Sam Querrey in Davis Cup in February. It was Robredo who made the better start in steady drizzle, breaking the Ward serve in the third game, but back came the British number three to level at 3-3. He then saved a break point to hold for 5-4, his serve getting him out of trouble, and piled the pressure on Robredo as the rain became ever heavier. Brave: James Ward took the first set before being beaten by No 17 seed Tommy Robredo . Steady: The Spaniard showed his class to pull away from Ward and claim his place in the second round . Soon it was teeming down but on they went. Robredo saved three set points but not a fourth, Ward taking it with a forehand winner and a pump of the fist. On Friday, his good friend Andy Murray touted Ward as a potential top-50 player, describing his cross-court backhand, which was much in evidence against Robredo, as 'maybe world class'. The quality and conviction of his play was hugely impressive but a break for rain did not seem to help him as on the resumption a series of loose points saw him drop his serve to start the second set. He continued to put pressure on Robredo and took his chance in the eighth game to level at 4-4 when the Spaniard missed a backhand only to drop his serve again straight away. Achievement: Ward was the first British man in 41 years to come through the qualifying rounds . In rain reminiscent of the end of the opener, Robredo served out the set, and the pair stayed in their chairs while the worst of the weather passed. Ward did not seem happy about starting again and, like in the second set, he dropped his serve straight away. When Robredo held from 0-40 in the next game, Ward began to look a little weary, and the third set quickly slipped away. He renewed his efforts at the start of the fourth but must have felt like he was playing a wall as Robredo retrieved everything. The Spaniard broke Ward's serve for the sixth time in the match to move 3-2 ahead and clinched victory after two hours and 53 minutes. It was not without some final heroics from Ward, though, who saved two match points in fine style on his own serve. The 27-year-old demonstrated once again that he performs at his best on the big stage and he will have high hopes for the grass-court season.","James Ward beaten 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 by No 17 seed Tommy Robredo .

"Jailed: Terrence Tucker, 46, groomed the girl before repeatedly assaulting her in a string of attacks . A child rapist who tried to explain blame his son for his sexual attacks after his victim fell pregnant has been jailed for 15 years. Terrence Tucker, 46, groomed the teenage girl before repeatedly assaulting her in a string of attacks which only came to light when she fell pregnant. Police collected DNA samples which revealed that Tucker was the father of the child, but he blamed his son, who suffers from severe learning disabilities, for the offence, Exeter Crown Court heard. His victim terminated the pregnancy. Tucker denied four counts of rape and three of sexual activity with a child but was found guilty by a jury at Truro Crown Court last month. He was described as showing 'no remorse' during the trial. Sentencing him to 15 years in prison, Judge Simon Carr said: 'You were convicted of the systematic abuse of a girl who you groomed and abused from the age of 12 or 13. 'You started with sexual assaults to see how she would react and if you could get away with it and when she did not complain you progressed to rape, culminating in a pregnancy when she was 16. 'She suffered the further emotional trauma of a termination. I saw her give evidence and it is perfectly clear she has been devastated and will be for the rest of her life. 'During the trial you showed no remorse at all and I could not fail to notice that given the DNA evidence, you attempted to blame your own son for the offence, knowing he suffers from severe learning difficulties.' The jury heard the victim revealed the abuse when she fell pregnant. Mr Robert Linford, defending, said Tucker of Liskeard, Cornwall, has very low intelligence and is unable to read or write. He said: 'He has his own learning disabilities and is of previous good character. 'His inability to read and write means his sentence will be one which is unusually difficult to bear.' Evidence: Police collected DNA samples which revealed that Tucker was the father of the child, but he blamed his son, who suffers from severe learning disabilities, the court heard.

"Andre Schurrle bolts in his chair, pupils dilated. The conversation has moved on to how much it really means to pull on a Germany shirt. ‘It’s the most important thing for us, without doubt,’ he says. ‘Look at the players who have pulled on that jersey throughout history. You are one of them.’ And so the Chelsea man recounts the names. Beckenbauer, Muller, Matthaus, even Ballack. ‘It means so much to me. When I was young I saw the national team with this pride and history.’ In the build-up to what should prove to be a World Cup to beat any of the previous three, the Germans know what they are and know exactly what they ought to achieve. VIDEO Scroll down for Schurrle is confident he can have a successful World Cup . This is it: Chelsea's Andre Schurrle confidently stated that Germany's only goal is to win the World Cup in Brazil . In training: The Chelsea man controls the ball during Germany training in Italy on Thursday morning . Legend: Schurrle is proud when recounting the players - like Franz Beckenbauer - to have worn the short . Hero: Michael Ballack played on gallantly even after suffering suspension in the 2002 semi-final . Gamer: Schurrle was talking at the launch of WATCH_DOGS . Joachim Low’s side are off to Brazil with the sole intention of becoming the first European side to win it in South America. Looking at the 23 they’re taking, it’s difficult to argue with Schurrle when he bluntly offers: ‘Our goal is the title – it must be with this team.’ Into the final four of the last three tournaments since Jurgen Klinsmann left eight years ago, the belief now is that it’s time to stop falling at the last. There are, Schurrle divulges, compelling reasons why; key men including Philipp Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger have reached their peak, while the emergence of younger supplements makes Germany a very exciting prospect indeed. ‘The team is quite young,’ he adds. ‘We’ve got Mario Gotze, Marco Reus, myself… Thomas Muller is still young too.’ Focus immediately pins on Reus.  It hasn’t been difficult to see why Manchester United remain so desperate to add the Dortmund forward. The 24-year-old - who singlehandedly beat Real Madrid in a Champions League quarter-final second leg in April - has now added consistency in front of goal to his ingenuity on the ball, making him one of the most revered talents on the continent. ‘The way he played during the last few months for Dortmund was quite incredible - he scored or assisted every match. Technique, pace and that right foot – it’s fantastic. He’s a very intelligent footballer as well. ‘I know him well – Marco is one of my best friends in football.’ Hotshot: Dortmund's Marco Reus is one to watch out for when the World Cup starts next month . Mates: Reus and Schurrle are very close, with the close-knit group one of the reasons why they're so potent . And with that Schurrle reveals just why the Germans are so dangerous, beyond their obvious charm in possession and doggedness without it. This team has grown up together. ‘It feels like a family,’ the 23-year-old says. ‘We’ve played together for the last four years. We’ve got big players of great quality and have two players for each position. ‘You build partnerships. You know what he wants on the pitch and how you should play a ball. That’s going to be an advantage for us. ‘Everybody sticks together and knows each other. It’s been a long time now and we’ve a good mix.’ Roy Hodgson’s defiant line that there’d be no point England travelling to Brazil not believing they could win it was admirable, but it’s questionable whether he himself really feels Steven Gerrard will be tootling up the Maracana steps to collect silverware. For Germany – with the undisputed talent at Low’s disposal – the time is now. Twenty-four years is too long. Like a family: Most of the German squad have played with each other for the past four years . Passing it on: Joachim Low has been in charge since 2006 when USA boss Jurgen Klinsmann left his post . That’s the message from above, driven by the silent patriarch Lahm and radiating down. ‘He isn’t the one to motivate everyone,’ Schurrle reasons. ‘Philipp is calm and has seen everything, even in the most difficult situation. He plays every game brilliantly, so easy, as if it’s nothing. He never makes mistakes – exactly what a captain needs to do. Everybody looks towards him. ‘He has his own ideas and knows what he’s talking about. If he talks to you it always makes sense.’ Talk then turns to Germany’s group: very tough on paper, and potentially more difficult in reality. Portugal are first up before Ghana and Klinsmann’s America. Does the opening game set the tone for the tournament, particularly if Cristiano Ronaldo is kept quiet? ‘You can’t think like this,’ Schurrle replies. ‘We’ve two games to go after that. It’s important to remain calm. If you lose then you start thinking everything’s over already and it isn’t. It’s a difficult group, but we should win all three games. ‘I don’t . think you can stop Ronaldo for the whole 90 minutes because of his . individual class. We have the players of our own though. Philipp plays . against him and knows him quite well after the games between Real Madrid . and Bayern Munich. ‘Philipp . is the best full back in the world. He can play in midfield, too, but . for me if Ronaldo plays on the wing Lahm has to be there.’ Marker: Captain Philipp Lahmn should be given the task of seeing off Cristiano Ronaldo in the opening game . How long left? Bastian Schweinsteiger could be playing in his last World Cup for Germany this summer . It appears he may have a point. Pep Guardiola opted to play his skipper at left-back against Madrid. Ronaldo up against David Alaba was on the other flank and took Bayern apart in the Allianz Arena, scoring twice to book their place in Saturday’s final against Atletico. Recent painful memories for Lahm and Schweinsteiger could either inspire or cripple. Schurrle is left in no doubt which. ‘I think they’re even hungrier now because they want to win a big title,’ he claims. ‘I don’t know how many World Cups Philipp and Bastian are going to play in the future, so they want to win this. ‘It’s something they don’t have.’ Not yet at least. If any side are to break the South American stranglehold, it’s Germany.

"Italy midfielder Riccardo Montolivo’s World Cup dream came to a painful and public end at Craven Cottage after he broke his left leg against the Republic of Ireland. Montolivo was captaining his country with coach Cesare Prandelli resting many of his big-name players from this warm-up game before they face England in Brazil on June 14. The 29-year-old enjoyed the  honour for just 13 minutes until he was tackled by Alex Pearce within touching distance of the dugout - in front of England’s Roy Hodgson and Gary Neville, watching from the Fulham directors’ box. Worried: Italy captain Riccardo Montolivo was injured in the friendly against Ireland . Painful: Montolivo came off worse in a challenge with Ireland defender Alex Pearce in the first-half . The AC Milan captain briefly got to . his feet and took a few steps before collapsing in agony. He was treated . by paramedics on the pitch for three minutes as concerned teammates . stood over him. A grimace . suggested he knew that his hopes of making it to a second World Cup were . over. He appeared to mouth ‘Mi sono rotto,’ - ‘I’ve broken it’ - to the . bench. He was later confirmed to have fractured the tibia bone in his . left leg. Instead of . travelling with his teammates to their training camp in  Florence, he . spent the night at Chelsea and Westminster hospital and will be flown to . Milan on Sunday for emergency surgery. ‘All . our thoughts are for Riccardo,’ said Prandelli later. ‘He is a key . player, so everybody is really cut up. They’re so upset right now. He . has a really good attitude. He’s such a great personality on and off the . pitch and I think all the lads were really shocked. ‘Obviously . after what happened the players were distracted, psychologically it is . difficult to move on. It is too emotional to consider now how it affects . the squad.’ Injury: Montolivo received treatment on the pitch before eventually leaving on a stretcher . Something to prove: Italy coach Cesare Prandelli named a changed side for the game against Ireland . Before the . injury, Montolivo seemed almost certain to make Prandelli’s 23-man . party, expected to be announced Sunday, and he was likely to have . featured in the starting XI in the first game in Group D. The . player, who made seven appearances for the Azzurri during the . qualifying campaign, would have been an important cog in  Italy’s attack . and a valuable experienced presence in the camp. Italy . remain without a victory since September, after five draws and a defeat . to Spain. It is difficult to pinpoint how useful Hodgson will have . found last night’s game in gauging the challenge England will face when . they open their World Cup campaign in Manaus. It . was an experimental line-up with the players who are likely to provide . the biggest threat to England left on the bench. Andrea Pirlo, the . 35-year-old midfield maestro who was probably on British soil in an . Italy shirt for the final time, did not play. The 22,879 crowd, a fairly . even split of Azzurri blue and Irish tricolour,  witnessed several . fabulous passes by Daniele De Rossi after his introduction on 62 . minutes. Star man: Mario Balotelli was named on the bench for Italy's game against Ireland . Safe hands: Experienced goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was another player named on the bench for Italy . Gianluigi Buffon, . at 36 still one of the world’s best goalkeepers, was rested although his . deputy Salvatore Sirigu did a superb job of thwarting several Ireland . shots. ‘He was the biggest positive for me,’ said Prandelli. Ireland . were  boisterous opponents committed to every tackle. Norwich’s Anthony . Pilkington exposed frailties in the Italian defence, getting the better . of Mattia De Sciglio on several occasions. ‘I . thought we played very well,’ said manager Martin O’Neill. ‘Italy . started off well but I thought we could have scored a few goals. When I . heard there was going to be 20,000 people here, I realised nobody was . taking this as a friendly. It was very competitive from start to . finish.’ O’Neill expects the . future of his assistant Roy Keane — a Celtic target — to be decided . before Ireland fly to America on Wednesday where they face Portugal and .

"Jim Davidson could still make an appearance on Celebrity Big Brother after he was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences earlier this week. Officers working on the Jimmy Savile sex abuse investigation detained the comedian at Heathrow Airport on Wednesday as he flew into the UK ahead of a planned appearance on the reality TV show. The 59-year-old pulled out of the Channel 5 programme's original lineup, which started on Wednesday, but it has been reported that he will enter the house following discussions with his advisors. Return: Reports suggest that former BBC television host Jim Davidson could still make an appearance on Channel 5's Celebrity Big Brother after he pulled out of the show following an arrest by police working on the Jimmy Savile sex abuse investigation . One source told the Daily Star: 'Jim is still in shock but hasn't done anything wrong and is determined to hold his head up high. He has vowed to clear his name.' Following the arrest at Heathrow, having flown in from a Christmas break in Dubai, Davidson was taken to a London police station where he was questioned for a several hours. He was released on bail until March. Bailed: Davidson, pictured with his fifth wife Michelle Cotton, was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree . Channel 5 is understood to have re-jigged its lineup at the last minute after talks with Davidson, replacing him with Neil 'Razor' Ruddock. Davidson's solicitor said in a statement that the former television host 'vehemently denies' the allegations, said to date back 25 years. In October Davidson, who formerly hosted BBC shows Big Break and The . Generation Game, publicly labelled the Savile investigation a 'witch . hunt'. On his blog he wrote: 'The Savile witch hunt is going a bit silly now. We all are starting to speculate and accuse ... even in jest. So no, I . don't know who's next. 'Everyone has had the nod. Everyone is an expert. Just pick someone you . don't like and say it's them. 'As odd as he was, Savile can't defend . himself. The bloke's dead for God's sake. Let's move on.' A number of plain-clothed police officers spent more than four hours searching Davidson's £1million Georgian home in the picturesque village of Stockbridge in Hampshire. They left the property at 7pm carrying boxes which appeared to contain plastic evidence bags and brown envelopes. Davidson has often courted controversy by telling offensive jokes about ethnic minorities, homosexuals and the disabled. He has divorced four times and in 2011 married his fifth wife, Michelle Cotton, 17 years his junior. Following the arrest, his solicitor Henri Brandman said: 'Two women have made allegations in respect of Jim that date back approximately 25 years. The complainants were then in their mid-twenties. 'Jim vigorously denies the allegations. He answered police questions as fully as he was able after this passage of time. Bailed: Jim Davidson, pictured with his fifth wife Michelle in 2004, left, and outside Buckingham Palace after receiving his OBE in 2001 . Star: Davidson pictured on the Generation Game after replacing Bruce Forsyth as presenter . Arrests: Davidson and an unnamed 53-year-old were on the same day  as police investigate accusations made in the wake of revelations about disgraced Jimmy Savile . 'He has not been charged with any offence. Neither he nor I will be making any further comment.' Another 53-year-old man was also arrested on the same day as Davidson. the pair are the ninth and tenth arrests made in the Savile investigation, called Operation Yewtree. Detectives are working through an arrest list of people who could be questioned about allegations made by victims of Savile or others associated with him. Scotland Yard said a total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Savile so far. And 589 people have come forward with information relating to the scandal, with a total of 450 complaints against the BBC presenter and DJ himself, mainly alleging sexual abuse, police said. Ten weeks after the launch of Operation Yewtree, police recorded 199 crimes in 17 force areas in which Savile is a suspect, with 31 allegations of rape. Others who have been arrested include former pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr and publicist Max Clifford. Those three are on police bail.

Ronaldo was set to play against Espanyol in Real's final La Liga game of the season last weekend, but felt discomfort during his warm-up and was removed from the squad as a precaution. Despite worries over his fitness, Ancelotti has confirmed that his star man will be able to face Diego Simeone's title winners. Speaking on Tuesday, the Italian said: 'Gareth (Bale) and Cristiano will play and that's the most important thing.' Ronaldo added: 'Nobody wants to miss a final, a final we have been aiming for and it is obviously important. 'If the body can't do it then it is not the end of the world but I will be there, I am confident.' Defender Sergio Ramos is certain to start Saturday's showpiece as Real aim to win 'La Decima' - the club's 10th European Cup. The Spanish international has never played in the Champions League final before and describes the chance to win the famous trophy as a 'dream'. Previewing the clash with Atletico for club sponsors Bwin, Ramos said: 'It's a special moment. It is a dream and a reward for the sacrifices and work of so many years. Looking good: Madrid stars (from left to right) Marcelo, Alvaro Arbeloa and Sergio Ramos step off the plane . Even battle: Sergio Ramos believes the Champions League final against Atletico is '50-50' Young gun: Spanish star Isco (right) looks likely to be left on the bench for Saturday's final . 'Although we look at it more as a collective level, it is a reward for the work of the team has carried out all of these years.' There has been plenty of talk about Real's failure to be crowned kings of Europe since 2002, but Ramos insists that his side will not be overwhelmed by pressure . 'We shouldn't talk about pressure or obsession either,' he said. 'I think it is more the hopes we have to be able to win the Champions League and to be able to share it with the fans.' Ramos had claimed that Real were underdogs to emerge victorious in Lisbon, but he now admits that the clash with city rivals Atleti is too difficult to call, even after his side's defeat in the 2013 Copa del Rey final. He added: 'They aren't very different (the finals), we are practically the same players, there . is a title at stake. It is 50-50. Both of us will use our strengths to . try and win the game.'","Real Madrid play Atletico Madrid on Saturday in an all-Spanish Champions League final .

"Sir Jack Brabham, who has died aged 88, was Formula One’s first knight, and the holder of another unique distinction: he is the only man to have driven to a world title in a car he designed and built. But even before that feat in 1966, he was assured of a place in motor-racing folklore, having pushed his car to the first of his three world titles in 1959 after running out of fuel 100 yards from the end of the US Grand Prix at Sebring. With the rules forbidding anyone else from helping him, his strong frame proved equal to the task. Brabham’s success as a wily, combative driver, combined with his acumen as the owner of his eponymous team, elevated him to the status of sporting royalty in his native Australia. His bust is displayed at the entrance to the paddock at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne each year. In black and white: Sir Jack Brabham, pictured here in 1969, won three Formula One titles in a glittering career . On the road to glory: The Australian, competing in 1965, is the only man to win a title in a car he built . His death . at his house on the Gold Coast, after a long battle . against kidney disease, was met by tributes from fellow racers from . motor-racing’s dangerous era. Sir . Stirling Moss said: ‘My career would have been considerably less . without him. Every race — and I’m talking 50-odd times a year — we would . fight against each other. ‘I . remember in New Zealand in the early Fifties, we were contending the . New Zealand Grand Prix, and I had a problem with my back axle. The first . person who came up was Jack and he said, “Take it off my spare car,” knowing very well that there was a good chance I might beat him. ‘That sums him up — a real sportsman and a good Aussie.’ Sir . Jackie Stewart, whose career overlapped with Brabham’s, said: ‘He was . an extremely talented driver and deceptively fast. He was also a very . aggressive driver and probably one of the most difficult to overtake.’ Legend of the sport: Brabham, seen here at the unveiling of his bust at the 2013 Australian Grand Prix, has died . Lewis Hamilton: 'RIP Sir Jack Brabham. What an amazing driver and man ‪#‎legend'‬ . Daniel Ricciardo: 'Sorry to hear about Sir Jack Brabham. A great Australian who inspired many Aussies to pursue our dreams.' Max Chilton: 'RIP Sir Jack Brabham' Romain Grosjean: 'R.I.P Sir Jack Brabham' Force India‏: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Sir Jack Brabham, a true legend of Formula One. 1926-2014.'

Johnny Herbert ‏: 'Really sad news with the passing of Sir Jack Brabham, A World Champion, and great man. RIP. My thoughts go to all his family.' Karun Chandhok‏: 'Sad news about Sir Jack Brabham passing away. A true legend & created a great racing dynasty of fast sons & grandsons! #RIP #FastGenes' Brabham, . the grandson of a Cockney emigrant to Adelaide, was born in an outer . Sydney suburb in 1926. His father was a grocer and taught Jack to drive . as soon as he could reach the pedals. By then he had already taken an . interest in the mechanics of his father’s trucks and cars, a fascination . with machinery that was to endure. After . leaving school at 15, Brabham got a job in a local garage and studied . engineering in the evening. He served during the war as an engineer in . the Royal Australian Air Force and opened a motor repair shop on . demobilisation. Having . first raced on dirt tracks in Australia, Brabham travelled to England . in the mid-1950s. He won the first two of his three world titles with . Cooper-Climax, before manufacturing his own winning car — the Brabham . BT19 — with the help of his compatriot Ron Tauranac. He . was 40 by then and had been written off by many cognoscenti as past his . best. To make this point someone sent him a long beard and walking . stick, which he wore, as a joke against himself, on to the grid at . Zandvoort that year before driving to victory from pole position. It was a humorous touch from a taciturn, even shy, man. Brabham . won also two constructors’ championships, in 1966 and 1967. He competed . in 126 grands prix during a 15-year F1 career, winning 14 races. He . retired in 1970, when he was 43, bowing out after winning at Kyalami, . South Africa. He would have continued but his first wife Betty and the . family implored him to stop. Picture that: Jack Brabham, at his home on the Gold Coast in 2009, will be remembered as a legend of the sport . ‘Black . Jack’, as he was called, sold the Brabham team to Tauranac yet it . continued for 30 years, including under the ownership of Bernie . Ecclestone, for whom Nelson Piquet won two world titles. He regretted . severing his ties with Formula One so abruptly. Despite . his immense achievement, which earned him a knighthood in 1979, few . commentators quite rank Brabham among their golden handful of finest . drivers, alongside the likes of Jim Clark, Ayrton Senna and Juan-Manuel . Fangio. Longevity: Brabham's career in F1 spanned 15 seasons - he was 44 when he finally retired from the sport . But . it is impossible to imagine a current driver owning, managing and . driving for his own team. As Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, said this . feat ‘will surely never be matched’. ‘Australia . has lost a legend,’ reflected Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Brabham’s youngest son, David, said: ‘He lived an incredible life, . achieving more than anyone would ever dream of.’ He leaves his . widow, Lady Margaret and three sons, David, Geoff and Gary, all of whom . pursued motor-racing careers. His grandsons, Matthew and Sam, are also . racers, keeping alive an illustrious tradition into a third generation.","Sir Jack Brabham died at his house on the Gold Coast on Monday morning .

"They may be newly-crowned La Liga title winners, after defying Barcelona at the Nou Camp, but Atletico Madrid will still go into Saturday’s Champions’ League final as underdogs, in most people’s estimation. Diego Simeone’s side can consider themselves worthy champions after going behind at the Nou Camp but bouncing back with an equaliser to force the draw they needed to break the Spanish League’s long-running duopoly and finish above Barca and Real Madrid. Man on a mission: Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone is aiming to lead his side to Champions League glory . Main man: Diego Costa trained ahead of the final with Real Madrid . But can they round off an unforgettable campaign by getting the better of Real in an eagerly-awaited all-Madrid European final in Lisbon? With Cristiano Ronaldo in the form of his life and Gareth Bale already looking at home in the company of Real’s galacticos, few are backing them to pull off an improbable double. If they do once more respond to Simeone’s inspirational promptings, in the same way that took them past Chelsea in the semi-final, it will bear comparison with other upsets in the competition’s illustrious history. Here are five of the best. Liverpool 3-3 AC Milan (aet: Liverpool 3-2 on pens), Istanbul, May 25, 2005 - Liverpool’s players were stunned when they trudged off at half-time, but not as stunned as Milan’s were the best part of two hours later. All bets were off after goals from Paolo Maldini and Hernan Crespo (2) gave Milan a 3-0 interval lead. All except spread bets on the margin of Liverpool’s defeat, that is. But it all changed after a tactical masterclass from Rafa Benitez, who replaced full-back Steve Finnan with midfielder Dietmar Hamman, switched to a 3-5-2 formation and saw the seemingly-impossible begin to unfold. Steven Gerrard, Vladimir Smicer and Xabi Alonso forced extra-time, and Liverpool pulled off the comeback to end them all by holding their nerve in the penalty shoot-out. The comeback to end all comebacks: Steven Gerrard lifts the Champions League for Liverpool . We've done it! Liverpool players run to goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek to celebrate . Spot kick king: Liverpool's goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek saves a penalty from AC Milan's Andriy Shevchenko . Celtic 2-1 Inter Milan, Lisbon, May 25, 1967 – we were still to enter the age of colour television, let alone widescreen and HD, but the grainy images of Jock Stein’s heroic Lisbon Lions defying the odds against Helenio Herrera’s seemingly-impregnable Serie A champions are as vivid as ever. Inter had won the European Cup, as it was known then, in ’64 and ’65 and looked on for a third in four years after Sandro Mazzola converted a seventh-minute penalty, following a Jim Craig foul on Renato Cappellini. The script was made for Inter to sit back and soak up any amount of pressure with their renowned defensive resilience. But Celtic had other ideas, and, after equalising through left-back Tommy Gemmell in the 63rd minute, they became Britain’s first European champions with a close-range finish by Stevie Chalmers six minutes from time. The Lisbon Lions: Celtic beat Inter Milan in 1967 to lift the play-off final . Marseille 1-0 AC Milan, Munich, May 26, 1993 – under Fabio Capello, Milan were known as The Invincibles and were in the middle of a spell of domestic dominance that brought them three successive Serie A titles. No-one gave Marseille much hope, and a look at the group stages underlined why. While Milan breezed through with a 100 per cent record, Marseille scraped through with three wins and three draws against Rangers, Bruges and an out-of-sorts CSKA Moscow. But defender Basile Boli’s 43rd-minute header proved decisive against a star-studded Milan side containing the likes of Marco Van Basten, Frank Rijkaard, Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta. Upset: Marseille beat the odds and defeated AC Milan . Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Juventus, Munich, May 28, 1997 – Juve had just wrapped up their 24th Serie A title under Marcello Lippi and were strong favourites, particularly after beating Manchester United home and away en route to topping their group with five wins and a draw. Dortmund only finished second in their group, to Atletico Madrid, but they unearthed an unlikely hero in the final, in the shape of midfield anchor man Paul Lambert. The Scot may be having his problems as manager of Aston Villa, but he had little difficulty shackling Zinedine Zidane in a man-marking job that proved decisive. He even found time to lay on the opening goal for Karl-Heinz Riedle, who doubled the Germans’ advantage, before Alessandro Del Piero hit back in the second half. An unlikely Dortmund triumph was secured when local lad Lars Ricken scored 16 seconds after going on as substitute. German joy: Borussia Dortmund beat Juventus in 1997 to win the European Cup . Bayern Munich 1-1 Chelsea (aet: Chelsea 4-3 on pens), Munich, May 19, 2012 – the venue gives a clue as to why this counted as an upset. Bayern’s glittering Allianz Arena was the stage, and it was set for Jupp Heynckes’ team to bring the trophy home, two years after the heartbreak of losing to Inter Milan. Add the fact that Chelsea were in turmoil after sacking Andre Villas-Boas two months earlier and finishing sixth in the Barclays Premier League, a distant 25 points behind champions Manchester City, and a Bayern win looked assured. It was all going to plan when Thomas Muller’s downward header reared up off the turf and beat Petr Cech seven minutes from time. But this was to be Didier Drogba’s finest hour in a Chelsea shirt. Just as Bavaria was bracing itself for an all-night party, Drogba powered an 88th-minute header past Manuel Neuer to force extra time that duly gave way to a penalty shoot-out. Incredibly, Bastian Schweinsteiger missed Bayern’s fifth to leave the way clear for Drogba to nervelessly convert the decisive kick.

"Danny Cipriani's England recall has been confirmed with the rejuvenated Sale fly-half in the national squad flying to New Zealand on Tuesday ahead of the three-Test series against the All Blacks. The 26-year-old has turned his fortunes around in the last 12 months and recent events have conspired to leave him on course for a first Test appearance since 2008. He has been named in a group of 30 departing for Auckland - with another tranche of players from Northampton and Saracens due to fly out next Monday, after the Aviva Premiership Final. Head coach Stuart Lancaster will choose his team for the series opener at Eden Park from the initial contingent and Cipriani is one of just two No 10s included, along with Freddie Burns. The man who is joining Leicester from Gloucester this summer is considered to be the prime contender to fill the playmaker's role in the first Test, in the absence of three domestic rivals. Made his point: Danny Cipriani issues orders during England training at the Lensbury Club earlier this month . Hitting form: Cipriani has impressed for Sale in the Aviva Premiership during the last 12 months . Forwards: Joe Marler, Matt Mullan, Kieran Brookes, Henry Thomas, David Wilson, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Gray, Dave Ward, Rob Webber, Dave Attwood, Joe Launchbury, Geoff Parling, Ed Slater, James Haskell, Tom Johnson, Matt Kvesic, Ben Morgan, Chris Robshaw. Backs: Danny Care, Ben Youngs, Freddie Burns, Danny Cipriani, Kyle Eastmond, Manu Tuilagi, Henry Trinder, Billy Twelvetrees, Mike Brown, Jonny May, Chris Pennell, Marland Yarde. 'Both Freddie and Danny have great opportunities to put a marker down as genuine international fly-halves,' said Lancaster. 'Owen [Farrell] and Steven Myler have been exceptional this season and they will be considered post these games this weekend. But now it's in Freddie and Danny's court. They've trained great so far so we're looking forward to seeing how they get on. 'Danny has done well, he's come up to speed; he's got to know the plays. He's built relationships with the players and he's been good - it's a similar defensive structure for him to the one at Sale. 'He's excited about being here. We'll make the decision on fly-half on what happens in training and what happens in the next week or so.' Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler cannot be considered for the opening clash with Steve Hansen's world champions, so soon after the Premiership Final. And George Ford of Bath has been ruled out of the tour, due to the pressing need for an operation on his damaged shoulder. So if Burns is chosen to start, Cipriani is likely to act as the back-up stand-off on the bench, unless Billy Twelvetrees returns to full fitness earlier than expected and can provide cover if required. 'Billy [Twelvetrees] is going well,' said Lancester. 'He hasn't trained yet, and it's unlikely he'll train (on Tuesday) before we fly, but we're optimistic enough to take him on the initial flight with a view to assessing him when we get out there. 'He's really going to have to be training fully at the start of that Test week in order to be considered.""But he's certainly made enough progress to be under consideration for the first Test and definitely for the second, so that's why he's on the plane.' Elsewhere, there are only two scrum-halves in the initial party; Danny Care and Ben Youngs - so the management must hope that neither of them come to any harm in the run-up to the series. Once the club season comes to an end, it appears that Lee Dickson and Richard Wigglesworth will come out as reinforcements in that position. Explosive impact: Cipriani looked to be a world-class star in the making during his early days with England . Shunned the celebrity lifestyle: Cipriani is now more associated with playing a starring role for Sale Sharks (right) than being pictured with glamorous women, such as former girlfriend Kelly Brook (left) James Haskell is back in favour, having last played a Test for his country in March last year, when England slumped to a record 30-3 defeat against in Cardiff. The Wasps flanker must have a strong chance of starting the first Test at blindside, in the absence of Northampton's Tom Wood. There are seven uncapped players in the group; Chris Pennell, Kieran Brookes, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Gray, Dave Ward, Ed Slater and Henry Trinder. Pennell is rewarded for a sensational season for relegated Worcester, while Cowan-Dickie, Ward and Gray will all tussle for the starting hooker place if Rob Webber fails to recover from injury in time - although the Bath player is also included in the squad. The presence of Pennell is an indication that Bath wing Anthony Watson is destined to miss the trip. The turbo-charged rookie suffered a suspected hamstring injury during Friday's Amlin Challenge Cup Final defeat to Northampton in Cardiff.","Cipriani has overcome bad-boy reputation in last 12 months .

"Ryan Giggs has revealed how he wept in his car the day he feared he was saying goodbye to Manchester United for the last time. Giggs spent the last four games of last season as United’s interim manager in the wake of the sacking of David Moyes. The 40-year-old Old Trafford legend has subsequently been invited on to new manager Louis van Gaal’s coaching staff and will remain at the club, even though his playing days are now over. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Giggs gets emotional describing his farewell . Caretaker: Ryan Giggs walking at Old Trafford against Norwich for the first of his four matches as Manchester United's interim boss . Unfamiliar surroundings: Giggs sits in the manager's office at Carrington . However, Giggs has now spoken for the first time about the moment he feared his life at his one-and-only club may be over. After saying goodbye to players and staff at Manchester Airport on returning from United’s last game of the Barclays Premier League season at Southampton, Giggs revealed: ‘Yeah, we got off the plane at Manchester Airport. ‘I was saying goodbye to the players, thanking them. ‘Potentially saying goodbye to a lot of players for the last time, a bit of staff, and I’m not an emotional... well, I didn’t think I was. ‘I’m not a really emotional person but my car was parked right outside and I thought, ""I need to get in my car here"". The crying game: Giggs gets emotional after the final home match of the season against Hull and admits he wept in his car a few days later when he feared his career at Old Trafford was coming to an end . Driven to despair: Giggs admitted the thought of leaving Old Trafford had him in tears . ‘I could feel myself getting . emotional. So I get in my car and I just went, started crying, started . getting really emotional and I think it was just a mixture of what I’ve . just said, saying goodbye to people for maybe the last time, and the . pressure that I put myself under. Clapping them off: Giggs after his final match in charge of United, at Southampton . ‘It sounds stupid now, but it’s just not me, it’s just not me at all. ‘So . I came out the airport and I came at the lights and Nicky Butt has just . pulled up next to me and I’m thinking, ""F***ing hell, I can’t let Butty . know that I’ve just been crying"". ‘So I just give him a little wave and just looked the other way and waited for the lights to go green.’ A revealing insight in to Giggs’ final year as a player at United will be seen on TV on Thursday night in ITV’s Life of Ryan: Caretaker Manager, which will be shown at 9pm. Understandably, most of the programme concentrates on the former Wales star’s four games as manager. Giggs reveals how his sleep dwindled to less than five hours a night as his time in charge wore on and tells of his anger after United lost at home to Sunderland in his second game in charge. ‘I was upset after the game but the longer it’s gone on since, I have just got angrier and angrier, slept less and less and just, you can’t have it, you just can’t have it,’ he revealed. ‘If any of them want to come and see me and ask me why they’re not playing then I’ll tell them and I don’t think they’ll have a leg to stand on. ‘I mean, I just, I was stood on the . side against Sunderland just wishing I’d named myself as a substitute so . I could something about it. ‘I bet every manager thinks like that, but I’m in a position where I’m still playing and can still affect the game. Anger: Giggs said he was especially upset after United's home loss to Gus Poyet's Sunderland . Premier League April 26 Norwich (h) won 4 - 0 . Premier League May 3 Sunderland (h) lost 1-0 . Premier League May 6 Hull City (h) won 3-1 . Premier League May 11 Southampton (a) 1-1 . ‘For 20 years Sir Alex Ferguson used to say, ""Wait until all you lot are managers and you’ll find out how hard it is to pick a team, to leave good players out"", and I was just say there going: ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever"". ‘But it’s like having your first baby. ‘You can prep as much as you can, but until it comes down to actually living it day in, day out, you can never prepare for it. ‘I was really, really down after that game and you know, that won’t happen again. ‘We prepared right, we knew that Sunderland were gonna be a tough team because they were on a good run, and you just pick a team and what I did was I picked a team that I thought could win the game and I trusted the players. ‘But some of the players let me down and let themselves down. Maybe I was a little bit too soft. Baby steps: Even though Giggs was advised by Sir Alex Ferguson (right), he was still not prepared for the job . ‘I don’t care where you are in the league and I don’t care if the results have been going badly, if you step on to that pitch as a United player you give it your all, and if you don’t then you deserve not to play the next game. ‘I think I’ve always had a will to win. From an early age I was used to winning and it’s that fear of losing because you know losing is a much bigger emotion than winning. ‘When you win it’s great, but then it goes away. When you lose, it’s not great, but it doesn’t go away for a long, long time.’ Thursday night’s programme features behind the scenes footage of Giggs as a manager at United’s training ground. It shows him parking in Ferguson’s old parking space and trying to settle in to his mentor's old office. ‘My approach is look at it as though I am going to be in this office for a long time,’ he revealed. Old pals' act: Giggs is greeted by Nicky Butt on his first day as caretaker United manager . Class of 92: Giggs (back left), Nicky Butt (back centre), Paul Scholes (back right) and Phil Neville (front left) were all on the coaching staff at the end of the season . As well as behind-the-scenes footage from training, team meetings and press conferences, the programme also features interviews with fellow Class of '92 members Gary and Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and David Beckham. Beckham, for example, reveals he was a bit jealous of seeing Giggs and his hastily-assembled backroom staff in the dugout for their first game as a management team at home to Norwich. Ferguson, meanwhile, calls him a ‘freak of an athlete’ and labels him one of the top three players ever to play for United. ‘The others you can argue about,’ said Ferguson. Gary Neville, meanwhile, said: ‘You usually have to wait 20 years or until you're are dead to get a statue built but Ryan should have one now. ‘When I’ve spoken to him, he’s now starting to have five hour sleeps so he’s, you know, he’s in the real world with the other coaches and managers, taking every sort of little problem to bed with him, thinking about how he’s gonna leave players out. ‘But he’s got the clinical side to be able to do that, he’s got the temperament to be able to deal with that. The new man: Giggs will be assistant to Louis van Gaal when the Dutchman takes over at Old Trafford . ‘As a manager you have to make big decisions and obviously that’s something that all managers will tell you and he is absolutely capable of making big decisions.’ With Giggs now on holiday until pre-season, he has spoken of his enthusiasm about working as assistant to Van Gaal. ‘I have met him and I liked him immediately,’ he said. ‘I am looking forward to working with him and learning from him.’ Having played for 23 years at United, Giggs almost scored on his farewell appearance against Hull last month. ‘Playing at Old Trafford makes you feel taller and stronger,’ he said. ‘I loved it. I wanted those feelings to last for ever.’ Life of Ryan: Caretaker Manager is on ITV tonight at 9pm.","Giggs wept in his car when he feared 23-year United stay was finished .

'I would like to send my sincere thanks and best wishes to Johan Mjallby and Garry Parker who have supported me magnificently, to all the players and staff at the Club who I have worked with over so many years and, of course, to our magnificent supporters who have been with me through everything. I would also like to thank Dermot, Peter and the Club’s Board of Directors for their support.' Grateful: Lennon thanked all of his Celtic players as well as the 'magnificent' supporters . 'I also want to thank my family for all they have given me. I could not have been Celtic Manager for four years without their wonderful support. 'Serving the Club was always a privilege. I have always given my best and aimed to do all I can to ensure success for Celtic, as a supporter it was all I wanted. 'I will now assist the Club in appointing my successor. As ever, we will need our fans’ support and I am sure they will give the Club and the new Manager the same great backing which they gave to myself.' And the man the Scottish champions want to replace him is former Parkhead defender Malky Mackay. Lennon’s stint in charge is now history with only the formalities left to be tied up. Since taking control in 2010 the Northern Irishman has won three Scottish Premiership titles, two Scottish Cups and taken the club to the last 16 of the Champions League after toppling Barcelona. Returning hero? Henrik Larsson has been installed as favourite to become new boss . Keen to test himself in English football, however, his resignation offers the 42-year-old the freedom to speak to other clubs without seeking permission from Parkhead powerbrokers. Speculation has surrounded the future of the former club captain for some time. Concerned Celtic plan to sell the key duo Virgil van Dijk and Fraser Forster this summer, the issue came to a head amidst concerns that qualification for the Champions League is becoming more and more difficult. Aside from facing three qualifiers to make the group stages, Celtic will have to play those games at Murrayfield due to Celtic Park being used for the Commonwealth Games – putting them at a distinct disadvantage. The recent departure of trusted deputy Johan Mjallby has also persuaded Lennon that this is the right time to move on. Lennon has been heavily linked with a move to managerless Norwich City, but has been hamstrung by the need for the Carrow Road club to seek permission to speak to him. That path has now been cleared. On Wednesday night bookmakers Paddy Power suddenly slashed the odds on Henrik Larsson – currently in charge of Swedish club Falkenbergs - becoming the new manager. Former Celtic defender and Cardiff City boss Mackay met Carrow Road directors last Thursday and is favourite for the job. Mackay, however, also tops Celtic’s list for a potential replacement for Lennon. Sportsmail has learned that a Celtic representative has already made informal contact with a member of the Mackay camp to establish if he would consider a return to his native Glasgow. Mackay holds the club in huge regard and has ambitions to manage at Parkhead one day – but has ambitions to return to management in the English Premiership sooner rather than later. David Moyes, recently sacked by Manchester United, is free to consider a return to his first love but that option seems unlikely. Meet the new boss? Jackie McNamara and former team-mate Lennon discuss the good old days last month . Steve Clarke, the former West Brom manager, is also in the mix together with ex Swansea deputy Morten Weighorst. Jackie McNamara, the Dundee United manager, would be a popular choice with supporters although the acrimonious nature of his departure in 2005 might count against him. In the running: Malky Mackay has been touted for a Celtic return too . Whoever is appointed the next Celtic manager has a tough act to follow. Lennon served Celtic as a player between 2000 and 2007 before returning as first team coach the following season. He was demoted to reserve team manager after Gordon Strachan made way for Tony Mowbray but was asked to take charge of the team after the latter was shown the door after an inglorious spell in charge. After being given the job on a permanent basis in 2010, Lennon built his own side by snapping up the likes of Gary Hooper, Fraser Forster and Joe Ledley. His side narrowly missed out to Rangers in the 2010-11 SPL yet defeated Motherwell to win the Scottish Cup that season. The following season, Lennon, boosted by the acquisition of Victor Wanyama, finally got his hands on the title and the following term his men took the scalp of Barcelona as they qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League. Successive league titles were added last year and this – together with another Scottish Cup in 2013 and another Champions League qualification last year. But facing the likelihood of losing Forster and Van Dijk this summer, Lennon has now opted to hand the task of rebuilding the squad to someone else. Glory days: Lennon lifts the Scottish Cup in 2005 next to McNamara . Former Celtic winger Aiden McGeady . has warned whoever succeeds Neil Lennon as manager will have to win two . trophies a year if he wants to be considered a success. The . Republic of Ireland international, who played both with and under . Lennon during his time at Parkhead, knows the new incumbent faces a . tough task. Asked how much . of a blow the Ulsterman's departure was to the club, the Everton winger . said: 'It's a big blow. Now Celtic will obviously be looking to replace . him with someone, but the big question is who do you replace him with? 'That's the first question, which candidates are out there? You start looking straight away. 'It . will be a difficult job because Celtic is a massive club and success is . a way of life, you have to go and win every game, you have to go and . win every trophy you compete in, apart from the Champions League. 'If you are not winning two trophies a year, you are seen as a failure.' Warning: Everton wideman Aiden McGeady believes the next Celtic manager will need to win two trophies a season to be considered a success . McGeady, however, admitted the news did not exactly come as a shock, even if the timing of it may have done. The 28-year-old said: 'To be honest, it's not really come as a surprise because of some things I've heard from a few people, that he was a bit unsettled and had probably kind of done all he thought he could do with the club and maybe was looking for a new challenge down in England somewhere. 'Maybe the Celtic fans wouldn't be shocked by it either, but obviously to just hear 10 minutes ago that he had resigned was a little bit of a shock in that sense. 'Ever since he took over at Celtic from when I was there, he was brilliant. I played with him - he was difficult at times to get on with as a player, but as a manager, I can't speak highly enough of him. 'He was fantastic when I was there and led the club to many trophies in the last four years. 'Maybe he just thinks it's time for himself to get down to England somewhere and have a new challenge.' One of the Bhoys: John Hartson celebrates with Neil Lennon (left) and Aiden McGeady (right) in 2006 . Meanwhile, another former Celtic winger, Davie Provan, says the absence of Rangers from the Scottish league cost Neil Lennon the chance of a top job in England. Lennon has left without another job to go to and Provan says that’s an indication of how far Scottish football has fallen in the esteem of English chairmen. 'It’s fair to say the Celtic job no longer has the prestige it once had,' observes Provan. 'At the time Martin O’Neill and Dick Advocaat were going head to head and Rangers had players like Ronald do Boer and Henrik Larsson and Chris Sutton. 'The job does not have the cache it had then. I think Neil may feel that he has achieved all he possibly can in Scotland and has now hit the glass ceiling. It’ s time to move on.'","Departure will spark interest from the Premier League and Championship .

"A 14-year-old boy who two years ago received an adult sentence of 25-years in prison for his part in the killing of a friend’s stepfather has had his conviction quashed and will now have his case heard again. Paul Henry Gingerich is the youngest person in the state of Indiana ever sentenced to prison as an adult, when aged 12 he was sentenced for conspiracy to commit murder. The unanimous decision to overturn that sentence was announced Tuesday by the Indiana Court of Appeals. They found that the juvenile court in Kosciusko County ‘abused its discretion’ in 2010 by not giving Gingerich’s attorneys more time to prepare arguments that his case should stay in the juvenile system. New hearing: The Indiana Court of Appeals has ruled unanimously that Gingerich had not received due process when he was tried in adult court and has ordered a new juvenile court hearing . Paul Henry Gingerich's mug shot from two years ago when he was arrested as a 12-year-old . Gingerich’s attorneys were given four business days, despite their pleas for more time. Similar cases typically offer defense attorneys as much as three months to prepare. The result was that Gingerich’s case was waived to the Circuit Court - the adult system. Facing the possibility of more than 45 years in jail, Gingerich pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced as an adult to 25 years. With credits for good behavior, he was expected to serve just under half the time, being released at age 24. Gingerich’s mother, Nicole, said she . was very happy about the decision by the appeals court. 'I’m very positive and confident that . my son will be tried as a juvenile,' Gingerich said, 'and that he will . be out a lot sooner than he was supposed to be.' Gingerich was one of three juveniles from a small town in northeastern Indiana charged with killing 49-year-old Phillip Danner as part of a plot to run away to Arizona in April 2010. Authorities say he fired one of the shots that hit Danner. The Indiana attorney general's office did not immediately say whether it would appeal Tuesday's decision to the state Supreme Court. ‘Among the most disheartening cases seen in the criminal justice system are those involving young people charged with extremely violent crimes. For prosecutors and judges, these are among the most difficult cases as well in terms of balancing the rights of the juvenile with the safety of the community,’ Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a statement. Monica Foster, the public defender who handled Gingerich's appeal, said the trial judge rushed to judgment without considering the boy's maturity, and the appeals court agreed. Since he was convicted, Gingerich has been incarcerated at the Pendleton Juvenile Correctional in Pendleton, Indiana . This photo shows Gingerich heading for lunch on Feb 17 2012, the day he celebrated his 14th birthday in jail . The court's ruling noted that Gingerich didn't understand the proceedings. The court cited a psychologist who found that the boy thought the judge was obligated to find him guilty, didn't understand plea bargaining, and didn't understand many of the words used by his lawyer. The appellate court rejected the state's arguments that Gingerich had given up his right to appeal as part of the plea agreement and found that a probation officer had provided the trial judge misinformation about the availability of private detention facilities. Going back to juvenile court could still be a gamble for the boy, who is now 14 and is eligible for release when he's 24. There's no guarantee the case wouldn't be sent to adult court again, and Gingerich could risk a longer prison sentence if he is charged again with murder as an adult.","Two years ago Paul Henry Gingerich was convicted for his part in the murder of a friend's stepfather .

"Lord Rennard humiliated Nick Clegg yesterday by defying his second request for an apology for making unwanted advances to female party activists. As the women who complained about the Lib Dem peer’s behaviour claimed they had been ‘branded liars’, party leader Mr Clegg again tried and failed to wring a statement of regret from him. The complainants are now considering taking legal action for having their ‘reputations trashed’ after the party let its former chief executive escape punishment. Unrepentant: Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard has humiliated Nick Clegg . They accused Lord Rennard of sexually . inappropriate touching when he was the Lib Dems’ chief executive and . also involved in candidate selection. On Wednesday, a review of the case found their claims were ‘credible’ and that he should apologise for ‘violating their space’. But . the QC appointed to investigate, Alistair Webster, said the claims did . not pass the tough, burden of proof threshold set in criminal cases. As . a result there were no grounds on which to expel him from the party but . both Mr Webster and Mr Clegg said Lord Rennard should say sorry. The . peer refused to do so and retains his position on a key party policy . board. He is also likely to have the Lib Dem whip reinstated at a House . of Lords meeting on Monday. Yesterday . Mr Clegg tried again when he told LBC radio that Lord Rennard should . now ‘do the decent thing’. ‘He should apologise,’ said Mr Clegg. ‘I think it is a matter of very real regret – to put it mildly – that, so far at least, he hasn’t chosen to apologise.’ Nick Clegg last night risked civil war in his party as he insisted Lord Rennard should not rejoin the Lib Dem group in the Lords unless he apologises over sexual harassment allegations . But the women involved are so furious at the leaderships’ impotence they have rebuffed Mr Clegg’s attempts to speak to them. One Lib Dem activist said last night: ‘It is infuriating to think that we are effectively being branded liars.’ And . one complainant said she wanted to think ‘very seriously’ once the . ‘heat’ had died down whether she and others should take legal action. Their anger intensified after Lord Carlile, a senior QC, said his friend Lord Rennard had ‘nothing to apologise for’. ‘Astonishingly . the Liberal Democrats, our party, which has committed against secret . justice has refused to allow either Lord Rennard or I as his legal . representative ever to see Alistair Webster’s report. What kind of . justice system is that?’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today. Mr Clegg was also pressed on his LBC radio show on whether he had failed to deal with the complaints about Lord Rennard. Current and former Lib Dem activists took to Twitter to condemn the ruling that Lord Rennard will face no further action . He . admitted that ‘the buck stops with me’ and added: ‘The party as a . whole, and myself as leader, we’ve got to take responsibility, [we] . failed to respond to the concerns first raised.’ Susan Gaszczak, a Lib Dem campaigner, waived her anonymity last night to claim she too had been a victim of Lord Rennard. Revealing that Mr Clegg had phoned her to apologise, she told Channel 4 News: ‘He needs to be firm. 'We . should not be calling for women to resign, we should be calling for . Rennard’s resignation. [And] he has not been found not guilty, either. 'Someone needs to man up here and do something about this.’ Another . alleged victim, Alison Smith, said: ‘The investigation has no . credibility with either side and the party needs to start again from . scratch, this time with transparency.’ Lord . Paddick of Brixton also angered victims by appearing to blame their . ‘reluctance’ to come forward years ago for the lack of action. He . added in an article for the Liberal Democrat Voice website: ‘Justice . works both ways, however difficult that may be to take.’ Lord Rennard did not respond to calls from the Daily Mail. By Andrew Pierce . NICK Clegg sought to limit the damage over accusations of a cover-up yesterday by insisting that Rennard will not be given any meaningful public role in the party. It was a hollow claim. Not only will Rennard be back in his usual place on the party’s benches in the House of Lords as early as Monday, he will also be at the next meeting of the party’s influential Federal Policy  Committee later this month. Far from being exiled to its outer reaches, the party’s former chief executive will be a key figure helping the policy committee to devise the Lib Dems’ 2015 election manifesto. Lord Rennard said he now plans to return to his roles in the party after the conclusion of the last report into his behaviour . ‘Chris (Rennard) is a member of that  committee, whatever the leadership may want,’ said one of the disgraced peer’s friends last night, ‘and he will give it the benefit of all his experience.’ To the dismay of Mr Clegg and his  supporters, who hoped he might quietly drift behind the scenes, Rennard is also planning to stand for re-election to the  policy committee in October (elections  happen every two years). Buoyed by the 100 letters of support submitted to the internal inquiry by senior party members, Rennard is confident he will be re-elected. And if, as expected, he wins the support of the majority of the party’s 43,000 activists, his victory will be announced during the Lib Dem autumn conference in Liverpool, guaranteeing even more damaging headlines. A Lib Dem spokesman said last night: ‘It’s true we can’t stop Lord Rennard attending the Federal Policy Committee meetings, nor can we stop him running for re-election to the committee if he wants to.’ It is a statement that underlines the deep divisions in the party over the Rennard affair and the sense of anger and frustration in the Clegg camp at the outcome of the investigation by the leading QC Alistair Webster. The impotence of the party leadership is underlined by the fact that Mr Clegg’s call for a public apology from Rennard has been summarily rejected. ‘They wanted to hang Chris out to dry and failed,’ said another senior Lib Dem. ‘This is the worst of all worlds for us, as Chris is wounded but not fatally.’ Rennard’s friends have mocked the inquiry for its secrecy and ineffectiveness. Lib Dem President Tim Farron said Lord Rennard should apologise . Under Lib Dem rules, Mr Webster was not allowed to speak to any of the ten women who made the sexual harassment allegations against Rennard, and they were allowed only to submit written statements. And this is a party that prides itself on equality and transparency! Rennard’s critics say there are two main reasons he has escaped without sanction. First, the Lib Dem party is inherently chauvinistic. An investigation last year by City fund manager Helena Morrissey after the Rennard affair first broke, found the party failed to live up to its ideals of equality and liberty, and that there was a culture of ‘low-level sexism’ with reports of widespread ‘sexism and misogyny’. Second, no individual has ever wielded more power and influence or instilled more fear within the Lib Dems than the overweight, balding and bespectacled Rennard. He is nicknamed Rasputin, after the mystic who mesmerised the Russian Imperial Court under the last Tsar, and he still has immense influence. A former party agent, he rose to become director of campaigns and elections between 1989 and 2002 and chief executive until 2009. When Clegg became party leader, he made clear he wanted get rid of Rennard – who had masterminded general election campaigns for Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy – and put his own man in the job. ‘Chris was regarded as too close to Ashdown and Kennedy and therefore too Left wing and too liberal. Having served two leaders, he was also seen by Clegg’s people as too powerful, too set in his ways,’ explained a source. When Rennard eventually quit as chief executive in 2009 the official explanation was ‘health reasons’. The truth was he went because the Lib Dem leadership realised the growing number of sex-pest allegations against their married chief executive meant his position was unsustainable. Mr Clegg, who was glad to see the back of  Rennard, was confident the allegations would never see the light of day, which explains why no action was taken. It was a bad miscalculation and, given the fury of Rennard’s alleged victims over the ‘whitewash’, the row can now only escalate. To try to draw a line under the controversy, the party leadership has told MPs not to go on the airwaves. But not everyone is listening. Tim Farron, the ambitious party president, has been quick to speak out, for example. ‘While this process has not found to a criminal standard of proof that Lord Rennard acted with indecent intent,’ he said, ‘It is clear that he did not behave in the way that a chief executive should behave. Lord Rennard must reflect on his actions and apologise to the women involved.’ Mr Farron, who is no fan of Nick Clegg, hopes to be the next Lib Dem leader. And the more mud that sticks to Clegg over the Rennard affair, the more likely that is  to happen.","Report by QC Alistair Webster says Lord Renard 'invaded personal space'

"Found: Michael Brutsch, 49, has been unmasked as the Reddit's biggest, most controversial troll . The internet troll behind a disgusting online message board where users post sexual photographs of unsuspecting teenage girls has been revealed as a cat-loving grandfather from Texas. Michael Brutsch, who uses the Reddit name 'Violentacrez', was the main moderator for the social network's 'Creepshot' forum which sparked outrage last month for encouraging the vile pictures. Now, after years posting offensive messages across the internet and earning the moniker of the 'biggest troll on the web', Brutsch has been found working as a computer programmer for a financial services company in Arlington, Texas by Gawker. The 49-year-old lives with his wife, who suffers from diabetes and is also an avid Reddit user, a son, two dogs and seven cats. Brutsch, who has a granddaughter, also has a son in the Marines, according to social networking sites. 'My wife is disabled,' he pleaded with the reporter. 'I got a home and a . mortgage, and if this hits the fan, I believe this will affect . negatively on my employment. 'I do my job, go home watch TV, . and go on the internet. I just like riling people up in my spare time.' But, even though he has become a massive internet troll after setting up a number of sickening Reddit forums, including 'Rapebait', 'incest' and 'misogyny', he refused to apologise. 'I would stand by exactly what I've done,' he added. Unmasked: At odds with his controversial life online, Brutsch is a married computer programmer for a financial services firm who lives with his wife, Tori, and their pets in Arlington, Texas . As Gawker reveals, Violentacrez has long been one of the driving forces of Reddit, a website where users submit content and vote for or against it to determine its position on the front page. On the website, he was also behind the sickening trend 'Jailbait', where users submitted sexualised images of scantily-clad underage girls. The users deleted photos of girls older than 16. It generated millions of page views . each month but, unsurprisingly, also sparked outrage and was eventually . pulled after Anderson Cooper lambasted Reddit for hosting it. Brutsch . has long argued that he is not a pedophile and would remove any child . porn that was posted, and was merely maintaining free speech on the . website. He told Gawker that, while at home with . his wife, the two would lie in bed together with their laptops, both on . Reddit, him posting porn as she posted cute animal videos. Reddit has not only condoned his vile . posts but encouraged and facilitated them, aware that their . controversial spin will drive more traffic to the website, which . launched in 2006. Sick trend: One Reddit forum set up by Brutsch is 'Creepshot' where users upload sexualised images of unsuspecting young girls. Here, a shot of a schoolgirl reportedly taken at a school . He was close with the employees, he . told Gawker, and was even given a 'pimp hat' as a thank you for his . contributions to the site, which now receives more than three billion hits a . month. Reddit has been an established and popular name on the Internet over the last five years. It is a social news website where users submit content and vote for or against it to determine its position on the front page. Users can discuss any subject, and the site is regularly used by celebrities for interviews, including Barack Obama, who recently took part in an 'ask me anything' debate. It is celebrated for its wide-range of topics, diverse users and freedom of speech which, as in the case of Brutsch, can make way for controversial topics. Some of the 'subreddits' he has been linked with include 'Rapebait', 'incest' and 'misogyny', on which users would post pictures and discuss them in detail. In 2011, he was behind 'jailbait', a group for sexually suggestive pictures of underage girls taken from pages like Facebook. Images of girls who looked over 16 were removed from the subreddit. After it was blasted on Anderson Cooper 360, the group was banned. Since 2006, Reddit has been owned by Condé Nast publishers, which also owns GQ, the New Yorker and Vanity Fair. Before Jailbait was to be closed, the general manager, Erik Martin, contacted him directly to warn him, Brutsch claimed. 'Want . to give you a heads up,' Martin wrote. 'We're making a policy change . regarding jailbait type content. Don't really have a choice.' This blasé - and often encouraging - . attitude towards trolling and offensive, invasive images raise questions . over Reddit's social and moral responsibilities. They even used Brutsch as a volunteer . moderator, trusting this man with extremely questionable tastes over . what would be appropriate to appear across the website. The revelation of his identity comes weeks after campaigners fought to close his 'Creepshots' forum. It . features images of ordinary women on the street, in the gym or even at . school who are caught unawares by stealthy 'creeps' with cameras. Most . shots focus on the buttocks or breasts of non-consenting women going . about their daily lives - and users admit that 'at least 40 percent' of . the images are of underage girls. In one alarming thread, a prolific poster appears to be a teacher, posting images of his unsuspecting female students. The user, 'Weagleweaglewde', while . posting numerous 'upskirt' images of girls in a classroom setting, . claims in at least two posts that he is a teacher at a high school. The response to the 'creep shots' forum - known as a subreddit - has been outrage and a campaign to remove . the site has sprung up from other corners of Reddit. Unabashed: The Creep Shots admittedly has photos of large numbers of underage girls . In a sub-forum called 16F - shorthand for Female, 16 - user Weagleweaglewde comments on a girl's appearance, again claiming to be a teacher at a high school . Blasé: Despite some his sickening posts and fears he could lose his job, Brutsch stands by what he's done . One furious user wrote: 'What's particularly disturbing about the voyeur subreddits is that individuals are having their perverse, invasive, and illegal behavior validated and encouraged by many others. 'Students should be able to attend class without having their privacy violated by fellow students and trusted authority figures like teachers. 'Girls should be able to go to school without worrying that sexually suggestive images of them are being uploaded to popular websites like Reddit for thousands to view and ogle.' One user went as far as to offer tips for getting 'creep shots'. 'Don't . be nervous,' the advice reads. 'If you are, you'll stand out. Don't . hover too much, get your shot and move on if you can. You'll look less . like a creep if you have photos of things other than just hot chicks' a**es.'","Reddit message board 'CreepShots' came under fire for photos of women taken without their permission; around 40 per cent were underage .

"June 14: Costa Rica, 8pm, Estadio Castelao . June 19: England, 8pm, Arena de Sao Paulo . June 24: Italy, 5pm, Arena das Dunas . Follow all the action on MailOnline . Uruguay remain confident that Luis Suarez will be fit to face England on June 19 - despite the striker having an operation on a knee injury today. Sportsmail understands that officials believe the 27-year-old is unlikely to be fit for the World Cup opener against Costa Rica, but that he could play five days later. Suarez picked up the injury in training on Wednesday and underwent meniscus surgery on Thursday morning. Despite Uruguay's optimism, he could still miss the tournament, given the worst case scenario for this type of injury is 16 weeks on the sidelines. Out? Luis Suarez is touch and go for the World Cup after it was revealed he needs surgery on a knee injury . Major blow: Suarez is Uruguay's talisman and is set to miss the whole of the first stage . The . striker - who was voted PFA Player of the Year for his performances at . Liverpool this season - is Uruguay's talisman but is almost certain to . miss up to between four to six weeks. And, . in a direct boost to England's chances of progressing out of Group D, . Suarez may be out for the entirety of the first stage and beyond . following results of an MRI scan. A Uruguay FA official said: ‘It was all unexpected. The latest information is that we . are deciding what to do, but there are increased possibilities . (involving surgery). 'I can’t tell you anything more. The AUF (Uruguay . Federation) will announce it officially on Thursday morning.’ The South American's are fancied as potential dark horses and face Roy Hodgson's side as well as Italy and Costa Rica. Suarez was checked over by medical staff on Wednesday after picking up the knock in training just three weeks before the tournament starts in Brazil. The best case for Suarez is recovery within four to six weeks, but with the final 23-man squad needed to be ratified on June 2, it leaves the country with very little wiggle room. Any decision to include Suarez from there - not match fit - would represent a sizeable risk. They won't be encouraged to know that Fernando Torres underwent meniscus surgery prior to the 2010 World Cup in April and didn't play his first game for seven weeks. The worst case scenario for Suarez is a four-month lay-off, which would heavily impact on Liverpool's start to the next campaign. The Reds are aware of the injury but haven't been officially informed. It's your time again: Diego Forlan is set to become even more involved in the Uruguay frontline this summer . Knock: The Liverpool striker picked up the injury on Wednesday and was immediately sent for an MRI scan . Upset: The 27-year-old is having meniscus surgery on Thursday and could miss up to six weeks . Main man: Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani will have the task of firing the South Americans to glory . Luis Suarez: (77 caps, 38 goals) Edinson Cavani: (60 caps, 20 goals) Diego Forlan: (107 caps, 36 goals) Christian Stuani: (66 caps, 13 goals) Abel Hernandez: (11 caps, 7 goals) The 27-year-old arrived in Montevideo for training on Tuesday morning, feeling discomfort in a session with Oscar . Tabarez's squad on Wednesday but continuing before encountering the major problem . later in the evening. Roberto . Pastoriza, executive of the Uruguayan Football Association, confirmed . that they had attempted to keep the news under wraps. Developments heap more pressure on Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani, who will lead the line when they face Costa Rica on June 14. Veteran Diego Forlan - so impressive in South Africa four years ago - was expected to play a bit-part role but may now be needed alongside Cavani. They do still have other options, with Espanyol's Christian Stuani and Palermo's Abel Hernandez waiting in the wings. Since he signed for Liverpool in January 2011, he has not missed a single match because of fitness issues and has been regularly hailed by his team-mates and manager for his extraordinary durability and determination – he will always make himself available for training, even if he is carrying the type of slight tweak that would convince others to spend time in the medical room. Should Suarez be prevented from leading the 2010 semi-finalists in Brazil, he would be left distraught. The last time there was a major tournament in South America, the 27-year-old was the star of the show as Uruguay won the Copa America in 2011. Golden boot: Suarez was the Premier League top scorer and won the PFA Player of the Year award . 1987: Born January 24 in Salto, Uruguay. 2005: Makes professional debut with Montevideo club Nacional, scoring 12 goals in 29 games in his one and only season in South America. 2006: Signs for Dutch side FC Groningen and fires 10 goals in 29 appearances for the club. 2007: February 8 - Makes debut for Uruguay against Colombia and is sent off in the 85th minute.August - Joins Ajax in a deal reportedly worth 7.5million euros. 2010: May - Enjoys his most prolific season in Holland, with 35 goals in 33 Eredivisie matches.June - Scores three goals to help Uruguay reach the World Cup quarter-finals but is then sent off for a goal-line handball against Ghana in the last eight. Ghana miss the resulting penalty before Uruguay go on to triumph in a shoot-out. November - Banned for seven matches after being found guilty of biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal. 2011: January 28 - Liverpool agree a deal worth up to £22.8million with Ajax for Suarez. February 2 - Scores on his Liverpool debut in a 2-0 victory over Stoke at Anfield. July - Scores four goals and is named player of the tournament as Uruguay win Copa America. October 15 - Manchester United defender Patrice Evra makes an allegation that Suarez racially abused him during the 1-1 draw between Liverpool and United.

"ABC got the wind knocked out of its sails Tuesday when Nielsen revealed the network's evening news ratings have not beaten NBC's for the first time in 263 weeks, as they'd previously believed. News ratings for the week beginning September 29 were affected by a software error that created miscalculations of television viewership dating back to last March. Industry officials said the error meant ABC's viewership was consistently over-estimated. ABC got the wind knocked out of its sails Tuesday when Nielsen revealed the network's evening news ratings have not beaten NBC's for the first time in 263 weeks, as they'd previously believed . Nielsen had said last week that ABC's 'World News Tonight' had averaged 8.42 million viewers for the affected week to 8.25 million for NBC's 'Nightly News.' NBC hadn't lost a week since 2009. But in its review, Nielsen found that NBC actually won the week by 170,000 viewers. Nielsen's statistics serve as the foundation for billions of dollars in advertising spending for the entire broadcast industry. Nielsen executives said the errors only became apparent in the past few weeks when the beginning of a new television season meant more people were tuning in. 'The differences are small enough that those of us who look at these numbers every day and live by them didn't notice a difference,' said Patricia McDonough, Nielsen senior vice president for planning policy and analysis. Both networks issued statements Tuesday. NBC’s said: “We are pleased that the corrected numbers confirm that ‘NBC Nightly News’ is the No. 1 news broadcast in America, and has been for the last 265 weeks.” ABC’s said: “For us, it has always been about the viewer at the end of the day. ‘World News Tonight’ is in the tightest evening news race in several years and we’re honored the viewers are responding.” The mistakes came up in adjustments Nielsen makes to its ratings each day between an early morning estimate of viewers and a more complete accounting that is released late in the afternoon. The morning estimate doesn't account for schedule changes in individual markets and sometimes doesn't assign some market results to individual networks. NBC still #1: News ratings for the week beginning September 29 were affected by a software error that created miscalculations of television viewership dating back to last March. It was discovered that all of the unassigned viewing was mistakenly being credited to ABC, making that network's afternoon viewership estimates consistently higher than those reported earlier in the day. CBS research chief David Poltrack said his network became suspicious upon looking at ratings for 'Dancing with the Stars' on Sept. 22. Two big ABC affiliates, in New York and Chicago, carried the 'Monday Night Football' game that night between the Chicago Bears and New York Jets instead of 'Dancing.' When Nielsen adjusted its ratings to account for two large markets that did not carry 'Dancing,' it stood to reason that the show's ratings would drop with the more detailed afternoon accounting. Instead, the 'Dancing With the Stars' afternoon numbers went up. CBS began noticing a pattern of ABC ratings being adjusted upward in the afternoon and called it to Nielsen's attention, Poltrack said. It's unclear whether the errors are significant enough to impact advertising spending, which is based on Nielsen's estimates of how many people are watching individual shows. Nielsen said that in more than 98 percent of programs, the difference was 0.05 of a ratings point or lower.","NBC Nightly News and Brian Williams beat out ABC despite ratings that said otherwise, Nielsen revealed Tuesday .

"A post-mortem on the body of 14-year-old Alice Gross has failed to reveal how the schoolgirl died . Police believe that the chief suspect in the murder of Alice Gross may still be in Britain after it emerged today that they examined CCTV showing him withdrawing cash in Isleworth, west London, the day before he went missing. The new footage is said to show Latvian Arnis Zalkalns, 41, using a cash machine at a Co-op supermarket near where he worked as a jobbing labourer. It suggests that the convicted killer could still be in the country. News of the new footage comes as Scotland Yard announced that more tests will be conducted on the body of murdered teenager to establish how she died after a post-mortem failed to reach a conclusion. The 14-year-old's body was wrapped in plastic sheeting and covered with heavy wooden logs when it was found in shallow water in the River Brent in west London on Tuesday night. Today,  a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'The post-mortem examination into the murder of 14-year-old Alice Gross has now concluded. 'No cause of death has been given at this time and further tests are required.' Meanwhile, Alice's older sister, Nina, 19, hit out at the BBC for allowing 'political agendas' to exploit her private family tragedy. Miss Gross, who is to study at Cambridge next year, branded the BBC 'extremely insensitive' and 'horrible' for allowing her sister's death to be discussed in a debate on immigration issues on last night's Question Time programme. She tweeted: 'Now is not the time for these discussions; it is exceptionally insensitive to talk about these issues at this time. 'In future, please respect our wishes as we grieve. This is a personal tragedy which we want to deal with privately, rather than fearing anyone using it for any political agenda.' In a tweet to the BBC, Alice's sister went on to say: 'It is really insensitive and horrible that you have used our family's tragedy on Question Time.' Her complaints came last night after a member of the audience asked the Question Time panel if convicted criminals should be allowed freedom of movement across EU borders. Referring to prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns, host David Dimbleby said: 'This is, of course, referring to the hideous murder of Alice Gross and the person who is being sought, who is a convicted murder from Latvia.' Scroll down for video . Liberal Democrat MP Julian Huppert said: 'There was a catastrophic failure in this case, he should never have been allowed to come in. 'There is a computer system that's supposed to sort this out and for some reason it didn't happen.' He said the UK should work more closely with other countries and encourage information sharing to better understand who might be entering Britain, adding: 'We have to know who are the people that really shouldn't be coming in – let's keep them out.' Forensics officers descended upon the towpath near where Alice's body was found to look for evidence . Clad in body suits, the forensics team searched for evidence as the investigation into how Alice died continued . Police officers brought in sniffer dogs to scour the area around the River Brent where Alice's body was found . Alice's body was found buried in the River Brent in west London, near her home in Hanwell, on Tuesday night . Alice's older sister Nina, 19, pictured, left, with her sibling, accused the BBC of 'extreme insensitivity' for discussing her sister's death during a debate on immigration on the Question Time programme last night . Within minutes of Miss Gross' comments, dozens of social media users condemned the BBC's coverage and called for complaints to be made to Ofcom. Luke Adar wrote: 'Filled out a full complaint to the BBC, very disappointed that they found it appropriate to use this as a debate topic', while another social media user, Stefan Paetow, said: 'Lodge a complaint with Ofcom.' Rose Wiltshire said: 'Disgusted with BBC, they should respect your wishes. I'm so sorry for your loss', and Katie Brooks wrote: 'Really feel for @GrossNina and the family after that @bbcqt. Very insensitive timing and harsh to bring it down to another immigration debate!' Today, the programme was still available to view on BBC iPlayer, but a BBC spokesman issued another apology to the family, saying: 'We reiterate our profound apologies to the family of Alice Gross. 'Question Time is a topical discussion programme and we recognise the considerable public interest in the issues surrounding this tragedy. 'We applied careful and due consideration to our choice of question and attempted to deal with this matter as sensitively as possible. We will of course reflect on the family’s comments.' The prime suspect, Arnis Zalkalns, 41, left, may still be in the UK, police investigating Alice's murder believe . Schoolchildren gathered at the clock tower near Alice's home in Hanwell yesterday to pay tribute to her . The lack of a result from the examination at Uxbridge Mortuary is yet another delay in the case of the Year 10 pupil who went missing after leaving her home in Hanwell, west London, on 28 August saying she was going for a walk. Despite the Met launching the biggest search operation since the 7/7 bombings in 2005, her body is believed to have lain underwater for weeks in a stretch of river already combed by search specialists. Yesterday crowds of mourners flocked to the clock tower near Alice's home in Hanwell to lay flowers and tributes to the murdered Year 10 pupil. Alice's parents Jose Gross, 60, and Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, said they touched by the support they'd received since hearing the 'completely devastating' news that the body found in the river was their daughter's.","Post-mortem on the 14-year-old's body has concluded at Uxbridge mortuary .

"Jose Mourinho has criticised FIFA's 'Team of the Year' awards - by claiming they are bad for football. Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas are the two Chelsea players who have been shortlisted for the accolade. But Mourinho, speaking in his Friday press conference ahead of the trip to Sunderland on Saturday, said: 'When I see these trophies, I think they are not good for football. I don't care about it.

'Sometimes it seems we are looking for stars, people who are more important than other people and that is not the culture in this club. 'The mentality here is not to worry about that, even less be obsessed with that. When I see the names are Fabregas and Hazard, I think they don't think about it. 'They think about the team and try to win matches.' However, Mourinho was far more positive looking ahead to the match-up with Sunderland at the Stadium of Light which could see Chelsea move nine points clear at the top of the Premier League, at least temporarily. Diego Costa (centre) attempts to dispossess captain John Terry in training on Thursday . He continued: 'People are confident and happy to play the way they're playing. It's good. '(Complacency is) a risk we don't have. We have all the other risks - a bad period, injuries, unlucky matches, other teams' great evolution but complacency is not a risk we have. 'It is not the profile of this group. We were winning 5-0 against Schalke and in the 88th minute Eden Hazard made a sprint to defend. 'They've changed. There was a clear evolution in these young people. 'Yes, there's more to come. I think there is much more to come. 'It's a young team, with lots of young players. I have two more years of contract.

Sunderland ended Mourinho's 77-game unbeaten home record in the Barclays Premier League in April and also knocked them out of the Capital One Cup at the Stadium of Light last season. But Mourinho is still positive. He said: 'There's been lots of water under the bridge since then. It's a difficult game. 'What happened last season was an isolated situation. I really believe that. I go to this game worried about many things but not about what happened last season. 'That match was impossible to win - but we move on. We are happy with the way we're doing things.' Mourinho would not be drawn on whether or not Diego Costa is the best striker in the league . When asked if Diego Costa was the best striker in the Premier League, Mourinho refused to be drawn on such a debate. 'I am not in favour of this kind of situation,' he said. 'In some cases it looks like we're doing a political campaign and I don't think it's a good way. Is he a top striker? Yes he is.' And the Portuguese is extremely impressed by the whole of his squad - including those who are not currently getting a run in the side. He added: 'My untouchables now are the ones that are not playing. They are responsible for what we are doing. I do not have one who is not training hard, behaving well.

When asked why his squad is not picking up the injuries which appear to have ravaged the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United, Mourinho put it down to plain luck. 'We also struggle to keep them fit. We work hard and try our best. It is a bit of everything including luck. You need luck. 'Things can change very quick. We are not in a position to say we do not care about certain competitions. 'For us, every compn is important and every match important. We try to play with our best team. We need a bit of luck also.'

"Louis van Gaal will share a drink with Sir Alex Ferguson when he arrives at Manchester United as he sets his sights on returning the Premier League trophy to Old Trafford. The current Holland national team manager has signed a three-year deal to take charge at United after this summer's World Cup in Brazil. The 62-year-old has a proven track record of success having won league crowns with Ajax, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar and Bayern Munich but will chat with his friend Ferguson to gain the inside knowledge on how to prosper at United.

First target: Louis van Gaal has vowed to regain the Premier League title during his first season at Manchester United after being officially appointed on Monday . First assignment: Van Gaal is currently preparing to lead Holland at the World Cup finals in Brazil . 'I will certainly go for a drink with him,' Van Gaal said on Dutch TV. 'I've often done it before. We are like each other, I always put more pressure on myself than other people do.' His first task will be to restore confidence at United after a disappointing season in which they finished seventh. Asked what his objectives were, Van Gaal said: 'That they are back as soon as possible at spot number one, (that) they (fans) will think they are champions of England again within a year. 'Spain saw me succeed in my first year and in Germany as well. In England, it must also be possible. 'But there can only be one champion. I would be proud if it works right away.'

Van Gaal may now be switching his immediate attention to the World Cup in Brazil but he has reportedly already handed United a list of transfer targets. The Dutchman, however, also has a fine reputation for bringing through youngsters and he intends to give youth its chance again at United. 'You do not only do it with stars, but also with youth players,' said Van Gaal, who will succeed the sacked David Moyes. Youngster Adnan Januzaj, whose emergence was one of the most positive aspects of Moyes' ill-fated reign, is looking forward to working with the new manager. The 19-year-old said: 'He is an excellent coach, who has won a lot of prizes. I think United are facing a bright future.' Looking ahead: Adnan Januzaj has called Van Gaal an 'excellent' coach and is looking forward to working with him . One of Van Gaal's first jobs has been to appoint Ryan Giggs as his assistant. The long-serving Giggs, 40, has ended his glittering 24-season playing career to take up the opportunity. Januzaj said: 'Giggs is very important to us. He gets a lot of respect and also helps me constantly.' Right-hand man: Ryan Giggs has been appointed Van Gaal's assistant at United . United are still to clarify the future of two of Moyes' backroom staff in coach Phil Neville and goalkeeping coach Chris Woods. It is also unclear whether Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who came into the first-team coaching set-up during Giggs' recent four-match spell as interim manager, will still have prominent roles. Butt had previously been working in the club's youth structure while Scholes, who retired as a player a year ago, was brought in by Giggs.","New boss will meet former boss to gain insider knowledge .

West Ham released a DVD after Tottenham were shocked 3-0 at home in the Barclays Premier League in October, and it only got worse for Spurs as the season went on. They were knocked out of the Capital One Cup at White Hart Lane by the Hammers in December before losing 2-0 at Upton Park in the League in May. But it was an otherwise abject season for Sam Allardyce's side though as they finished 13th with 40 points, having come 10th with 46 the season before. Tottenham, in contrast, finished sixth with 69 points - 29 ahead of their London rivals. A West Ham fans' Twitter account, @whustuff, posted a picture of the shirt with the words: 'Beating them was nice but this is embarrassing.'

"IN YOUR PRIME, OLDER, WISER, HAPPIER by India Knight (Fig Tree £16.99) India Knight confronts the grim choice between the bonkers Botox look of startled fixity or the equally unappealing wrinkly alternative . The question of what it means to get older is endlessly discussed in the media, yet it remains strangely uncharted territory. There are plenty of novels on the subject — mostly rather autumnal in tone — and a plethora of off-putting books on the menopause. But when it comes to ideas on how to make the best of the second bit of life, there is a curious dearth of inspiration. How to escape the curse of the elasticated waistband, not to mention the grim choice between the bonkers Botox look of startled fixity or the equally unappealing wrinkly alternative? What are the rules of dating at 50? And how do you keep your sanity when you are menopausal, your teenage children have taken up shoplifting and/or underage drinking and your parents are losing their marbles? Having written books on dieting, shopping and thrift, the columnist India Knight has decided to explore what she encouragingly calls the prime of life. ‘This is a book designed to function as a sort of manual,’ she writes. It’s got advice about bras and Botox and advice about ailing parents, care homes and dementia. It tells you what make-up to buy and how to be a better step-parent. She covers middle-aged sex and dating and lots of other topics, too, in similar forthright fashion — from what to wear (navy, apparently. And leopard print. And trainers. Though possibly not all at the same time) to surviving the menopause, and how to be a good friend to someone who is ill (alas, the prime of life is also the moment when what a friend of mine calls The Organ Recital starts tuning up with a vengeance). She begins with Beauty and Maintenance or, as the sub-heading cheerily has it, ‘navigating the passage from nymph to nana’. This is an excellent place to start, because the great conundrum of middle age (as of that other transitional stage, adolescence), is that suddenly you don’t know who you are. Your previous certainties are thrown into confusion as the clothes, make-up and hair styles that have helped you present a confident face to the world for the past three decades now look bizarrely wrong. Knight tackles this intractable problem with an engaging mixture of ribaldry and sage advice — urging the supreme importance of taking good care of one’s teeth, hair and feet as one advances towards old age. £18k is the average amount a woman spends on her face in a lifetime . This is not, it must be said, a book for those trying to keep their end up on a budget. The pages are filled with variations on the theme of ‘prices are, as you’d expect, not cheap’. But even if you can’t afford the John Frieda haircut, the £250 dental bleaching treatment or the Creme de la Mer moisturiser, it’s worth reading on. For a writer so exhilaratingly worldly, Knight has an unexpectedly bracing streak of common sense and an even more surprising emphasis on kindness. The more ghastly the situation, the more strongly she insists on good behaviour. ‘Let it go. Let it gooooo,’ she urges in her section on divorce. ‘All the bad/mad/annoying things are in the past. The only person you’re harming by harping on about them is you — and, if you do it within their earshot, your children.’ Author India Knight . She has a fund of equally sensible advice on dealing with teenage children, stepchildren and frail parents. (Though given her Twitter bust-up with her former chum, Liz Jones of this parish, it is predictable that her views should be considerably tougher when it comes to culling friends whose sell-by date is past.) ‘Some people mature like wine... and some turn to vinegar, I’m afraid, causing you to want to spit them out,’ she writes. K night is tremendously opinionated, but there is something strangely comforting about her robust certainty. Reading her book is like having a conversation with a fearfully bossy but beloved old chum. You may disagree with her views on the wrongness of Pointlessly Long Hair, or feel irritated by her relentless plugging of unfeasibly expensive Vi-Spring beds. But just as you’re about to lose patience, she comes out with something so funny or endearing or just plain right (‘the supreme importance of an excellent funeral’, for example), that you can’t help but forgive her. And when it comes to living well, taking care of your teeth, being kind to your loved ones and wearing leopard skin in moderation is pretty good advice at any age.","What it means to get older is endlessly discussed in the media .

"Prince Andrew this week said foreign firms should invest in Britain, not other European nations, because 'unlike them it is open for business' Prince Andrew has risked causing another political controversy by poking fun at EU nations plunged into chaos by the collapse of the euro. The Duke of York told entrepreneurs at the Davos summit in Switzerland that foreign firms should invest in Britain, not other European nations, because ‘unlike them it is open for business’. And he boasted it had another huge advantage – its own currency, not the ailing euro. Fresh questions were being raised about the Prince's attendance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he is staying in a luxury ski chalet - at the expense of the taxpayer, it has emerged. His controversial remarks were made at a private . cocktail party at the conference, attended by international . political and business leaders.

Government-backed body. Prince . Andrew was forced to quit the role last year following disclosures in . The Mail on Sunday about his friendship with US billionaire Jeffrey . Epstein, a convicted sex offender. But . he was allowed to maintain a lower-profile role and was guest of honour . at its reception for British business leaders in Davos on Thursday. According . to witnesses, he said in his welcoming speech: ‘The message to get . across here tonight is that Britain is open for business – unlike one or . two other countries I could mention.’ To warm applause, he added: ‘And what is more, we have our own currency!’ A man sleeps before a panel session at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland, where Prince Andrew this week gave his speech . Controversial: Prince Andrew (left) has held a one-to-one meeting with President Ilham Aliyev (right), the billionaire dictator of Azerbaijan . One . businessman said: ‘He knew he was chancing his arm a bit but most of us . thought his comments were great. That is what he is there for, to bang . the drum for Britain. ‘If any European takes umbrage at what he said, they lack a sense of humour.’ The . Duke of York has made hundreds of trips to promote Britain. But his . role was dogged by claims of lavish spending. A spokeswoman declined to . comment. Questions have been raised over . Prince Andrew's role at the World Economic Forum, six months after he . was forced to stand down at UK trade envoy over his friendship wit a . convicted sex offender.

So . far he has given a dinner for Indonesian businessmen, hosted a reception . for UK trade delegates - including George Osborne - and held a . one-to-one meeting with President Ilham Aliyev, the billionaire dictator . of Azerbaijan. This is despite him being forced to . stand down as the UK's Special Representative for International Trade . last July, amid controversy over his friendship with sex-offender . Jeffrey Epstein and his close links with despots. The 51-year-old Duke has been accompanied to the event by two publicly-funded aides and royal protection officers. Yesterday, he was spotted going in . skiing in nearby Klosters, where he is staying in a luxury, . eight-bedroom chalet - accommodation which could up to £39,000. The bill for the chalet - which . features its own chef, chauffeur, sauna and steam room - could cost . anything between £21,000 and £39,000, and it is expected to be paid for . out of taxpayers' pockets. The latest revelation about Prince Andrew has sparked outrage amongst his critics. Shadow . Justice Minister Chris Bryant told the Sunday Mirror: 'I thought we had . dispensed with his services. There were plenty of UK representatives - . David Cameron, George Osborne, Andrew Mitchell - who could have all met . with Aliyev if it was in our national interests. 'At a time when everybody is feeling . the pinch, it's shocking Prince Andrew still thinks he should be . entitled to an eight-bedroom mansion.' The Duke's meeting with President . Aliyev only emerged through Azerbaihan state news agency, which released . a picture of the pair together. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace . said Andrew had been invited to the World Economic Forum and was . attending in his capacity as a senior member of the Royal family.

"Gareth Bale looked fresh enough to go out and do it all again. This is how it must feel to be high on the euphoria of an unstoppable rise to the top of the world. It had just gone midnight in the concrete underbelly of the Stadium of Light and his eyes sparkled as Bale tried to explain the emotion of scoring the goal Real Madrid have waited 12 years to score. ‘When you’re a little boy you dream of lifting the Champions League trophy and to lift the 10th one for Real Madrid is special,’ said Bale, pausing en route to the carefully choreographed celebrations waiting in the Spanish capital.

Top of the world: Gareth Bale has dreamed of lifting the Champions League since he was a boy . Matchwinner: Bale heads in the vital goal during extra time . Delivered: The £86m man has been excellent in his first year in Spain playing a key role in two final wins . ‘It’s hard to describe what it felt like. Seeing all the fans and all the players run over, it was amazing. It’s the reason I joined Real Madrid to play in competitions like this and be able to win them. For me it’s a dream come true.’ The £86m man became the first Welshman to score in the European Cup final and the 20th Briton.

Phil Neal (2), Kenny Dalglish, Trevor Francis, John  Robertson, Alan . Kennedy, Peter Withe, Teddy Sheringham, Steve McManaman, Steven Gerrard, . Sol Campbell, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney. So many expensive footballers have pulled on the pristine white shirt without being able to achieve what Bale, the most expensive of them all, has done in his first season in Spain. David Beckham, Kaka, Robinho, Fabio Cannavaro, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Mesut Ozil and Michael Owen have all come and gone, unable to deliver what Bale delivered.

No-one will quibble with the £86million world-record transfer fee again. Not for the first time in the last 12 months, he must wonder where this breakneck journey is going to take him. From Footballer of the Year to the Bernabeu Stadium, the winner in the Copa del Rey final and now the pivotal strike in the Champions League final. What better way to celebrate all this than with a showpiece at the Cardiff City Stadium where Real Madrid will face Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup on August 12, a week before Tottenham set out on yet another Europa League campaign. It promises to be an emotional homecoming for the Welshman, who could captain his country for the first time in a friendly against Holland in Amsterdam next week. United they stand: Bobby Charlton, George Best (below left) and Brian Kidd (below right) all scored in 1968 . Bringing it up to date: Wayne Rooney (left) scored in 2011 and Frank Lampard bagged a goal in 2008 . Parents Frank and Debbie were numb with a heady mix of shock and pride as they climbed aboard an early-morning flight in Lisbon Sunday. They had spoken to their son on the phone but did not have time to see him. Bale was being whisked through his media responsibilities before flying back to Madrid with his team-mates. By 4am yesterday morning, he was sharing photos of the victory party with his three  million followers on Twitter. On his way out of the stadium, he seemed bashful, reluctant to talk too much about the most amazing night of his professional life. Many team-mates left wearing their white Real match shirts or specially printed ‘La Decima’ T-shirts. Bale was slick in his black club suit and skinny tie, toilet bag tucked under an arm and the silver gong dangling from his neck on a blue ribbon. King of Europe: Kenny Dalglish scored the winner for Liverpool in the 1978 European Cup final .

Lisbon Lions: Tommy Gemmell (left) and Steve Chalmers both scored in the 1967 win against Inter Milan . He had the medal, he had his hands on the trophy every footballer wants and he had made such a vital contribution, once Sergio Ramos had saved Real from heartbreak with the stoppage-time header that took the game into extra time. Without Ramos, this would have been a tale of woe for Bale; emptiness after a promising first campaign in Spain, cast as a villain, having snatched at two glorious chances, one in each half of normal time, and missed them both. He had not played well. ‘A few thoughts crept into my mind,’ said Bale. ‘We have been like that all season. We’ve been down in the last minute and always been able to come up with a crucial goal and we showed it again. We kept believing in the football we play and we came out on top.’ The concept of extra time might have been designed for Bale and Angel di Maria to showcase their phenomenal reserves of stamina and pace against wilting opponents. Ups and downs: Bale missed a number of good chances before eventually getting on the scoresheet . Atletico were grinding to a standstill with players barely able to run, hobbling and limping. Dotted around the pitch were red-and-white shirted shapes stretching muscles as calves and hamstrings cramped. Then came Bale’s moment; an hour and 50 minutes into a gripping final. It typified his boundless energy and desire as he followed in Di Maria’s run and shot as it spun high from the left boot of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Despite those earlier misses, he refused to hide. ‘You have to keep persisting,’ said Bale, but few would have noticed had he been jogging up the pitch rather than sprinting from half-way in anticipation. This was the hard part, to be where he was at that stage of the game. ‘He turned up when he was needed,’ said manager Carlo Ancelotti, who boldly predicts the Wales international, without a World Cup summer, will be an even greater force next season. Persistent: Bale refused to hide despite those earlier misses . The finish was relatively simple: a big spring and a cushion header from a yard or so. ‘Don’t miss,’ smiled Bale, when asked later what had flashed through his mind at that precise moment. He did not. This was far removed from Bale’s exhilarating solo goal to win the Copa del Rey against Barcelona last month and yet so much more precious to a club obsessed with this 10th European title. It destroyed Atletico to such an extent that they collapsed and conceded two more, scored by Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo. It was to all intents and purposes the killer strike — the winner — although everyone in the Real camp seemed mightily relieved when Ronaldo engineered and then converted a penalty and spared them all the inevitable sulk. Room to improve: Carlo Ancelotti said the Welshman can be even better next season . ‘He obviously got on the score-sheet and that was important for us,’ said Bale, diplomatically. After all, the stage had been set for Ronaldo’s night in Lisbon. His penalty was his 17th goal in Champions League campaign, a record. His personal numbers are staggering but not even the self-important shirtless and muscle-flexing celebration of the fourth goal could distract from the fact this triumph was about more than one man. The perfect 10th was also about Iker Casillas and Ramos and Di Maria and Marcelo. It was about Ancelotti and it was about Bale. Nine months after leaving Tottenham he could not have dared to hope for more.","Bale said he dreamed of lifting the Champions League when he was a boy .

"Introducing Tinderella, the anonymous British writer who, after moving to New York, decided to set up her own dating blog chronicling her dating escapades in the Big Apple. Little did she know however that her blog – which she started to keep her friends at home in London updated with her love life – would become an internet hit with women emailing her nonstop for dating advice. ‘When I moved to New York, my London friends were a bit panicky that there would be no dating disasters to point and laugh at on a regular basis,’ she said, 'So I set up the blog.' Tinderella is looking for the one in the Big Apple, she says that she hopes to find her Prince Charming on the dating app. Tinder users (left) can swipe left for those they don't fancy and right for those they do . ‘Tinder was never part of the plan, I’d actually never heard of it until my second night in New York. I decided to download it and became completely hooked. Now Tinderella has become much bigger than it was ever intended to be!’ But teh 20something she says that even though her close friends and family know about it, she plans to remain anonymous, ‘To avoid potential murder from some of the more unhinged dates that I have written about… . Tinderella continued, ‘One of my dates – who I named Worst Person on Tinder - turned out to be a jui-jitsuer and I now carry a small amount of fear wherever I go that he might be around the corner with a karate chop for my head.’ Tinder is a dating app that first became popular in 2013. The app allows you to scroll through a large number of profiles swiping right for people you like the look of and left for those you don’t. Tinderella blogs about her dating experiences. She uses a rating system and describes her dates clothing, however, she does not use their real names instead giving them code Tinder names . Luckily for Tinderella she says that so far only one match has worked out who she is (and he probably shouldn’t have been messaging her in the first place). ‘I received a text from a man I call Married Tinder [because he’s married] saying, ‘You wrote about me’, which was a little terrifying. I’d rather hoped we might never speak again. ‘Apparently someone that he matched with on Tinder sent him the link to the blog asking if it was him. Luckily, since he was married and lying about it, I figured I still maintained the moral high-ground…’ Tinderella says some dates are worse that others. She's even met a married man on the app who discovered her true identity (posed by models) Tinderella explains that when she first downloaded Tinder the excitement and novelty of it led her to go on three or four dates a week. But now she’s chooses a little more carefully, ‘I’ve accepted that my soulmate probably isn’t in a strip bar, or in Brooklyn, so I’m a lot more picky with who I date. And she’s still hopeful that she will meet ‘the one’ on the dating app. She said, ‘It would be lovely to tell my grandchildren that my husband and I met on the moorlands when he rescued me on horseback from a vicious storm, but as I don’t frequent moorlands I’m grateful for Tinder. ‘I hear of Tinder romances and engagements all the time, so I’m very hopeful that my 6’2”, gorgeous, kind, witty writer is going to appear on Tinder any day now. But for now she says that writing about bad dates makes up for having to go on them, ‘The worst date I ever had was with Worst Person on Tinder and I wrote about it immediately. ‘Writing about a bad date is fun, and is the only retribution for having been present at said bad date. ‘It’s a lot harder to write about heartbreak… I don’t want the blog to turn into a mopey pity party, so I needed a little distance before I was able to write about Boston Tinder. And as for Tinderella’s future plans she revealed, ‘I’d love to turn the blog into a fictional book one day. 'Right now I am currently working on a feminist’s guide to online dating which has been borne out of the many emails that I receive from readers asking for dating advice, and the hours I put in with friends to help them with their tinder profiles.' She added, 'I seem to be pretty good at helping others with their dating lives… now I just need to find someone who will fix mine! The thought of telling my perfect match about the blog though fills me with absolute dread.'","'Tinderella' started  blog to keep  friends updated with her love life .

"Roger Federer has been getting used to early exits at grand slams but rated his French Open loss to Ernests Gulbis as the most disappointing of the lot. Having made 36 consecutive slam quarter-finals, Federer has failed to reach the last eight at three of the last four tournaments. The sequence ended at Wimbledon last summer with his stunning second-round loss to Sergiy Stakhovsky while he was then beaten in the fourth round at the US Open by Tommy Robredo. Bowing out: Roger Federer fell to Latvia's Ernests Gulbis in five sets at Roland Garros . Giant-slayer: Gulbis claimed the biggest scalp of his career by beating Federer in the fourth round . In Paris, Federer came out on the wrong end of a five-set battle with Gulbis in round four, losing 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. 'For every match you can't necessarily explain why you lost,' said Federer. 'Sometimes . you're more disappointed, sometimes less. I'm not mad, but I'm not . happy, either. Because I missed too many opportunities. I did not play . like I wanted to play. 'This time I was in good shape, and I think I could have done better. That's why I'm probably even more disappointed this time.' Gulbis . appears to have left his playboy reputation behind him, if not his . penchant for causing controversy, and is finally living up to his . considerable talent. From . outside the top 130 in the rankings at the start of last season, Gulbis . has climbed to a career-high 17 and is unbeaten in France this year . having won titles in Marseille and last week in Nice. He said: 'It's probably the most important win, especially because it was five sets. 'I . beat him before, but it was a three-set match. So for my confidence and . just for me as a tennis player, a five-set win over Roger Federer, it's . really big.' Hard yards: Roger Federer during his five-set round three match against Ernests Gulbis at the French Open . Wasted talent: Gulbis, from Latvia, admits he hasn't utilised his potential yet but is starting to impress at 25 . Next up: Tomas Berdych is Gulbis's last-eight opponent after the Czech beat John Isner on Sunday . The lightbulb moment for Gulbis came at a Challenger tournament in Eckental in Germany in November 2012. 'I asked for a wild card,' he said. 'I . didn't get the wild card. I had to play qualifying. I made the final . there, so it was an okay week, but it was the end of the year and in the . middle of nowhere. 'It . was winter, it was really depressing, and I thought, ""I start to do . something or for what I do this""? So that was one big question. This is . the answer.' Gulbis . probably should have won the opening set but Federer fought back, and . the outcome might have been very different had the Swiss taken either of . two set points serving at 5-3 in the second. On . the first Gulbis admitted he got lucky as Federer sent a smash right to . him, but three points later the Latvian had the break back and he went . on to win the set on a tie-break. Another key moment came with Federer leading 5-2 in the fourth set. Gulbis . went off court for treatment to his back and hamstring and, although . Federer did take the set, his momentum had gone and a service break at . the start of the decider ultimately cost him the match. Federer . was suspicious Gulbis may have used the break tactically, saying: 'He . didn't look hurt in any way. But if you can use it, you might as well do . it.' Gulbis, though, insisted that was not the case. Feisty: Gulbis shows the remnants of his racket after smashing it on the clay at Roland Garros . Gracious: Federer congratulates Gulbis as his opponent goes on to face Tomas Berdych in the quarter-finals . 'I'm . not big on medical time-outs,' he said. 'I don't like to take it, but I . take it when it's really necessary. It probably was my third medical . time-out in my life.' The . crowd willed their favourite Federer on, and Gulbis admitted the . hostility towards him had curbed the wilder side of his personality - . not withstanding one broken racquet. 'One is nothing for me,' said the 25-year-old with a grin. The . Latvian moves on to play sixth seed Tomas Berdych, who continued his . impressive progress through the draw with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win over John . Isner. Federer will have . a week to spend with his family before defending his title on grass in . Halle and then moving on to Wimbledon, where he believes he is a genuine . title contender. He said: 'Mentally I have already switched to the grass. 'I . think when I'm healthy, like I have been now for the last six to nine . months, I think clearly I can decide the outcome of the matches more . than I could last year. So I'm very excited about my chances for . Wimbledon now this time.'","Gulbis fought back from a set down to beat Federer in five sets .

"A 28-year-old man had unprotected sex with a woman seven times without telling her he was HIV-positive, police have said. Daniel Cleaves, from Henrico, Virginia, met the woman in a bar in downtown Bethesda, Maryland in July and had sex with her seven times over three days, according to court documents. The woman only learned of Cleaves' HIV-positive status when she found medical tests in his backpack revealing his diagnosis. She then confronted him over text message. 'Do you have HIV?' her text message read, MyFoxPhilly reported. He replied: 'No, why?' Scroll down for video . Accused: Daniel Cleaves, pictured left in a mug shot and right, allegedly had sex with a woman 7 times without telling her he had HIV. Three other women have claimed he sexually assaulted them in other incidents . When she said she knows he does, he responded: 'I should have told you... I am truly sorry, I am not a criminal. I am not a bad person. I just made a mistake.' He added: 'It doesn't mean you have HIV though.' The woman, who has not been identified, added that she was going to get tested for the virus before telling him he had committed a crime. 'I know,' he texted her back. 'You can do what you want.' The victim went to police on July 31. She told them that Cleaves never offered or asked to use a condom. Sick: He allegedly met the woman in a bar in downtown Bethesda, pictured, in July before having sex with her - but she only found out about his diagnosis after finding medical tests in his backpack . He was arrested last week and faces seven counts of knowingly having and attempting to transfer HIV to a victim in Montgomery County, Maryland. Cleaves, pictured in a mug shot from Virginia, is still being investigated in three previous sexual assaults . Police will not reveal whether the woman did contract the virus due to medical record privacy laws. Investigators have searched his home and seized medical documents and medication, according to a search warrant. Cleaves has also been accused in separate sexual assaults in Richmond and Virginia Beach, although no charges have yet been brought in those counties, NBC12 reported. His first alleged victim claims she met him in September 2013 while out in Richmond, where she blacked out several times after drinking. She told police he took her to his home and raped her. A second woman claims he sexually assaulted her at her home in Richmond after a night of drinking, NBC reported. Then in March this year, a third woman met Cleaves on a dating website and he sexually assaulted her at a hotel in Virginia Beach, she claimed. None of the victims indicated whether Cleaves had disclosed his HIV status, although one of the victims later read an internet post indicating that he had the virus, NBC12 reported. The investigations remain active. Cleaves posted bond and is awaiting his next court date. If convicted, he could face up to three years in prison on each count as well as a $2,500 fine, WTVR reported.
