"By . Damien Gayle . The future looks rosé for a Midland hotel which is to sell off some of a hitherto untapped cache of incredibly rare wines, champagnes and spirits - some over 100 years old. Bosses hope that an auction of just 100 bottles will make thousands towards the upkeep of the 500-year-old Evesham Hotel, in Evesham, Worcestershire. The sell-off, organised by Littleton Auctions of Evesham, is expected to reach a crescendo when two bottles of highly sought-after 1914 Hine Grande Champagne brandy will go under the hammer. 'I knew I was looking at something special': David Field, general manager at the Evesham Hotel in Evesham, Worcestershire, stumbled across the cache shortly after joining the business six months ago . Perfectly kept: Bosses hope an auction of just 100 bottles will make thousands towards the hotel's upkeep . Massive collection: The sell-off, organised by Littleton Auctions of Evesham, is expected to reach a crescendo when two bottles of highly sought-after 1914 Hine Grande Champagne brandy go under the hammer . Regarded by experts as the brandy equivalent of Penny Black stamps, they are expected to go under the hammer for £3,000 each. Hotel manager David Field, who stumbled across the cache shortly after joining the business six months ago, said: 'The fact that it's the centenary of The Great Way has added to the Champagne's value. 'I have visions of a well-heeled, patriotic couple popping the cork and raising a glass to the fallen.' The unique collection was amassed by hotel owner John Jenkinson, 65, who has spent 40 years scouring the world for rare tipples.

"England star Adam Lallana faces having to knock down a £40,000 football pitch built in his back garden, because it doesn't have proper planning permission. The Southampton captain, who is set to play for England in the World Cup in Brazil before joining Liverpool, commissioned the large area to be built in the garden of his home in Hampshire. The 26-year-old had planned to use the astro turf pitch - which also doubles as a basketball court - for ‘kickabouts’ with his young family. England footballer Adam Lallana faces having to knock down a £40,000 football pitch built in his back garden, because it doesn't have proper planning permission. Pictured is neighbour Brian Riley . But the fenced off area has been developed without proper planning permission. One of the footballer's neighbours has since complained to their local council and MP about the scale of the development which prompted planning officials to look into the matter. They discovered the height of the multi-use games area, in particular the basketball hoops and back boards, was beyond permitted development rules and required planning consent. Lallana will either have to adjust it or submit a retrospective application for consideration. If this fails, under planning law, he could be ordered to demolish the construction. Lallana, who is currently in Miami with the England squad, is said to be considering the latter option. The row started after he built a separate wooden play area in his garden with permission. But then the football pitch which is similar to fenced-off games areas seen in most towns and which cost between £40,000 to £60,000 to build, was added. Lallana will either have to adjust it or submit a retrospective application for consideration . Brian Riley, who lives next door to Mr Lallana’s £1.5 million five bedroom house said he is concerned about the prospect of noisy sports matches. Mr Riley, who has lived with his wife Constance at their home for more than 20 years, said: 'We didn’t object to this application, why would we? We understand kids need somewhere to play. 'But then we saw builders and welders arrive on site and we couldn’t work out what was going on. We saw this sports pitch being built and we just couldn’t believe it. 'The council enforcement officer told us it was more in-keeping with a council play park than a garden in a special character area, which this area is. 'He was given 28 days to submit a planning application but that deadline has gone. 'He’s done nothing and the council haven’t taken any further action.' Giles Moir, development management manager at East Dorset District Council, said: 'Every applicant is dealt with in exactly the same way. Lallana commissioned the large area to be built in the garden of his home in Hampshire . But council officers discovered the height of the multi-use games area, in particular the basketball hoops and back boards, was beyond permitted development rules and required planning consent . Brian Riley, who lives next door to Mr Lallana's £1.5 million five bedroom house said he is concerned about the prospect of noisy sports matches . 'Our enforcement team have been in contact with the agent and we anticipate an application for the multi-use games area very soon.' Mike Hirsh, a planning consultant acting for Mr Lallana, said: 'The area of hard standing to be used as a knock-about pitch has been agreed by East Dorset District Council as ‘permitted development’ and does not need planning permission. 'The majority of the fencing is two metres or less in height and also does not need planning permission. 'Over the small goal areas fencing has been raised to support a basketball hoop. Technically that part needs planning permission as it is more than two metres in height. Star in the making: Lallana broke into the England side after impressing for Southampton . 'My client went around to the neighbour and apologised and has asked a landscape architect to mitigate the visual impact of the hoop.' Mr Lallana moved into his current house two years ago after failing with plans to extend his former home in Highcliffe, near Christchurch. But the footballer, who is said to earn £50,000 pounds a week, is likely to be moving again soon as he is widely tipped to join Liverpool FC this summer in a deal worth £25 million.","Lallana planned to use pitch for .

"By . Leon Watson . What did the Benefits Street star do when she was asked to do stand-up? She stuck her hand out. And that's what happened when White Dee was asked to do a routine in her home city of Birmingham. Comic turn: White Dee, real name Deirdre Kelly, from the Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street, outside her home on James Turner Street in Birmingham . It didn't all go to plan for the mother-of-two though, on the night four other comedians made her the butt of their jokes. One even cracked even cracked a joke about the jobless 42-year-old having 'the ambition and drive of a Fiat Punto'. But the Channel 4 star - whose real name Deirdre . Kelly -  took the abuse in good heart and gave back as good as she got. She spent four hours on stage in front of 400 people at the £17.50-a-head event. During that time Ms Kelly, who appeared for free, cracked jokes about her life on handouts, The Sun reported. She told the crowd: 'I thought I'd just come up here and sit on a chair - just like I do all day long anyway.' White Dee received some friendly abuse when she did stand-up, but took it all in good heart . Speaking about having to leave her children at home, she quipped: 'It's tough being a working mum.' Maureen Younger said: 'She's the queen of Benefits Street. She's got the ambition and drive of a Fiat Punto.' She told comedian and former MTV host Richard Blackwood, 42: 'I used to really fancy you. I'd give you a good going over.' Talking about burglaries in her street, Miss Kelly said: 'People obviously think I'm still skint, my house is fine.' Afterward she told a fan: 'It was great making people laugh. Most of the other comedians were rubbish.' Miss Kelly, who is rumoured to have . had some of her benefits frozen after it emerged she was being paid to . do promotional work, has been receiving around £20,000 a year in welfare . payments. The single mother angered taxpayers after insisting she would continue claiming handouts until the Government stops her. Last month it emerged she had turned down four job opportunities, claiming they were 'too boring' among other excuses. After . being given trial runs at four potential careers near her home in . Birmingham, the 42-year-old declined to pursue any of them. She is reported to be receiving £214 a . week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance - formerly . known as incapacity benefit - child tax credit and child benefit, plus . £500 a month in housing benefit. Miss Kelly said she does feel guilty . about claiming handouts, maintaining it is her depression that has . stopped her from taking on full-time roles.","Four other comedians made White Dee the butt of their jokes .

"By . John Drayton . Frank Ribery remains a huge doubt for France ahead of the World Cup, but if he doesn't make it Samir Nasri won't be considered as a replacement. The Bayern Munich midfielder was named in the 23-man squad to travel to Brazil on Monday but there is uncertainty as to whether he will recover from an ongoing back problem. Remy Cabella of Montpellier - once a target for Newcastle - and Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette are likely to fight it out for the standby spot should Ribery not make it. Potential big miss: Frank Ribery is struggling to make this month's World Cup with an ongoing back injury . Relaxed: Samir Nasri has been away on holding with his girlfriend and won't be called up on standby . French woe: Coach Didier Deschamps said they would 'do everything possible' to get their talisman ready . The 31-year-old winger missed the comfortable 4-0 friendly victory over Norway at the Stade de France on Tuesday. He was then an unused substitute during the disappointing 1-1 draw against Paraguay. The French Football Federation are reported to have set a deadline of Friday for Ribery to prove his fitness, but are likely to give the player as long as he needs. In theory Deschamps has up until 24 hours before the opening game against Honduras on June 15 to name a replacement. The former Chelsea midfielder said earlier this week that they would 'do everything possible to get him ready.' Real Sociedad winger Antoine Griezmann will be given an opportunity in Ribery's absence. The developments might have opened the door for a sensational return from the cold for Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri, who was initially left out. That was a decision to anger his girlfriend Anara Atanes, who caused a twitter-storm after tweeting 'F*** France and F*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager' after the news. The coach has filed a civil law suit against the model and it remains highly unlikely that Nasri - who has been in Dubai - will be included.

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Raheem Sterling has played for only 38 minutes in three warm-up games but his thrilling displays in training are fuelling the idea that the teenage winger can give England an added dimension at the World Cup. Liverpool team-mate Glen Johnson is among those who believe Sterling might be a secret weapon, having been under wraps, due to the red card soon after he came on against Ecuador and which banned him from the 0-0 draw against Honduras. 'That would be ideal, if people don’t know what he’s capable of and underestimate him a bit,' said Johnson. Secret weapon: Glen Johnson believes Raheem Sterling (right) can spring a surprise at the World Cup . 'That would definitely work in our favour. Hopefully people will underestimate him and then he can prove them wrong. 'He was on fire in training on Friday and he looks like he has been around the squad for years. When he gets on the ball you can see he has learnt the game quickly and he can hurt teams. He’s probably the quickest in the squad over 10 yards. 'He has looked good all year. He’s a young kid who is willing to learn about the game and he should just get better.' Sterling may yet be an asset weapon best used from the bench against teams drained by the heat anticipated in some parts of Brazil, including Manaus where England open the Group D fixtures against Italy on Saturday. With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain still an injury doubt for the tournament, Sterling is expected to feature at some point in the group games. In action: Johnson reckons Sterling is one of the quickest players in the squad and looks like he has been part of the England set-up for 'years' Like Sterling, the Ox was also at the Sun Life Stadium to watch the Honduras game. He has been able to walk around at times this weekend without a protective knee brace, but it was strapped on last night as the squad left the arena for the airport. Roy Hodgson has until Friday to decide if Oxlade-Chamberlain, ruled out for an estimated two weeks after straining ligaments against Ecuador on Wednesday, will stay in Brazil for the tournament or be replaced. If the initial diagnosis proves accurate he could be fit for the final group game against Costa Rica on June 24, but if it takes a little longer, Hodgson may yet choose to replace him. He will be closely monitored and his team-mates are trying to keep his spirits up. Knock: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain injured his knee ligaments during England's draw against Ecuador . 'He is well in with the squad, well in with the lads and we try and keep him as happy as possible,' said Johnson, one of the team’s elders, winning his 52nd cap against Honduras. 'He is just as involved as he was apart from the training sessions. There are still a few question marks around how bad it is and how quickly he can recover. 'He will be gutted and we are gutted for him because you don’t want to be picking up injuries now. I am sure he will be mentally strong and we will be by his side. He was great the other night and you don’t want to lose any player especially with the quality he has got.' Hope: Despite the injury England medical staff remain hopeful about Oxlade-Chamberlain's chances . The emergence of fresh young players like the Ox and Sterling have encouraged Johnson to believe England can impress at the World Cup, with more attacking threat than at Euro 2012, when they lost to Italy on penalties in a quarter final. 'We had a good team when we played Italy last time, but now we have more players who can hurt them,' said the Liverpool full-back. 'We have a bit more pace in the squad as well so hopefully we will get further on. 'I don’t think Italy will have met an England team like this before. The team we had before was a good side but maybe it was slightly defensive. If we can defend well now and use some of the pace and ability we have going forward we can cause problems.'","Johnson believes Sterling can be England's secret weapon in Brazil .

Online commenters called the woman a 'hoe' and a 'slut,' the suit says. Lawsuit: The woman claims her diagnosis was shared on a Facebook group called 'Team No Hoes' Raphael Bradley, the father of her unborn child, pressured the woman to say why she was seeking medical treatment, but she didn't say why, the suit says. Bradley then told her he would ask UCMC employee Ryan Rawls, the mother of his other child, for the information. Rawls and a second UCMC employee posted the woman's medical information to Facebook, the suit says. The second woman's name has not yet been released. Her attorney, Mike Allen, told WCPO she has been cyberbullied since her medical information was shared online. She is seeking over $25,000 in damages. Meanwhile, UCMC says that an employee was fired over the alleged security breach. Breach: University of Cincinnati Medical Center said the employee who leaked the information has been fired . 'UC Health became aware of this incident shortly after the screenshot of this patient’s billing record appeared on Facebook, when she brought it to our attention,' the hospital said in a statement. 'We took swift action and our investigation revealed that the record had been accessed by a Financial Services employee who did not have a business reason to do so.

"By . Sarah Dean . There may not be a drop of snow in sight but that hasn't stopped 190 Australian dog sled enthusiasts banding together to race in their own 'dry' version of the traditional winter sport. Forget the sleds used to compete in the Arctic regions of the United States, Canada and Russia - in Northern Victoria people jump on specially imported scooters and homemade vehicles, adapted from $1000 mountain bikes, for the fast and furious races. And it's not just the ordinary dog sled racing breeds, such as the Alaskan malamute, Alaskan husky and Siberian husky, that take part in the competition. There are also German short-haired pointers, English pointers and newcomers - the crossbreed eurohounds, imported specifically to race. Speedy: One dog driver or 'musher' with four Nordic pooches takes to the dirt track for the Northern Victorian Sled Dog Classic race on Monday . The largest dry land dog sled race in Australia has taken place on dirt tracks at Moira Park, Kialla West, just outside of Shepparton, over the Queen's birthday weekend for 24 years. The dogs and their speed-loving owners pitch up at the starting line for the Grand Prix of dry sled and set of at 30 second staggered starts to avoid dramatic crashes. 'The dogs love it they race each other, they are very competitive,' Vaughan Winther, a committee member for the Northern Victorian Sleddog Club, told Daily Mail Australia. The 45-year-old has helped organise the colourful races for the past three years. 'There are accidents out there,' he warned, but said in the open class - for the experienced racers - there are hardly ever collisions. Competing: One woman joins the fast race with her two dogs and adapted scooter. The top dogs whizz around the track at 30/35kmph . Taking part: In Northern Victoria people jump on specially imported scooters and homemade vehicles adapted from $1000 mountain bikes as they are pulled along by their dogs. One man in the fast race (left) is pulled by two Nordic dogs, while a girl in the junior category (right) is led by just one dog . And this is no sedentary sport - the top dogs whizz around the track at 30/35kmph. The winning hounds will complete the 2.2km course in just 4 minutes. 'They're pretty quick,' Mr Winther noted as he explained how the dry races are in fact faster than the traditional snow races. 'It's quicker than snow. Snow tends to be slower because the dogs have to drag a sled.' Boy racer: A junior competitor focuses on the track during the dry sled. Competitors set of at 30 second staggered starts to avoid dramatic crashes . Quick: The dry races are in fact faster than the traditional snow races that occur in Arctic areas of Canada, North America, Russia and some parts of Europe . Mr Winther and his wife joined together with five friends to keep the races going after the former committee decided to call it a day after 21 years, in 2011. 'We didn't want it to be lost,' he explained. When he first got involved with the unusual Australian take on the sport 12 years ago, he bought just one dog - a Nordic breed - but now he has 16 of them. 'Once the kids got older - they are now 15 and 12 - they wanted to join in too.' The owners and their dogs get into shape for the competition with bootcamps at the beginning of the season and Mr Winther said it's important you don't pile on too many pounds over summer, as it will only slow the dogs down. A girl's best friend: A Nordic breed dog gives one young girl a wet kiss on the cheek after the race . There are usually three heats but the Saturday night heat this year was cancelled because it was too hot for the dogs to race . 'We can't run over 15 degrees - the welfare of the dogs is paramount... and they can overheat if we run over 15.' Instead, this year, just two races were held - on Sunday and Monday morning. Winners of the sprint race receive the coveted title, a trophy, a $50 cash prize and a goody bag filled with treats for them and their pooch. There are also encouragement awards, hard luck awards and sportsmanship awards.","Australia's largest dry dog sled race takes place over the Queen's birthday bank holiday weekend every year .

"By . Leesa Smith . Just when you think you have heard it all - a Queensland cafe has added take-home coffee enemas to its menu. And while they're not everyone's cup of tea, staff have already sold 140 of the DIY kits. Forget milk and sugar, the alternative-healing way to take your coffee is with a tube, bucket and coffee watered-down with purified water. But New Earth Cafe owner Sarah Parsons, who has sold 140 coffee enema kits in the past five months at her business in Coolum, Queensland, advises everybody to do their homework properly before even considering committing to the procedure.‘We just always recommend that people buy the Gerson book then they have got first-hand information from Charlotte Gerson who has been using coffee for 70 years to heal all different sorts of diseases,’ she said. A coffee enema kit must contain purified water and certified organic light-roasted drip-grind coffee . She has been using the coffee enemas for four years with her husband, Ben Parsons, since he was diagnosed with a heart condition.‘When Ben uses it, sometimes he is on the floor and I have to look after him for three hours so it’s not just a walk in the park,’ she said. ‘It’s not just a matter of popping it in and getting these amazing healing reactions – it’s something you have got do for a couple of years.’ Sarah Parsons says people must do their homework before even thinking about signing up for a coffee enema . ‘The coffee isn't bad- quite good actually but this middle-class hippy fad really has to stop,’ he posted.Although Ms Parsons admits the procedure is not for everybody, she claims to know people who are now in remission from cancer after using the Gerson method.‘Every cancer is different and every person’s vitamin deficiency is different so then the person’s ratio of coffee to water is different – it all changes,’ she said.","Queensland cafe owner Sarah Parsons warns people to do their homework before considering a do-it-yourself coffee enema .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Formula One grand prix weekends are poised to undergo a revolution from as early as next year. As part of the ongoing debate with regard to cost saving among the 12 teams, one of the proposals under discussion relates to a scaling back of the current Friday format. For many years the sport has run two 90-minute practice sessions, but one possibility that could be pushed through would see the teams only run for one 90-minute outing in the afternoon. Staying in the garage: F1 could lose a Friday free practice session from as early as next season . The thinking behind the move is that not only will money be saved on the track with the running of just one session, but it allows teams to arrive a day later at venues and so save on travel expenditure. Whether or not race promoters will be happy with the cars featuring less on their tracks has yet to be determined. The move could be ratified by the end of the month following meetings of the Formula One Commission and FIA World Motor Sport Council. Setting the pace: Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was fasted in Friday's first free practice session for the Canadian Grand Prix . Both are scheduled to sit over the coming weeks, and needing to give approval before cementing the changes in next year's regulations. The Commission, in particular, is crucial as promoters sit on that body and may yet throw a spanner in the works. Another suggestion could see a ban on in-season testing, which only returned this year.","Formula One cars currently run two 90-minute free practice sessions on Friday .

"By . Sarah Dean . Brave: Jordan Rice, 13, told rescue workers to make sure his younger brother, Blake, was saved first during the Queensland floods in 2011 . The devastated father of schoolboy Jordan Rice, who lost his life during the 2011 Queensland floods, has pleaded with Prime Minister Tony Abbott to have his son recognised for his outstanding bravery. 'You said he was ""emblematic of the Australian spirit"". You said he should be awarded the Cross of Valour, the highest civilian bravery award. Those words... gave me something past grief,' Jordan Tyson says in an open letter published on Mamamia.com. Three and a half years after Jordan's father heard the PM commend his brave son, he is still waiting for the Cross of Valour. However, he now has 180,000 Australians backing his moving petition to have Jordan recognised. Jordan insisted that rescuers save his little brother first as raging flood waters surrounded them in Toowoomba, Queensland, and his incredible bravery touched hearts all over the world. The 13-year-old's actions saved his 10-year-old brother Blake's life over his own, as they stood stranded in rising waters with their mother Donna, who also died during the deadly flash flood. His final words: 'Take my brother first,' led to the promise from Mr Abbott. In the letter, Mr Tyson describes the moment that he found out his eldest son and wife had died in the horrific floods. 'I was at home one Thursday morning when the police knocked on my door and delivered the news that immediately shattered my life. It was only 32 days later that you would personally stand up in parliament to speak of my son, Jordan Rice,' he writes. Scroll down for video . The rescue: Blake Rice (centre left) was saved from a car trapped in heavy flash flooding in the town of Toowoomba. His brother Jordan told rescuers to take Blake first . Grieving: Jordan's father John Tyson (left) and brother Blake Rice (right) want their brave family member awarded with the Cross of Valour . Mr Tyson tells how he has had to battle with the grief of losing Jordan and Donna and at the same time hold it together for his son Blake, who was saved by Jordan. 'In the last three and a half years, I have had moments of feeling very alone. Battling to hold myself together, to support Blake, to hold down a job, to deal with the pain. 'People often ask me how I keep going after losing two of the people closest to me like that. To be honest, I don’t really know. I still live with the pain, probably always will,' he says. The father waited patiently for Jordan to be awarded the Cross of Valour but all he received was a rejection letter from Australian Bravery Awards Council, two years ago. Campaigning: John Tyson (right), seen here with Blake Rice (left) outside the Brisbane Coroners Court in October 2011, has called on the PM to stick to his promise . 'That feeling of Jordan being rejected has only begun easing slightly this week,' he writes. Mr Abbott wasn't the only politician who spoke out about Jordan's bravery. Mr Tyson also started his campaign to get his son the award on change.org after former Prime Minister Julia Gillard told him 'the legend of Jordan's amazing courage will go on'. Ms Gillard met Mr Tyson on a visit to Toowoomba while speaking with flood victims, three months after the devastating floods in January 2011. During the meeting she even autographed Jordan's brother Blake's cloth sling, which he was using to nurse an arm injury caused by the natural disaster. Promises: Then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard (right) spoke with Jordan's father John Tyson and brother Blake Rice (left) at a reception for Toowoomba flood victims on 5 April 2011 . 'I was so proud. I waited, waited and waited - but it never happened,' Mr Tyson says in a petition on Change.org. 'Nothing will ever bring Jordan and Donna back. But it would mean the world to us to have his last moments of bravery acknowledged.' The gold Cross of Valour was established in 1975 to replace the British George Cross, previously awarded to Australians, and has so far only ever been given to five men. It was last awarded in 2003, to two heroes from Western Australia who entered bombed Bali nightclub Paddy's Pub, in the tourist district of Kuta, in 2002 to rescue people, despite ongoing explosions and their own personal injuries. Tragic: Warren McErlean (left) who rescued Blake from the floodwaters that hit Toowoomba and the boys' mother Donna (right), who was also killed . In January 2011, Jordan, his brother and his mother were trapped on the roof of the family's car as raging floodwater surrounded them. When a Good Samaritan, Warren McErlean, waded over to rescue the family Jordan insisted his little brother was saved first despite not being able to swim himself. 'Moments later, Jordan and his mum were swept to their deaths,' Mr Tyson said. Mr McErlean, who saved Blake, told news.com.au he completely backs the petition. 'I'm right behind anything that will remember what Jordan did and goes towards recognising his actions.' This photo taken on January 10, 2011 shows flash floods described as an 'inland tsunami' smashing through mountainside Toowoomba . Flood waters surged through streets, inundating the city of Toowoomba . Debris and overturned cars were seen in central Toowoomba between following the flash flood which ripped through the town centre on January 10, 2011 . A spokeswoman for Mr Abbott told the website he supported Mr Tyson's calls for Jordan to be appropriately acknowledged. 'Nominations for bravery awards in the Australian Honours system are considered by the Australian Bravery Decorations Council, which makes recommendations to the Governor-General,' she said. 'The Prime Minister has approached the Governor-General to ask for his support in ensuring proper consideration is given to any nominations for bravery awards relating to this tragic incident.'","Jordan Rice was killed during the 2011 Queensland floods .

"By . Daniel Mills . Rory, a keen footy player, was diagnosed with the rare tumour just days before he was due to fly out to Disneyland with his family . A Sydney family has described the incredibly cruel impact cancer has had on their life following the double diagnosis of a father and son just eight months apart. In a heart-wrenching interview aired on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes program, the Williams family revealed the devastating moment cancer took hold of the youngest boy, 11-year-old Rory, before illness also struck his 44-year-old father Grant just eight months after. The avalanche of bad news began to tumble downhill after Rory's diagnosis in November, just days before the family were due to fly out on a dream holiday to Disneyland. Rory's parents took the keen footy player to hospital when they noticed his stomach began to swell significantly. 'My mum thought that something was wrong but Dad's like 'you’re probably eating too much Maccas,' Rory said. It turned out his diet had nothing to do with his stomach's ballooning growth, but everything to do with the football-sized tumour hiding inside. 'I think our life prior to this was a very average suburban day-to-day life .. very solid and happy,' mother Leanne said. First Rory, then Grant Williams was told he too had a cancer in a cruel blow to the family which were still dealing with the news of the 11-year-old's diagnosis . His father had joked he'd been eating too much fast food - but doctors discovered a football-sized tumour (right) when Rory was taken to hospital . The grey matter below the doctor Toby Trahair's finger show the extent of the foot-ball sized tumor which was too big to be cut from Rory's stomach . 'Now I feel like we have the same life but instead of living on solid ground we are on the edge of a precipice.' It meant Rory's long-awaited trip of a lifetime to visit Disneyland was put on hold indefinitely. The news - enough to reduce his parents to tears. 'You talk about going from the penthouse to the basement,' Mr Williams said. 'For an 11-year-old kid to think he is about to get on a plane to Disneyland and then get told he's got cancer the next day, is just mind boggling.' Rory's mother and father both broke down during the heartfelt interview with Ben Fordham who is a close friend of the pair and the godfather of the 11-year-old . Despite the intensity of the situation, Rory Williams remained incredibly upbeat during the interview. At times, the 11-year-old was joking with interviewer Ben Fordham saying the reason behind his ballooning stomach was his poor diet . The mind-boggling news was made worse after hearing that doctors were unable to operate on the tumour. Too big, the family knew despite hoping otherwise, that Rory's cancer was serious. 'All I remember him saying to me is, 'am I going to die?' Mr Williams said. 'That took all I had to say 'mate of course you're not going to die' and not cry myself.' Knowing chemotherapy, radiation and surgery wouldn't work, there was only one hope of bringing the watermelon-sized growth to it's knees and that was a shot of a therapy drug called Crizotinib. The untested drug which had only been trialed in a small sample of pediatric cases and adults with lung cancer, had amazing results. Rory had four CT scans, the last of which showed remarkable trials that a drug had removed a large portion of the cancer in his stomach . Rory, the youngest in the family, is pictured with sister Gemma . Months on and four CT scans later the doctors at Randwick Children's Hospital revealed the remarkable change in Rory's condition. Oncologist Dr Toby Trahair said the the tumour's reduction in size was 'almost a miracle.' 'But it is also important to be optimistic on the one hand and realistic on the other.' Meanwhile as Rory's condition started to improve, his father received the gut wrenching news that a cancer had begun to grown inside his own body just eight months after Rory's diagnosis. 'I found out last Thursday. I've got prostate cancer,' Mr Williams said. 'The way I look at it is, Rory's got a tumor that is sort of a one in a million tumor. 'When the prostate cancer was diagnosed it was kind of like we've already had the shark attack this is just a mozzy bite.' When the family found out about Rory's condition, Grant Williams sent a text message to family and friends telling them of Rory's diagnosis. He told 60 minutes he couldn't believe what he was writing in the message was true. The size of the cancer, in red, was as big as a football when it was at full maturity inside Rory's stomach . But months of target treatment using the the trial of a cancer therapy drug reduced it to the size of a golf ball. 'It is almost a miracle. 'It's almost a miracle' Oncologist Dr Toby Trahair said. Nonetheless, Mr Williams admitted it was still incredibly tough news to take. 'How do the two boys in the family get cancer at the same time?, he said. 'It's just ridiculous.' Knowing his family weren't the only ones with a young child battling cancer, Mr Williams said they also won't be the last. 'You can't sit back and think don't worry about it it's not our caper ... that won't happen. 'Well, it's happened to us.' He said he wanted people to pledge their support to the annual Gold Telethon fundraising event for Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick. It raises funds to buy life-saving equipment, fund research and deliver vital services to help young patients. 'That's probably the only reason we told this story. These kids are just plain unlucky, they've done absolutely nothing ... there's nothing but bad luck involved and we need to save these kids it's as simple as that.'","Rory Williams, 11, was diagnosed with a rare cancer in November .

"By . Margot Peppers . Angelina Jolie turned 39 on Wednesday, but thanks to her flawless skin she doesn't seem to have aged in years. Now, according to Us Weekly, the secret to her youthful appearance has been revealed: an $800 treatment called the Triad facial, administered by New York dermatologist David Colbert, which combines microdermabrasion, laser and a glycoloic peel. Dr Colbert, whose office is in Manhattan, has also treated Naomi Watts, Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz, all of whom are fans of the Triad facial. Skin secret: Angelina Jolie, 39, (pictured on Tuesday) reportedly owes her flawless complexion to the Triad facial, an $800 treatment developed by New York dermatologist David Colbert . Magic formula: The facial combines microdermabrasion, laser and a glycoloic peel . Angelina reportedly first met Dr Colbert in 2010 on the set of Salt, where he treated her for a minor cut. Since then, she has come to swear by his 30-minute treatments. The Oscar winner also uses Dr Colbert's line of skincare products, which range in price from $52 for a purifying cleanser to $165 for night cream. According to his website, the Triad facial is a three-part process: gentle microdermabrasion to remove dead skin cells, then laser toning to even pigmentation, and finally a gentle chemical peel that 'imparts a fresh, youthful radiance and silkiness to skin.' It can cost between $800 and $1,200, depending on the type and strength of the chemical peel as well as the number of laser pulses performed. Get the look: Dr Colbert, whose office is in Manhattan, also has a line of skincare products, with prices ranging from $52 to $165 . One of the benefits of the treatment is that it doesn't produce redness, which means A-listers can have it last-minute before attending important events. 'It gives immediate results and, most importantly, there's no downtime,' the dermatologist told the Hollywood Reporter. Dr Colbert first gained attention in 2010, after Naomi Watts said in Life & Style magazine that she credited his skin care line for her flawless complexion. Celebrity following: House of Cards actress Robin Wright, 48, (pictured left on Wednesday) and 45-year-old Naomi Watts (right, on May 16) are also fans of the Triad facial . Supporters: Michelle Williams, 33,  (left in 2012) apparently visited Dr Colbert's temporary clinic in Beverly Hills before this year's Oscars. And Rachel Weisz, 44, (right, in 2013) swears by his treatments, too . Oprah endorsed his 'heal and soothe' night cream in the July 2010 issue of O Magazine, and Fitness magazine featured his facial disks as some of the 'secrets to perfect skin' in the February 2013 issue. In February, Dr Colbert set up a temporary pre-Oscar beauty clinic in Beverly Hills, so that actresses could enjoy a 20-minute version of his signature Triad facial before hitting the red carpet. Robin Wright, Emma Stone and Heidi Klum all apparently visited the temporary clinic before the big event .","The Triad facial, created by New York dermatologist David Colbert, is also loved by Naomi Watts, Rachel Weisz, Michelle Williams and Robin Wright ."
"By . Sarah Dean . Australia Post is reportedly set to axe 900 jobs within days after its flagging letters business potentially faces billions of dollars in losses. One of Australia's oldest companies, founded in 1809, is forecast to go heavily into the red if it continues to offer its failing letter delivery service, Farifax Media reports. Its 32,000 staff are expected to be informed of the cuts as early as Tuesday, with most positions to go in Sydney and Melbourne. Scroll down for video . Major losses: Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour is expected to announce 900 job cuts this week . Fairfax says everyday home delivery of standard-priced mail is expected to be another casualty, with the service to be cut back to two or three times a week providing approval can be sought to change government regulations. 'Australia Post has made it very clear that it is confronting dramatic change due to the impact of declining revenues in our letters service,' an Australia Post spokeswoman told MailOnline. 'Our Managing Director and CEO Ahmed Fahour has publicly stated that the losses in letters business have already overwhelmed the profits in parcels and without reform, the letters services will lose over $1 billion annually in a few years.' Huge cuts: The most positions are expected to go in Sydney and the Melbourne head office of Australia Post (pictured) Posties could lose their jobs: Private modelling indicates Australia Post will lose $7.1 billion through to 2022-23 if the business continues on its present . The spokeswoman added: 'Australia Post is already responding and is a much leaner organisation than it was three years ago. 'Part of the modernisation of Australia Post involves shifting resources and investing in areas in response to customer needs, such as recent announcements around the extension of Express Post services and parcel delivery to Saturdays and extended weekend trading hours.' 'We will not be commenting further until the impact of these and other changes we need to make are communicated to our staff, who of course remain our top priority,' she said. Fairfax papers says private modelling indicates Australia Post will lose $7.1 billion through to 2022-23 if the business continues on its present path. Ahmed Fahour was appointed MD and CEO of Australia Post in February 2010. In May of that year, he announced a new strategy that was designed to bring the company into the future. It included a new organisation structure and a foray into digital businesses. However, last year things began to look worse for the company as it was announced external recruitment had been frozen. Mr Fahour has been fairly open with the government about the impending financial problems for the postal service, which reaches more than 10 million Australian addresses, operates 6,990 postal outlets, and serves more than a million customers in postal outlets every business day. The company's three core areas are letters and associated services, retail merchandise and agency services, and parcels and logistics. Falling behind: Australia Post's letters service lost $218 million in 2013 . In Australia Post's annual report last year, released in October, Mr Fahour announced a steady 14 per cent rise in revenue to $5.8 billion. But the actual letters part of the business lost $218 million in 2013. While there may not be much money left in delivering letters these days, other parts of the postal service are booming. Its unregulated packages business made $648 million. This was in part because the company has an advantage in the package business world over competitors like DHL - it can use the entire Australia Post network, including some 4400 retail outlets - with 2651 situated in rural areas - and the huge network of posties. Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull said earlier this year that there were no plans to sell Australia Post. The news that the service could axe 900 jobs in the next few days, is in bitter contrast to Mr Fahour's current pay packet. Despite working for a public utility, he was paid a whopping $4.8 million in 2013. His earnings were higher than the bosses of some of Australia's biggest companies, including Woolworths, Woodside Petroleum, David Jones and JB Hi-Fi. He received a pay increase of 66 per cent, while his workers received a meager 1.5 per cent pay rise in 2013.

"By . Leon Watson . The top Fifa official at the centre of bribery allegations threatening to de-rail Qatar's 2022 World Cup has been accused of organising a major gas deal to secure key votes, it emerged today. Mohamed Bin Hammam has already been accused of buying support for the Arab nation's World Cup bid by making payments to football officials from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. Now it has emerged the 65-year-old Qatari brokered meetings between officials from his country and governments to discuss bilateral trade deals worth tens of millions of dollars. Pressure: Disgraced Fifa official Mohamed Bin Hammam has been accused of corruption. Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid committee has denied all links to him . The fresh allegations threaten to . blow a hole in Qatar's claim that it had no links to the former vice-president of Fifa. Qatar's 2022 bid committee said Mr Bin Hammam, the disgraced Fifa vice-president, played 'no official or unofficial role' in efforts to secure the competition and denied all wrongdoing. It said he was an 'entirely separate' individual with 'no official or unofficial role in the bid'. But The Sunday Times reported today that leaked Fifa files show how Mr Bin Hammam fixed meetings with the Qatari royal family for at least seven key members of Fifa's executive committee, including the president, Sepp Blatter. Two . secret meetings were brokered between Qatari royals and an aide to Thailand's serving Fifa member to discuss a gas deal. It happened in the . critical final months before the 2022 ballot. Documents show that the meetings were aimed at 'promoting the bilateral . co-operations in soccer developments and activities between the Qatari . FA and Thai FA'. It is also alleged he arranged for Michel Platini, the president of European football's governing body Uefa, to meet the bid committee. In the 2010 vote, Mr Platini, who has since joined calls for an investigation, voted for Qatar. Demand: UEFA President Michel Platini insists there is a re-vote for the 2022 World Cup if corruption is proven . Controversy: Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup in 2010 but allegations of corruption have surfaced . And it is also claimed Mr . Bin Hammam kept his seat on the executive committee by making payments . totalling $1.7 million to football officials across Asia. Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup four years ago at the same time Russia was handed the 2018 tournament. It was the first time Fifa had awarded two bids at the same time. But just a month before, Russian president Vladimir Putin was invited to . discuss 'bilateral relations' in sport between Qatar and Russia. Qatar's bid in particular has attracted controversy from the outset because of the extreme summer heat during the months when the cup is played and the tiny country's lack of domestic soccer tradition. Just days before the 2014 tournament kicks-off in Brazil, pressure is mounting on Fifa to take action over the allegations by stripping Qatar of the tournament and ordering a re-run of the bidding process. Today it emerged one of its key World Cup sponsors, the Japanese electronics giant Sony, has become the first to call for a probe. In a statement, Sony said: 'As a Fifa partner, we expect these allegations to be investigated appropriately. New horizons: The 2022 tournament would be the first World Cup in the Middle East if it goes ahead . 'We continue to expect Fifa to adhere to its principles of integrity ethics and fair play across all aspects of its operations.' Fifa earned almost $1.4 billion last year, including more than $600 million from broadcasting rights and over $400 million from sponsors and other marketing partners. Sony is one of six main Fifa sponsors who collectively paid around $180 million last year. Sony's sponsorship agreement expires this year, giving it particular leverage as it negotiates a new deal. Labour leader Ed Miliband also told The Sunday Times that if the allegations were proven there would be an 'overwhelming case for the bidding process to be reopened immediately'. A number . of British officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and FA . chairman Greg Dyke, called for a rerun of the contest if the allegations . are proven true. Mr . Clegg wrote on Twitter: 'These are shocking allegations about the . bidding process for 2022 World Cup. If proven true, FIFA must rerun the . contest fairly and openly.' Prime Minister David Cameron agreed with Mr Clegg that the claims were .

"By . Helen Carroll . When Claire Weller found she was pregnant, just a few months after suffering a miscarriage, she felt joy and anxiety in equal measure. While delighted to be expecting again, she was also worried her unborn baby might suffer the same sad fate as the one she had lost 16 weeks into her previous pregnancy. So, when a friend offered to lend her a foetal Doppler - a handheld ultrasound listening device used by midwives at antenatal appointments - to check her unborn baby's heartbeat, she leapt at the opportunity, never imagining the panic it would induce. Twice as nice: Claire Weller with her partner James Reeves and their one-year-old twins Jack and Bobby . 'I thought being able to hear my baby's heart beating would be hugely reassuring,' says Claire, 32, of Chessington, Surrey. 'But I didn't bargain for the terror I'd feel when I was unable to detect a heartbeat. 'This happened several times. Once, seven months into my pregnancy, I got into such a state that my partner, James, had to race me to Kingston Hospital for an emergency scan. 'Everything was fine, but it took a few hours for me to calm down - not ideal when stress in pregnancy poses such a risk to you and your baby.' Indeed, as foetal Dopplers become a must-have piece of kit for mums-to-be, the Royal College of Midwives has issued a warning about the risks they pose. They urge pregnant women to seek medical advice if they are worried about their baby, rather than attempting to self-diagnose with a Doppler. 'We advise against personal Dopplers as it takes considerable training to use them properly,' says Jane Munro of the RCM. 'It can cause needless stress to a pregnant woman when she cannot pick up her baby's heartbeat. It can lead to raised blood pressure in the mother and premature births. 12 weeks: Claire Weller used a personal Doppler to listen to her unborn children's heartbeats . 'More worrying, we've had cases where there has been something wrong with a baby and the mother has been wrongly reassured after hearing her own heartbeat, or the sound of blood pumping through the placenta, leading to a dangerous delay in her seeking medical attention. In at least one instance, sadly the baby died.' So the message from midwives is loud and clear: leave the job to the professionals. Although Dopplers for home use can be picked up for as little as £30 from online retailers including Amazon, the £250 model Claire borrowed from her friend was identical to ones used in hospitals. In fact, it was so sensitive that, at ten weeks pregnant, Claire detected two foetal heartbeats and realised she was expecting twins. 'At my first antenatal appointment I said to the midwife: ""I think it's twins,""' recalls Claire, whose partner, James, 38, is a chauffeur. 'She couldn't believe how early I'd picked up the heartbeats.' Claire then used the Doppler every other day, and fought the urge to listen in more often. 'It sometimes took me 40 minutes to find a heartbeat and even longer to pick up two, because you don't know whether you're hearing the same heartbeat twice. I'd get anxious checking and double checking,' she says. 'Later in the pregnancy one of my twins was breech and the other head down, so it was a real struggle locating both of their little hearts. 'I got into a terrible state seven months into the pregnancy because my breech baby was not moving very much and I couldn't pick up a clear heartbeat. Realising how worried I was, James took me to hospital. 'Thankfully the obstetrician who scanned me was able to reassure me that both our babies were fine.' The twins, Bobby and Jack, were born in March last year, each weighing a robust 7lb. Happy families: Bobby and Jack were born in March last year, each weighing a robust 7lb . Although there are no official figures on the number of mums using Dopplers, midwives have reported a huge increase in pregnant women who admit to listening to their babies' heartbeats at home. Dr Thomas Aust, an obstetrician at the Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital, first raised the alarm in the summer of 2009 after a 27-year-old woman was admitted to his antenatal ward due to reduced foetal movement 32 weeks into her first pregnancy. The unnamed woman told doctors that she had first noticed her baby had become less active two days previously, but had been reassured that all was well after using her own Doppler to listen to its heartbeat. However, concerned by a lack of movement during monitoring, doctors performed an emergency Caesarean later that evening. The baby was so unwell it spent its first eight weeks on the special care unit. While recognising the inevitable anxiety women experience during pregnancy, Jane Munro, of the RCM, questions the ethics of companies which sell and loan personal Dopplers. 'I think it's unethical for retailers to overstate their usefulness,' says Jane. 'It's far more important for mothers-to-be to tune into any changes they notice in their baby’s movements than to encourage them to rely on a gadget.' Pregnant: Kayley Boden (left) takes a selfie of her pregnancy bump, and used a foetal Doppler in the hopes of reassuring herself . That's a lesson that Julie Hainsworth, an NHS receptionist from Leeds, learnt the hard way. While pregnant with her fourth child, Toby, now six months old, she bought a Prenatal Foetal Doppler for £30 on eBay. 'I bought it so that our older children could hear the heartbeat and feel more involved,' recalls Julie, 32. 'But it was such a worrying pregnancy because I discovered early on that his heart rate was quite irregular. 'I'd creep off and listen while my husband, Christopher, was supervising the children's teatime. When I told my midwife about my concerns, she advised me to stop using the Doppler because it was likely to be more stress-inducing than reassuring. 'I couldn't resist the temptation to listen in. However, I couldn't make sense of what I was hearing.' As the pregnancy progressed, Julie was unable to hide her fears from Christopher, 31, a landscape gardener. From the 26th week of pregnancy, Julie was admitted to St James's Hospital in Leeds no less than 12 times for monitoring after she raised concerns about her baby's heart rate. The first prototype ultrasound system was developed in Glasgow in the Fifties . Toby was born at 37 weeks, three weeks before his due date, weighing just 4lb 6oz, but otherwise healthy. 'After all those months of worry, of not knowing whether his irregular heart rate symbolised some underlying problem, it was such a relief to finally hold Toby,' says Julie. When a year later, she became pregnant with her youngest child, Arya, now five months old, she was far more cautious about using her Doppler. 'I picked up her heartbeat nine weeks into the pregnancy,' recalls Julie. 'But then I only used the Doppler a handful of times. Yes, it was hugely tempting, but I couldn't put myself through all that worry again for another nine months.' Kayley Boden is another mother who succumbed to home monitoring, much to her midwife's disapproval. She bought a Doppler for £40, but struggled to detect her baby's heartbeat. 'I finally heard something at 24 weeks, but even then it was hard to detect,' says Kayley, 21, a trainee teacher. 'I thought the Doppler was going to reassure me but in fact it did the opposite. 'I rang my midwife in a state when I couldn't hear anything. She said they don't recommend personal Dopplers. 'She said it didn't help for me to be worried because the baby would become stressed and the heartbeat would be even harder to find. After that, I didn't dare call her again when I couldn't detect a heartbeat so I'd just keep trying and fretting.' Pretty in pink: Kayley Boden with her daughter, six-month-old Erica Grace . Eight months into her pregnancy, Kayley's baby became worryingly still, but she decided not to seek immediate help when her mind was put at rest after checking for the heartbeat herself. 'Because I'd heard the heartbeat, I decided to hold on until the following day when I had an antenatal appointment,' says Kayley. 'But towards evening time, she still wasn't moving so I called my midwife who told me to go straight into the assessment unit.' Kayley's daughter, Erica, was born five days past her due date at Warrington Hospital, weighing 8 lb 2.5 oz. 'She's healthy so there was no need for all that angst,' says Kayley. 'If I have another baby, I won't use the Doppler again - it's not worth all the stress it causes.' How ironic, then, that this is a device marketed with the promise of alleviating anxiety in pregnancy.","Foetal Dopplers become a must-have piece of kit for mums-to-be .

Here, Chris Foy looks into the three close calls that Lancaster will have to make this week. Ben Morgan vs Billy Vunipola (No 8) Vunipola has been a rampaging force of nature for Saracens and England all season. He propels his team over the gainline repeatedly, but limped off at Twickenham last weekend and it remains to be seen if he is 100 per cent fit. Morgan was herculean with his carrying and collision work on Saturday and made a strong case to survive. Power: Ben Morgan (centre) put in a brilliant performance against New Zealand on Saturday . Kyle Eastmond vs Billy Twelvetrees vs Luther Burrell (Inside centre) Suddenly, England will have a raft of options. If Twelvetrees is fit, he is the established first choice, but Eastmond was electric, showing pace, footwork and good distribution. Burrell played at outside centre in the Six Nations but Manu Tuilagi shone there on Saturday, so the Saint will come into this equation.

Marland Yarde vs Chris Ashton (Right wing) This wasnâ€™t an occasion when Yarde was able to cut loose and show his qualities as an attacking runner and predatory finisher, and his yellow card will count against him.

"By . Emma Innes . They have a combined age of just 32, but between them this brother and sister duo can lift 47 stone - the equivalent weight of an average tiger. Bronwyn and Cosmo Taylor, 18 and 14, have been weightlifting since 2012 at a gym in their home town of Inverness in Scotland. After years of training with their father, Andrew, they can now lift an amazing 47st (300kgs) between them. The two are barely away from the gym, and travel up and down the country at weekends to compete in powerlifting competitions. Bronwyn and Cosmo Taylor can lift about 47st (300kg) between them . The siblings only started weightlifting in 2012 but they have both won awards and broken records . They lift weights at the gym with their father, Andrew, and their mother says they have a 'friendly rivalry' Both hold records for their deadlifts and bench presses. Bronwyn, who helps her dad at their removal company, said: ‘I have done many other sports in the past but I love powerlifting. ‘I love being stronger than the boys and being able to push myself to the limit. ‘Boys . are always commenting - I get tired of having to refuse to have arm . wrestling competitions with them just for them to try and prove they are . stronger than me. ‘In . September 2011 I entered my first competition and after that I was . hooked. 'I’ve met a lot of like-minded people and it’s helped me see more . of the world.’ Despite still being teenagers, the siblings already have a string of prizes and records under their belts.

In total Bronwyn and Cosmo can lift 300kgs - the equivalent weight of the average adult tiger . 'Being in a strength sports has allowed me to meet many interesting people and it’s a great opportunity to travel. ‘I went to most of Bronwyn’s competitions in the UK and have also travelled abroad with her. ‘My . dad has always been in a gym and since I was young, I’ve always heard . him say how good he feels after a workout - I feel the same.’ Bronwyn, who is 5ft 10ins and weighs 10st 5lbs (67kg), stunned friends, family and strangers by lifting twice her body weight just 12 months after starting the sport at the Commonwealth Powerlifting Federation Championships. She said: ‘I was very into boxing and karate, which inspired me to take up powerlifting and I quickly found out I was a natural. ‘My friends at school thought it was a little strange at first - they thought I would end up looking like the Incredible Hulk - but now they are very encouraging and some have even started lifting themselves. ‘Most people don’t believe what I can lift because I am tall and slender, especially boys. Since most of them don’t go to the gym, I have to tell them to look at some of my postings on YouTube if they don’t believe me.

"By . Ruth Styles . For Patricia Whitfield, a 71-year-old pensioner from Hartlepool, life has become a daily battle against pain and immobility. The reason: her weight. Tipping the scales at 27st, Patricia's weight problems have become so bad, she hasn't left the house unassisted for five years and spends nearly all of her time on a chair in her sitting room. Now Patricia, who appears in Channel 5 documentary Bigger Body Squad: Off The Scale, has been told she must lose weight or face an uncertain future. Miserable: Patricia Thornhill spends most of her time in her sitting room and hasn't left the house for five years . 'Just living in these four walls is about as far as I get,' she says of her limited lifestyle. 'One room is not enough. 'I can stand up - this chair helps me but I don't know if I can to walk to the back door.' Patricia's problems began when she was diagnosed with lymphoedema - a chronic condition that affects the joints and makes walking painful. As a result, she has gained another two stone since being diagnosed with the disease - a complication that has made getting her to the clinic for treatment enormously difficult. Currently, the NHS spends £3m a year ferrying morbidly obese patients such as Patricia to and from doctor's appointments and it's a figure that looks set to grow, with more than 40 per cent of British pensioners classified as overweight or obese. Struggle: As a result of her weight and lymphoedema, Patricia cannot walk just 12ft to her front door . Warning: Nurse Kerry Wood (pictured) says Patricia must lose weight or face an uncertain future . 'Our stretcher is a specialist stretcher for bariatric patients and has side wings that pop out,' explains Ian Wheatley, the bariatric paramedic tasked with getting Patricia out of her house and to the clinic. But getting her out of the door is a problem because not only is Patricia unable to walk, she's in constant pain. Eventually, she's helped out of the house in a wheelchair before being winched into an ambulance, although even that proves exhausting. 'I'm in so much pain,' she complains as she completes her 12ft journey. But despite the pain, Patricia has so far failed to lose any weight - much to the disapproval of nurse Kerry Wood. '[Patricia's] weight has increased over the last few years,' she explains. 'And as a result, her lymphoedema has worsened. 'If she lost weight, it would dramatically improve her . mobility and I suspect it might take some of the pressure off her knees as . well so she could become more mobile. 'Losing some weight would have . quite an impact on her lymphoedema as a whole.' For now, Patricia has returned home to sit on the same chair in the same sitting room in the same home. The only change? Thornton's chocolate is off the menu. Patricia appears on Bigger Body Squad: Off The Scale, tonight at 8pm on Channel 5 .","Patricia Whitfield, a 71-year-old pensioner from Hartlepool, weighs 27st .

"By . Lucy Crossley . An NHS worker defrauded a leading cancer hospital out of more than £640,000 and spent the money meant for life-saving drugs on Gucci handbags and her wedding, a court heard. Stacey Tipler, 32, is accused of exploiting her position in the accounts department of the Royal Marsden Hospital Trust in London to alter invoices and divert £642,827.98 that should have been paid to the hospital’s suppliers. Tipler changed the bank details of genuine suppliers for the hospital, one of the world's top cancer units, to a group of people recruited by her 33-year-old fiancé Scott Chaplin, Southwark Crown Court was told. Hospital: Stacey Tipler, 32, is accused of defrauding the Royal Marsden Hospital Trust in London (pictured) out of more than £640,000 and spending the money on handbags and her wedding . It is alleged that once the money had been transferred it was then withdrawn and split among gang members, with Tipler using her share to buy Gucci handbags and a model helicopter, as well as clear debts and funder her wedding. However, she was arrested a year before her big day and investigators only managed to claw back slightly more than half of the stolen money. Today Tipler and Chaplin appeared in the dock alongside Aiden Butcher, Steven Rico and Danielle Flynn, who is alleged to have agreed with Chaplin to have the money paid into their accounts. They all deny fraud charges. Six other men, Clinton Woolery, Thomas Quinlan, William Flynn, Russell Baker, Roy Harriott and Adrian Horan, have already pleaded guilty to being involved in a fraud. 'The real shame of this case is the defendants spent money that should have gone on cancer drugs on model helicopters and Gucci,' said Stephen Hopper, prosecuting. 'This is a very straightforward case. Stacey Tipler exploited her access to the Trust’s computerised payment system, Agressos, in order to divert funds that should have been paid to suppliers to a series of bank accents controlled by other defendants. 'She achieved this simply by removing the bank details on the Agressos system for a number of the Trust’s suppliers and replacing those details, temporarily, with the bank account details of one of the other defendants. 'In this way a total of £642,827.98 was diverted to six different accounts controlled by people known either to her or her partner. Accused: Southwark Crown Court was told that Tipler changed the bank details of suppliers for the hospital, one of the world's top cancer units, to a group of people recruited by her 33-year-old fiancé Scott Chaplin . 'Some of the diverted money was recovered but £310,857.86 remains unaccounted for. 'The prosecution allege Tipler could not have acted alone. She entered into an agreement with others to carry out the fraud. 'She agreed to carry out the necessary changes to the Trust’s system and the others agreed to let their bank accounts be used for the diversion, knowing that the use of their accounts was an integral part of a fraud against the Royal Marsden.' Mr Hopper said the defendants then laundered the money by withdrawing it from the accounts as cash or banker’s cheques and then paying it into other accounts belonging to Tipler, Chaplin and their co-conspirators. Butcher allowed his account to be used to receive a £25,000 cheque and a £20,000 banker’s draft from Horan and Quinlan, which he then withdrew in cash, the court heard. Mr Hopper added: 'This represents laundering of criminal funds and was of great assistance to the main conspirators as it allowed the to remove large amounts of money from the accounts in one go.' The money was diverted from Alliance Pharmaceuticals, Hospira Aseptic Services, Baxter Healthcare Ltd, Alliance Healthcare and AAH Pharmaceutical Ltd between December 2011 and May 2012. The prosecution said Tipler covered her tracks by placing false descriptions in the Agresso system and changing invoice details. In April, the payment system was outsourced to NHS Shared Business Service, meaning Tipley lost control of it. However, money continued to be diverted to Woollery and William Flynn meaning a total of £300,000 was lost. Tipley of Carshalton, Surrey, was arrested in May 2012 after an employee of Alliance Healthcare told the NHS that the company had received two remittance slips, but no payment to go with them. Mr Hopper added: 'Tipler first made a straightforward denial. She was interviewed again in August, by which stage the full scale of the fraud had been uncovered. 'She now admitted to changing all the bank details in order to divert payments but claimed to have done so as a result of being threatened by Horan and Woollery.' 'She also believed (William) Flynn had attacked Chaplin in order to place pressure on her to carry out the fraud. 'The prosecution’s case it that this duress defence has been created by Tipler with Chaplain’s help. 'The Crown does not accept there was any duress on either side. All the defendants were fully aware of the mechanism of the fraud and all knowingly participated.' He added: 'Tipler and Chaplin had acquired a substantial level of personal debt. At the time she was first interviewed she believed she owed £30,000. She and Chaplin planned to get married in May 2013 and had begun to pay for the wedding.' The trial continues.

"By . Emma Innes . A mother who was diagnosed with breast cancer during her pregnancy had a mastectomy just 30 minutes after giving birth. Sarah Williams gave birth to her son Joshua by planned C-section before surgeons removed her breast in the same operating theatre. The 40-year-old had already endured five rounds of chemotherapy while carrying her second child, at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in North Wales. Sarah Williams, 40, had a mastectomy just 30 minutes after baby Joshua was delivered by planned C-section . Mrs Williams, of Connah’s Quay, was diagnosed with breast cancer after becoming pregnant with Joshua, last year. Today the mother-of-two recalled her terrifying ordeal. She said: ‘When I was told I had cancer it was an utter shock. 'I was 20 weeks pregnant and kept thinking, “what about the baby?” I was terrified this would mean I would lose him or her. ‘Although I felt in safe hands, it was the most terrifying experience of my life having chemotherapy while knowing I had this precious bundle of joy inside me.’ Doctors at the Wrexham Maelor Hospital planned a treatment plan for Mrs Williams, which aimed to protect her unborn child. In October she was taken into hospital for a C-section to deliver her baby boy. Half an hour later, in the same operating theatre, she underwent a mastectomy as well as a procedure to remove 29 lymph nodes, 22 of which had live cancer cells in them. Following Joshua’s birth, she resumed three more cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy treatment. Mrs . Williams, who also has a young daughter, Sasha, said: ‘Chemotherapy was . a nightmare physically and mentally but it did the trick and, . thankfully, reduced my tumour. Mrs Williams (pictured with Joshua and her daughter, Sasha) was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 20 weeks pregnant with Joshua. She went to her doctor after noticing changes in one of her breasts . Mrs Williams had to have five rounds of chemotherapy while she was still pregnant with her son . ‘The . thought of losing the baby and not coming through this to see my little . girl Sasha grow up was sickening. 'But I tried really hard to push those . thoughts to the back of my mind and focus on the treatment.’ 'When I was told I had cancer it was an . utter shock. I was 20 weeks pregnant and kept thinking, “what about the . baby?” I was terrified this would mean I would lose him or her' - Sarah Williams . Having . conceived naturally after undergoing failed IVF treatment, Mrs Williams . and husband Carl’s delight turned to concern when she noticed a . change in one of her breasts. She initially put it down to the IVF, but tests revealed she had cancer. ‘It’s strange because I wasn’t ill before my diagnosis,’ said Mrs Williams. ‘I was hardly ever poorly. I never had any warning signs.’ She is now preparing to run the Chester Race for Life with Team Beck, and has been chosen to start the countdown on Sunday, July 20. She has already raised more than £2,000 for Cancer Research UK. ‘I feel so blessed now,’ said Mrs Williams. ‘We have our beautiful little girl and precious baby.

"By . Amanda Williams . Oliver Blockley was given a 95 per cent chance of survival when he was taken to hospital, suffering vomiting and diarrhoea . A four-year-old boy who was given a 95 per cent chance of survival when he arrived at hospital, died after an NHS trust made 28 mistakes in his care. Oliver Blockley was taken to Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire, suffering vomiting and diarrhoea. Medics misdiagnosed with gastroenteritis - a stomach virus which cannot be treated with antibiotics - and as a result was not given the medication that would have saved him. But Oliver actually had an invasive form of sore throat bacteria Strep A which should have been picked up by a blood test. The young boy soon became dehydrated as he was denied vital fluids. He turned grey as the septic shock took hold of his body and he suffered a fatal cardiac arrest hours after his arrival. His grieving mother Jennifer said she was initially 'denied information' but later discovered her son actually been given a 95 per cent chance of survival, had medics acted sooner. Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, which was put in special measures in 2013, has now apologised to the family and are set to agree five-figure compensation. Ms Blockley said: 'I feel that it’s every parent’s right to know that the main hospital in their area has had major failings in care for a child who, if treated correctly, had a 95 per cent chance of survival from the infection. 'Even when I questioned the care at the time I was told that it was just a tummy bug and that it would be fine. 'Even at the end when Ollie was losing his battle with life after being so let down earlier in the day by the staff at Stoke Mandeville, I saw the most unprofessional handling of the situation. 'It was a shambles, it was out of control. If you think one doctor is wrong you go to someone else, but if every member of staff is saying the same thing you don’t question it.' The mother - who has two other young sons - added: 'Oliver was so special, and really kind and gentle, he was just lovely. 'At the time he had an 18 month-old brother, Finley, who was just at that stage where he really liked his older brother; it was really, really hard.' Ms Blockley took her son to Stoke Mandeville’s A&E department in October 2011 and was initially told to go back home to Thame, Oxfordshire, and give him fluids. Oliver (pictured right with mother Jennifer and little brother Finley) actually had an invasive form of sore throat bacteria Strep A which should have been picked up by a blood test. The young boy soon became dehydrated as he was denied vital fluids . She insisted his condition was more serious and that he remained at the hospital. Despite blood tests revealing he was severely dehydrated and was heading for septic shock, doctors continued to refuse him antibiotics or give him fluids. Throughout the evening, the nurses and doctors failed to notice Oliver’s fast heart rate and rapid breathing - a sign of septic shock - and between 8pm and 1am failed to monitor him at all. Despite nurses noticing his grey colour and dilated pupils doctors arrived too late and he died following a cardiac arrest. He was eventually given antibiotics too late - just half an hour before he died. Even after his death nurses still told his distressed mother he had a stomach bug and not streptococcal. The family’s solicitor Laura Cook, of Darby’s Solicitors, said: 'It’s another sad example of the NHS only admitting to mistakes after legal action is taken, putting the family through additional stress at what is already such a traumatic time.' He died at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital aged just four, due to 28 admitted counts of negligence by hospital staff in treating Oliver for a stomach bug . Despite blood tests revealing he was severely dehydrated and was heading for septic shock, doctors continued to refuse him antibiotics or give him fluids. Throughout the evening, the nurses and doctors failed to notice Oliver's fast heart rate and rapid breathing - a sign of septic shock - and between 8pm and 1am failed to monitor him at all . Anne Eden, chief executive of Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'I sincerely and without reservation apologise to Ms Blockley for the actions of the Trust which led to the death of Oliver in 2011. 'We have thoroughly reviewed the circumstances around Oliver’s death, as well as policies, procedures and staff training, and we commissioned an independent expert review. 'A number of other improvements have been made, which include strengthening our early warning process for recognising when a child’s condition is getting worse, improving how we care and treat patients with gastroenteritis, in particular the use and types of fluid given and additional advanced life support training. 'We recognise and regret that nothing will ever change this terrible situation for the Blockleys but we have learned the lessons and hope these changes will ensure that as far as possible no other family will suffer in the same way.'

"By . Emma Innes . People are more likely to commit suicide at night than during the day, new research has revealed. Far more suicides occur between midnight and 4am than during the daytime or evening, the study found. The researchers believe this could be because some suicides are trigger by insomnia and by nightmares. People are most likely to commit suicide between the hours of midnight and 4am, a new study shows . The researchers, at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, found the average suicide rate per hour was 10 per cent after midnight, peaking at 16 per cent between 2am and 2.59am. In contrast, the average suicide rate per hour was two per cent between 6am and 11.59pm. When six-hour time blocks were examined, the observed frequency of suicide between midnight and 5.59am was 3.6 times higher than expected. ‘These results suggest that not only are nightmares and insomnia significant risk factors for suicidal [thoughts] and behaviour, but just being awake at night may itself be a risk factor for suicide,' said  principal investigator Dr Michael Perlis at the University of Pennsylvania. According to the authors, previous research suggesting that more suicides occur during the day failed to account for the proportion of the population that is awake at each given hour - something that was taken into account for this study. It is thought insomnia and nightmares could play a role in prompting suicides at night . The current study involved archival analyses of both the National Violent Death Reporting System, which provided data for the estimated time of fatal injury, and the American Time Use Survey, which provided an hourly proportion of the U.S. population that is awake. A total of 35,332 suicides were included in the analysis. According to Dr Perlis, an important implication of the study is that the treatment of insomnia may be one way to reduce suicide risk. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine reports that about 10 per cent of adults have a chronic insomnia disorder lasting at least three months. Accounting for more than 38,000 deaths each year, suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the U.S. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In comparison, about 16,000 deaths occur each year due to homicide.","The most common time to commit suicide is between midnight and 4am .
Suicide rates peak between 2am and 3am and are lowest during the day .
Aside from insomnia and nightmares prompting some suicides, simply being awake at night may be a risk factor, say U.S. researchers .

"By . Sarah Dean . One of Australia's most decorated Olympians is returning to TV after overcoming a drug addiction. Grant Hackett will put the past year's troubles behind him, including a stint in rehab after he became hooked on the sleeping drug Stilnox, to co-host Channel Nine's Wide World of Sports. The 34-year-old will be back on the box next Sunday, alongside former cricketer Michael Slater. 'We both thought it was time he came back... he was raring to go,' Nine's head of sport Steve Crawley told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Back in action: Grant Hackett is returning to TV after overcoming a drug addiction . Crawley said he stayed in touch with Hackett 'even when he was away in America' in rehab and says it wasn't a case of if he would return to the channel but when. 'In difficult times, that's when it's important to think about people you care for,' Crawley said about his and Nine's close relationship with the gold-medalist, who he described as a 'great talent'. 'I rang Grant and he rang me back last week,' he said, explaining that it was an easy process to get him back on the box. Hackett will become part of the Sunday sport show's regular cycle of co-hosts, who appear alongside regular Ken Sutcliffe. Moving: The former swimmer will put a stint in rehab behind him to co-host Channel Nine's Wide World of Sports . And Crawley is already eyeing up Hackett for Nine's Commonwealth Games coverage from Glasgow, Scotland. 'It will be great to have him in the Commonwealth Games. Once we get next week out the way we'll look into,' he said. 'He's part of the show, he's part of the family. It sounds like a cliche but its true.' The Commonwealth Games kick off on the 23 July. Hackett first joined Channel Nine in October 2008, as Nine News Melbourne's weekend sport presenter, replacing Heath O’Loughlin, and went on to appear on numerous shows for the network. In May, the former swimmer returned to work as an executive at Australia's largest bank, Westpac, a month after he completed a 35-day rehabilitation programme at a US clinic for his addiction. United front: Hackett was all smiles when he posed for a photo with his parents Neville and Margaret after returning from his five week drug treatment in America . Hackett boarded a flight to America in February to attend the clinic, just days after a bizarre incident in which he was photographer half-naked in the middle of the night in the foyer of Melbourne's Crown Casino. The father of two young children was seen carrying his daughter on his hip while he searched for his son. The incident prompted an intervention by his mother, Margaret, and father Neville, a retired policeman, who insisted their son travel to America for rehabilitation. Divorced: The Olympian's troubles came after his divorce from Australian singer Candice Alley in August 2013 . Following his successful five-week treatment, Hackett flew to his parents' home on the Gold Coast. The swimmer told Channel Nine News before boarding the plane home he was 'feeling a lot better'. 'It just gets to a situation in life where you're not coping too well and you need to put your hand up and ask for help,' he said in Los Angeles. His troubles came after his divorce from Australian singer Candice Alley in August 2013.","Will co-host Channel Nine's Wide World of Sports next Sunday .

"By . David Middleton . When . my mobile rang at around 1am on a Sunday, I knew instinctively that . something was wrong. It was my sister, Jane, and the anguish in her . voice confirmed my fears. Her husband, David, had been rushed into . hospital after developing severe chest pains. The outlook was not good . and, unable to contact either of her daughters, Louise and Charlotte, . who lived nearby with their partners, she pleaded with me to get hold of . them. In the hours that followed, Charlotte made it to Stafford . Hospital to be with her father. Then the decision was made to transfer . David to the specialist vascular unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in . Birmingham. David's sister Jane's husband, David, 57, died following an abdominal aortic aneurysm . During the 30-mile journey his condition deteriorated . further and paramedics battled to keep him alive. David's eldest . daughter Louise managed to see him before he was rushed into theatre. We waited in the family room clinging to the hope that he would pull through, but it was not to be. I . will never forget the outpouring of grief as the surgeon returned to . tell us that David had died, just over five hours after first being . admitted to hospital. He was 57 and the cause of death was a rupture of the aorta - the large artery that passes from the heart to the abdomen. It . had burst because of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) - where a weak . part of the artery starts to swell, causing it to bulge outwards like a . balloon. Eventually, the wall bursts open causing massive internal . bleeding which cannot be stemmed without immediate surgery. This can . lead to the heart being starved of oxygen, which can be fatal. Since . his death on November 12, 2006, my family has struggled to come to terms . with why David died so suddenly. He enjoyed good health and there were . no signs that his life might end so abruptly. For my sister and her daughters, the loss of a wonderful husband and father has been devastating. He . did at least live to see the arrival of his first grandchild - and he . would have been overjoyed to see the arrival of four more. 'It is said that of patients with a ruptured AAA, half will die before they reach hospital' On birthdays, anniversaries and at Christmas there is still a feeling that someone is missing. There . is also the inevitable question as to whether or not he might still . have been here if his condition had been diagnosed sooner. An . abdominal aortic aneurysm can grow slowly over years. The aorta of a . healthy person is as wide and as tough as a garden hose, so someone can . live with a small aneurysm for years if it does not grow much. And . as Dr Mike Knapton, the British Heart Foundation's associate medical . director, explains: 'It usually causes no symptoms until it ruptures, . which is a medical emergency, and often proves fatal.' AAAs are responsible for nearly 6,000 deaths in England and Wales every year - with men over 65 being more at risk than women. The exact reason for this is not clear, but genetic factors are important and female hormones are thought to offer protection. Because of hereditary influences anyone whose brother, sister or parent has had the condition could also be at risk. Aneurysms . may be exacerbated by the hardening of the arteries, due to things such . as smoking, an unhealthy diet, and high blood pressure. AAA has an . extremely high mortality rate, says Dr Jenny Richards, a clinical . lecturer in vascular surgery from the Centre of Research Excellence at . the University of Edinburgh. 'It is said that of patients with a . ruptured AAA, half will die before they reach hospital. And half of . those who do reach hospital will die before they reach the operating . theatre and then half of those who have an operation to repair the tear . in the artery will not survive.' In March 2009, NHS England set up . the National AAA Screening Programme for all men reaching 65, with . identical programmes rolled out in stages across the rest of Britain . from 2012. Men over 65, who have not previously been screened, can put . themselves forward for the programme, too. Uptake for the screening . has been good - 76 per cent of the 226,901 men aged 65 invited for . screening attended their appointments. A further 13,164 men above 65 . referred themselves for screening. But with more than 2,627,000 men . aged 65 to 74 in the UK, according to the latest census, clearly more . lives could be saved if those who do not qualify for screening . self-referred. The screening test consists of a ten-minute ultrasound . scan. At less than 3cm there is no concern, but an aneurysm measuring 3 . to 4.4cm needs annual surveillance. This increases to three-monthly . surveillance for measurements of 4.5 to 5.5cm. Anyone with an . aneurysm larger than 5.5cm is referred to the consultant vascular . surgeon. Anyone found to be at risk, that is with an aneurysm greater . than 5.5cm in diameter, can then elect for surgical intervention. This . involves replacing the affected part of aorta with a piece of synthetic . tubing known as a graft - either via open surgery on the abdomen or fed . up from the groin. As Dr Knapton says: 'It is better to manage . things in a proactive way than to wait for a crisis. Assuming a patient . survives the ruptured aorta, you then have the awful pressure it puts on . services in terms of the emergency trip to A&E before going into . the 'resus' room to try to repair the thing, all of which is extremely . traumatic for patients, relatives and staff.' One man who can't speak highly enough of the process is Colin McEwan, from Edinburgh, who had the ultrasound scan. 'The . machine beeped and as the measurements were taken the nurse's . expression changed. She said: “I'm afraid you have an aneurysm and it's . quite big - around 4.9cm.” Within days I had an appointment with a . consultant vascular surgeon at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.' Aneurysms may be exacerbated by the hardening of the arteries, due to things such as smoking or bad diet . Told . later that the aneurysm was 5.9cm and not 4.9cm he was given a choice of . treatment - endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), which involves a . synthetic graft being fed up through the arteries in the legs to repair . the aorta or open surgery, which, unlike EVAR, is a one-off procedure . without further checks. He opted for the latter, despite a slightly . higher mortality risk of 1 to 5 per cent. Before his surgery, Colin . agreed to take part in a trial of another, possibly more accurate . screening method for AAA. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, funded by the British Heart Foundation and the Medical Research . Council, is being put to use in a study of 350 patients at Edinburgh . Royal Infirmary. This provides instant, real-time moving images of . the inside of the body. It is being explored as a way to predict the . risk of rupture and help surgeons decide which patients would benefit . from preventative surgery, and possibly lead to even earlier . intervention. The proportion of men screened who will be found to have an aneurysm . Colin had the MRI scan before his initial assessment . day and another on the day of assessment. He will have a follow up in . two years to check for any changes. 'MRI scanning is potentially . more accurate but more difficult to do because it is an expensive piece . of kit,' says Dr Knapton. 'Currently AAA screening can be done in any . surgery setting without specialist equipment, so the challenge for the . NHS would be a trade-off between something that is quick, easy and cheap . and something that's less accessible.' Six days after his operation, . Colin McEwan was allowed home. 'For the first couple of weeks I spent a . lot of time in bed feeling exhausted but I gradually got back to . fitness through walking - starting slowly and increasing the distance . each day. It has now been four months and I have started to play golf . again and feel fine.' It is too late for David - and at 57 he was . too young to have been offered screening - but if advances in screening . techniques can lead to more outcomes such as Colin's, costs will, . hopefully, become a secondary consideration. aaa.screening.nhs.uk .","David: 'My sister Jane's husband, David, 57, died after five hours in hospital'

"By . Emma Innes . A mother-of-five has died from breast cancer after doctors mistook the disease for tennis elbow for two years. Jill Goodrum, 46, visited her GP in 2011 because she was struggling to lift her arms above shoulder height. But her doctor misdiagnosed her symptoms, telling the grandmother she was simply suffering from tennis elbow. As a result, her cancer went undiscovered until late 2013 when she discovered a ‘bone-like’ lump near one of her breasts. Jill Goodrum, 46, (pictured with the youngest of her five children, Amy and Grace) died of breast cancer last month after being misdiagnosed with tennis elbow . The grandmother-of-four, from Plymouth, Devon, underwent tests and finally learned she had aggressive and invasive breast cancer. Worse still, the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes and her liver and was incurable. She died on May 21 this year of septicaemia (blood poisoning) during chemotherapy treatment. She spent her final months documenting her battle on Facebook in a bid to raise £10,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support and Plymouth-based Jeremiah’s Journey. She fell short of her goal, collecting £6,400 - but donations to her fundraising page have continued to flood in since her death. Her eldest daughter, Lyndsey Todd said: ‘In the week since Mum died £1,500 has been raised from people all over the world. ‘She was posting the ugly truth about living with cancer and I have continued - it doesn’t end when the person has died. ‘I’m so proud of her for everything. Everybody who knew her loved her. She was always the go-to person. Mrs Goodrum's only symptom for two years was that she was struggling to lift her arms. It wasn't until she found a lump in her breast that she returned to her doctor and the cancer was found . Writing on her Facebook page, Jill's Fundraising Journey, the 46-year-old raised awareness while documenting her fight with the disease. Recalling the moment doctors uttered the devastating diagnosis, she wrote: 'Being diagnosed with cancer was horrendous. ‘When . I found out it was terminal I sat in the car park at the hospital for . about an hour unable to let go of the wall I was holding onto. ‘It’s just horrific. I’m 46 and I’m never going to get old. 'The . fact that I have two small children is very hard to deal with too. I’m . never going to see them grow up. My children are going to lose their . mummy. ‘My older children are obviously traumatised by my diagnosis, but they are very supportive. ‘Nothing is the same for me now. My world has completely changed - I’ve lost me, my identity, my life as I knew it.’ On October 30, last year, Jill shared her feelings about having a wig fitting, after bouts of chemotherapy. She said: 'My first step was chemo last Friday. 'Now I have next chemo this Friday and wig fitting on Monday. 'Those who know me are aware that my hair is down my back and I've had it very long most of my life. I thought having my head shaved was a grand idea. 'And of course I will still go through with it. 'However I now realise there are so many things to come to terms with when losing your hair. 'The loss of feminine identity, the feeling of being a bit pretty, hair being a defining factor all my life, and 'no hair' is not pretty. 'I don't suit scarves and my complexion is shot with the chemo. So I am afraid. No hair = sickness. And that's a fact, I have also seen how my lickle ones respond at the mention. It is a visual reminder mummy isn't well. So much to try and understand and that's just the loss of hair. Wig day has suddenly become very important x' On November 9, 2013, the mother-of-five offered these words of wisdom to others, 'don't count the days, make the days count'. A post on November 14, said: 'Can it get worse I ask myself? Yes it really can... And I'm sure it will. 'I was advised not to see this as a battle but I think I will disagree. Fighting this mind, body and should twister takes every ounce of my energy: . Will the chemo work?If so, how much will it do?How long have i got?How awful on a scale of 10 today, oh another 9.Will I be able to walk today?Will I lose my hair today?Will my support fall away?Am I better off not existing at all? It's a veritable melting pot of teenage angst.I wish I was a bigger person lol and able to be really grown up and level headed. I only needed another 20 years to reach that echelon.' ‘She supported me during the birth of my children and was my birthing partner for all three of my births and she was amazing. ‘Towards . the end we were able to repay some of that support and we sang songs to . her that she used to sing to us when we were young during her final . hour. ‘She just got on with things. Even when they stopped the medication she fought for another 24 hours.’ Her daughter Jemma Campbell, 20, added: ‘We were always a team and did everything together. It was me and her against the world. ‘Everybody . loved her. When I was at school all my friends would come over just to . see her. Whenever anyone had a problem they would turn to her.’ After she received the devastating . news that the cancer was terminal the family all spent Christmas Day . 2013 on the beach – Mrs Goodrum’s favourite place. Her . son, James Todd, said: ‘When I was a small kid in Plymouth - about five . or six years old - I remember my mum feeding us when she didn’t always . have food for herself. ‘Her mission was to better our situation and she did it.’ 'We moved to York where she got her degree and she brought us up to a better standard of living.' Speaking before she died, Mrs Goodrum said: ‘Being diagnosed with cancer was horrendous. ‘When . I found out it was terminal I sat in the car park at the hospital for . about an hour unable to let go of the wall I was holding onto. ‘It’s just horrific. I’m 46 and I’m never going to get old. 'The . fact that I have two small children is very hard to deal with too. 'I’m . never going to see them grow up. My children are going to lose their . mummy. ‘My older children are obviously traumatised by my diagnosis, but they are very supportive. ‘Nothing is the same for me now. My world has completely changed - I’ve lost me, my identity, my life as I knew it.’ Mrs Goodrum’s family say she never blamed doctors for missing her cancer because the symptoms were so hard to detect. They say that when she visited her GP in 2011 all she was able to describe was having difficulty in raising her arms. It was only two years later when she noticed a lump in her breast that she sought further help. She learned then that she had been suffering from cancer for between three and four years with virtually no symptoms. Ms Todd, 27, said: ‘The doctor said several years ago that she had tennis elbow. ‘She went to them with a complaint in her arm, but she felt absolutely fine in herself. ‘Mum never blamed them for not picking it up then as she only had one symptom - they weren't to know at that time. ‘When she was diagnosed with cancer last year, doctors said they thought she had had it for three or four years.’ Tragically, . Mrs Goodrum was given some positive news at the beginning of 2014 after . scans showed no signs of cancer in her breast. But after a holiday to Gran Canaria in April she became unwell again and scans revealed the disease had returned. Mrs Goodrum (pictured with her daughters, Amy, eight, Grace, four, and Lyndsey, 27, and granddaughters Sofia, 10 months, and Ella, eight) already had advanced cancer by the time she was diagnosed . A lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast. A change in the size or shape of one or both breasts. Discharge from either nipple or a lump or swelling in either armpit. Dimpling on the skin of the breasts or a rash on or around the nipple. Pain in either breast. Source: NHS Choices . Ms Todd said: ‘When she went for a scan earlier this year, doctors were gobsmacked. ‘The cancer seemed to have gone from her breasts and there was only one slightly enlarged lymph node. ‘They said that they had drugs that could control the liver - It was amazing news and we were all so hopeful. ‘They thought they had it under control and mum went on holiday in April. ‘While she was away she started to feel very unwell. On her return we found that the cancer had returned with a vengeance. ‘I'm so proud of everything she's done - she was just an amazing mum and grandmother.’ Mrs Goodrum died of septicaemia during chemotherapy treatment last month . Mrs Goodrum leaves behind her husband Mark and five children James Todd, 29, Lyndsey Todd, 27, Jemma Campbell, 20, Amy Goodrum, eight and Grace Goodrum, four. She also has four grandchildren - Ella, nine, Amelie, four, one-year-old Sofia and Elowen, also one. Ms Goodrum’s friends, family and supporters have vowed to keep her fundraising and awareness efforts going with several planned events set to go ahead this summer.

"By . Tara Brady . A man in his 80s shot himself dead in the toilet of a doctor's surgery today sparking panic among patients. Armed police were scrambled to the scene following reports of gunfire and a 'sudden death' at the GP practice in Frimley, Surrey. Shocked neighbours near the Station Road Surgery wrote on Twitter about hearing 'gunshots' coming from inside the terraced building. A pensioner in his 80s is believed to have shot himself dead in Station Road doctor's surgery in Frimley today . A police officer is standing guard at the entrance to the sealed-off surgery and a cordon has been set up around its car park.

Ed Tse, 25, said he heard 'a bang like a gunshot' while working in his . father's Chinese takeaway which backs onto the surgery. He described the aftermath at the scene as 'chaotic'. Mr Tse, from Frimley, said: 'I heard a bang around 10.30am and at first I thought it sounded like the bins being collected. 'The surgery is always throwing stuff out so hearing the bang of a bin is quite common but this was louder. Scene: A car with number plates covered, parked very close to the Station Road Surgery, Frimley . 'I went around the corner and there were lots of people and police cars around - it was chaotic.

Station Road and staff were having to show IDs to police on the door. 'Police . were not letting anyone in or out and were taking statements and . telling people the surgery was close. I haven't spoken to police myself . yet.' Workers at The Mane . Street barbers opposite the surgery said they were told a man had shot . himself dead in the toilets at around 10.30am. A . female member of staff, who asked not to be named, said: 'The first . thing we heard was the police sirens screaming as the first of nine cars . sped up.

'Everyone in the surgery had to give statements to the police before they could leave at around midday. 'I don't know if any other patients are still inside. 'From what I've heard the man shot himself in the toilet or the reception area, not in an appointment. 'One customer came in and said the Ford Focus parked outside is the dead man's car.' Police were called to the surgery in Station Road, Frimley, Surrey, at about 10.30am this morning . The . Ford Focus has now been removed by a recovery firm. It had been parked . on double yellow lines with its number plate taped over. Jodie Skilton, 18, wrote on Twitter: 'Gunshots in frimley doctors. How scary.' Office worker Senna Michelle, who works nearby, wrote: 'Gunshots in Frimley Doctors - scared for my life.' Staff at the surgery, which has been sealed off, refused to comment on the incident. Dr Samuel Coulter, a senior partner, briefly emerged from the building at around 3pm but only said he had 'nothing to add'. Silver-haired Dr Coulter, dressed in a blue shirt, gold tie, said: 'I have nothing to add at this stage. Thank you.' Surrey Police confirmed they were called to reports of a 'sudden death' after a firearm went off. A spokesman said: 'We were called to the doctor's surgery just before 11am this morning following reports of a sudden death. Shocked residents near the Station Road Surgery said they heard 'gunshots' from inside . 'Officers . and other emergency services attended the location after reports that a . firearm had been discharged inside the building.

Adam Wicks, 21, works at Vickery and Co estate agents in Frimley High Street, which is in the next road. He said police officers had asked to see the firm's CCTV footage. Mr . Wicks, from Camberley, Surrey, said: 'I didn't hear anything myself as . we're too far away but there was a lot of commotion at the surgery. 'There are about six or seven police cars all around the doctor's surgery. 'The police came in asking about our CCTV but we don't have any and they wouldn't tell us anything.' 'It's crazy. I've just heard there was a shooting and there are rumours that it was a suicide.' Paramedics from South East Coast Ambulance Service were also scrambled to the scene.

"By . Emma Innes . A mother made the heartbreaking decision to have an abortion after being told there was a 50 per cent chance that giving birth would kill her. Doctors told Lucy Buckby, 28, that she was at high risk of dying during labour due to a serious heart condition which only became apparent during her third pregnancy. Miss Buckby, of York, says she still lives with deep regret after agreeing to the advice to terminate the pregnancy. Lucy Buckby (pictured with her oldest child, Thomas, when he was a baby) was diagnosed with high blood pressure in her pulmonary arteries when she was pregnant with her third son, Jayden . But says she feels thankful to her son, who she named Jayden, for alerting her to her potentially fatal idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. She said: ‘I sometimes wonder whether I would have been able to survive the labour, and whether I did the right thing. ‘I asked to see an ultrasound of Jayden alive before I gave birth to him when he was 17 weeks old. My son was very small, but in my heart he was a human being. ‘We christened Jayden and we held a funeral. The decision I made is something I'll have to live with for the rest of my life, but I believe his purpose was to let me know about the heart condition. ‘If it wasn't for Jayden, my two older sons could have been left without their mum.’ Miss Buckby and her partner, factory worker John Smith, 29, were delighted when they discovered she was 11 weeks pregnant in April 2013. Ms Buckby was warned that there was a 50 per cent chance she would die during childbirth and she was advised to terminate baby Jayden . Miss Buckby made the heart-breaking decision to go ahead with the termination when she was 17 weeks pregnant. She made the decision for fear of leaving her other children without a mother . Soon after discovering the happy news, however, Miss Buckby's health began deteriorating rapidly. In early May, she collapsed while in town on a shopping trip. She said: ‘I was walking down the street when I felt myself slump. I was completely out of breath and felt sick to my stomach. I sat down on a bench and was horrified when I realised I simply couldn't move.’ An ambulance rushed her to The York Hospital, where doctors began urgent tests. Pulmonary hypertension is raised blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These are the blood vessels that supply the lungs. The term idiopathic means that the underlying cause is unknown. Pulmonary hypertension is a serious condition that can damage the right side of the heart, making it less efficient at pumping blood around the body. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, feeling faint, chest pain, a racing heartbeat and leg swelling. The condition occurs when the walls of the pulmonary arteries are thick and stiff making it difficult for them to expand to allow more blood through when the heart is under any strain - such as during exercise. It can also occur if the arteries are blocked by blood clots. The reduced blood flow makes it hard for the right side of the heart to pump blood meaning it has to work harder. If it is continuously having to work harder than it should, it may become weaker. This can eventually lead to heart failure. The condition usually gets progressively worse but it can be treated with some medications. Two thirds of people with pulmonary hypertension now live for more than five years after their diagnosis. There is a high risk of death during pregnancy and childbirth for women with the condition. This is because they can suffer heart failure as a result of the pregnancy or birth putting extra strain on their already struggling heart. Source: NHS Choices . Miss Buckby, who has two other children, Thomas, eight, and Ashley, two, did not leave hospital for nearly a month. She said: ‘They wondered whether I had a blood clot on my lungs, but I was transferred to a specialist heart unit at The Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, where they confirmed idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.’ Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which are the blood vessels which supply the lungs. It is a serious medical condition that can damage the right side of the heart, making the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body and getting oxygen to the muscles. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pains, feeling faint and leg swelling. It can lead to the sudden death of a woman during childbirth when the heart is put under strain. About two thirds of patients live for more than five years after diagnosis. The word idiopathic means the root cause of Miss Buckby's condition remains unknown. As Miss Buckby struggled to come to terms with the life-changing diagnosis, she was faced with a heartbreaking decision - either continue with her pregnancy knowing there was a high chance both she and her unborn child would die, or agree to a termination. She said: ‘I don't agree with abortion unless there are very extreme circumstances. I never thought I would have to face a choice like that. ‘The consultant made it absolutely clear that if I decided to continue with the pregnancy, I would be doing so against strong medical advice to terminate. ‘I thought about what life would be like for my two other children if I died. It hadn't been long since I'd given birth to Ashley and I didn't want to leave my boys without their mum. ‘I still felt protective over my child, so I asked for a scan and discovered he was a boy. We decided to name him Jayden.’ The pregnancy was then terminated and Miss Buckby endured an induced labour, after which hand and footprints were taken. It was safer for her to go through a carefully managed labour after just 17 weeks of pregnancy, when the baby was very small, that to wait until the baby was bigger and it would put more strain on her heart to deliver him. Miss Buckby said: ‘We were heartbroken. We had Jayden christened and then John took him to be with him in the accommodation area while I recovered on the ward. Miss Buckby (pictured with Thomas) says she credits Jayden with saving her life . ‘He was buried after a service. I was too upset to say anything during the memorial.’ Today, Miss Buckby takes medication to manage her heart condition and must attend hospital for regular check-ups. She said: ‘Jayden is now my guardian angel. He let us know about the heart condition and without him, I might not be here today. He was tiny, but he was looking after me. ‘I believe it was his purpose in life to make sure that his brothers could spend more time with me. ‘I wonder what the future would have been like with Jayden with us. I know that one day, I will see him again.’ Miss Buckby is holding a charity event with live music at Dunnington Sports Club on July 11, 2014 to raise money for Pulmonary Hypertension Association UK.

"By . Emma Innes . A teenager has credited her favourite jeans with saving her life after she noticed they were becoming too tight. Emily Clark, 16, noticed her size six jeans suddenly didn’t fit her as normal when she went out with friends. She then noticed two hard lumps in her stomach, which scans revealed to be cancer. Emily Clark, 16, was diagnosed with cancer after noticing her favourite jeans had suddenly become too tight . Sixth-former Emily said: ‘My jeans felt really tight and I thought my tummy was bigger than normal. ‘I didn’t feel ill at all but I knew something wasn’t quite right. ‘Thank goodness for those tight jeans - they probably helped to save my life’. Emily, of Llantarnam, near Cwmbran, South Wales, went for a check-up with her doctor after noticing her jeans didn't fit. Emily went to see her doctor after noticing she had become bloated and that there were two hard lumps in her abdomen. Tests revealed she had non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Emily had to have months of chemotherapy before finally being told she was in remission . She was asked if she was pregnant or constipated and when she said she wasn't, further tests were ordered. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system. This is the network of vessels and glands in the body. Clear fluid, called lymph, flows through the lymphatic system and it contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma affects these lymphocytes causing them to multiply in an abnormal way and to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system. Affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties making the patient vulnerable to infections. The most common symptom is a painless swelling in a lymph node - usually in the neck, armpit or groin. The cancer can also cause night sweats, weight loss, fever and fatigue. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in people of any age but is most common in people over the age of 65. Treatment usually involves chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Source: NHS Choices . Two scans later later revealed the tumours in her abdomen and devastatingly, she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. During a four month stay in hospital she was given four rounds of intensive chemotherapy. She lost her long auburn hair and became very thin - but says she refused to feel sorry for herself. She said: ‘There was no “Why me?” 'I just thought: “This is a bit rubbish, let’s get on with it”.’ Six months later, Emily is at home recovering after being told the cancer is in remission. She now wants encourage more people to donate bone marrow and blood. Inspired by teenage fundraiser Stephen Sutton, who raised more than £4 million for the Teenager Cancer Trust while fighting incurable bowel cancer, she has set up her own campaign - remissionpossible.org.uk . The campaign aims to encourage people to give blood, join the bone marrow donor register or to fundraise for charity. She said: ‘I don’t think what happened to me is a tragedy. 'A positive attitude is what has kept me going through it all. ‘But being told I was in remission was amazing. It was the best day ever. 'It was so much relief. My mum didn’t stop crying for hours. ‘Now I want to help others thrive and survive during treatment.’ Her mother, Donna, said: ‘The only symptom was her jeans were too tight. ‘When Emily lay down you could see two large lumps. They were growing so fast you could also see it happening. ‘But we are just so glad that it was caught in time - and Emily has been so brave and positive.’ Emily is now trying to encourage people to join the bone marrow donor register and to give blood .","Emily Clark, 16, noticed her jeans had suddenly become too small .

"By . Emma Innes . A 32-year-old who spent £7,000 on sunbed sessions has been told he is dying of cancer because of his tanning addiction. Damien Platt was so keen to look tanned he used sunbeds up to 200 times a year - four times more than the EU recommended safe usage. Mr Platt would spend nine minutes in the tanning booths up to four times a week and continued this routine for eight years. Scroll down for video . Damien Platt, 32, was diagnosed with terminal melanoma after eight years of frequent sunbed use . He says he used the sunbeds to make himself 'feel good'. But his addiction has come at a huge price. Doctors diagnosed him with melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, in 2010 after he spotted a mole on his thigh. Then, last March, they gave him just 10 months to live after discovering the cancer was not curable. Treatment has prolonged Mr Platt’s life but he now deeply regrets his years of sunbed use. The ex-tradesman, from Little Hulton, Greater Manchester, said: 'I loved the confidence having a tan gave me and everyone would say how healthy I looked. Mr Platt was diagnosed with the cancer after finding a suspicious mole . on his thigh. Image (left) shows the scar from surgery to remove the cancerous . mole and (right) shows him when he was using sunbeds . Mr Platt (pictured when he was using sunbeds) went for a tanning session up to four times a week . 'I couldn't go anywhere unless I had been on the sunbeds first. 'Pretty much everyone in my life at that time used the sunbeds, so I thought I would give them a go. 'I just didn't feel normal without a tan and my confidence in the way I would look would go right down without them. Symptoms that may indicate skin cancer include any mole, spot, lump or area of skin that: . Source: Bupa . 'To find out I had melanoma was the worst feeling in the world. 'I felt completely numb and found it very hard to function properly for days, people would try talking to me but nothing would register. 'Now I'm just trying to be as happy as possible with the time I've got left. 'Doctors told me I had six to ten months to live last March but at the time they didn't have much feedback on the drugs I was taking. 'Thankfully the drugs have worked longer then they originally thought. 'However I'm still in the same position, the drugs will always stop working in every case - it is just a question of when.' Mr Platt now wants to raise awareness of skin cancer and raise funds for Cancer Research UK. He has support from Coronation Street star Simon Gregson, who plays landlord Steve McDonald, and he met soap star Michelle Keegan as a surprise treat from a friend. The actor has invited him to Simon Gregson's Charity Ball at the Palace Hotel in Manchester on July 5 to warn people about the dangers of indoor and outdoor tanning. He said: 'It's been horrific at times because I know how much it hurts my family to see me like this.'People are quite literally dying for a tan and it really isn't worth it.’ Mr Platt is now trying to raise awareness of the dangers of sunbeds as well as raising money for charity . Yinka Ebo, senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: 'Far from improving your looks, the UV radiation given off by sunbeds can make skin look wrinkled, leathery and old before it's time, and it also damages the DNA in your skin cells. 'Over time this damage can build up and may lead to skin cancer. If you're really desperate for a tan it's better to fake it. 'See your doctor if you notice any changes in the size, shape or colour of a mole or normal patch of skin.' Mr Platt is using his Twitter @mymelanomafight and JustGiving page to reach a target of £10,000 and has so far raised more than £2,000.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Essential oils from cloves and oregano could be used to prolong the life of bread (stock image) They are common in aromatherapy products and alternative cleaning fluids, but now essential oils from plants could also be used to prolong the life of bread. Scientists have developed new edible films, containing oils from clove and oregano, that preserve the humble loaf longer than commercial compounds. Essential oils are natural compounds that keep bacteria and mould at bay, according to a study published in ACS' Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry . Nilda de F. F. Soares and her team from the Federal University of Viçosa in Brazil, set out to test how well different edible films with these essential oils could maintain bread's freshness. To do this they took the essential oils - Syzygium aromaticum from clove and Origanum vulgare from oregano - and incorporated them as emulsions into water-soluble polymers to make their antimicrobial film. A chemical compound called methylcellulose was added for film-forming purposes. They wanted to study how they measured up . against a commercial synthetic antimicrobial agent, which also prevents . the growth of bacteria and mould. Bread is a common staple around the world and is often kept fresh with calcium propionate. Though naturally occurring, some research has suggested the ingredient has negative side effects, which have tarnished its popularity, leading experts to look for alternatives. Researchers discovered that films made with clove (left) and oregano (right) essential . oils can maintain bread's freshness and reduce the amount of mould and yeast that gathers on bread over 15 days . The scientists bought preservative-free bread and placed slices in plastic bags with and without essential oil-infused edible films. To some slices, they added a commercial preservative containing calcium propionate. After 10 days, the calcium propionate additive lost its effectiveness, but the edible films made with small droplets of the oils continue to slow mould growth. The experts found that both essential oils reduced the counts of yeast and moulds growing on the slices of bread over 15 days. Finer droplets of the oil increased the effectiveness of the film's antimicrobial properties. Scientists say toast falls butter side down because it only has time to rotate half a somersault before landing . Last year scientists claimed to have solved the mystery of why a piece of toast always seems to fall buttered side down. They said that it is to do with the height of the table so that if a slice of bread topples off the edge, it only has time to perform a half-somersault before it hits the floor. As the side which has been buttered is naturally facing upwards, that’s the side which ends up on the floor. To confirm the theory, food expert Professor Chris Smith and his team dropped 100 slices of toast from a table at Manchester MET University. In 81 per cent of cases, the buttered side made contact with the floor. ‘Our research shows that Sod’s Law really does exist when it comes to dropped toast,' Professor Smith said.","Scientists from Brazil used essential oils to prolong the life of sliced bread .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Children with asthma may be using medicines that do not  work, and in some cases could increase their suffering, a new study has shown. The inhaler, often the first line of treatment in asthma, could be less effective or may even make the condition worse for some children carrying a particular gene, according to research at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School. Its chairman of paediatrics, Professor Somnath Mukhopadhyay, said: ‘Both asthma reliever and controller medicines may not work well in a proportion of children. The inhaler could make the condition worse for those carrying a particular gene, researchers say . ‘A simple test can identify those who might benefit from a switch to an alternative, more effective medicine.’ The news comes just weeks after it was revealed that exposing newborn babies to germs could help prevent asthma as they grow up. According to the 'hygiene hypothesis', exposure to bacteria is necessary to prime the immune system early in life. The findings bolstered the theory that modern obsession with hygiene and cleanliness has driven a boom in allergies and health problems. Many scientists believe that modern society, with its mania for sanitation and easy access to antibiotics, makes children hypersensitive to harmless allergens.","Youngsters with a certain gene could make condition worse by using the aid .

"By . Mark Prigg . Researchers have solved the mystery of how massive lakes in the Western United States were formed. Lakes were able to grow large – rivaling the Great Lakes – during the peak of the last Ice Age 21,000 years ago, a period known as the 'Last Glacial Maximum,' The key, researchers discovered, was that evaporation rates were significantly lower than today. During the Last Glacial Maximum, large lakes (light blue) covered many of the now dry desert basins of Nevada, Oregon and California.  At the height of the LGM, Lake Surprise had a surface area of about 390 square miles, roughly the size of San Francisco Bay. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), giant lakes covered large sections of California, Nevada, Oregon and Utah, including where Salt Lake City is today. Scientists have long been puzzled by how these ancient lakes, now completely dry, grew so large. The prevailing theory was there was more rain and snowfall during this time period. But recent evidence from paleoecology and climate model simulations indicates that precipitation rates were actually relatively low compared to later periods. 'It was previously thought that the lakes grew because there was more rain and snowfall during this period of the Earth's history,' said Daniel Ibarra, a graduate student in Stanford's Department of Environmental Earth System Science and the first author of the study.

Earth scientists have long been puzzled by how these ancient lakes, now completely dry, grew so large. The prevailing theory was there was more rain and snowfall during this time period. But recent evidence from paleoecology and climate model simulations indicates that precipitation rates were actually relatively low compared to later periods. To resolve the discrepancy between computer models and the interpretation of geologic evidence, Ibarra collected more than 80 samples of tufa – a limestone created by the evaporation of mineralized water – from different locations around the edges of Lake Surprise, a moderate-sized fossil lake in Surprise Valley, California. The layered shorelines of California's Lake Surprise date back to the peak of the last Ice Age and provide a record of lake level changes over thousands of years. The layered shorelines of California's Lake Surprise date back to the peak of the last Ice Age and provide a record of lake level changes over thousands of years. Their findings showed that at the height of the LGM, Lake Surprise had a surface area of about 390 square miles, roughly the size of San Francisco Bay. Their analyses revealed that 21,000 years ago, the evaporation rate at Lake Surprise was nearly 40 percent lower than today, with precipitation rates similar to the modern era. More quantitative studies of past climate could help refine the computer models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to simulate Earth's atmospheric conditions under changing atmospheric conditions, said Kate Maher, assistant professor of geological and environmental sciences, who headed the project. 'The IPCC uses climate models to simulate past and future climate, so knowing that some of the models do a better job of simulating past changes gives us more confidence that we understand the physics involved,' Maher said. 'That can give us more confidence in the models we use to simulate future climate change.'","Lakes were able to grow large – rivaling the Great Lakes – during the peak of the last Ice Age 21,000 years ago .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . More than 7.5 million children aged under 13 lie to get around Facebook’s age restrictions. In 2012, the social network filed a patent that would make this process more legitimate, by seeking approval from, and handing the controls of the account to, the child’s parent. But this application was only made public last week, and has caused uproar among children's rights campaigners. Scroll down for video . In 2012, Facebook filed a patent that would make it possible for children under 13 to set up an account, as long as they had parental approval. The application went public this week. Facebook told MailOnline 'a patent is not a predicator for future work' and denied the age limit was changing. Stock image pictured . James Steyer, chief executive of child-advocacy group Common Sense Media said: 'We don't have the proper science and social research to evaluate the potential pros and cons that social-media platforms are doing to teenagers. According to the files (pictured), if an underage user tried to access the site, Facebook would ask for 'parental authorisation' via an existing account . 'The idea that you would go after this segment of the audience when there are concerns about the current audience is mind boggling.' According to the patent, when an underage user tries to access the site, or ‘perform actions’ on it, Facebook will ask for ‘parental authorisation from an additional user having a parental relationship to the user’. The child would tell Facebook who their parents are before the site runs a validity check on the parent’s account to confirm the relationship, and the age of the user. ‘The online service may make these verifications based in part social and transactional information associated with the identified user's account,’ explained the files. ‘Upon successful verification, the online service allows the identified user to authorise account creation for the child user, and/or manage the account and actions of the child user.’ This means that once an underage account had been linked to a parental one, the adults would be able to limit and monitor their child’s behaviour. They would also have complete control of the child's privacy and applications on the site. Facebook has denied it is planning to . launch the service, and told the MailOnline: ‘Child safety advocates, . policymakers and companies have discussed how best to help parents keep . their kids safe online. The original age limit was set to comply with the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  Any changes would need to be approved by governing body, the Federal Trade Commission. The site was criticised in October for allowing teenagers to make public posts (pictured) Facebook was criticised in October for letting teenagers make their posts public.

In . a blog post, Facebook said: 'Teens are among the savviest people using . social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, activism, or . their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard. 'So, starting today, people aged 13 through 17 will also have the choice to post publicly on Facebook.' ‘Like any responsible company, we looked at ways to tackle this issue, but a patent application based on two-year-old research is not a predictor of future work in this area.’ The patent was filed in 2012, at the same time Facebook was researching how many underage children access the site. This research was carried out after a number of child safety advocates voiced concerns about the number of children using the site.

"By . Leon Watson . The world's most expensive stamp, with a rich and colourful history, was displayed in London today ahead of its $20 million (£12m) later this month. The only surviving 1856 one cent magenta from British Guiana has rarely been seen since it was last publicly exhibited in 1986. On each of the three occasions it has been sold at auction, the stamp has set a new world record and it is expected to set yet another high when it goes under the hammer in New York on June 17. The unique stamp is expected to fetch $20 million when auctioned in New York on June 17 . An employee of Sotheby's auction house holds a case containing the sole-surviving 'British Guiana One-Cent Magenta' stamp dating from 1856 . The sliver of paper - which was shown . off at the London base of Sotheby's today - is estimated to sell for . between $10 million and $20 million. It . was found by a 12-year-old Scottish boy living in British Guiana, South . America, who saw it as a nice addition to his stamp collection in 1873 . when he found it among family papers, but had no idea that even at the . time it was a rare find. He . sold it for a small sum later that year and within five years it was in . the care of the renowned collector Count Philippe la Renotiere von . Ferrary, an Austrian nobleman. After . he bequeathed it to a Berlin museum, it was seized by France in 1920 as . part of First World War reparations from Germany and then sold on to a . New York textile magnate. Frequently described as 'the most valuable stamp in the world', the British Guiana 1c Magenta, pictured, will be auctioned in New York on June 17 . The stamp was initially discovered in 1873 by a 12-year old Scottish boy living in British Guiana, South America who sold it to a local stamp collector for several shillings . It . eventually ended up with John du Pont, heir to the chemical company . fortune which bore his name, who bought it in 1980 for a then record . price which would be equivalent to around £560,000. The . director of special projects at Sotheby's, David Redden, said of the . stamp: 'I have been with Sotheby's all my working life, but before I . knew about the world's greatest works of art, before I knew about the . Mona Lisa or Chartres Cathedral I knew about the British Guiana. 'For . me, as a schoolboy stamp collector, it was a magical object, the very . definition of rarity and value, unobtainable rarity and extraordinary . value.' In March, the Expert Committee at the Royal Philatelic Society London gave the stamp a pre-sale estimate of between $10 million (£6 million) and $20 million (£11.8 million). The last time the world-famous stamp was examined was in 1935, pictured, and it has been in private collections ever since . The 1c Magenta was part of an emergency shipment commissioned by the country's postmaster when a delivery from England was delayed. This range also included the 4c Magenta, pictured, and the 4c Blue, and all the stamps were printed by the local Royal Gazette newspaper .","British Guiana 1c Magenta was issued in 1856 by the colony's postmaster .

In . the black box is an ADS-B flight transponder which, unlike the GPS in a . car, broadcasts its location by sending information back to air traffic . controllers every second. Crews are also able to speak to their airline through discrete radio channels. The . cockpit voice recorders can additionally reveal conversations and other . sounds to hint at problems that may have occurred during the flight. This is where search efforts have focused since contact with Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was lost on 8 March . The image was published today in Eos, the weekly newspaper of the Earth and Space sciences, published by the American Geophysical Union. The new illustration of an area 2,000 by 1,400 kilometres (1,250 miles by 870 miles) where the plane might be shows locations on the seafloor corresponding to where acoustic signals from the airplane's black boxes were reportedly detected at the surface by two vessels in the area. It also shows the two plateaus near where these 'pings' were heard. It points out the deepest point in the area: five miles (7.9 kilometres) underneath the sea in the Wallaby-Zenith Fracture Zone - about as deep as 20 Empire State buildings stacked top to bottom. Undersea mountains and plateaus rise nearly three miles (five kilometres) above the deep seafloor, according to the map. Satellites can map the floor by observing the effects of gravity, as water on the surface dips and swells according to the topography of the sea bed. Satellite altimeters, which measure the distance from the satellite to the ocean surface, can measure the variations in the water that indicate what the topography is below . Boeing 777 Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 with the registration number 9M-MRO flies over Poland 5 February 2014 on a previous journey. The plane, with 239 people on board, dropped off air traffic control screens at about 1:30 a.m. on 8 March 2014, less than an hour into a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . Satellite altimetry (measuring altitude) has made it possible to depict the topography of vast regions of the seafloor that would otherwise have remained unmapped, Smith said. To illustrate the topography of the search area, Smith and Marks used publicly available data from various models and data banks, along with information culled from news reports. Smith said the terrain and depths shown in the map could help searchers choose the appropriate underwater robotic vehicles they might use to look for the missing plane. Knowing the roughness and shape of the ocean floor could also help inform models predicting where floating debris from the airplane might turn up. But he cautions that the new illustration is not a roadmap to find the missing airplane - nor does the map define the official search area for the aircraft, he added. 'It is not ""x marks the spot"",' Smith says of their map. 'We are painting with a very, very broad brush.' Search efforts for the missing airplane have focused on an area of the southern Indian Ocean west of Australia where officials suspect that the plane crashed after it veered off course. After an initial air and underwater search failed to find any trace of the airplane, authorities announced this month that they will expand the search area and also map the seabed in the area. The Phoenix team watches on as the Phoenix Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Artemis begins a search for MH370 on 17 April. 26 nations have been involved in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 since it disappeared more than a month ago . Smith pointed out that the search for the missing plane is made more difficult because so little is understood about the seafloor in this part of the Indian Ocean. In the southeast Indian Ocean, only five per cent of the ocean bottom has been measured by ships with echo soundings. Knowledge of the rest of the area comes from satellite altimetry, which provides relatively low-resolution mapping compared to ship-borne methods. 'It is a very complex part of the world that is very poorly known,' Smith says. He added that a lack of good data about Earth's seafloors not only hinders search efforts, it also makes it harder for scientists to accurately model the world's environment and climate. Today, our knowledge of our planet's undersea topography is 'vastly poorer than our knowledge of the topographies of Earth's Moon, Mars and Venus,' Smith and Marks write in Eos. This is because these other planetary bodies have no oceans, making their surfaces relatively easy to sense from space. Smith further added that he hoped that 'the data collected during the search for MH370 will be contributed to public data banks and will be a start of greater efforts to map Earth's ocean floor.'","Two experts have released their new illustration of the Indian Ocean floor .

"By . Mark Prigg . The D-Day landings have been recreated as a virtual world to allow a new generation to experience the Invasion of Normady using 3D displays and virtual reality headsets. French researchers painstakingly scanned and recreated the landing craft, gliders and even the artificial harbour, known as the Mulberry harbour, for the virtual invasion recreation. The team today revealed their work as part of the seventieth anniversary of D-Day and the Invasion of Normandy. Scroll down for video . The Mulberry Harbor was one of the most extraordinary technological feats of WWII. Developed in part by Major Allan Beckett of the Royal Engineers, it was an artificial harbor built in England, transported across the English Channel and assembled off the coast at Arromanches to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle. Tim Beckett, son of Major Allan Beckett, who designed the mile-long Mulberry Harbor bridge, stands on a virtual recreation of his father's work, long lost under the waters of Normandy, France.  In order to preserve the engineering innovations that were instrumental in the war, a team of experts led by Dassault Systèmes used CATIA design software to accurately recreate the harbor, and have projected into onto giant screens and into VR goggles. Some of the innovations engineered for the invasion and now recreated are: . Landing Craft, Vehicle & Personnel (LCVP) was designed by American businessman Andrew Jackson Higgins and carried a platoon-sized CK complement of men and weapons to the beaches of Normandy. Waco CG-4A gliders were relatively small, lightweight and maneuverable planes. Most importantly, they were silent and could land troops in enemy territory during the early hours of the June 6 invasion. The glider could carry up to 13 men or a vehicle. Dassault Systèmes, the Paris firm behind the project, say it is designed to 'safeguard the memory of some of the remarkable engineering achievements of D-Day and preserve it for future generations,’ The 3D model is an accurate, scientific reconstruction of the Harbor that will allow many to see and experience a site that was destroyed after WWII. The Dassault Systèmes teams also identified, located and gathered all available data in order to create detailed 3D models of both the Waco glider and LCVP landing craft, right down to the last nut and bolt, taking careful account of the specific materials used and how they would have behaved in actual conditions. 'Virtually reconstructing the Mulberry Harbor, the LCVP landing craft and the Waco glider brings to life one of the most exciting episodes of 20th-century history for the broadest possible audience, safeguarding this valuable part of our engineering heritage – a heritage that is gradually being lost,' said Mehdi Tayoubi, Passion for Innovation Institute Director & Experiential Strategy VP for Dassault Systèmes. 'This project builds a bridge between the engineers of yesterday and today by preserving the memory of these remarkable technological innovations. The result is a fitting tribute to the engineers of then and now.' Much of the hardware deployed on D-Day was part of a huge effort among the Allies to develop the weapons, airplanes, landing crafts and other innovations that could turn the tide of the war. A beach assault required the engineering of wholly new ways to land an invading army, along with the necessary gear and supplies that the operation entailed. The LCVP or Higgins boat was a landing craft which allowed the Allies to disembark massive numbers of men on the beaches of Normandy 70 years ago. The Waco Glider was accurately recreated in 3D by Dassault Systèmes, using what remained of the original blueprints and designs. The Glider was one of many engineering innovations built specifically to enable the Allied victory in WWII. The Dassault Systèmes’ recreation of the Mulberry Harbor will be featured in an upcoming two-hour documentary, “D-Day’s Sunken Secrets,” produced by the PBS science series, NOVA. The film follows the team as they carry out the most extensive survey ever done of the seabed bordering the legendary D-Day beachheads of Normandy, revealing the ingenious technology that helped the Allies overcome the German defenses and ultimately liberate Europe from the Nazis. One of the key parts of the project was the Mulberry Harbour . The Mulberry Harbour was one of the most extraordinary technological feats of WWII. Developed in part by Major Allan Beckett of the Royal Engineers, it was an artificial harbor built in England, transported across the English Channel and assembled off the coast at Arromanches to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle. World War Two, France 7th June 1944: Aerial view of the concrete Mulberry harbour in position at Normandy during the Allied D Day invasion . An artificial harbor was assembled off the coast at Arromanches — the first temporary deepwater facility of its kind ever devised and attempted. It was be used to offload no less than 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles and 4 million tonnes of supplies. Major Allan Beckett of the Royal Engineers developed a system of floating metal roadways mounted on pontoon units of concrete or steel, which connected the beaches to the floating pierheads, further out to sea where large vessels could berth. Thanks to legs that rested on the seabed but allowed these floating platforms to move up and down with the tide, operations could continue round the clock, which was a world first. The system used to join the floating sections gave them great flexibility, absorbing movements caused by sea swell and the weight of vehicles moving over them. The ‘kite’ anchors, which moored the floating platforms to the seabed, were designed to dig in further when the cable is pulled, keeping the structure firmly in place throughout the landing operations. Huge reinforced concrete caissons were laid in a semicircle around the artificial harbor to form a breakwater, protecting it from tide surges and storm damage. By the end of July 1944, the Mulberry B at Arromanches was the world’s busiest port in terms of traffic volumes. The Mulberry Harbor was the first temporary deep water facility of its kind ever devised. Today, nearly seventy years after D-Day, only pieces of the Harbor remain. To recreate the Harbor, the Dassault Systèmes team compiled what remained of the original plans from the Royal Engineers Museum in London, the construction and maintenance manuals, the aerial photographs taken at the time and additional information provided by Tim Beckett, the son of Mulberry Harbor designer Allan Beckett, himself a marine engineer. All of this valuable data was brought together and scrutinized over a period of almost eight months by the lab teams, to enable the son of its inventor to virtually stand on it in an immersive 3D experience. The virtual recreation allows people to stand onboard the Mulberry bridge(right) , and even see the amphibious vehicles driving onto the beach (left) Built in CATIA, the same technology used by leading manufacturers to digitally design cars, airplanes and other advanced products, people can experience these 3D recreations through a number of different technologies, from typical computer screens, to Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets, to an immersive virtual reality experience as shown here. “NOVA: D-Day’s Sunken Secrets” premieres Wednesday, May 28, 2014 at 9PM EDT on PBS (check local listings).","French researchers painstakingly scanned and recreated the landing craft, gliders and landscapes .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . It's easy to forget that bugs have faces - complete with eyes, a mouth and, if not a nose, a pair of large antennae. But now a wildlife photographer has captured extreme close-ups of creepy crawlies  - revealing the complex compound eyes of flies, the triangular profile of a praying mantis and a moth during metamorphosis among others. Many of the images have been lit in such a way they resemble mind tricks, optical illusions and even ink blots. This macro image of a pair of owlflies was taken by 33-year-old photographer Yudy Sauw at his home studio in Tangerang, Indonesia. Owlflies are dragonfly-like insects with large eyes. They are distant relatives of flies, dragonflies and damselflies and typically grow up to 2-inches (5cm) long . The images were shot by 33-year-old Yudy Sauw at his home studio in Tangerang, Indonesia. He used a photography technique known as focus stacking, also known as focus blending, which combines multiple shots of the same subject, taken at different focal distances. Sauw was able to capture the extreme close-ups by placing his camera 4-inches away, but other shots were captured at up to 20-inches distance. Each image took around ten minutes and involved Sauw keeping calm and still so not to disturb the insects. Sauw said: 'All of the photographs were taken in my studio in Indonesia. All of the insects had to be incredibly still for the process to work. Among his collection were a pair of owlflies, which Sauw captured facing each other to resemble an ink blot. Owlflies are dragonfly-like insects with large eyes. They are distant relatives of flies, dragonflies and damselflies and typically grow up to 2-inches (5cm) long.

Sauw was able to capture extreme close-ups, including this shot of a soldierfly, by placing his camera 4-inches (10cm) away . In addition to insects, Sauw also shot alien-looking images of praying mantises. The head consists of a rounded triangle with eyes that take up almost three quarters of the creature's face. It is the only insect that can swivel its head over its shoulder, over 300°, which gives the mantis a distinct advantage when looking for prey . Wasps, such as the one captured in this image, do not reproduce during mating flights, like bees. Instead they reproduce between a fertile queen and either a single, or multiple male wasps. After successfully mating, the male's sperm cells are stored in a tightly packed ball inside the queen until they are needed .

Meanwhile, the adult solider fly, photographed by Sauw, grows up to 0.6 inches (1.6cm) and only lives up to eight days. Its colour and size mimics the appearance of the organ pipe mud dauber wasp, this is enhanced by the fly's elongated, wasp-like antennae.

It is the only insect that can swivel its head over its shoulder, over 300°, which gives the mantis a distinct advantage when looking for prey. This image, which resembles a human face, is a macro photo of a longhorn beetle. Several species are pests and the larvae often bores into wood, where they can cause damage to trees and structures. A number of species mimic ants, bees, and wasps . By taking images over a series of weeks, Sauw was able to capture a moth going through metamorphosis (pictured left), and emerging (pictured right).  For the most part, moths are nocturnal and they fly and feed at night. Butterflies and moths pupate, or become adults, differently. Both go through their metamorphosis in a chrysalis, but moths will often spin a silk cocoon around this protective shell, sometimes camouflaging it with leaves or debris . Although the majority of Sauw's images focus on flies, this shot is of a metallic jumping spider. These spiders have been known to jump from 10 to 50 times their own body length by increasing the blood pressure in their legs. Their large eyes have stereoscopic vision to help them stalk prey and communicate with the opposite sex .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . What lengths would you go to to watch your team play during the World Cup? According to research, a surprising percentage of football fans would bribe their spouse, postpone their wedding, or even miss the birth of their baby. The study also revealed the vast array of superstitions football fans have to ‘ensure’ their team wins. A survey has revealed how far football fans will go to watch their team play in the World Cup. Some 7% would postpone their wedding for a match, while 18% said they would bribe their partner out of the house. England's first game is against Italy on Saturday 14 June at the Arena da Amazonia stadium in Manaus (pictured) In the research, carried out by OnePoll for Pringles, 2,000 UK football fans were asked a series of questions. The fear of bad luck can be reversed by carrying out rituals like touching wood and throwing salt, according to a study by the University of Chicago. Touching wood is the most common superstition in Western culture used to reverse bad fortune or undo a ‘jinx’, while other cultures maintain similar practices, like spitting or throwing salt, after someone has tempted fate. Even people who aren't particularly superstitious often participate in these practices. The study found that these superstitions actually do ‘reverse’ perceived . likelihood of bad fortune. And people believe that negative outcomes are especially likely after a jinx. This uncovered the tactics some fans will be using to ensure they don’t miss a match when the tournament kicks off next week. For example, almost one fifth (18 per cent) admitted they would bribe their partner with cash to shop or go out with friends, so they can watch the match undisturbed. Some . steadfast supporters would also reschedule life events; 7 per cent said they'd be willing to . postpone their wedding to watch their team's match, while nearly one in . ten (8 per cent) said they’d even skip the birth of their baby. Of the respondents, 45 per cent were men. The research also revealed how superstitious football fans are, with half of the respondents saying they had a matchday superstition or ritual. Of these superstitious participants, half insist on sitting in the same ‘lucky seat’ to watch each match and 45 per cent only drink from a special, ‘lucky’ pint glass. Items of clothing also proved popular good luck charms with more than one in ten (12 per cent) men donning ‘lucky undies’ and nearly a quarter (23 per cent) wearing a lucky T-shirt while watching a game. Is this the only safe way to watch England in a penalty shoot-out? In the study one in eight football fans admitted that, if a game in the World Cup comes to spot kicks, they will be watching from behind their sofa in the hope that it will help the team win . When it . comes to penalty shoot-outs, though, one in eight football fans believed . hiding behind the sofa would increase the team's chance of winning. ‘We . usually carry out rituals to help us deal with worries about . uncertainty and bring about good luck,’ said Richard Wiseman, Professor . of the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of . Hertfordshire. ‘But . these superstitions can have a real effect, with research showing that . sportsmen’s rituals, such as wearing lucky boots or tying their laces in . a certain way, can focus the mind and actually enhance on-pitch . performance.’","A study by Pringles reveals the measures fans take to watch football .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . One of the theories for how life began on Earth is something known as panspermia. This says that life was first carried to Earth in microbial form by an asteroid or comet that originated from a planet in our solar system such as Mars, or even one outside it. But could the opposite be possible? Could we send our own life into the universe to ‘seed’ other worlds? That’s what some researchers have discussed - and they say it’s feasible. Scientists have suggested that our best bet of colonising the galaxy might be to send human genomes throughout the cosmos (arist's illustration shown) in the hope they seed life on a planet. The radical proposal was made at a talk for the Smithsonian Magazine in Washington DC recently . In a talk at the Smithsonian Magazine’s ‘The Future is Here Festival’ in Washington DC in May, Nasa engineer Adam Seltzner spoke about the future of space exploration. The 100-year Starship Project is a joint endeavour run by Darpa, Nasa, Icarus Interstellar and the Foundation for Enterprise Development. Through the project Darpa has previously suggested that 'printing' humans on distant planets, like the proposal suggested here by Seltzner, is a possibility for colonising the Milky Way galaxy. Announced in January 2012, the project has an overall goal of achieving manned interstellar travel by 2112. To . do so it is evaluating a number of different techonolgies, including . ‘warping’ space time to travel great distances in short time frames at . faster-than-light speeds. The project is also considering building ‘generation ships’ that move slowly but have a self-sustainable long-term population. To date Nasa has contributed $100,000 (£60,000) to the project and Darpa $1 million (£600,000). And aside from reiterating the importance that we continue manned exploration, he spoke of a lesser-known method of space exploration – sending the human genome to far-flung planets. His somewhat radical proposal, building on work by other researchers, would see humans launched as bacteria to distant planets before being ‘printed’ by methods unknown, perhaps a machine, according to a report written by Meghan Neal for Motherboard. ‘Our best bet for space exploration could be printing humans, organically, on another planet,’ he said. ‘Maybe we will colonize other worlds not with astronauts in space suits, but with bacteria,’ Seltzner continued. ‘Those considerations seem beautiful, fantastic.’ The idea was first dreamed up by Harvard biologists Dr Gary Ruvkun and Dr George Church, as reported in a Harvard Medical School release. They suggest that fractions of the human genome could be sent to distant worlds in bacteria. Upon arrival, the various segments would then be reassembled into a human genome. In fact, in a paper from April 2012, scientists from Kyoto Sangyo University in Japan discussed how so-called ‘reverse panspermia’ might have already happened - albeit by accident. They say previous impacts could have sent life-bearing meteorites from Earth to other planets. The Chicxulub crater event, for example, which is thought to have ended the time of the dinosaurs, might have been sufficient to send Earth-based life to other planets in the solar system. ‘If life forms inside remain viable, this would be evidence of life from Earth seeding other planets,’ they wrote. The proposal would be based around one of two methods. Either bacteria carrying the human genome (strand of DNA pictured) would be sent to 'infect' distant planets and evolve, or a robot would be sent thousands of years in advance and then tasked with printing humans from beamed information . Planets such as Kepler-186f (artist's illustration shown), which was announced in April, provide tantalising hints of habitable worlds outside our solar system. This particular planet is the most Earth-like found to date, orbiting its star in the middle of its habitable zone where liquid water and possibly life could thrive . Quite how these bacteria would grow into humans is up for debate. They could simply be left to evolve, as life did on Earth, seeding another planet with our own organisms. Alternatively, an autonomous machine capable of creating cellular life could be sent thousands of years in advance to a habitable exoplanet outside the solar system. Upon arrival, information on how to genetically construct a human would be beamed to the machine. Of course, these proposals are something that will only be possible for humans hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of years in the future. But many scientists are of the belief that we will one day be able to create multicellular life - and it stands to reason this could include an organism as complex as a human. The theory might sound unlikely but it's not entirely without precedent. In May the European Technology Exposure Facility (Eutef), attached to the exterior of the Columbus module on the ISS, proved that bacteria could survive an interplanetary trip from Earth to Mars, suggesting a journey even further could be possible . The proposal also overcomes a well known problem of interstellar travel - namely, travelling to a distant planet in a human lifetime is impossible based on our current knowledge of the laws of physics. Without a form of travel that can ‘cheat’ when travelling large distances, such as a wormhole that jumps through space-time, interstellar travel just isn’t a realistic proposition. So, perhaps to colonise other worlds our best bet is simply to send the ingredients for humanity and let nature take its course. Whether we’d then be able to communicate with these distant humans, or if they’d know we exist, is another consideration altogether. If the idea sounds like purely science fiction rather than science fact, it might seem less so when a recent experiment on the ISS is taken into account. In May the European Technology Exposure Facility (Eutef), attached to the exterior of the Columbus module, proved that bacteria could survive an interplanetary trip from Earth to Mars. For an interstellar trip they would need more protection in order to survive the long travel time. But one day down the line, perhaps our descendants will decide that throwing bits of human genome into the cosmos in the hope it sticks on a distant planet is our best bet of colonising the galaxy.","A Nasa expert has joined others in saying we could launch DNA to planets .

"By . Dan Bloom . and Ashley Collman . The moment outraged figure skater Ashley Wagner was caught on TV mouthing 'b******t' at her low score has become one of the most re-watched of the Sochi Olympics. Users of the TiVo digital TV recorder wound back to see the American athlete's sour gasp - which she has defended saying 'I wear my heart on my sleeve' - more than any other Olympic moment on Saturday. Viewers were also fascinated with young women falling over, with face-planting snowboarders claiming three of the five most-rewound moments on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Before and after: After finishing what she believed was a stellar short-program performance, Wagner's beams of delight turned to disgust as she received an unexpectedly low score from the judges . Ooft: A fall by U.S. snowboarder Jessika Jenson was another of the most re-watched moments on TiVo . Painful: Jenson, pictured, featured alongside teammate Ty Walker and Aimee Fuller of Great Britain . Wagner's star moment came as the 22-year-old scored 61.30 in her Olympic debut after skating to Pink Floyd's 1975 hit Shine On You Crazy Diamond. Although she clearly thought she had deserved a higher mark, she still made it through to the next round. Her reaction and a GIF depicting her pithy one-word response went viral on social media, with Facebook saying Wagner was one of the most talked-about topics of the weekend. But she was beaten into first place by Canadian sisters . Justine and Chloe Dufour-Lapointe, who took gold and silver in the women's moguls. Meanwhile Sunday's rewinding was dominated by scenes of female snowboarders falling over. Waiting game: Wagner blew kisses to spectators as she waited for the results of her short-program competition . 'I wear my heart on my sleeve': Wagner appeared on the Today show Monday, saying she doesn't have much of a pokerface in competition .

Before the score: Wagner waves to the crowd after her performance . Hopeful: Surrounded by teammates and next to her coach, Wagner waits for the scores . More to come: Wagner says she's hoping to score better in her individual events . While . the top three competitors at the U.S. Championships are usually . selected for the Olympic team, Wagner placed fourth and was chosen over . third-place skater Mirai Nagasu. Despite the low score, Wagner said she was happy she performed so well in the team competition. 'I needed that performance going into the individual event,' she added. 'I came off rocky at nationals and I needed to prove myself more than anything - that one competition didn't define me.' Her performance was enough to propel the U.S. team to the second round of competition, and teammate Gracie Gold's long-program helped give the team a bronze medal. Russia placed first in the competition and Canada earned the silver medal. The Americans' main competition, Russian skater Julia Lipnitskaia, is just 15 years old. The American ladies will be back on the rink to battle Lipnitskaia and the rest of the world competition on February 20.

"By . Mark Prigg . It is said you should never ask a woman her age - but researcher say that by simply knowing her name, it may actually be possible to work out how old people are. Researchers plotted hundreds of names and their popularity. They then created a series of graphs that reveal when each name hit its peak - showing when the person was most likely to have been born. The red dots indicate the age someone with each name is likely to be, based on data from the Social Security Administration, which records birth names dating back to 1880. Researchers at website fivethirtyeight.com analysed  data from the Social Security Administration. They record birth names dating back to 1880. They then used the SSA’s baby name database and combined it with the agency's actuarial tables. These which estimate how many people born in a given year are still alive. The researchers were then able to create the graphs showing when names were most popular. Researchers at website fivethirtyeight.com analysed  data from the Social Security Administration, which records birth names dating back to 1880. They found, for example, that certain names meant a person was likely to be in their 70s. The median living Mildred in the United States is now 78 years old, they discovered, while Gladys, Betty, Ethel and Opal were all of a similar age. On the younger names, they found Madison, Sydney, Alexa and Haileywere most likely to be between 9 and 12 years old. Young names include Liam, most likely to be under 5, Jayden and Aiden for boys, while for females Ava, Isabella and Lily were likely to be toddlers. The team also plotted the popularity of some names over time, and found names like Joseph have always been popular. The peak year for boys named Joseph was 1914 when about 39,000 of them were born, the researchers found. Those 1914 Josephs would be due to celebrate their 100th birthdays at some point this year - although only about 130 of them were still alive as of Jan. 1, according to the most recent records. Joseph has been one of the most enduring American names; it¿s never gone out of fashion. The team also found certain names allowed a very specific age to be guessed at. 'By contrast, you can make much stronger inferences about a woman named Brittany. 'That name was very popular from the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s, but it wasn’t all that common before and hasn’t been since.' Half of living American Brittanys are between the ages of 19 and 25, the team found. Half of living American Brittanys' are between the ages of 19 and 25 .

A pretty English market town could adopt central European time – in a bid to boost tourism numbers. Tenterden in Kent’s idea has been backed by the town's Chamber of Commerce, and if approved would mean the small rural village being an hour ahead the rest of the UK. With a population of 7,800, the town, which has been twinned with Avallon in France for 25 years, believes it should be ‘closer in line with the rest of Europe’. Mike Carter, the Chamber's president said: ‘‘I think we should seriously push this forward, . ‘Tenterden is a real tourist hub and we need to cash in on the millions spent in the area and make the best of it. ‘I hope this gets people talking and thinking about the idea.’ Mr Carter plans to start lobbying Ashford Conservative MP Damian Green to put pressure on the government to rethink the UK’s clocks. The chamber has a meeting with Mr Green later this month and he intends to raise it there. Mr Carter said: ‘It was done as a bit of fun, but there is a serious side to it. Tourism bid: The town is mooting the idea to boost spending by tourists . Popular town: Tenterden in Kent is to lobby its MP in a bid to change its time . ‘It would be great for tourism to have the extra hour sitting outside and people would save on their electricity bills. ‘For quality of life, businesses and leisure time it would be so much better.’ When Mr Carter raised the question at the chamber annual meeting, the majority of those present voted in favour. Scenic: Picturesque Tenterden wants to give tourists an extra hour of daylight . Judy Turk, chairman of the Tenterden & District Twinning Association, said: ‘I think it would be a great idea for England. ‘Businesses would be on the same time and it would not get dark so early. ‘I can't say I have noticed having the extra hour when we have been in France, but then we only go for three days.’ Twinners are going to Avallon later this month for celebrations marking the quarter century of friendship.","Rural town would be one hour ahead of rest of UK if plans get green light .

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . Chijindu Ujah became the third quickest British man over 100 metres in history by running 9.96secs in Hengelo, Holland, on Sunday. The 20-year-old European junior champion took 21 hundredths of a second off his lifetime legal best to set a new UK Under-23 record and become only the fifth British athlete to break the 10-second barrier. Ujah finished second in Hengelo behind Richard Thompson of Trinidad and Tobago, who ran 9.95secs, but his stunning performance has set up an fascinating battle between the country’s best male sprinters at this month’s British Championships in Birmingham. Sprint: Chijindu Ujah (left) became the third fastest Briton over 100m as he recorded a time of 9.96secs . Champion: Ujah is the European Athletics Junior champion after wining in Rieti last year . James Dasaolu ran 9.91secs at last year’s trials, veteran Dwain Chambers has recorded 10.06secs and 20-year-old Adam Gemili has clocked 10.07secs already this season, while Richard Kilty became the world indoor champion over 60m earlier this year. Ujah’s breakthrough performance, however, has probably come too late for the sprinter to be included in England’s team for the 100m at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. The squad was due to be released on Mondau but, although the announcement has been delayed, successful athletes were notified last week. Ujah, who combined athletics with studying applied sciences at college, trains at Lee Valley in north London with long jumper Greg Rutherford and talented young British sprinters such as Sean Safo-Antwi, 23, and Deji Tobias, 22. The group work under Jonas Tawiah-Dodoo, a rugby and sprints coach and former apprentice of American ‘super coach’ Dan Pfaff, who guided Rutherford to Olympic gold at London 2012. Ujah said: 'Right now I’m feeling so happy. I’m just over the moon about my performance. Challengers: Dwain Chambers (left) and James Dasaolu will face Ujah at the British Championships . Competition: World Indoor Champion Richard Kilty (left) and Adam Gemili (right) will also run in Birmingham . 'I knew Richard Thompson was in form and for me to make him dip I knew that we must have gone fast. 'Before the start I knew there was good conditions, much more cooler than it was for my heats, and I thought: ""Anything is possible here. Just try and win the race."" and the time came. 'I came second to Richard Thompson and he’s a world class athlete. 'I did have a feeling this was coming. My group has been training well and we are all on form. I knew what type of shape I was in when I ran 10.17 in Loughborough three weeks ago. 'I’m still in shock, it hasn’t sunk in. Soon I think it will sink in. 'I’ve been getting lots of messages from family and friends and seen it all on Twitter, it makes me happy. 'I just want to take one step at a time. There is still more work to do.'

"By . Ryan Gorman . The accused shooter: Paula Strange is believed by police to have shot dead husband Bruce Strange before killing herself . A woman reportedly shot dead her husband in front of a packed suburban Atlanta supermarket before then turning the gun on herself. Paula Strange, 54, is said by police to have shot dead 52-year-old husband Bruce Strange at a Marietta, Georgia Kroger just after 5.30 p.m., authorities said. It happened only minutes after an argument over dinner at a nearby restaurant, a source told MailOnline. The Kennesaw, Georgia couple was eating at a Mo’s Southwest Grill in the same shopping plaza where the shooting occurred less than half an hour before they were both dead, a person who answered the phone in the fast food joint told MailOnline. ‘They were in our store eating, I assumed they were having an argument,’ the source said, adding that he wasn't sure what the disagreement was about. The husband then abruptly got up and left the restaurant. ‘The gentleman went to the bathroom, ran out the door, jumped over the patio fence and ran behind the restaurant,’ the worker said. Witnesses told WXIA the Kennesaw State University associate director of research compliance chased after him in her Honda Element, racing the engine and shouting at him. He shouted back as he ran towards the supermarket, possibly to escape her. Another shooting: This one at a supermarket in suburban Atlanta - a woman is believed to have shot her husband dead before killing herself in front of this Kroger . She then shot him several times before getting out to execute him in front of horrified shoppers before killing herself with a single gunshot, the witness said. The husband's body was still lying on the sidewalk in front of the store more than three hours later, according to WSB. 'It's just mind-blowing,' one person told the station. 'You come to Kroger to get some groceries... and find out that there is somebody with some kind of issue in their life.' 'They just snapped, and it's just unfortunate,' the shocked witness continued. 'There's families on both sides that are going to be involved and there's going to be a lot of hurt from his and hers, and I'm at a loss for words.' A person who answered the phone at the West Dallas Highway supermarket declined to comment and would not say if any employees witnessed the horrifying shooting. Police told WSB the shooting occurred at 5.37 p.m., and that an unidentified woman shot her husband dead on the sidewalk in front of the busy store. She then used the same firearm to shoot herself dead. It is not clear what kind of gun was used in the slaying. Local authorities did not immediately respond to multiple MailOnline requests for further comment.","Paula Strange, 54, and Bruce Strange, 52, had dinner at a fast food restaurant just minutes before the murder-suicide .

"By . Sally Lee . and Emma Glanfield . Mobile conversations can be listened to or recorded and user's metadata can be tracked by government agencies . The world's second-largest mobile phone company has revealed how government agencies around the world use secret wires to listen in to private phone calls across its entire network. Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report, released on Friday, unveiled how direct-access wires or pipes were connected directly to its network. This allowed government authorities in some of the 29 countries it covers to monitor phone conversations and track users. Although the report didn't release figures on Australia, recently collated data by The Guardian unveiled that Australian government agencies made 685,757 requests to access details about phone calls. This is known as metadata which can track the location of a device, the times and dates of the call and with whom they were made to last year. They also listened to 3,389 calls from various Australian networks - not just Vodafone. In the report, the phone company disclosed details on the widespread use of secret surveillance - including phone tapping - by government agencies, according to The Guardian. While legal notices are required in Australia to access its network, Vodafone revealed that at least six unnamed governments can use its phone system to monitor customers whenever they want. The company has called this direct access to be disconnected and for agencies to gain warrants if any surveillance is to be undertaken. Stephen Deadman, Vodafone's group privacy officer, was quoted in the article: 'We are making a call to end direct access as a means of government agencies obtaining people's communication data. 'Without an official warrant, there is no external visibility. If we receive a demand we can push back against the agency. The fact that a government has to issue a piece of paper is an important constraint on how powers are used.' Vodafone is publishing the report to reveal the extent of phone tapping used by governments to snoop on citizens . Civil rights groups were horrified at the latest revelations, with some describing the practice as 'terrifying'. Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights campaign group Liberty, said: 'For governments to access phone calls at the flick of a switch is unprecedented and terrifying. '(Edward) Snowden revealed the internet was already treated as fair game. Bluster that all is well is wearing pretty thin - our analogue laws need a digital overhaul.' Gus Hosein, from Privacy International, said Vodafone had taken a 'brave step', calling the covert surveillance wires 'the nightmare scenarios that we were imagining'.","Mobile conversations can be listened to or recorded and user's metadata can be tracked by government agencies .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida business owner left his vehicle in an amphitheater parking lot as he attended a hip-hop concert earlier this year. When he returned to the vehicle after the show, he found that his truck had been broken into and vandalized. It wasn't until Matthew Heller found a note in his trashed vehicle outside the Ybor Amphitheater in Tampa that he discovered that it wasn't your typical thief who'd broken into and damaged his truck - it was the police. 'Sir, your car was checked by TPD K-9,' the note left by police states. 'The vehicle was searched for . marijuana due to a strong odor coming from the passenger side of the . vehicle. Any questions call Cpl Fanning.' FYI: After trashing Matthew Heller's vehicle, the Tampa Police Department left him this note . Promotion: The truck the police trashed isn't just a vehicle for Heller, it's advertising for his airhorn business . After tearing through the vehicle and damaging much of the electrical wiring and cosmetics, the officers found precisely zero marijuana - or any other drugs, for that matter. As would be expected, Heller is not happy. 'You think if anyone is going to break into your vehicle in Ybor, the last person you think, it’s going to be the cops,' Heller tells WFLA.com. The officers who trashed the vehicle didn't even leave a business card or an apology - just a handwritten note on a 2x3 piece of scrap paper with a phone number written on it. Heller's vehicle is an over-sized truck with graphics on the side advertising his business, HornBlasters, which sells automotive air-horns. Damage: Heller shows how pieces of paneling were ripped off of the console on his truck . Paint: Damage also was done to the truck's paint job - before the officers realized there were no drugs in the vehicle . 'Disgusted, I’ve got my whole life savings in this truck. It’s like a . marketing tool for my business to promote the air horns and everything. The horns weren’t working, all the electronics were ripped out,' said . Heller. Heller is questioning the officers' claims that his car smelled like marijuana - as he notes, the truck is lifted very high off the ground, where a K-9 unit would have a hard time smelling. Additionally, it was in the parking lot at a concert, where the smell of marijuana is often not an uncommon scent. 'It was all sealed up, a parked vehicle in a private parking lot for a . hip hop concert in Ybor. There were all kinds of smells, everywhere . around here,' said Heller. Heller says he would have happily allowed the officers to search his vehicle, but says he's upset that they trashed his truck, and didn't even ask for his permission, which - depending on who you ask - is potentially against the law. Horns: The wiring to the air horns Heller has hooked up to the truck were damaged in the officers' search for non-existent marijuana . Questionable: Heller's truck is lifted more than three feet off the ground, which has him questioning how a dog was able to smell non-existent marijuana that couldn't be reached by the animal's nose . 'It’s an illegal search,' Florida attorney Bryant Camareno told the website. 'Usually if it’s some kind of . unoccupied vehicle there has to be some level of exigent circumstance to . justify searching a vehicle without a search warrant. Exigent could . mean if there is a dead body inside, if there is a screaming child . locked in the car, a dog but if the car is unoccupied there is no . exigency to justify the search.' The Tampa Police Department, however, defends its search of Heller's truck and says it was perfectly legal. 'While the search is legal, it is not typical,' the TPD said in an email to WFLA. 'The Tampa Police Department is now reviewing the specifics of this investigation.' In the meantime, Heller is still baffled about how something like this could even happen. 'I am out for the damages and my time but mostly I’m scratching my head and kind of confused with everything. I had no clue this was something that could happen,' Heller said.","Matthew Heller attended a concert in Tampa Florida in February and left his truck parked in the venue's parking lot .

"By . Associated Press . The Hershey Co. has sued a Colorado marijuana edibles maker, claiming it makes four pot-infused candies that too closely resemble iconic products of the chocolate maker. The trademark infringement lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Denver this week against TinctureBelle LLC and TinctureBelle Marijuanka LLC. It alleges TinctureBelle's Ganja Joy, Hasheath, Hashees and Dabby Patty mimic Hershey's Almond Joy, Heath, Reese's peanut butter cups and York peppermint patty candies, respectively. York Peppermint Patties are one of the popular Hershey chocolates mimicked by TinctureBelle . Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are one of the most notorious chocolate candies under the Hershey Brand . TinctureBelle's version of the chocolate peanut butter cup looks very similar to the Hershey bran's packaging . TinctureBelle did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The Denver Business Journal first reported about the lawsuit filed Tuesday. The company's website says its products, which include lotions and balms, are 'diabetic safe and delicious' and helpful with a variety of issues, including pain, headaches and insomnia. The edibles are sold in Colorado's legal pot shops and medical marijuana dispensaries. Pennsylvania-based Hershey says TinctureBelle products are packaged in a way that will confuse consumers, including children. Hershey's suit says TinctureBelle ""creates a genuine safety risk with regard to consumers"" who may inadvertently eat them thinking they are ordinary chocolate candy. The lawsuit was filed as Colorado lawmakers look to tighten safety regulations for largely unmonitored marijuana snacks that can be indistinguishable from regular candies and baked goods. Parents and doctors have said some children are eating the highly potent gummy bears, cookies, brownies and other items by mistake, sending them to hospitals in increasing numbers. This is a photograph of a Hershey's Almond Joy, a product the chocolate company claims is being ripped off by an edibles brand . This is TinctureBelle's version of an Almond Joy called 'Ganja Joy' and Hershey isn't happy about it . Hershey wants a judge to order TinctureBelle to stop selling the items. It is also seeking damages. 'Individuals and families the world over trust Hershey and its various brands as signifying safe and delicious treats for people of all ages,'the lawsuit says. More than two dozen people had reported poisonings from marijuana edibles to the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center as of April, citing dizziness, nausea and hallucinations. At least six were children who swallowed innocent-looking edibles, the poison center said. Pot critics' concerns about the marijuana-laced products were stoked by the March death of a college student who authorities said ate more than the recommended dose of a marijuana-laced cookie and jumped to his death from a hotel balcony. In April, a woman told a 911 dispatcher that her husband was hallucinating and talking about the end of the world after he had eaten a marijuana-infused candy and taken pain pills shortly before allegedly shooting her. Supporters of the new marijuana law and some experts say alcohol causes far more problems among users, and the issues with pot can be largely addressed through better regulations.

"Lily Allen has upset health campaigners by accepting money to plug an e-cigarette . Lily Allen has been condemned by health experts for being paid to plug e-cigarettes in the video for her song Hard Out Here. The mother of two, said to be worth about £8 million, was paid an unspecified sum to promote E-Lites, which deliver a nicotine hit in vapour form. The video features dancers taking drags on the devices – promoted as alternatives to cigarettes with the suggestion they help smokers to quit – and close-ups of the packaging. It comes after a Public Health England report on the uptake of  e-cigarettes last month warned of the risks of their promotion by celebrities on young people. Last night one of its authors, Professor Linda Bauld, said: ‘There really isn’t any role for celebrity endorsements in  e-cigarette advertising.’ She warned that using an icon such as the pop star ‘makes the product look very appealing’. The organisation’s director for health and wellbeing, Professor Kevin Fenton, has now called for ‘rapid action’ to introduce regulation, while charity Action on Smoking and Health said the brand should be ‘ashamed’. An E-Lites spokesman said: ‘The Lily Allen video is 18-plus and not targeted at teens.’ A spokesman for the singer declined to comment.

"By . Kirk Maltais . A federal jury in an New York City courtroom awarded a clothing clerk who was tormented and eventually attacked by a co-worker because of his name and race $4.7 million on Friday. Osama Saleh, 27, a Yemeni man, was a earning minimum wage as a stock clerk at a Pretty Girl clothing store location in Brooklyn, New York, where he was tormented by a security guard. Saleh claimed that the security guard, James Robinson, not only constantly referred to as 'bin Laden' and told that 'Muslims are dirty and terrorists', but was punched in the face during a September 2007 altercation with the store's security guard, which resulted in him sustaining a fractured cheekbone. In Saleh's lawsuit, he claimed that nothing was done by the store's manager to stop the bullying from happening. In court documents, store manager Albert Hamra claimed to have thought that Robinson was 'kidding around.'

The outlines of the 'Pretty Girl' sign can be seen in the photo. 'Being called a terrorist and bin Laden is like an insult and a slur against me and my race,' Saleh told the NY Daily News. In the September 2007 altercation that left Saleh with a facial fracture, Robinson confronted Saleh . in the basement of the store after a previous work-related argument on the retail floor. In the basement, Robinson allegedly told Saleh, 'I'm going to call . the police on you, telling them that you don't have papers and you are a . terror [sic],'  further adding that Saleh was 'not an American.'

Hamra conceded in court that he was heard Robinson refer to Saleh as 'bin Laden' a 'few times', but said that the comments took place in the context of the two 'kidding around' and 'teasing each other.' Hamra also admitted that Saleh told him on some occasions that he did not like being called 'bin Laden.'

"A Florida police officer is under fire after a photograph of him in uniform and leaning on a police car while in a passionate embrace with a woman began circulating online. Jacksonville Sheriff's Office patrolman Irving Diaz was snapped grabbing the rear of the woman outside a Denny's on Blanding Boulevard last week. According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, the woman was Diaz's girlfriend - but that fact makes little difference to the feelings of locals who saw the picture. Scroll down for video . Public display: Patrolman Irving Diaz was photographed in a compromising position with a woman who is purportedly his girlfriend . 'It’s one thing to enjoy time with your girlfriend, and it’s another to do it on the city’s dime, you know?' Jacksonville resident Emily Wellstead told News4Jax. Blurred lines: This unclear shot is of Diaz with his police orientation class in 2008 . 'When you’re wearing a uniform and an officer of the law, you're kind of expected to conduct yourself in a certain manner because you are a role model in the community.' The image was taken by Neshia Thomas, who says Diaz and his girlfriend were putting on a shameless display around 6pm on Monday. 'I mean kissing, smooching, like French kissing. Not a simple kiss on the lips,' Thomas told News4Jax. 'All they needed was a bed to fall out of the sky. It was just ridiculous.' Thomas says she took the picture because she was offended by the behavior of Diaz which reportedly went on for 15 minutes. 'You were on top of the squad car like you were above the law, like you made the law, like you own the law.' Inappropriate: Neshia Thomas says the officer should be held to a higher standard of behavior . The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has said it is looking into the incident to determine whether Diaz violated any policies with his enthusiastic PDA. It is not clear whether the amorous cop was on-duty or off the clock at the time of the make-out session. 'It looks pretty bad, looks like that officer is groping that girl,' resident Angelo Collins told News4Jax. 'It’s pretty unprofessional. You wouldn’t expect an officer to be doing that in uniform, let alone on a police car.' According to rules laid down by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, officers must not be seen 'engaging in sexually motivated physical contact or other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature.'","A Florida patrolman was photographed groping a woman outside a Denny's .

Ronny Deila said an emotional farewell to former side Stromsgodset on Monday – and left the Norwegian club declaring that Celtic had snared their title-winning manager on the cheap. Norway’s champions had demanded £1million in compensation for Deila. But sources close to ‘Godset reported that they’d eventually settled for £300,000 up front, rising to £500,000. And sorting director Jostein Flo declared: ‘Ronny is worth 10 times more than Celtic paid. But there is no transfer market for managers, unfortunately. New man: Ronny Deila has left Stromgodset to take over at Scottish champions Celtic . ‘When he wants to go, he has to go. That’s the same for all clubs. There is no reason to keep a manager when he wants to go. ‘For this club, it’s very important to build up players who then go out into the world.

"By . Kaswar Klasra . The brazen attack on Karachi's Jinnah International Airport late on Sunday left at least 29 people dead, including 10 terrorists, exposing how Pakistan is vulnerable to the militants it nurtured for years in its backyard. ""Ten terrorists infiltrated the old Karachi airport on Sunday night disguised as security guards. Pakistan Army soldiers killed all of them following an operation,"" a Pakistani official said on Monday. The attack began just before midnight, when 10 gunmen wearing Airport Security Force uniforms and armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades shot their way into the airport's old terminal, which is used mainly for charter and executive flights. Dark skies: Smoke rises from the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi after militants launched an assault . Response: Pakistani security personnel rush to the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi after the assault by Pakistan Taliban militants . Survivors: Employees leave the airport premises after the attack, which saw night-long gun-battles . Passengers were evacuated and flights were diverted. Gun battles raged through the night until security forces regained control of the airport in the morning. The assault has destroyed the prospect of peace talks between the Pakistani Taliban and the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. It also deals a heavy blow to Sharif's efforts to attract foreign investors to revive growth, and raises questions about security at the country's main installations. In a statement that could hurt ties . between Islamabad and New Delhi, the Director General of Pakistan . military's media wing Asim Bajwa claimed that the arms and ammunition . which the terrorists used could have been made in India. ""Indian-made arms and ammunition were recovered from the militants,"" Major General Bajwa told reporters. Not . surprisingly, it gave Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed an opportunity . to criticise the Sharif-lead government's efforts to improve ties with . India. Gun-battle: A paramilitary soldier in action to repulse the strike by the outlawed Tehreek-e Taliban Pakistan militants . Bomb-disposal: A member of the bomb disposal squad places hand grenades after defusing them along a sidewalk outside the airport in Karachi . Ammunition: Pakistani police officers display confiscated weapons and bodies of the attackers. Sophisticated machine guns and rocket launchers were recovered from the slain terrorists . ""#Karachi Airport is an attack on Pakistan. Modi's new security team is behind this act of war by India. Nation knows the real enemy,"" he tweeted on Monday. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack and vowed to conduct more such strikes in future. ""It is a message to the Pakistan government that we are still alive to . react over the killings of innocent people in bomb attacks on their . villages. Also, it was a warning for the government that we can strike . anywhere across Pakistan,"" Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan spokesman . Shahidullah Shahid said. ""The main goal of this attack was to damage the government, including by hijacking planes and destroying state installations."" The terrorists attacked the Terminal One of the old airport with AK-47s, sub-machine guns and hand grenades. Sources said they took control of the building exposing security lapses at the airport until reinforcements were called in. The army operation to clear the airport continued for almost 10 hours. ""The security forces killed seven terrorists while three blew . themselves up during the fight,"" Director General, Rangers, Major . General Rizwan Akhtar told reporters. A preliminary probe revealed that the terrorists used sophisticated weapons and were highly trained. They are believed to have complete information about every nook and corner of the airport. Sources said the terrorists wanted to hijack a passenger plane to blackmail the government to free their commanders currently languishing in various Pakistani jails. Major General Rizwan Akhtar, a senior army official who supervised the army operation, said only a DNA analysis of the terrorists could ascertain their identity. ""We will carry out DNA tests but their facial features suggest that they may be Uzbeks,"" he told reporters. Sources from intelligence agencies said the government had been alerted about militants preparing to target sensitive installations in big cities. The banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, has claimed the responsibility of attacking Karachi airport in which 29 people were killed, including 10 militants. Pakistani authorities, who suggested the gunmen appeared to be Uzbeks, believe the group intended to destroy or hijack aircraft before they were stopped by the security personnel and commandos. ""We attacked the airport to avenge death of Hakimullah Mehsud, our late leader. There are many more to come as it is just the beginning,"" Shahidullah Shahid, Pakistani Taliban spokesperson said on Monday. He also accused the Pakistan government of using peace talks as a tool of war. Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a US drone strike in November last year. Sunday night's brazen attack on the Karachi airport was the first major terror attack by Pakistani Taliban since Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif came into power after winning general elections in May 2013. According to Asim Qadeer Rana, a security defence analyst, the terror attack on the airport indicated that there can be more in the days to come. ""This fresh attack shows how agitated they are. One can expect more attacks in the future,"" Rana said. Even though the Pakistani Taliban said they attacked the airport to avenge Mehsud's killing, many point out that the strike came soon after government-TTP talks ended. The talks had continued for months with the aim to reach a peace deal. But soon after the peace talks collapsed last month, Pakistan Air force jets pounded suspected hideouts of militants in North Waziristan Agency. The Air Force action eliminated dozens of militants, including various commanders of the TTP. Authorities believe the airport attack resembles the May 2011 strike on the key Mehran Naval base in Karachi by heavily-armed terrorists. Many were killed and aircraft, worth billions of Pakistani rupees, were destroyed. It was the fourth such attack on a heavily-guarded Navy installation that year. Tehreek-e-Taliban militants involved in the assault on Karachi airport were carrying XStat devices that can heal gunshot wounds within seconds, a security official said on Monday. These devices are used to stop bleeding and heal gunshot wounds in 15 to 20 seconds, a source in the paramilitary Rangers said. The security forces found XStat or Faxziat devices from the bags of these terrorists. ""Clearly they came with a long siege of the airport in mind,"" he added. The device, normally used by military medics and emergency services, is an applicator filled with dozens of tiny sponges that soak up a 'ton of blood' when injected into an open wound. Security at various airports has been beefed up following the terrorist attack on Pakistan's largest airport in Karachi. Security at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport has also been tightened. Security measures have been increased as per Standard Operating Procedures and joint patrolling by Delhi Police and CISF personnel are being carried out.","29 people dead, including 10 terrorists .

Ms Copelin was so amazed by what she saw that she posted the image on Instagram so she could share it with followers.

Ms Copelin later told KMBC news: 'Thanks to my love of Instagram I chose to drive by and as I stopped to take a picture the wind whipped up the fire into this funnel. 'The sound and heat were intense and a bit scary not knowing if it would stay put, but it only lasted a couple minutes.' Fire whirls are described by meteorologsists as 'rapidly spinning vortices that form when air superheated by an intense wildfire rises rapidly, consolidating low-level spin from winds converging into the fire like a spinning ice skater, pulling its arms inward'. They are usually very narrow but can reach nearly 100ft.","Photo shows a whirl of 'tornado' fire shooting into the sky in America .

"By . Richard Spillett . Benefits cheat Gwyn Kemp-Philp was jailed after investigators discovered he was a property developer who owned land in the South of France . A benefits cheat was jailed after investigators discovered he was a property developer who owned land in the South of France. Company director Gwyn Kemp-Philp, 69, falsely claimed more than £41,000 in benefits while buying and selling property. A court heard Kemp-Philp and his wife Christine, 60, had nine different bank accounts in the UK and one in France. But the businessman only declared one of the accounts and kept his land in France a secret from the authorities. Prosecutor Christian Jowell said: 'Kemp-Philp received incapacity benefit and submitted applications for housing, council tax and pension credit benefits. 'However he was not entitled to the benefits because he had owned land in France since the early 2000s which he had not declared. 'When he sold the land he did not declare the income.' Cardiff Crown Court heard Kemp-Philp also failed to declare taking out a £25,000 loan from Lloyds TSB and gaining £13,000 from the sale of a property. Kemp-Philp, of Newport, south Wales, initially claimed he used the money from the sale to pay back debts and thought the land in France was 'worthless'. But he later admitted 10 charges of dishonestly making false representation with a view to obtain benefits over eight years. A judge at Cardiff Crown Court said Kemp-Philp's fraud was 'repeated' and 'intentional' The . charges consisted of four of dishonestly making a false statement or . representation and six of failing to disclose a change in circumstances . which would affect benefit entitlement. Between 2005 and 2013 he falsely claimed £41,162.56. Jailing . him for four months, Judge Stephen Hopkins told Kemp-Philp: 'For almost . eight years you repeatedly committed this fraud of public funds - . offences in which you intentionally deceived.' Ex-scaffolder Kemp-Philp and his wife have so far paid back just over £6,000.","Gwyn Kemp-Philp only told authorities about one of his nine bank accounts .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . An Arizona woman convicted of fatally beating her husband with a hammer will spend the rest of her life in prison, a judge ruled Friday, as he denied her request for a chance at parole after serving 25 years. The jury that convicted Marissa Devault in the January 2009 killing of Dale Harrell had spared her the death penalty in late April and instead handed down a life sentence. It was up to a judge to formally impose the sentence and decide whether Devault would have a chance at parole. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Roland Steinle heard tearful pleas for leniency from Devault's three daughters, but he picked the harsher punishment. Marissa Devault, convicted of fatally beating her husband with a hammer, cries as she listens to testimony during her sentencing Friday, June 6, 2014, in Phoenix. She will spend the rest of her life in jail . Marissa Devault's request for parole after 25 years was denied by a Phoenix judge on Friday and she was instead sentenced to life . Murdered: Devault was found guilty in April of brutally beating her . husband Dale Harrell (pictured) to death in 2009, while trying to repay . $300,000 in loans to her 'sugar-daddy' boyfriend . Steinle said he rejected Devault's claim that she committed the murder because she was a victim of domestic violence and instead noted that he believes she killed him out of greed. 'There is nothing in this record of the defendant that would justify parole,' Steinle said, adding that he didn't believe she was remorseful. Prosecutors say Devault, 36, killed Harrell in a failed bid to collect on a life insurance policy to repay about $300,000 in loans from her boyfriend. Devault said she killed her husband in self-defense and told investigators he had physically and sexually abused her in the past. Harrell, 34, died nearly a month later at a hospice because of complications from his head injuries. Devault, wearing a jail uniform, sat in the courtroom's jury box as Harrell's relatives asked the judge to deny her the possibility of parole. Devault tilted her head and bit her lips as she tried to fight back tears during her daughters' comments to the judge. The daughters cried throughout their plea to the judge that their mother should be given the lenient sentence. Rhiannon-Skye Devault-Harrell, Devault's oldest child, said even though her mother attacked her father, he would still have loved her. 'My dad was much stronger than you think, and if he wanted to leave, he would have,' she said. Devault made a brief statement before sentencing. 'I wish I had known all the things I know now so I could make healthier choices,' she said. End of the road: Marissa Devault looked hopeless in court on April 8 as she was found guilty of killing her husband . Harrell's relatives described the pain they have suffered from Devault's actions. Melinda Artrup, Harrell's sister, said Devault took away her brother's chances to witness milestones in his daughters' lives, such as graduations and weddings. She expressed frustration at Devault's portrayal of Harrell as an abuser. 'She tried to taint my brother's name,' Artrup said. Shortly after the attack, Devault told investigators Harrell attacked her as she slept in the couple's home in Gilbert and choked her until she was unconscious. She also told police that when she woke up, she saw another man who lived at their home beating Harrell with a hammer. Devault later confessed to attacking her husband, saying she pummeled him in a rage as he slept after he sexually assaulted her. Disturbing: Devault is seen smiling while . demonstrating for investigators just hours after the attack how the . hammer (right) entered her husband's skull in January 2009 . Prosecutors said there were no records to support Devault's claim that she was sexually abused in the past, though Devault's children had testified that she and Harrell had hit each other in the past. The key prosecution witness was Devault's former boyfriend, Allen Flores, a businessman who met Devault on a sugar-daddy dating website and loaned her about $300,000 during their two-year relationship. Flores testified that Devault wanted to either hire someone to kill Harrell, or kill him herself and tell police he tried to rape her after a night of drinking. Devault's attorneys attacked Flores' credibility, noting he was given an immunity agreement on child-pornography allegations in exchange for his testimony. The child pornography was found on Flores' computer during a search that was part of the murder investigation, authorities said.","Marissa Devault, 36, of Phoenix, Arizona, was convicted of first-degree murder in April in connection to her husband's 2009 killing .

Ailing radio personality Casey Kasem was in critical condition with an infected bedsore at a Washington state hospital, as his daughter and wife headed to court for another hearing in a dispute over his care. The 82-year-old Kasem was receiving intravenous antibiotics and other care Thursday for a serious pressure ulcer he had when he was admitted on Sunday, according to a statement from St. Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbor. Hospital spokesman Scott Thompson said Friday he would make no comment beyond the statement. Radio legend Casey Kasem, 82, is said to be suffering in critical condition with an infected bedsore . Jean Kasem (left) is due back in court opposite . step-daughter Kerri (right) as the two continue to struggle over the radio legend's care . People reports that his two daughters are already in the hospital with him with his son on the way. His health is reportedly alert but it is uncertain how badly his health has deteriorated. Meanwhile, a hearing was scheduled later in the day in Kitsap County Superior Court in the dispute between Kasem's  wife Jean Kasem and his daughter Kerri Kasem, who has said in a court filing that her father has a form of dementia. Jean Kasem has been in control of her husband's medical care and has controlled access to him as his children from an earlier marriage contested who should make decisions about his care. On May 20, while Kasem and his wife were in Washington state, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel S. Murphy ordered Jean Kasem to comply with court orders allowing doctors to evaluate her husband, and also permit Kerri Kasem to see him. Jean Casem is restrained by a friend as she shouts at Kerri Casem as she takes custody of the 82-year-old broadcast icon . The judge also ordered Jean Kasem to surrender her husband's passport and temporarily suspended her powers to determine her husband's medical care. The ruling came after Casey and Jean Kasem were tracked down by Kitsap County deputies on May 13 at the home of long-time family friends. Jean Kasem said they were on a family vacation. Kitsap County is west of Seattle. Daughter Kerri Kasem has been in a protracted legal battle with Kasem's second wife Jean over control of her father's care . Last week, a Washington state judge reiterated the order to allow visits by Kerri Kasem, who brought a doctor on Sunday and her father was taken to the hospital. As Casey Kasem was taken out of the home, Jean Kasem tossed a package of ground meat at her stepdaughter. Before chucking the meat, Jean Kasem recited a passage from the Bible. 'In the name of King David, I throw a . piece of raw meat into the street in exchange for (giving) my husband to . the wild rabid dogs,' the 59-year-old said, according to NBC News. She later added: 'If you need to know why I did it — when a person is about to pass away, there are always rabid dogs.'

A North Carolina man has been charged with human trafficking after police say he held a German woman against her will in a secret room at a suburban Raleigh warehouse. Robert Whiteside, 45, was charged with sexual servitude involving an adult victim and assault by strangulation on Monday. He is being held on $250,000 bond in the Wake County jail pending a first court appearance on Tuesday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Prosecutors in Virginia have agreed to drop rape charges against a former sheriff's deputy who was fired last month amidst allegations that he had non-consensual sex with a female inmate while she was in custody at a county jail. However, former Alexandria County deputy Bryant Pegues, 52, will still be charged with a felony count of carnal knowledge of an inmate. It's unclear what caused the prosecutor to drop the rape charge, and the crime of carnal knowledge of an inmate does not come with a mandatory jail or prison sentence, which means Pegues could potentially be found guilty but not be incarcerated. Fired: Bryant Pegues was terminated from the sheriff's office following allegations that he had sex with an inmate . Pegues was arrested May 27 after an inmate at the William G. Truesdale . Adult Detention Center accused him of sexually assaulting her. Prior to dropping the rape charge, Commonwealth’s Attorney Bryan Porter said Pegues used a pen to threaten the unidentified inmate as he raped her on the morning of his arrest. According to Alexandria Sheriff Dana Lawhorne, the inmate told another deputy about the alleged rape shortly after it happened. The deputy then reported the rape to Lawhorne. '[The inmate] did not hesitate...[to tell another] deputy, who immediately reported it and did the right thing,' Lawhorne told NBC Washington shortly after the incident was reported. Following a brief investigation, Pegues - who has been with the sheriff's office since 2007 - was fired. Lawhorne now says he's trying to determine whether there are other victims. Pegues has worked as a deputy at the William G. Truesdale Adult Detention Center since 2007 . 'If he's done it before, and there's more than one [victim], let the chips fall where they may and it'll fall right on him,' Lawhorne - who says he knows the former deputy well - said. After it was revealed that Pegues would not be charged with rape, Lawhorne said that he agreed with the prosecutor's decision. 'I agree with the decision of the Commonwealth’s Attorney to drop this . charge,' Lawhorne said in a statement. 'The fact remains that he . betrayed his duty to this Office and violated the public trust.' Lawhorne says the decision to drop the rape charge does not change Pegues' termination.","Former deputy Bryant Pegues is accused of threatening the inmate with a pen before sexually assaulting her .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . Legendary radio DJ Casey Kasem's wife pleaded Monday with her lawyers to not let her husband die shortly before a ruling was handed down demanding he be fed, hydrated and medicated. Jean Kasem attended the hearing to argue for her ailing husband to receive nourishment while a court-appointed attorney evaluates his health of the ailing radio personality after daughter Kerri Kasem moved to implement end of life measures. Casey Kasem is in critical condition at a Washington hospital while suffering through a combination of dementia and infections that are exacerbated by feeding and hydrating him, lawyers for Kerri kasem argued. 'Please don't let them kill my husband!' Jean Kasem cried out while dropping to her knees in a court corridor, according to NBC News. A judge ruled on Monday that Casey Kasem, pictured in 2003, should be fed, hydrated and medicated while a court-appointed attorney evaluates the health of the ailing radio personality . Jean Kasem's lawyers also argued he has the will to live and does not want to die. '[He] signaled to her that he was in distress, grabbed her hand with such strength that the hospital administrator had to peel his fingers off one by one,' one of her lawyers told the judge. Kerri Kasem has been placed in temporary control of his treatment. She consulted with doctors and decided in recent days to stop giving her father food, water and medications, her attorneys said. 'This is an unusual circumstance,' one of her attorneys explained. 'Feeding and hydration causes him tremendous amounts of pain and further infection and pneumonia.' Kerri Kasem added that 'only God knows when to take someone.' Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy disagreed, and ruled that Casey Kasem should receive the treatments while an attorney appointed by the judge meets with Kasem and his doctors in Washington state. Tug of war: Jean Kasem, wife of the ailing radio star, left, and his daughter Kerri Kasem, right, have been fighting in courts in Washington state and Los Angeles over his care . Kerri Kasem's attorney Troy Martin said the decision to begin end-of-life measures was made after doctors determined that feeding and hydrating the celebrity had become increasingly painful. Martin said the judge's ruling is likely to cause the former American Top 40 host more pain. Casey Kasem's wife of 34 years, Jean Kasem, appeared in court and said she supported Murphy's ruling and will ask to be restored as her husband's caretaker. She lashed out at Kerri Kasem and judges who have found Jean Kasem in contempt for refusing to cooperate with her stepdaughter, who was named Casey Kasem's temporary conservator last month after he was moved to Washington state.

"By . Francesca Chambers . Hillary Clinton fans and foes need not rush to the store tomorrow morning to buy the former secretary of state's book Hard Choices, readers who obtained early copies say. The juicy sections of the book have already been leaked, and book is overall 'a newsless snore,' Politico's Mike Allen said today in his morning newsletter. Hard Choices was 'written so carefully not to offend that it will fuel the notion that politics infuses every part of her life,' Allen said. 'In this book, like in ""The Lego Movie” theme song, everyone is awesome!' Hillary Clinton's soon-to-be released book Hard Choices is getting bad reviews . At . one point in the book, Clinton, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, discusses criticism and notes that, . 'Your critics can actually teach you lessons your friends can’t or . won’t.' 'I try to sort out the . motivation for criticism whether partisan, ideological, commercial, or . sexist, analyze it to see what I might learn from it, and discard the . rest.' What Clinton ought to take away from criticism of Hard Choices is that she should be more honest in her next book, readers say. 'Clinton’s account is the low-salt, . low-fat, low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert,' Slate's John Dickerson said in a review today titled 'Safe Choices.' Likewise, Allen said a Republican who has already devoured the book told him in an email, 'Honestly, it is so vanilla and picked over.' She does a LOT of complimenting people in D.C. Everyone is . clear-eyed and indefatigable.' ' ""Hard Choices"" is no tell-all by a former official looking to settle . scores,' says The Washington Post's Dan Balz. Balz quotes Clinton as writing in the book that she didn't always agree with president Barack Obama and other administration officials, 'Some of those times you’ll read about in this book, but others will remain private to honor the cone of . confidentiality that should exist between a president and his secretary . of State, especially while he is still in office.' The anecdotes in the book mostly fall into the latter category, if early reviews are to be believed. Clinton¿s account is the low-salt, low-fat, low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert,' one critic said . Clinton has routinely said that she's not yet certain of her future political plans. It's clear from the book that she is 'keeping all her political options open,' however, New York Times reporter Michiko Kakutani, writes. The 2008 presidential candidate obviously wants to be 'known not only for mastering the art of diplomacy, but also for having the policy chops to become chooser-in-chief,' he said. But Clinton doesn't quite get the job done, according to Dickerson. 'The . entire message of the book is that foreign policy is hard and . complicated, so when Obama goes another route,' than the one she advised . him to take, 'Clinton explains that it . was a reasonable path to take having weighed all the complexities' instead of explaining why her way would have been better, Dickerson says. 'No one likes to . lose a debate, including me. But this was the President’s call and I . respected his deliberations and decision,' Clinton says after explaining that she wanted to assist Syrian rebel forces in forcibly removing Syrian president Bashar al-Assad from power but Obama said no. On a similar note, Balz said, 'The book is a careful document designed to preserve, perhaps burnish, . future possibilities.' Balz wrote that the 'normally cautious Clinton' comes off in the book as 'less a visionary and more a practical-minded problem solver.' The purpose of Clinton's memoir wasn't to provide a vision, though, New York Times Magazine's Mark Leibovich says. Like most memoirs by politicians and presidential hopefuls, Clinton likely penned the book for the following reasons: 'a payday, the aforementioned shadow campaign, the future right to say, “I addressed that in my book”— but reading pleasure is not among them.' 'As a general rule, the most engaging political memoirs are written by those who are ending their political careers,' Leibovich said in an article panning Clinton's memoir last month. Such books out to be called, 'Contractually Obligated and Desperate Not to Offend,' Republican strategist Mike Murphy told Leibovich. 'When someone is brave enough to write one of these books and call it ""Screw Iowa and New Hampshire"" or something, then I might actually read it,' Murphy said, referring to the states that traditionally hold their presidential primaries first, and therefore set the tone on the race. In an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyers about the book, Clinton said she'll make her decision about running for president again after she finishes her book tour and the 2014 midterm elections are over this fall.","Hillary Clinton's memoir Hard Choices doesn't come out until tomorrow, but the juicy potions have already been leaked in the press .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Hillary Rodham Clinton says that she has ‘moved on’ from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and even wishes the woman who had an affair with her husband well. Former president Bill Clinton admitted that he had an ‘inappropriate relationship’ with Lewinsky when she interned at the White House in 1995 to 1996. But Mrs Clinton, talking as her memoir Hard Choices hits the shelves, is seemingly putting the past behind her. Moving on: Hillary Clinton has said that she wishes Monica Lewinsky well . In an interview with ABC, the former Secretary of State, said: ‘I have moved on, and that's how I see, you know, my life and my future.’ And when it was put to her that Lewinsky has complained about living her life ‘as a punchline’, Mrs Clinton said: ‘Well, I would wish her well. I hope that she is able to, you know, think about her future and construct a life that she finds meaning and satisfaction in.’ She added: ‘Forgiveness is a way of opening up the doors again and moving forward, whether it's a personal life or a national life.’ It was said that she’d referred to Lewinsky as a 'narcissistic looney toon' after the affair became public, but she refused to be drawn on this. Mrs Clinton explained that she believes that over the years she’s become a ‘deeper, more understanding’ person. Putting the past behind her: Mrs Clinton refused to be drawn on whether she referred to Lewinsky as a 'narcissistic looney toon' Publicity drive: Clinton sat down with ABC to promote her memoir Hard Choices . If she does run for president again, Clinton said she 'would be working as hard as any underdog or any newcomer because I don't want to take anything for granted if I decide to do it.' That said, the presumptive 2016 frontrunner indicated that she may not reenter politics because she's happy with the work she is doing now at the Clinton Foundation. 'I really like my life, I like what I’m doing,' she said. 'I’m thrilled about becoming a grandmother in the fall. I have lots of hopes – for what that means – to me and my family.' 'We have one life to live. This is -- this is it. It’s not a dress rehearsal,' Clinton said. The comments come after her former boss - President Barack Obama - said he thinks she would be a 'very effective' president if she decides to run. The President praised his former Secretary of State during an interview for Live with Kelly and Michael at the White House that aired last Friday. 'Hillary and I, we're buddies,' he said in the interview.","Bill Clinton admitted to an 'inappropriate relationship' with Lewinsky .

"By . Associated Press . For years, he lived a solitary life amid the expansive wilderness of Utah as he ransacked cabins and trekked hundreds of miles alone on his snowshoes with a rifle slung over his shoulder. For most of the next decade, he'll live behind bars in a federal penitentiary. Troy James Knapp, known by many as the 'Mountain Man,' agreed on Monday to a package of plea deals on burglary and weapons charges in state and federal courts, closing dozens of criminal cases against him in seven Utah counties. Troy James Knapp, center, is taken into custody in the mountains outside of Ferron in central Utah on April 2 . Troy James Knapp, also known as the mountain man, is shown in this Sanpete County, Utah, Sheriff's Office booking photo taken after his capture on April 2 of last year . Knapp, 46, was sentenced in U.S. District Court in St. George to 10 years and six months in prison on federal weapons charges that stem from him firing shots at agents before he surrendered last year in April last year in the snowy mountains of central Utah. He also pleaded guilty to 10 felony burglary counts on state charges, with each state conviction drawing a sentence of one to 15 years and a $10,000 fine. State court Judge Eric A. Ludlow ran each sentence concurrent with the other and the federal sentence, and waived the money amount. Knapp's federal and state defense attorneys said he was indigent. He will receive credit for the 14 months he has already served in jail. When he finishes his time in federal prison, state officials will determine whether he spends any more time behind bars. But prosecutors and Knapp's attorneys, including Deputy Federal Public Defender Kathryn Nester, said the intent was for Knapp to serve his entire sentence in federal prison. The plea deals mark the end of the mysterious story of an unknown California fugitive who became a sensation in Utah as he raided cabins, stealing guns, whiskey and supplies. U.S. District Judge Ted Stewart commented that Knapp should write a book about his experiences, and told him that he would have plenty of time to do it in prison. Troy James Knapp listens as he is addressed by Judge Eric A. Ludlow during a sentencing hearing at the Fifth District Court Monday, June 9, 2014, in St. George, Utah . Knapp declined to speak in federal court and when asked by Ludlow in state court if he had anything to say, Knapp said: 'No, thank you.' Outside court, his attorney Jay Winward said, 'That will be his last word,'Thank you,' And he will live a quiet life.' After his arrest last year, Knapp fired his defense attorney and defiantly told a judge he would represent himself. But U.S. Assistant Attorney Matthew Bell said Knapp has been cooperating with authorities since agreeing to the plea deal this spring. Knapp helped authorities them find 16 weapons he had stored away in four locations in four different counties. That included 13 handguns, two rifles and 1 one shotgun, Bell said. Winward said all weapons Knapp stole during his years on the run had been accounted for. His attorneys said the weapons were used for survival and protection against wild animals and never to ""scare, threaten or use against citizens,"" although they conceded he was convicted of firing at the federal agents who apprehended him. Troy James Knapp exits the courtroom after being sentenced at the Fifth District Court on Monday . Knapp was born in Saginaw, Michigan, and got into trouble with the law early. As a teenager, he was convicted of breaking and entering, passing bad checks and unlawful flight from authorities, according to court records. Knapp drifted across the country and ended up in prison in California for burglary. He fell off the radar in 2004 when he 'went on the run"" while on parole. In 2007, southern Utah authorities began investigating a string of cabin burglaries in southern and central Utah they believed were tied to one person. It wasn't until early 2012 that they identified Knapp as the suspect from cabin surveillance photos and fingerprints lifted from a Jim Beam bottle in one cabin.

In one photo, he was wearing camouflage, a rifle was slung over his shoulder and he had purple-colored aluminum snowshoes on his feet. Authorities say Knapp spent winters holed up in snowbound cabins, sleeping in the owners' beds, eating their food and listening to their AM radio for updates about the manhunt. In summer he retreated deep into the woods with a doomsday supply of guns, dehydrated foods, radios, batteries and high-end camping gear. Knapp's signature clues were rumpled bed sheets and an empty bottle of whisky, authorities said. Sometimes he left notes taunting authorities, including one that warned a sheriff that he was ""gonna put you in the ground!"" Other times, he left thank you notes. In one break-in in Garfield County, police say Knapp cooked some beans and left a note in the cabin log that said 'Thanks for the hospitality, Troy James the red head.' After years of being unable to catch him, authorities finally closed in on Knapp around Easter 2013 by using some of his own tactics. After tracking him by snowshoes for three days, dozens of officers converged on him in snowmobiles and a snowcat, flushing him out of the cabin. He fired several shots at officers and a helicopter, and tried to flee on snowshoes before being caught. McCombs reported from Salt Lake City.

"By . Associated Press . A former Miami Beach police officer was convicted Monday of reckless driving but acquitted of driving under the influence for a 2011 crash in which he struck and seriously injured two people strolling on the beach while joy-riding with a woman on a police all-terrain vehicle. The six-person jury reached the verdict in the trial of Derick Kuilan after deliberating just over two hours. Kuilan, 33, was convicted of reckless driving with serious bodily injury, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, as well as misdemeanor reckless driving. Party boy: Kuilan was photographed with this bachelorette party before he struck two people while driving his ATV . Embarrassed? Kuilan kept his head down in court on Wednesday . Trial evidence showed that Kuilan, while on duty and in uniform, had a blood-alcohol level above Florida's 0.08 legal limit to drive when he took a woman at a South Beach nightclub bachelorette party out on the high-speed beach ATV ride. But the defense also showed there was a second blood test that put Kulian's alcohol level below the limit, some five hours after the crash. 'He was not guilty of DUI, and that's what we've said all along,' said Kuilan's attorney, Evan Hoffman. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez will sentence Kuilan at a later date. Kuilan, who had been free on bail, was taken into custody following the verdict. Assistant State Attorney David Gilbert told jurors during closing arguments that the two alcohol blood test results — both of which would surely have been higher if Kuilan's blood had been drawn earlier — coupled with the officer's decision to take the ATV out on a pitch black beach was clear evidence of recklessness, not just poor judgment as Kuilan's attorney contended. Victim: Kitzie Nicanor, pictured, suffered a brain injury from the crash and her spleen had to be removed . Vehicle: Kuilan was driving this ATV on the night of the crash that struck two people on the beach . 'Without his headlights on, he might as well have had a blindfold on,' Gilbert said. 'Can you get more reckless than that? He was both impaired and reckless on the night of the incident.' Victims Kitzie Nicanor and Luis Almonte both testified, saying they had gone to ocean's edge to watch the sunrise when the ATV slammed into them without warning. Almonte suffered a shattered leg and Nicanor had numerous injuries, including a brain injury she said has left her unable to work. Her spleen was removed, leaving a large scar. Some of the women at the bachelorette party testified they initially thought Kuilan and his then-partner may have been part of the club's entertainment, perhaps even male strippers. They got the officers to pose for a party cellphone photo that was published around the world after Kuilan was charged by prosecutors. Hoffman noted that Kuilan is also being sued in civil court by the victims, who seek money damages for negligence. Hoffman said that was the proper way to resolve the case, rather than felony criminal convictions. No one testified that Kuilan was seen drinking alcohol, Hoffman said, and no hard evidence that he was speeding on the ATV or driving it erratically. 'This case is riddled with reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,' Hoffman told the jury. 'This is a reckless driving case where there was no reckless driving.'","Derick Kuilan, 33, was convicted Monday of reckless driving for a 2011 crash in which he struck and seriously injured two people strolling on the beach, but was acquitted of driving under the influence .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A three-hour armed standoff with a man wanted for making criminal threats and leading police on a high speed chase Monday morning was brought to a peaceful end. The unidentified 40-year-old Latin male surrendered just after 3.00 p.m. to being an end to the hours-long standoff which followed a high speed chase and a bizarre jog through a residential neighborhood while brandishing an assault rifle that cause multiple schools to go on lockdown. Footage showed the man, wearing all-white, lying on his stomach with his face in the grass and his hands on his head with snipers trained on him from a next-door roof as SWAT officers cautiously approached and arrested him. End of the line: The unidentified male surrendered peacefully . On the move: The wanted man running through a suburban Los Angeles neighborhood after leaving the highway . Locked and loaded: The gunman stands on the roof almost as if he's looking up at the police and news helicopters hovering over him . It was a stark contrast from the aggressive driving, and erratic flight on foot that saw him slowly jogging around the area and eventually jumping on a roof before running inside a home around 11.30 a.m. Authorities told KABC he held no hostages in the home. Police claim to have a warrant for the arrest of the suspect after he was identified as having made ‘terrorist threats’ to multiple people a few days ago. An attempt to apprehend him at about 10.30 a.m. Monday led to the chase. The pursuit lasted about 45 minutes from local streets near downtown Los Angeles to multiple highways including the 101 to the Pasadena Freeway and finally the Golden State Freeway to North Hollywood. Further footage showed him pointing the firearm out the window of his maroon sedan at police during the chase, but it is not clear if any shots were fired. Opening fire on a police officer would lead to potential attempted murder or attempted deadly assault. The suspect: Dressed in all white and pacing back and forth on top of a roof . Evacuation: Students flee a nearby school once SWAT officers surround the gunman . Investigators were reportedly combing the 5 freeway for spent shell casings as proof he fired upon police as of about 2.30 p.m. Aerial footage showed him dangerously weaving in and out of traffic, across multiple lanes and reaching speeds police said exceeded 100 MPH before he inexplicably got off the highway and jumped out of his car in the Oakwood neighborhood and began jogging around. At least one bystander fled the man when he realized he was carrying what looks to be an AK-47 assault rifle. Another told KABC of the horrifying moment he encountered the armed man. 'I was at the light and on my left came a maroon-colored car,' the witness told the station, adding the motorist drove past him before making a sharp right turn. 'I wasn’t sure what was going on and then saw police come up behind him. 'I saw him fumbling in the car and came out with a rifle and that’s when I ducked, he continued. 'I was in the Marine Corps, but when you see this in front of you and you're not armed.. the first thing is observe and see what info you can give [police]. Getaway car: The suspect fled police in this maroon sedan . Driving dangerously: The suspect weaved through traffic at high speeds as he made a desperate attempt to outrun police . In hot pursuit: A police cruiser chases the man at speeds approaching 100 mph . 'I’m just happy he didn’t open fire,' said the relieved man. 'I was thinking God I hope he doesn’t shoot anybody, its something that you think you’d see in a movie.’ The suspect then bizarrely paced back and forth on the roof of one home before ducking inside just before 12.00 p.m. Multiple schools went into lockdown as word of the danger spread, but the lockdowns were lifted after police surrounded the suspect in the home he holed up in with about 50 squad cars and other armored vehicles. Further aerial footage showed young children in a long line holding hands while walking to North Hollywood Park to meet their families. One mother who spoke to KABC said the ordeal was 'nerve-wracking,' but that her daughter was 'able to text me and tell me everything was okay. 'The even had a spot for them to go to the bathroom.' A SWAT team and negotiators have been brought in to handle the situation, but police are remaining tight-lipped as the standoff lurches forward. Both sides are dug in to the point that police have brought in portable bathrooms, possibly a sign they plan to be there for a while.","The unidentified suspect was reportedly wanted for making violent threats during a domestic dispute last week .

"By . Associated Press . and Joshua Gardner . Conservative radio host Glenn Beck has revealed that he's the bidder who won a June 5 auction of an American flag that flew over a ship at Normandy on D-Day. Beck announced on his radio show and website that he snagged the 48-star Navy ensign at a sale of World War II artifacts and memorabilia at Bonhams last Thursday for $350,000. The tattered flag flew aboard the American-built LST 493 during D-Day operations 70 years ago. It had been estimated it would sell for far less: about $25,000 to $35,000. History: This tattered American flag was flown on a U.S. ship at D-Day and was auctioned off on Thursday for a whopping $350,000 . 'While the human experience is itself exceptional, those who deny the will to endure and the willingness free mankind from those who wish to control and oppress miss what makes the average American truly exceptional throughout the world,' Glenn said. Beck was listed as an unnamed online buyer when he won the spirited bidding at Bonhams in Manhattan. The auction also featured rare print-outs of the original series of hourly Dow Jones news bulletins with some of the first reports of the fighting on France's north coast on June 6, 1944. They fetched $10,000. The flag and documents were owned by military collector and historian Rodney Hilton Brown. The auction also included battlefield souvenirs, innovative wartime technology, rare documents and photographs from the war's European and Pacific theaters. Among the . higher-priced items for sale were the original designs of the Mulberry . harbor, the massive structures the Allied ferried across the English . Channel to use as temporary ports on Normandy's coast. The British . innovation allowed quick resupply and reinforcement of the assault . troops after they started advancing inland. Sketched . in pencil by engineer Hugh Iorys Hughes, the nine drawings had a . pre-sale estimate of $70,000 to $100,000. But Bonham's said they did not . sell Thursday. Glenn Beck, a well-known collector of WWII memorabilia, and his charity Mercury One paid ten times what Bonham's estimated the flag would go for -- $350,000 . Your browser does not support iframes. More than half of the 350-lot auction is owned by Brown, a military historian and collector who also owns the original 12½-foot-tall version of the sculpture depicting the raising of the American flag at Iwo Jima. Inspired by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal's famous image of the event, Felix de Weldon made the stone monument seven years before his larger bronze of the flag raising was installed in Arlington, Virginia, as the Marine Corps War Memorial. The original statue failed to sell during a February 2013 auction at Bonhams. Brown, a 71-year-old Army veteran, began collecting World War II items as a 10-year-old canvassing his Philadelphia neighborhood, telling homeowners he was collecting items from the war. 'They'd say, 'Great, take them out of here,' Brown said in a telephone interview. Brown, founder and owner of the New York-based War Museum, said it was fitting to put his items up for sale on June 5 because June 6 was the day 'the greatest invasion in history took place.' He points out that the Dow Jones printouts from various news sources that historic day are particularly rare since they were usually tossed away or used for 'ticker tape' parades. 'Somebody knew enough to clip out and save the D-Day bulletins,' Brown said. 'It's a unique document. I don't believe there's another one in existence.'","The conservative radio personality's identity as the buyer was only revealed Monday when Beck himself announced the purchase .

"By . Associated Press . If you believe Chris Christie is going to put himself at the mercy of a late-night comic, we've got a bridge to sell you. But it's true. NBC said today that the New Jersey governor is booked to appear on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight show on Thursday, alongside comic Chris Rock and musician Kacey Musgrave. Christie is no stranger to late-night television. He appeared on Fallon's Late Night three times before the star took over Tonight in February. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie pictured speaking in Manahawkin, N.J.  in January . But this is his first foray into . late-night comedy since the story about lane closures on the George . Washington Bridge became a problem for the Republican governor. The governor had been accused of making his staff intentionally clog traffic near the George Washington Bridge to punish a political adversary. Beginning on September 9, 2013, three lanes leading from the town of Fort Lee to the bridge's toll booths were choked into a single-file line, with the other toll lanes serving other bridge traffic. The resulting backup snarled traffic in the town, delayed school buses and first responders, and led to the death of an elderly woman. Mike Myers visited The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon at Rockefeller Center last week . The Republican strongly maintains he never had any knowledge that the bridge closing was orchestrated by staffers in his own office - and certainly never ordered the closing. Christie was photographed at a 9/11 memorial event in New York City that day and insisted he had no knowledge of any plot regarding the bridge until January. However, the scandal damaged Christie's brand. He had been considered an early front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination before Bridgegate. Now, his name comes up in conversation considerably less.","Christie will appear on Tonight show on Thursday .

"By . Associated Press . and Meghan Keneally . Charged: Andrew Young, 48, was arrested on Sunday for his third instance of drunken driving . Disgraced politician John Edwards' former aide who was a key witness in the federal case against the Democrat has been arrested on drunken driving and child abuse charges. Andrew Young, best known for falsely claiming to have a sexual relationship with Edwards' mistress during the 2008 presidential campaign, was arrested on Sunday night in North Carolina. Court records show that Young was charged with impaired driving and misdemeanor child abuse since his 13-year-old son was in the vehicle. The 48-year-old father was released on a $2,000 secured bond early Monday morning. Young, who lives in Chapel Hill, was pulled over about 11.45pm near Walnut Creek Amphitheatre in Raleigh after he 'was involved in a road rage incident where he punched a vehicle,' according to court records. The arresting officer described Young as having 'red glossy eyes, slurred speech.' Young told police he drank four large beers at a concert, according to the report. The outdoor arena had just hosted a show by country music singer Luke Bryan. North Carolina court records show Young has been charged with driving while impaired on two prior occasions, most recently in 2006. Star witnesses: Andrew Young (right) and his wife Cheri (left, seen in 2012) testified against former presidential candidate John Edwards during his campaign finance trial . Let go: John Edwards, pictured with his eldest daughter Cate and his parents by his side, was found not guilty of committing any crimes during the 2012 trial, which focused on the cover up of his affair during the 2008 presidential race . Young's arrest report does not list a current employer. In 2007, the married aide falsely claimed paternity of the baby Edwards fathered with a campaign videographer, Rielle Hunter. Young testified at Edwards' 2012 campaign finance trial that he took secret payments from two political donors to hide his boss' pregnant mistress from the media. Edwards was acquitted on one felony count, and the jury was unable to agree on a verdict on five other charges. Federal prosecutors elected not to seek a retrial. Young wrote a 2010 tell-all book about his role in the Edwards scandal, titled 'The Politician.' Trying to keep it quiet: As a married aide to Edwards, Young (left, with his wife in 2010) publicly said that he was the father of videographer Rielle Hunter's daughter Frances Quinn (right, in 2012) and not Edwards . At the subsequent trial in federal court, however, Young was forced to admit under cross-examination that several details in his book- which has been optioned for a film being written by Aaron Sorkin- were inaccurate. Edwards' defense lawyers claimed that the presidential candidate had no direct knowledge of the roughly $1million in payments funneled into accounts controlled by Young and his wife, Cheri. Bank records entered into evidence showed much of the money went not to care for Edwards' mistress, but to help build the couple's palatial dream home.","Andrew Young has been released on bond after being arrested for drunken driving after leaving a Luke Bryan concert .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Jessica Jerreat . and Associated  Press Reporter . Blustery California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn showed a sensitive side on Monday's Good Morning America as he tearfully apologized to his wife and rival owners for his fiery rant after his horse's loss in Saturday's Belmont Stakes. 'I'm very ashamed of myself,' the 61-year-old told Robin Roberts with his wife at his side. 'I need to apologize to a lot of people.' Those people included the team behind Belmont Stakes winner Tonalist and Coburn's wife Carolyn, who he was seen lashing out at as she attempted to calm him during his televised tirade. Scroll down for videos . Finally sorry: Steve Coburn tearfully apologized Monday after two days of angry remarks following his horse California Chrome's loss at the Belmont Stakes on Saturday . 'I wanted so much for this horse to win the triple crown': Coburn's tears truly began to fall after he apologized to his wife and started talking about the hopes he had for 'America's horse' 'I want to apologize to all the horse racing in the world, to Carolyn,' he said, and also to co-owner 'Perry Martin and his family.' It wasn't until Coburn addressed his regrets to America as a whole that the tears really began to fall. 'This is America's horse,' a crying Coburn said of the horse with humble beginnings. 'I wanted so much for this horse to win the triple crown.' Monday's talk with Roberts was in stark contrast to the Coburn that horse racing fans saw over the weekend. Even . after a night's sleep to think over calling Belmont Stakes winner . Tonalist a 'coward' for not running in the Kentucky Derby, Coburn . labored his point that California Chrome was at a disadvantage having . raced three times in five weeks. 'That . would be like me at 6'2"" playing basketball against a kid in a . wheelchair,' said the owner during a previous interview on Sunday with . Good Morning America. 'Any celebrating going on beforehand?' Deft interviewer Robin Roberts appeared to try to get Coburn to admit he'd been drinking before his tirade, but he did not . 'I'm proud of you': Carolyn Coburn accepted her husband's apology for appearing to lash out at her as she moved to sooth him following his televised tirade. She called him a 'very compassionate man' On Monday, Carolyn Coburn spoke of her husband's generosity towards a boy with special needs the couple met while at the Kentucky Derby. 'I hope people can see him the way he is,' she told Roberts. 'He is a very compassionate man.' She quite clearly had accepted her husband's apology and told him as the tears started to dry: 'I'm proud of you.' Before the regret set in, the irate co-owner repeated an awkward analogy three times during his round of Sunday  interviews, despite its questionable tone. 'Triple Crown, that means three — not one, not two — triple means three,' he said. 'If you don’t realize that maybe you need to go back to school and figure this out. Triple means three. 'If something isn’t done I will never see a Triple Crown winner again. I’m 61 years old.' Coburn was furious that his horse was denied the Crown by Tonalist, who was . allowed to enter the Belmont Stakes despite not competing in the . Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes. 'We won the Kentucky Derby and we won the Preakness,' Coburn said. After the loss: California Chrome owner Steve Coburn, pictured, said his horse 'had a target on his back' and complained that other horses in the Belmont Stakes - like winner Tonalist - did not compete in the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness Stakes . Shove off: Coburn's apologies came after this questionable interaction with his wife. She told Robin Roberts she was trying to calm him at the time but that emotions were very high following his post-race tirade . 'We earned the points to run in the Kentucky Derby. We did not have to race in the Preakness or the Belmont but we nominated to the Triple Crown.' He was asked during the Good Morning America interview if thought his wheelchair comparison offensive. 'No, I'm just trying to compare the two,' he said. 'Is it fair for me to play with this child in a wheelchair? Is it fair for them to hold their horses back?' Coburn said he has no problems if people label him a 'sore loser' and even proceeded to give out his phone number so people can call him with their complaints. Yesterday, California Chrome owner Steve Coburn complained that other horses were entered just to knock out California Chrome as his horse's bid to win the Triple Crown was ruined on Saturday. Tonalist, the Belmont Stakes winner, did not run the Kentucky . Derby or the Preakness Stakes. California Chrome tied for fourth place in a dead heat with horse Wicked Strong. Commissioner came in second place, while Medal Count came in third. California . Chrome and jockey Victor Espinoza lost the 1 1/2-mile race on a hot day . at Belmont Park, where tens of thousands of fans were packed in hoping . to see history. It was not to be, leaving Affirmed as the most recent . Triple Crown winner in 1978. Crestfallen: California Chrome and jockey Victor Espinoza pictured following their loss Saturday, and the dashing of their Kentucky Derby hopes. Coburn condemned his competitors who chose to forgo the Kentucky Derby or Preakness in order to have rested horses and a better shot at the Belmont Stakes . 'Will race again': Coburn on Monday addressed the injury the horse incurred during Saturday's race. He made contact with another horse, cutting his foot, but can soon race again . 'It's all or nothing. This is not fair to these horses and to the people that believe in them. This is the coward's way out,' he told NBC. 'Our horse had a target on his back,' Coburn said. 'I thought . he was gaining ground, but he didn't have it in him, apparently,' Coburn said of California Chrome's performance. 'These other horses, they always set him out. They set him up and try to upset the apple cart.' He also said, 'I'm 61 years old and I'll never see another Triple Crown winner in my lifetime because of the way they do this, it's not fair to these horses that have been in the game since day one.' California . Chrome broke quickly but was pressed immediately by Commissioner and . General a Rod. Espinoza eased California Chrome back into third along . the rail. Approaching . the final turn, California Chrome was maneuvered to the outside. He . angled four-wide turning for home, just to the outside of Tonalist, who . was close to the pace the entire race. Espinoza started whipping left . handed in the lane but California Chrome had no response. Tonalist kicked strongly in the final strides, edging Commissioner by a head to finish in 2:28:52. The defeat . snapped California Chrome's six-race winning streak. His rise from a . humble pedigree and his working-stiff owners resonated with sports fans . who rarely take an interest in horse racing. California . Chrome's owners spent $8,000 on a mare they bred to a stallion for . $2,500, and were called 'dumb asses' by a trainer for buying a mare who . gave no indication that she could produce a standout offspring who could . run fast. Victor: Tonalist and his jockey Joel Rosario are pictured after their Belmont Stakes win and would soon become the targets of Coburn's wrath . Belmont . Park race track was earlier buzzing on Saturday as crowds gathered to . watch California Chrome try and win the Triple Crown. The . Long Island track - said to the the toughest of the three - had to add . extra facilities after a surge in interest over the possibility that the horse could become the first racehorse in 36 years to pull . off the feat. Crowds . began arriving early at the track, with an array of brightly colored . and creative headgear - from wide-brimmed sunhats with ruffles and . delicate fascinators to more imaginative offerings. One . racegoer had styled his Stetson-style hat around California Chrome.

High hopes: California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn, center, reaches for posters to before the Belmont Stakes horse race, Saturday, June 7 . Another fan clearly rooting for the chestnut colt was spotted wearing a silver construction worker's helmet that had a crown and the number 3 attached. The creation was being worn on top of the person's baseball hat. Many of the women attending the event opted for more elegant headwear, with large-brimmed sunhats in fuchsia pinks and mint greens a popular choice. Feathers, flowers, ruffles and other adornments helped the hats stand out in the crowd, as an estimated 100,000 race fans gathered ahead of the big race at 6.52pm. California Chrome was on a six-race winning streak, which included being first past the post for the Kentucky Derby on May 3, and Preakness Stakes in Maryland on May 17. On Friday the horse was given the opportunity to shake off any race day nerves, with a visit to the paddock and track areas, before being taken for gallop. 'He's training outstanding. Nothing seems to bother him too much. He's pretty cool,' Sherman said. California Chrome had to navigate the testing ground at Belmont, which includes a lap around 'Big Sandy' - its deep and exhausting track. However, his veteran trainer Art Sherman, felt positive before the race. The 77-year-old said: 'I feel more confident coming into this race than I did any race. I'm getting pumped up.'","Steve Coburn, 61, followed up his angry rant in the aftermath of California Chrome's defeat on Saturday with another series of irate comments on Sunday morning .

The toy firm will launch a series of female scientists and their lab tools in August . In her project proposal, Kooijman wrote: 'The motto of these scientists is clear: explore the world and beyond!' report the Guardian. On her blog she wrote of her recognition of a clear gender gap among Lego figurines. 'As . a female scientist I had noticed two things about the available Lego . sets: a skewed male/female minifigure ratio and a rather stereotypical . representation of the available female figures,' she wrote. 'It seemed . logical that I would suggest a small set of female minifigures in . interesting professions to make our Lego city communities more diverse.' 'Any toy or any activity that dispels the idea that a girl's value lies just in the way she looks is a positive idea' The . toy company has been criticised in the past for its gender-based . marketing tactics, but these latest additions could mark a change in direction for them. Leading psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos, 43, who has an 11-year-old daughter, spoke with MailOnline about her personal and professional stance on the launch of the new product. 'My daughter's a big fan of Lego, and I've been thinking about this a lot,' she said. 'I buy her the architectural designs you can get an the UN building [such as the Sydney Opera House Play Set]. They are the least gender specific Lego toys - just buildings . 'I remember thinking, ""What a lovely idea"". You can read a bit about who the architects are. It's not all this ""would you like the pink section or the blue section"". 'I think any toy or any activity that dispels the idea that a girl's value lies just in the way she looks; that shows she can be more than that, that she can do more, is a positive idea. 'Sadly female scientists or business leaders aren't celebrated in the same way that males are, so this is fantastic. 'The younger you can get girls to see these things as the norm the better. Getting them to see that it's just as normal for a woman to wear a white doctor's or scientist's coat as it is for a man; that's such an important thing. 'The whole idea that there is the whole idea that there is just one section for girls - the pink section - reinforces gender stereotypes. 'Of course, there's always going to be evolutionary differences, but so many more toys aimed at girls have to do with being pretty and looking a certain way, whereas those all about having fun and action heroes are for boys. 'Girls need to be seen as doers rather than passive, to subvert the objectification of women. The object is someone acted upon; ""how can I make my hair curlier, my lips pinker, my eyes brighter"".

"By . Meghan Keneally . Good Morning America meteorologist Ginger Zee has married her fellow television presenter fiance Ben Aaron in a beachfront wedding in her home state of Michigan. The TV-friendly couple are based in New York and Aaron works for the local NBC affiliate but they decided to wed on the shores of Lake Michigan because that is where she went every summer while growing up. Given her focus on weather at work, it only seemed fitting that the couple tied the knot on a perfect day. 'The weather could not have been more perfect. Mid 70s and high clouds, I couldn’t have written it better,' she said. Match made for TV: Ginger Zee, 33, married Ben Aaron, 32, on Saturday at the Inn at Bay Harbor in Petoskey, Michigan . Weather friendly: Zee was thrilled that it was in the mid-70s with high clouds when they got married . Emotional: Aaron said that he has been thinking about the vows he was going to write ever since he proposed to her in front of the fountain at Lincoln Center, where they had their first kiss . Second set of vows: The pair first had a private vows ceremony and then later held another ceremony in front of 55 friends and relatives while overlooking Lake Michigan . 'She has a direct line to Zeus himself,' her new husband joked to MLive.com. 'She called him up and said ""Hey Z"", she calls him that, it’s a thing they have in common, and she said ""I want beautiful weather this weekend"" and it was.' The low cloud covering made for great light for the photos shot by Michael Murphy and for her part, Zee felt the beautiful day was karmic payback for her years of service in the field. 'It’s a rough time of the year in Northern Michigan. (The weather) can be anything. But I figure I’ve treated weather pretty well my whole life — I think it can give me one day,' she told The Chicago Sun-Times ahead of their Saturday ceremony. Traditional touches: Zee said that she would not have expected to like a lace dress but is thrilled with her pick . Family roots: The New York-based couple decided to get married near Lake Michigan because that is where she spent summers with her family growing up . They exchanged their personal 'I dos' in a private vows ceremony and then held a second, more traditional ceremony outside in a circle of rosepetals overlooking the Lake, in front of their 55 guests. 'I’m not joking. Since I knew I was marrying Ginger, I’ve been writing the vows in my head. So every time I thought about it I started crying. We’d be walking and I’d have to turn my head and blame it on allergies I don’t even have,' Aaron told MLive. He wasn't the only one in tears. 'I thought I was done crying after the . private vows but then walking down the aisle I saw my aunt and her face . and it was like the vomit scene in The Goonies. It was totally . contagious,' she said. Video Source YouTube . Party time: Aaron, who does playful segments on NBC New York, and his new bride let loose on the dancefloor . Showing some skin: Ginger's back was bare as she previously described how the lace dress had modern, sexy touches .

"By . Associated Press . A man who crashed a powerboat into a barge on the Hudson River in New York, killing a bride-to-be and a best man two weeks before the wedding, pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree vehicular manslaughter under a plea bargain. The Rockland County district attorney's office said Jojo John, 36, of Nyack, was promised a sentence of two years in a local jail. John was piloting a 19-foot Stingray on July 26 when it crashed into a stationary barge that was involved in the construction of a new Tappan Zee Bridge in the New York City suburbs, about 30 miles north of Manhattan. Tragedy on the river: Jojo John appears during his arraignment hearing at the Rockland County Courthouse in New City, NY on November 20, 2013 . The impact killed Lindsey Stewart of Piermont and Mark Lennon of Pearl River, both 30 and friends of John. John and three other friends, including groom-to-be Brian Bond, 30, were injured. John's lawyer, David Narain, said John suffered a fractured skull and fractured spine. Prosecutors had alleged that John had nearly twice the legal level of alcohol in his system when the boat crashed, and quoted him as telling first responders 'I've been drinking all day' or words to that effect. The original charges included operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol, as well as first-degree vehicular manslaughter. If convicted at trial in county court in New City, John could have been sentenced to five to 15 years in prison. However, Narain asserted that that the . crash was caused by a lack of lighting on the barge, not by . intoxication. The Coast Guard and the state Thruway Authority, which is . building the bridge, said the barge was properly lighted, although the . Thruway Authority added lighting after the crash. Narain said complaints had been made about the lighting before the crash and 'no corrective measures were ever taken.' Heartbreaking loss: Mark Lennon (right) was to be the best man at Lindsey Stewart and her fiance Brian Bond's wedding before they were both killed in the boat accident . Jail time: John, who works in banking, has been sentenced to two years in a local prison as part of a plea bargain . Stewart's and Lennon's families made the same claim in civil lawsuits, naming several companies involved in the construction. They said they had spoken to survivors and None of them saw the barge. They did not brace for impact and could not identify what they had hit - even after impact. But they also sued John, as co-owner of the boat, and said he was careless and negligent. John's civil lawyer, James Mercante, said Monday that he couldn't comment on how the guilty plea might affect the civil suits until he learns exactly what John acknowledged. The construction area alongside the existing Tappan Zee is now far more congested with construction vessels than at the time of the crash. The Thruway Authority has issued precise guidelines for recreational boating in the area. Sentencing was scheduled for September 16.","Jojo John, 36, pleaded guilty to second-degree vehicular manslaughter Monday .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The Texas Republican party are now endorsing so called restorative therapy to 'cure' homosexuality. At their annual conference in Fort Worth on Saturday, the party adopted the policy, which tea party groups had advocated. One particularly influential group, the Texas Eagle Forum, had urged the party to support the psychological treatments, which claim to try and turn homosexuals straight. Scroll down for video . A same-sex marriage rally was held outside the Fort Worth Convention Centre on Thursday before the Texas Republican party conference . Before the convention began on Thursday, a same sex marriage rally was held outside the convention centre in Fort Worth, where the conference took place. But before 7,000 delegates, the party agreed to adopt the platform which states they recognise 'the legitimacy and efficacy of counselling which offers reparative therapy and treatment for those patients seeking healing and wholeness from their homosexual lifestyle.' President of the conservative group, Texas Values Jonathan Saenz welcomed the decision saying it comes as no surprise. Treatments for 'curing' homosexuality claim to change a person's sexuality through techniques such as electric shock therapy, inducing nausea while being exposed to homoerotic material, praying, exorcism, trips to brothels to have sex with women, and hypnosis. Some advocates of the therapy have also asserted that prayer and religious faith can be helpful in suppressing or overcoming same-sex attractions. The American Psychological Association have warned that the therapies run the risk of causing serious psychological harm. Gay rights groups agree saying the therapy damages young people, because it tells them that it's not acceptable to be whoever they are. The largest Christian ministry engaged in such work, Exodus International, also closed last year and its leader apologised to the gay community for inflicting 'years of undue suffering.' California and New Jersey have both passed laws barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay youth straight, and both laws have been upheld in court. He explained: 'The platform reflects what the people in the Republican Party have asked for, and that should be no surprise: family values, protection of marriage between one man and one woman and everything that goes along with that.' But adopting the policy has sparked controversy even amongst members of the Republican party, some of whom had been lined up to speak out against endorsing such therapy. They never got the chance to address delegates, because a parliamentary motion to approve the full platform was called first. Rudy Oeftering, vice president of the gay conservative group Metroplex Republicans, who was due to speak said: 'There's a very, very small group of people who want to keep the party in the past. We were here today to try to pull the party into the future. 'The only . way the party can go into the future is to start listening to young . people, to start listening to people who have gay family members.' Reparative . therapy or conversion therapy, uses a number of techniques to try and . change a person's sexual orientation or lessen their interest in . engaging in same-sex sexual activity. The . American Psychological Association and other major health organizations . have condemned the counselling, with other groups saying the practice . should not be used on minors because of the danger of serious . psychological harm. Some of the delegates who attended the convention cheer after the speech of Governor Rick Perry . One particularly influential group, the Texas Eagle Forum, had urged the Texas Republicans to support the psychological treatments . California and New Jersey have both passed laws barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay youths straight, and both laws have been upheld in court. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, signed the ban in his state against the wishes of some conservatives, saying the health risks entailed in trying to change a child's sexual orientation overrode concerns about parental choice. However, Gay conservatives did come away with a rare victory at the convention, winning the removal of decades-old language in the state party platform that states, 'homosexuality tears at the fabric of society.'","Party adopts platform which recognises legitimacy of reparative therapy .

"By . Chris Pleasance . He may be a veteran base jumper, but even daredevil Sebastian Alvarez admitted being nervous before his latest stunt - jumping off a bridge from the back of a moving truck. Adrenaline junkie Alvarez has completed more than 400 dangerous BASE jumps, but had never tried one from the back of a moving vehicle. The stunt had to be timed to perfection as Alvarez leaped over a camera mounted on the railing of  Amolanas Bridge in Coquimbo, Chile, missing the edge by inches. Scroll down for video . Daredevil Sebastian Alvarez has jumped off the edge of a 328ft bridge from the back of a moving truck . Alvarez had to time the stunt to perfection, leaping over a camera and missing the railing by inches before quickly pulling his parachute chord . He then deployed his parachute before floating more than 300ft back down to earth. He said: 'This jump was very technical, if I made a bad exit from the truck or had a bad parachute opening, things turn immediately dangerous. 'Also Amolanas is a low bridge where there are almost no room for mistakes. If I don't open the parachute right before I jump, I'd be dead on the ground four to five seconds after.' 'I was scared, but you have to turn it into something positive. Fear is good, panic means death,"" Alvarez said. 'But at the same time, I felt really confident, I love to jump from bridges. Everything goes very fast so theres no time to think, you can only react.' Alvarez was driven into position by his friend of 15 years Matias, who he refers to by the nickname Gaviota - meaning 'seagull'. While 300ft may seem a long way, for a parachute jump it is a very short distance, meaning Alvarez would have had little time to react had anything gone wrong . Despite having completed more than 400 jumps before, Alvarez admitted to being nervous before this one, having never jumped from the back of a moving vehicle before . He was also accompanied by Chilean surf filmmaker Johannes Bock, who filmed the outside scenes, and a Danish friend. And the jump has done nothing to dull Alvarez's thirst for BASE jumping. 'This is my first jump from a moving vehicle and for sure its not gonna be the last,' he added. 'In the air I felt really good. As soon as i jumped I realised that my body was in a good position and when i saw my parachute opening perfectly, I was very excited. 'I landed in a small area beside the river. It was a very technical landing.' Amolanas is Chile's second highest bridge, measuring 328ft off the ground, compared with 336ft for the Loa Viaduct. Alvarez was only in free fall for a few moments before pulling his parachute chord and floating back to earth . Despite the obvious danger, Alvarez said he loved jumping from the truck, and vowed the stunt will not be his last from the back of a moving vehicle . The BASE in BASE jumping is an acronym which stands for building, antenna, span or Earth, and the sport's participants leap from any and all four of these things while performing their stunts. Technically a base jump is any in which the jumper leaps from a fixed point or object, then uses a fast deploying parachute to float back down to Earth. The first official BASE jumps were filmed in 1978 by Carl Boenish from El Capitan rock in Yosemite National Park, and since then the sport has attracted participants worldwide. Since 1981 there have been 230 registered deaths from BASE jumping. Jumpers are roughly 43 times more likely to kill or injure themselves compared with jumping from a plane.","Sebastian Alvarez jumped over edge of Amolanas Bridge in Chile .

"By . Corey Charlton . The Kinks may re-form to release a new album and tour, following the success of a play about the rise of the band in the Sixties. The band, fronted by brothers Ray and Dave Davies, is acknowledged as one of Britain’s most influential rock bands with hits such as Lola. After constant speculation following their acrimonious break up in 1996, Ray has now revealed the band may record and tour together once again. Responsible for such hits as You Really . Got Me and Waterloo Sunset, the violent disputes between the two brothers evolved into one of the longest running feuds in rock 'n' roll. Ray Davies, left, and his brother Dave, right, formed a sibling rivalry that contributed to the band's breakup . 'I met Dave only last week to talk about getting back together again,'  69-year-old Ray told The Sunday Times. 'We've also spoken a few times on the phone and emailed. He's been composing his own songs, but I'd really like to write with him again.' The two formed the band in the early 1960s and their first major hit, You Really Got Me, came along only a year later. They went on to become one of the most . influential rock groups of a generation and influenced countless other . British bands, including Oasis and Blur. The Kinks, composed of the late Pete Quaife (left), Ray Davies, Mick Avory and Dave Davies, found fame a year after their formation with the hit You Really Got Me and their popularity remained until the 1990s . In 1990, The Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2004, Ray Davies, pictured, was awarded a CBE for services to music. In later years he was labelled a 'narcissist' by his brother Dave . Oasis mirrored them closely in their own sibling rivalry, with brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher frequently falling out and bickering. It is not the first time a Kinks reunion has been mooted. In 2010, Dave said there would never be a reunion, adding: 'Ray sucks me dry of ideas, emotions and ­creativity. It’s toxic for me to be with him. He’s a control freak.' The Kinks were formed in Muswell Hill, North London, by brothers Dave Davies and Ray Davies in 1963. Their first hit single, You Really Got Me, came the following year and propelled them to stardom. They went on to write and record dozens of hits, most famously Lola and Waterloo Sunset. In 1990, the four original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band separated in 1996, due to the creative tension between Ray and Dave and their declining commercial success. During their decades as a band, the two brothers' were known for their bickering and dust-ups, reportedly including fights on stage. Although Dave rubbished reports of a reunion only a few years ago, Ray claims he has spoken to his brother recently about a possible reunion and said he wants to write music with him again. He labelled his brother an 'a**hole and a narcissist'. However, a musical detailing The Kinks' rise to stardom is reported to have been the reason for the latest change of heart. Sunny Afternoon, which ran in Hampstead Theatre earlier this year, detailed the band's rise to fame. The musical received a five star review from Mail Online in May. In 1990, The Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2004, Ray was awarded a CBE for services to music. The brothers' volatile ­relationship has often been credited for much of The Kinks’ success, but it also drove both brothers half-crazy. Dave sought escape in drugs and more recently in spirituality. And Ray attempted suicide (he was later diagnosed with bipolar ­disorder, also known as manic depression). Dave also suffered a stroke in 2004, describing how his body seized up and he couldn't move his arm or leg. Ray is also no stranger to injury - he was shot by a mugger when visiting New Orleans 10 years' ago. Since the dissolution of The Kinks, Ray has formed a solo musical career.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Alan Turing was 39 when he was prosecuted after he told the police that he was romantically involved with a 19-year-old man . To many it is regarded as the highlight of the classical music calendar. But for pop duo Pet Shop Boys the Proms will become a platform to highlight the work of computer pioneer Alan Turing and to call for the ‘tens of thousands of men’ imprisoned or fined for committing homosexual acts to be pardoned. Pet Shop Boys Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe will premiere their orchestral work A Man From The Future at the Proms on July 23. The Pardon, the last song, refers to the posthumous pardon granted to Turing, who was prosecuted for gross indecency in 1952 after he admitted that he was sexually involved with a teenager. Tennant and Lowe said that they are using the event to urge the Government to pardon others convicted before homosexuality was decriminalised in 1967. ‘So very many lives were ruined over such a long period,’ said Tennant. Frankly it rather disappoints me that [the gay rights group] Stonewall has not done more. So we’re making the statement ourselves.’ The pair will be accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra and the BBC Singers. Actress Juliet Stevenson will narrate. The Pardon will mention Gordon Brown, who as Prime Minister in 2009 apologised for the ‘appalling treatment’ of Turing after he innocently told police he had been in a sexual relationship with a man. Despite his code breaking work at Bletchley Park during the Second World War and his ground-breaking research in computer science, Turing pleaded guilty to the charge of gross indecency and was chemically castrated as an alternative to prison. Pet Shop Boys Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe will premiere their orchestral work A Man From The Future at the Proms on July 23 . He committed suicide two years later, aged 41, although his mother believed his death was an accident. Tennant and Lowe were inspired to write about Turing by a 2011 TV documentary on his life. ‘It’s a memorial to Turing, invoking the spirit of the man and his work,’ Tennant told The Sunday Times. ‘He was a man from the future in that his scientific achievements were in the vanguard and that, for us, his pioneering work on computers led to our electronic music. ‘Then he was ahead of his time in being openly gay, though perhaps a bit too honest when he told the policeman, when he need not have done, about his sexuality.’","Pet Shop Boys will premiere their orchestral work on July 23 .

Mr Draper turned his skills to coffee cups after selling more permanent works through galleries. He said he deliberately leaves the cups behind in the hope that someone will pick them up to cherish and look after. 'I have always been fascinated with the contrast of creating something of great detail on something so disposable and valueless,' he said. 'I really like the juxtaposition of the lettering itself, which I hope is beautiful, and the materials used which are disposable, everyday objects.

"By . Mia De Graaf . A tenant turned his home into a sophisticated cannabis factory worth almost £70,000. The man, who vanished when the drugs were found, filled two bedrooms in his terraced home with at least 40 potted plants covered in tents. And the landlord only discovered the stash when he dropped by the property unannounced after deciding to put it on the market. Discovery: The landlord discovered the £70,000 stash of potted cannabis plants in two of the bedrooms when he dropped by this Tyne and Wear home (right) unannounced after deciding to put it up for sale . Police are now hunting the tenant, who fled the home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, on Sunday night. Property manager Samuel Gluck said: 'I was very surprised. He was a very good tenant.' There were around 40 mature plants growing in neat pots housed in little tents, police revealed. Mr Gluck, of Northgate Lettings, who was managing the property for a landlord, said he never suspected the quiet tenant. 'He was a very amiable guy and always paid his rent on time,' he added. 'When the landlord told me he had found a drugs factory I thought he must just mean there were two or three plants on a window sill. But there were two bedrooms full, all in full bloom ready to be harvested.' And Mr Gluck, who has had problems with drugs farmers attempting to rent his properties in the past, is now warning other landlords to beware. Sophisticated: The farm was covered in sophisticated tents, which have now been seized by the police . 'Cannabis farms these days are very difficult to detect,' he said. 'In the past they used to bypass the electricity and cover the windows, but this one was very low energy. It’s happening more and more and I think it’s a lot more sophisticated now.' Police have since seized the plants and equipment after being notified by the landlord. A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'At 8.25pm last night we got a report that a cannabis farm had been found inside an address on Whitehall Road in Gateshead. 'Officers attended and recovered 40 cannabis plants and seized equipment. Inquiries are ongoing.' Anyone with any information should call Northumbria Police on 101.","Landlord dropped by Tyne and Wear house to find factory of plants .

"By . Simon Cable . Harsh: Food writer Jay Rayner has criticised farmers' markets . His acerbic put downs are usually restricted to hapless chefs and pretentious restaurants. But food critic Jay Rayner has now served up a withering assessment of farmers’ markets – to the fury of those who run them. The MasterChef star, who also works as a critic for BBC One programme The One Show, said that the overpriced fare sold at local markets is nothing more than a ‘status symbol’ for wealthy shoppers. Instead, the 47-year-old has extolled the virtues of sprawling supermarket chains who offer cheap ingredients, while dismissing the idea of buying a £15 chicken as similar to splashing out on a Chanel handbag. While Mr Rayner said that he enjoyed the experience of visiting local markets, the increasing difficulty in feeding a growing worldwide population meant that a minority of shoppers who insisted on buying expensive, locally-grown food resulted in ‘a veneer of self-righteousness’. In an interview in the local Cotswold Life magazine, Rayner said: ‘As I say repeatedly, I like a good farmers’ market. But if you think they’re a genuine answer to food retail in the UK, you’re sadly mistaken. ‘Buying a £15 chicken is no more a challenge to the supermarkets than buying a Chanel handbag is a challenge to Primark. It’s a status symbol. It’s a nice one and one I’m able to enjoy; and one I suspect a lot of your readers in the Cotswolds are able to enjoy because they’ve got a penny or two. ‘I’m not a head-banging old Trot. There is nothing wrong with spending your expendable income in whatever way you wish. But what you mustn’t do is to allow there to be a veneer of self-righteousness across the top of it, which makes that indulgence of an aesthetic into some political statement. Because that it ain’t.’ It was last year that Mr Rayner released a book called A Greedy Man in a Hungry World, which championed supermarkets, super-dairies and industrialised production methods. He argued that a growing global population, especially in China and Asia, are putting growing pressure of food resources around the world. He warned in the interview with Cotswold Life that the increasing difficulties in feeding so many people will ‘make the sight of young chefs on telly talking about their passion for cooking and their commitment to local and seasonal ingredients sound like the screeching of fiddles while Rome burns.’ Not accessible: Mr Rayner said farmers' markets were the designer label of food shopping while supermarkets the high street chains . Talking about the benefits of foreign imports and giving the example of being able to buy cheap produce such as corn from the US, he added in the interview: ‘You don’t own a local mobile phone because they make them better and cheaper in China.’ However, Mr Rayner’s comments have angered the National Market Traders Association, who claim that traditional UK markets employ almost 100,000 people across the country. Joe Harrison, CEO of the NMTA hit out at Mr Rayner, saying: ‘This kind of thing really gets my goat and I’d like to put Mr Rayner right. ‘He is clearly taking this to the extreme by criticising what he sees as “fashionable” farmers markets. There are 1,400 traditional markets operating across the UK, all of which could beat supermarkets hands down in terms quality of meat, fish and vegetables. ‘I can name markets which will offer 30 different types of potato, while most supermarkets will offer just three. Farmer’s markets have a huge appeal with the British public, and these traditional markets have seen a huge increase in popularity following the horsemeat scandal, because clearly people trust the produce. ‘Turnover from farmer’s markets in the UK reaches almost £4bn each year, and we can’t ignore that they are a major employers. There are almost 100,000 people working on markets across the UK. To suggest supermarkets are a better alternative to traditional farmer’s markets is wrong.’","Critic Jay Rayner praised supermarkets as being affordable .

"By . Sarah Dean . Humans are often encouraged not to feed pigeons but this wallaby obviously didn't get the memo. The caring marsupial was snapped offering up her lunch to an inquisitive looking feathery friend at Sydney's Featherdale Animal Park. And as she held out her ice cream cone full of food, a cute little Joey peeked out from her mother's pouch. Caring: One kind wallaby at Sydney's Featherdale Animal Park feeds a hungry pigeon . The heart-warming scene was captured by 66-year-old photographer Ann Cameron, from Sydney, while on a family trip to the park. 'My granddaughter gave the wallaby the ice cream cone full of food, and the pigeon began eating,' said Ms Cameron. 'The wallaby put the cone down as if it was inviting the pigeon to have some. 'I love visiting the animal park and have often taken overseas visitors there as well.' Cute: A baby Joey was nestled in the wallaby's pouch while she shared her food with the pigeon . Ms Cameron has travelled and photographed wildlife across Europe and South Africa, but her favourite spot remains the animal park, which is only ten minutes away from her home. 'I always come back with so many photos which I look at on a regular basis and relive my wonderful experiences,' she said. 'When I take visitors to the animal park, they're always excited to see some of Australia's native animals up close. 'This is also why I love visiting South Africa. It is so amazing to see the animals roaming free in their natural habitat.' Established on seven acres of land, Featherdale has evolved from a poultry farm to one of the leading privately owned wildlife parks in Australia. Ms Cameron added: 'I love taking photos and it gives me great pleasure to know that people find my photos interesting and diverse.'

"By . Richard Spillett . The BBC's Head of Television has been criticised after he appeared to claim viewers have 'free access' to the broadcaster's programmes. Danny Cohen said the BBC should continue to offer viewers 'free access to news and great television' when he was interviewed on BBC One's Points of View show. But critics rushed to point out that viewers are forced to pay £145.50 annual licence fee and accused Mr Cohen of being 'out of touch'. BBC Head of TV Danny Cohen (left) said he thought it is good that news and 'great programmes' are 'free access' in the UK. Conservative MP Rob Wilson (right) said the comments showed Mr Cohen and other BBC bosses are 'out of touch' The controversial comments came as Mr Cohen discussed whether the BBC should become a subscription service like on-demand internet TV site Netflix. Arguing that the corporation's funding should stay the same, he said: 'I believe in the universality of the BBC, I believe the BBC should provide something for everyone, and it should be free access to news and great television programmes for everyone in the UK.' But his comments were seized upon by those calling for reform of the licence fee, who insisted his mistake showed the corporation's complacency about its funding. Conservative MP Rob Wilson told the Daily Telegraph: 'That Mr Cohen thinks paying £145.50 a year constitutes ""free access"" shows just how out of touch with reality some overpaid bosses really are.' He branded the licence fee a '60-year-old idea' and called for it to be reformed to give customers better service. Viewers also took to Twitter to mock the claims, with David Hartley tweeting: 'Give me free access to the BBC anytime!' Mr Cohen's comments were mocked in a series of tweets by viewers of the interview (above and below) Website user Nick Dale added: 'Head of BBC TV Danny Cohen insists we keep ‘free access’ to the BBC - apart from the £145.50 licence fee we all have to pay, of course…' Mr Cohen worked for E4 before joining the BBC in 2007 as controller of BBC Three. He was appointed to his current role as Director of BBC Television in April last year. He is currently paid £320,000-a-year by the corporation, but defended his huge pay packet earlier this year . by saying: '[BBC] executives continue to be well-paid, but if we went to . commercial organisations we'd be paid roughly double.' Earlier this year, he vowed to get more women on TV by putting an end to 'sexist' all-male line-ups on comedy panel shows like Have I Got News For You and Mock The Week. His latest comments came as plans emerged to increase the fine handed out by magistrates to people who do not pay the licence fee from £1,000 to £4,000. The BBC has faced down calls for it to become a subscription service but ministers recently announced a review of plans to de-criminalise the offence of not buying a licence. The comments came during a discussion of whether the BBC should become a subscription service .","Head of Television Danny Cohen says news and programmes 'free to access'

"By . Richard Spillett . Lieutenant Colonel Russell Paul, 53, tried to watch an 11-year-old girl as she changed at a public swimming pool in Plymouth last summer . A high-ranking Royal Marine could be thrown out of the Armed Forces after he was convicted of voyeurism for spying on a schoolgirl with a mirror at a public swimming pool. Lieutenant Colonel Russell Paul, 53, watched the 11-year-old as she took off her bikini top after a swimming session last summer. But she looked down while changing into her clothes and saw the mirror poking out from underneath the next cubicle, Plymouth Crown Court heard. She and a friend ran to tell staff at the city's Life Centre leisure complex and CCTV footage showed Paul emerging from the neighbouring cubicle moments after the girl had fled. Paul told police he went swimming for 45 minutes, then showered and left, but cameras showed him in the water for just seven minutes. Officers searched his room at his base and found a bag containing 22 pairs of women's knickers, though Paul said they were a secret Santa present from seven years ago. They also examined his home computer and found Google search terms which revealed 'an interest in young girls, teen and pre-teen', the court was told. Llewellyn Sellick, prosecuting, said the girl spotted Paul spying on her on June 4 last year as she changed. He said: 'She saw an eye reflected in the mirror. She covered herself with a towel and left the cubicle.' Adrian Chaplin, defending, said Paul had a 'very good career' and wanted to 'apologise to the victims that his actions caused the upset that it did'. Sentencing Paul, . Recorder Simon Levene said the two young girls were left frightened by . their ordeal and would not forget it for a long time. Naval chiefs are considering the impact on Paul's career after the incident at Plymouth Life Centre (pictured) The judge told Paul that 'certain members of society' such as 'marines, and judges amongst them, when they do something wrong, draw the attention not only to themselves but to their profession. That's something you're going to have to live with.' Paul, of Taunton, Somerset, was handed a community order with three years of supervision and ordered to pay £1,600 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge. He now faces potential consequences from his famous regiment and could be expelled from the forces over the conviction. A Royal Navy spokesman said afterwards: 'The service will now consider the effect of his conviction on his career. Any administrative action is a private matter between employee and the employer.'","Lieutenant Colonel Russell Paul watched schoolgirl at swimming pool .

"By . Dan Bloom . A nine-week-old baby boy has been left orphaned after both his parents died in a car crash. Raquel Davies, 23, and Lee Jenkins, 25, were in a friend's open-top BMW when the car left the road near the village of Tonyrefail, south Wales, killing them both. Tributes poured in to the pair, who had their first child in April, as police arrested the 20-year-old driver on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Tragic: Raquel Davies, 23 (left) and her fiancé Lee Jenkins, 25 (right) have been killed after a friend's open-top sports car left a road in the Welsh valleys on Saturday. Their baby son Harley was just nine weeks old . The couple, from the nearby village of Porth, had recently become engaged to be married and their families said they loved each other 'immensely'. Just nine weeks ago Ms Davies gave birth to her son Harley, the couple's first child. Both were passengers in a white BMW 1 Series convertible on Saturday during the fatal crash just after 10.30am. Police said the car left the village of Gilfach Goch and joined the A4093 through the Welsh valleys, passing the village of Hendreforgan before it left the road. It is believed the open-top car rolled upside down in the crash. Both Ms Davies and Mr Jenkins died at the scene. The driver, 20, survived and was today arrested on suspicion of causing their deaths by dangerous driving. Scene: The pair were passengers on the A4093 through the Welsh valleys near Hendreforgan (pictured) Police said no other vehicles were thought to be involved. Ms Davies' family released a statement through South Wales Police, which said: 'She was perfect in every way and was a devoted mother to her young son. 'She would help anyone out at any time and was a beautiful person inside and out. She loved her fiancé immensely.' Her fiancé's family added: 'He loved his fiancée Raquel dearly and was enjoying being a new dad to Harley who is just nine weeks old. 'Lee was a keen and talented footballer when he was younger. 'She was perfect in every way and was a devoted mother to her young son. She would help anyone out at any time and was a beautiful person inside and out' - Family of Raquel Davies, 23 . 'We are heartbroken at the loss of Lee and will cherish all the great times and wonderful memories he gave us.' Police are investigating the crash and appealing for witnesses who saw the car in the moments before it happened. A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'We have viewed CCTV footage and believe that people in a number of vehicles, including two buses, may have seen the car in the moments before the accident. 'Potential witnesses include the occupants of a silver Volkswagen Passat, and what is believed to be a dark Renault Clio travelling from Gilfach Goch to Tonyrefail behind a bus. 'Travelling in the opposite direction, from Tonyrefail towards Gilfach Goch, again behind a bus, was what was believed to be a dark Hyundai Santa Fe, a silver Citroen Picasso, a white Mercedes C Class Estate, a black Volkswagen Beetle, and a silver Vauxhall Vectra.' The spokesman added: 'Specially trained South Wales Police officers are providing support to both families at this difficult time. 'A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and is in police custody.' Witnesses should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"By . Lillian Radulova . A HIV-positive mother-of-four, who contracted the disease from her deceased husband, has shared her inspiring story in an effort to break down stigma surrounding the life-long illness. Debra was completely unaware of her husband Gary's condition until he became gravely ill with a bout of acute pneumonia in 1995. After 10 years of being happily married and living a normal suburban life, Debra was shocked and angered when tests revealed that her husband was HIV positive. Scroll down for video . Debra, 50, has been living with HIV for the last 20 years after contracting it unknowingly from her husband . After finding out Gary had contracted the disease by having sex with men and using drugs intravenously, she was appalled when tests revealed she had also contracted the disease from her husband. 'How dare he do this to me,' Debra told SBS's program The Feed. 'I still call him a bastard for doing it, the bastard who put us at risk; not only me, but his children. How could he be so selfish?' Luckily, tests showed that Debra and Gary's three children were HIV negative. Despite her fury, Debra still nursed her husband on his death bed for 11 months after the pneumonia caused his immune system to fail, changing his HIV to full blown AIDs. Debra had been married to Paul for 10 years when he was admitted to hospital with acute pneumonia, which later revealed he was HIV positive . Tests confirmed that Debra had contracted the disease from her husband, but luckily their three children proved to be HIV negative . 'I just got on with it. And also I needed my kids to know that they can never turn around to me and say ""why didn't you look after daddy?"". 'He gave me 3 beautiful children. I love him for that, I will always will love him for that, but I hate him so much at the same time.' Debra has now been living with HIV for almost 20 years. However with treatment, she has been able to live a completely normal life, even finding herself a new partner, Paul. After nursing her husband for 11 months on his death bed, Debra met Paul (pictured) and they have been together ever since, even conceiving a health boy, now aged 15 . Debra has spoken out about her illness to beat social stigma and prove that with the help of medication, she lives  a normal healthy life . Paul and Debra met 12 months after Gary died and have been inseparable ever since, even having a completely healthy baby together 15 years ago by following professional medical advice. Paul, who is HIV negative, says he's neither frightened by Deb's illness nor concerned about contracting it himself. But not everyone is so accepting of the illness, with stigma a common factor, particularly for the small proportion of women in Australia who live with the disease. 'There’s still such a stigma with it, but I'm sick of being ashamed of what I have. I'm over the ""HIV is a bad thing"",' Debra said. 'I'm a normal mum, I'm a normal woman and I'm just getting on with my life and HIV is just a small part of my life.'","Debra unknowingly contracted HIV from her husband of 10 years .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Tragic: Liam Hardy, 14, had been hospitalised after a suicide attempt less than a week before he died, an inquest heard . A 14-year-old schoolboy who was about to become a father was found hanged days after being discharged from hospital following a suicide attempt. Liam Hardy was allowed to leave St Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, after his first suicide bid - despite pleas from his mother for him to be sectioned, an inquest heard. Days later, he was readmitted when he tried to hang himself at home. Again, the teenager was released within hours. But that same week, Liam was found dead in his bedroom as his grandfather took him a cup of hot chocolate. He had just texted his girlfriend to say: 'It's no use, I'm giving up'. Despite . desperate attempts by Terry Hardy and paramedics to resuscitate the teenager, Liam never regained consciousness and died at St Georges’ Hospital, South London, nine days later. Giving evidence at an inquest into her son’s death, Janine Hardy wept as she claimed pleas to have her son taken into care as a precaution were ignored. She had caught Liam during his first attempt after school on November 15, 2012. Despite trying to calm him down, he persisted until police and ambulance crews arrived, treated him for a superficial injury and took him to St Helier. Even though he was seen by a doctor, a specialist nurse from the district Children and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS) and his therapist, Liam was allowed to leave and go back to his pregnant girlfriend’s house, against his mother’s wishes. He was readmitted and discharged once more, before his grandfather found him on November 19, 2012. He died on November 27. Accompanied by her partner, Ms Hardy said: 'I gave her all Liam’s history about his self-harming, what was going on in the present situation, how he didn’t get on with [his therapist] Catelin, that he wasn’t taking help seriously, about the pregnancy. 'She said she would go and speak to Liam, she would go and speak to him alone. She was in there for about 10 minutes. We went back in to the room. There was the C.A.M.S nurse, myself and Dean. Devastated: Liam's mother, Janine Hardy, (pictured, left, outside Croydon Coroner's Court and, right, with her son) said she asked for him to be sectioned but her calls went ignored . 'She said that Liam was fine now, he didn’t intend to die, no he doesn’t want to die. I told her he intended to do this. 'She said that in her opinion it was fine for him to go back to his girlfriend’s house. 'I wasn’t happy with it, I asked why she was discharging him back to his girlfriend’s, why she isn’t keeping him in or sectioning him.' Liam, a pupil at Carshalton Boys Sports College who suffered from epilepsy, was expecting a child when he died . Liam, a pupil at Carshalton Boys . Sports College, had a history of psychological health issues including . epilepsy and had been assigned a therapist in May 2012. At . an earlier meeting with CAMHS in March, Ms Hardy had told how her son . was self-harming, had been found with red marks around his neck and that . 'he didn’t want to live'. She said she did not want her son to go into care at the time and was told 'there wasn’t any mental health issue there', although he was referred to Multi Systemic Therapy and eventually assigned to a therapist. However, Croydon Coroner’s Court heard how he struggled to interact with the therapist, who he was supposed to meet 'a couple of times a week'. Ms Hardy claimed her son felt he was not being taken seriously. After another altercation at their home in Worcester Park, Surrey, Liam was taken into custody after the police were called. Again, his mother asked for social services to section him after he self-harmed.

"By . Darren Boyle . Adison Bridet, pictured, was on bail following a previous rape allegation when he attacked the victim who was alone in an office in Luton two days after Christmas last year . A young woman, working alone in her office over the Christmas holiday period last year, was repeatedly raped by a stranger who called by asking if he could use the phone. Adison Bridet claimed he had been out the night before and his phone had been taken. But, after making his call, Bridet dragged the 22 year old into a back room where he raped her three times. He even forced her to look at herself in a full length mirror as he carried out the attack. Today Luton Crown Court heard that at the time of the offence - the morning after Boxing Day last year - Bridet was already on bail following a rape allegation in Portsmouth. Judge Philip Bartle was told that offence was not pursued and eventually dropped. Bridet, 22, of no fixed address, was given an extended prison sentence of 14 years today after pleading guilty to a charge of rape and two offences of assault by penetration. Judge Bartle told Bridet the custodial element of the sentence meant he would serve 10 years behind bars and, once released, would be on extended licence for 4 years. Tim Clarke, prosecuting, said the 22-year-old woman was working alone in her office in Luton town centre when Bridet came in. After using the phone, Bridet asked if he could visit the bathroom. By now, the girl was becoming suspicious and moved her bag and a knife. The court heard that when he emerged from the bathroom, he suddenly grabbed her and dragged her into a back room, where he removed her clothes and punched her about the face and head. 'He squeezed her neck so hard, she thought she was going to die,' said Mr Clarke. Luton Crown Court, pictured, heard that Bridet dragged the victim into a back room where he raped her three times, even forcing her to look at a full length mirror so she could see the attack taking place . The court heard eventually he allowed her to get dressed and, having left the office, walked to Luton Police Station and handed himself in. Judge Bartle was told the attack had left the victim traumatised and had done severe psychological harm to her and her boyfriend who, himself, had suffered panic attacks. Passing sentence, the judge said 'This was a prolonged and sustained incident. She was vulnerable because she was a woman alone in her office.' The judge ordered that Bridet’s name be added to the Sex Offenders Register and he was made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order.","Adison Bridet asked his victim if he could make use of her office phone .

"By . Damien Gayle . Jane Campbell, 80, bears the marks of the street robbery she fell victim to just yards from her garden gate in Deane, near Bolton, Greater Manchester . An 80-year-woman was hurled face-down into the road by hooded attackers who made off with her handbag. The two thugs were caught on CCTV attacking Jane Campbell just yards from her garden gate as she returned from a trip to pick up her prescriptions.

She was left badly shaken, with cuts . and bruises, but luckily suffered no serious injuries. Her handbag was . taken but when it was found later nothing had been stolen. Police say they are 'determined to find' the two diminutive crooks, one of whom is described as just 5ft 3in tall. Today .

"By . Darren Boyle . A council has paid sniffing experts £35,000 to monitor foul odours seeping from a waste processing plant. The environmental consultants, 'with very sensitive noses', are assessing the scale of the stench which locals claim has plagued them since the Biffa plant opened at Mowmacre Hill, Leicester in 2003. Specialists from Technology company SLY and consultancy firm RPS have been sniffing the air at the plant for the past 14 months. Leicester City Council has paid for 'sniff consultants' to examine the odours to see if there's a problem after receiving 152 complaints about the waste plant which processes 120,000 tonnes of rubbish a year . Steve Weston, the head of waste management at Leicester City Council, said: 'We’ve paid for consultants to come and do sniff monitoring. 'They’re professional people with very sensitive noses - a bit like perfumers - who can detect small changes in the smell of the area. They’ve been doing random sniff tests and recording what they find. 'That’s the only way we’re going know whether there’s a problem. The consultants have also looked at the air evacuation systems and the bio-filter at the plant to assess their effectiveness. It’s cost us about £35,000 so far.' Local MP Liz Kendall, pictured, said she was angry this odour problem was taking so long to resolve claiming she will do everything in her power to get the Environment Agency to intervene . Local residents complain that the Biffa waste management plant in Momacre Hill in Leicester is making their life a misery since it has opened in 2003. The facility treats 120,000 tonnes of rubbish a year . Since the 'sniff monitoring' started residents have complained 152 times about the waste plant, which processes 120,000 tonnes of rubbish each year. Stewart Lewin, chairman of the Mowmacre Tenants and Residents’ Association, said: 'We can’t open our windows or our doors - it’s a sickly horrible smell and it’s about time something was done about it.' Reg Hubbard, who lives close by, said: 'Biffa should be doing a lot more to make sure this stops. It’s not nice for anyone. Information from the 'sniff monitoring' and the assessment of the plant’s filtration systems - which are designed to catch any smells before they escape - have been handed over to the Environment Agency. Today, representatives from the agency, Biffa and the council will meet to discuss the findings of the report. Mervyn Tongue, law enforcement officer for the Environment Agency, said: 'We’ve now taken receipt of the technical reports, which show some problems with the processing plant. 'We’ll meet Biffa to discuss the next steps.' He said his agency has the power to force the company to find a solution, but added: 'I’m sure Biffa will want to resolve this as much as everyone else.'On Saturday, a meeting to update residents was chaired by Leicester West MP Liz Kendall. Miss Kendall said: 'I’m so angry we’re still talking about this after so long. 'I will do everything in my power to make sure the Environment Agency uses its power to do something because we’re sick of having to meet like this all the time.'Biffa said it continues to cooperate fully with the authorities.","Locals residents have complained 152 times since 'sniff monitoring' started .

"By . Corey Charlton . Three men are in hospital after having bleach thrown in their faces in a suspected homophobic hate crime with one man believing he might have lost his sight. The 23 year-old is thought to have been hit with bleach in a hate crime involving two woman and a male assailant outside the Lightbox club in south London. He and a male friend, 21, had struck up a conversation with the trio . outside the club after being refused entry because it was past closing . time. Police wish to find these three people following an ammonia chemical attack in South London at the weekend . But the women, thought to be Eastern European, began hurling homophobic abuse at the pair when they discovered they were gay. One of the victims has described . feeling his face 'melting' when his attacker sprayed him with the . chemical at around 4am on Sunday. The older victim said: 'As we walked away I heard a man shout 'Oi! Come . here.' At first I thought it was the doorman saying he'd changed his . mind and we could go in. 'Then I saw this white guy with a beard, and his hand coming up with a water bottle that he squirted really hard into my face. Officers have asked anyone who recognises the people in this CCTV image to contact them immediately . The first attack occurred outside . Lightbox, (pictured) which is located on South Lambeth Place, where two men were . sprayed in the face with the substance following a row with another . group nearby . 'It went right in my eyes and it . sprayed into my friend's mouth. My face was burning so much, I thought . it was acid. I thought I would never see again and my face was melting. 'He poured every last drop onto us and then turned around and walked away, like it was mission accomplished. 'The chemical burnt the cornea in my left eye and the vision hasn't . cleared since. The doctors said it should hopefully return but there is . no guarantee. 'My friend's tongue was swollen and it looked like someone had scratched part of it away. It was horrible.' The owners of the nightclub have issued a statement, condemning the 'homophobic attack'. Spokesperson Mark Williams, from Lightbox owners Orange Nation, said: 'Unfortunately, there was a homophobic attack outside the cafe by Vauxhall Bus Station early on Sunday morning. 'This was an isolated incident and we have been speaking to police since it occurred, including supplying them with our CCTV footage of the local Vauxhall area. 'The police have confirmed there is no direct link with the venue or our customers. 'Our doors were closed at the time of the incident, with no gay events at the Lightbox that morning. 'Our extensive commitment with the council and Vauxhall One to provide a safe environment for everyone continues. 'Our thoughts go out to the victims of this awful attack and we wish them a speedy recovery.' Police are treating the attack as a homophobic hate crime because of comments made during . the argument. The victim added: 'I feel this was a hate crime given where we were and the situation with the two girls. 'What's playing on my mind is the fact that this guy has left his flat and thought 'wallet, keys, bottle of bleach.' 'The guy has gone out with the intention of blinding someone.' It later emerged that a third man had been hit in another random acid attack inside the venue earlier in the evening on Sunday. All three men were treated at hospital. Police have now released CCTV images of the suspects. There have been no arrests. Ammonia is a powerful chemical which can cause blindness if it comes into contact with the eye, and severe burns if it comes into contact with skin.","Three men injured in two ammonia attacks near Lightbox nightclub, London .

"By . Richard Spillett . Centre stage: Artist Marina Abramovic is to appear alone in a gallery and will interact with visitors as part of a new show . A top performance artist has banned visitors to her new show from bringing phones, cameras or computers in a bid to force people to live in the moment. Marina Abramovic will be appearing on her own at London's Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens and intends to simply interact with those who come to see her. But the gallery has installed lockers in its foyer, in which visitors will have to leave their electronic devices before entering the room. Belgrade-born Abramovic, 68, hopes the move will stop those who come to see her hiding behind their phone screens and taking photographs of things 'they don't even experience' at the time. She said: 'In these lockers they can put their BlackBerries and phones and camera and computers and watches. 'We don't want people to come here and phone and blog and tweet before they have even seen it, as they do all the time. 'We want people to come as they are, with nothing, as I am. From then we will see what is going to happen. From that energy, every day is different. That is why it is so hard for me to explain to you what I am going to do, because I don't know.' Abramovic, who collaborated with Lady Gaga on a video last year, will appear before an audience of up to 160 people for eight hours a day for her 64-day exhibition, which opens on Wednesday. In a sneak preview of the show yesterday, she took members of a preview audience and placed them in various locations in the white-walled gallery, leading them by the hand, whispering to them and giving instructions. Launching the work, she said: 'There is nothing. Just empty walls, there's no more, and just me.' She went on: 'I think I push my limits here. I couldn't do anything more radical than I am doing now - and I am terrified.' Abramovic . will be aided by a team of 45 black-clad 'guards' who will ensure her . welfare and she says she may choose to use some props - including . chairs, tables and mirrors - although much of each day will be spent on . her feet. Abramovic, pictured explaining the new show yesterday, will force visitors to leave their phones and tablet computers at the door in a bid to get them to 'experience' the present . The New York-based artist, who will wear a simple black and white outfit each day, will take no rests other than toilet breaks. She said she had some concerns about how a British audience will react to the wacky idea. She said: 'The British public is different. You're cynical, you really like the bad jokes and you drink too much at the weekends, so I am very worried about your public - the only way that I can win here, the British public, is to be extremely vulnerable and humble, that I am there for you at this impossible moment.' Her new exhibition is her first major performance work since she appeared at New York's Museum Of Modern Art in 2010, with The Artist Is Present, in which she sat in silence for three months with visitors invited to gaze into her eyes. As part of another exhibit last year, rapper Jay-Z danced with her for six hours while performing his song Picasso Baby at the Pace Gallery in New York. The Serpentine Gallery in London will have 160 lockers in its foyer so visitors can leave their electronic devices .","Eccentric Marina Abramovic will appear alone at London's Serpentine Gallery .

"By . Corey Charlton . A lesbian madam who forced a talented athlete into prostitution while running a ‘high class’ escort agency serving London’s most upmarket areas is facing jail. Tatiana Shmyrova, 45, exploited the former record-breaking Bulgarian runner, after she was lured to Britain with the promise of a new life. Shmyrova’s son, Artyom, convinced the alleged victim to move to the UK after they enjoyed a holiday romance in her homeland. She was one of a number of girls whose sexual services were enjoyed by wealthy punters including doctors and businessmen, Southwark Crown Court heard. Russian-born Shmyrova set up a business . arrangement with Natalia Cannon, 34, and estranged husband William, 52, . to advertise sex workers for sale on their website. The three were found guilty of all counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation after a four-week trial. Natalia Cannon, and William Cannon, denied charges of conspiracy to traffic persons into the United Kingdom for sexual exploitation as part of the alleged prostitution ring, but were found guilty by a jury . Natalia Cannon was said to have spent her profits on a lavish lifestyle that included a riverside apartment in Chelsea, designer clothing from Prada, Gucci and Versace, and jewellery and watches from Cartier . Shmyrova, . Natalia and William Cannon, had all denied conspiracy to traffic . persons into the United Kingdom for sexual exploitation. Both . Cannons and Michael Poole, of north London, denied conspiracy to . control prostitution for gain and Natalia Cannon also denied possessing . £13,899.79 in criminal property. Shymrova’s lover, Irina Bespalova, 32, organised photoshoots of the working girls. The court heard Bespalova was her ‘partner in work and love’. Crown lawyer Riel Karmy-Jones said they were all part of a ‘ruthless’ sex ring which ran a lucrative business ‘by bartering in human beings and human bodies’. The . prosecutor described Shmyrova as a ‘modern day madam’, adding: ‘She . lives her life through prostitution - but organising prostitutes through . largely the mechanism of the internet. ‘She . was mainly involved in the prostitution network through her work as a . photographer, conducting photo shoots with the working girls to supply . advertising pictures,’ Miss Karmy-Jones added. Michael Poole, 28, was hired as a 'fixer' to ensure prostitutes were willing to carry out client demands . A number . of others were also involved in the alleged prostitution ring. Michael Poole, 28, was hired by Shmyrova . as a ‘fixer’ to ensure that prostitutes were ready and willing to carry . out clients’ demands. Ryzard Goreki, 37, was employed as a driver while Jerzy Molczun, 26, worked as a receptionist and 'heavy'. They all face prison when they are sentenced tomorrow. The victim, who was privately educated, achieved a record when competing in a race when she was just a teenager. But she chose not to pursue a sporting career and went on to work in a series of low-paid jobs. She believed she would be working as a tour guide in London, sobbing as she told of her shame at having to sell her body after being ‘pushed into prostitution’. ‘He said I don’t need any money when I come here so when I arrived in London, I did not have a penny even, I was vulnerable. ‘I was scared, I didn’t know what is going to happen because he didn’t explain anything to me. ‘For me it is not important to have money and all those things like that,' she said. ‘I prefer to have a normal job so I can feel proud of myself, not ashamed of myself, like now. Police smashed the sex ring, which began in October 2012, after launching an undercover sting in February last year. Officers discovered the victim was being housed in an alleged brothel in southwest London. Officers used the brothel's website to identify other west London addresses. Many of the defendants were found guilty of their roles in the business after a trial at Southwark Crown Court . A further count against Natalia Cannon of failing to comply with a disclosure, in relation to a four digit code for an Apple iPad, was left on the court file. Bespalova, Gorecki, and Molczun all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to control prostitution for gain prior to the trial. Artyom Shmyrova is believed to be out of British jurisdiction in Russia and is not subject to any charges.","Tatiana Shmyrova and others set up business advertising sex workers .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A woman has unearthed a treasure trove of pining love letters her father sent to her mother from the trenches during the Second World War. Jim Allen, 23, was called to join the Irish Guards in April 1940, forcing him to leave behind his sweetheart, Ella Bradley. Devastated that they hadn't married before he was deployed to Caterham, they wrote letters to each other every day. Snapshot: Virginia Aighton, 65, has opened her father's cases of cuttings, letters and photos from life at war . Sweethearts: Jim Allen and Ella Bradley, who married during the war, wrote to each other every day . Finally unearthed by their daughter Virginia Aighton 70 years later, the moving notes have been compiled into a book, offering an awe-inspiring glimpse into wartime Britain and the life of a conscript. Jim, from Accrington, Lancashire, . served as an instructor before crossing the channel 12 days after D Day, . where he faced fierce fighting. During his early days of training, he wrote to Ella, declaring his love and describing the intensive daily routine at Caterham. On April 9, 1940, he sent an emphatic letter about his elaborate uniform - 'boots that have to be polished till they look like glass!' - and intense daily routine. At 6am they are up, dressed and tidying their quarters, he explained, before breakfast and the first parade at 8am. 'That is followed by Drill and when I say Drill I mean Drill! My feet are sore with stamping!' he exclaimed. 'Afterwards it's weapon training with rifle and bayonet. Then it's DRILL again till Dinnertime. Treasure trove: It took Mrs Aighton 10 years to find the courage to look through the collection . 'After dinner it's P.T. and more DRILL till tea, after which we polish our kit too 8 o'clock when we finish if we're lucky. 'To be honest darling to be here is like HELL!' The sergeant major was discharged after being blown up by a mine while on reconnaissance near Maastricht. He . spent nine months in hospital, and wore a calliper for the rest of his . life, although it didn’t stop him working at a printing firm. Although he spoke often of his time in the war, Jim's daughter could not bear to go through his souvenirs and letters when he died in 2003. Mrs Aighton, 65, had always planned to archive them - but it wasn't until she was listening to a war-themed radio piece this year that she finally felt ready to look at the suitcases of photos, telegrams, and notes. She said: 'My father often entertained us round the dinner table with his stories about his wartime adventures. 'Dad also gave me a small brown suitcase containing letters and souvenirs from the Second World War. 'I was very busy at the time with work and family commitments, but we had an understanding that one day I would work on this project. 'Then one day I happened to hear a request on the radio asking if any listeners had authentic letters from the decades of the 20th century. 'I retrieved the suitcase from the cupboard and for the first time began to study properly the contents.' Mrs Aighton, a retired teacher, added: 'When I started to read the letters, I found they were beautifully written and full of fascinating details about the times. Reading them was rather like peering through a window into the past.' Wounded: Jim Allen, then a sergeant major, was blown up by a mine near Maastricht in November 1944 but survived with wounded to his hands and legs . Ella died from cancer in 1991, but Jim remained strong, staying in the house he shared with her from the end of the war until his death. After tackling an intruder at home, he was taken to hospital with a broken hip, but succumbed to his injuries a fortnight later following an operation. Two men, who got away with just £30 during the robbery, were jailed for manslaughter in connection with his death. Ginny, who now lives in Wilpshire, Lancashire, is selling the book online on Kindle, and has several hard copies for sale too, which were printed by Jim’s former employer, John Nayler.","Jim Allen, 23, joined Irish Guards in 1940, wrote to sweetheart every day .

"By . Wills Robinson . and Christian Gysin . Their crucial encounter with Italy is only four days away, so England fans would have hoped key players are putting their feet up between training sessions. But strikers Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck took a more relaxed approach to their preparations today, as they tried their hand at a Brazilian form of martial arts with a group of youngsters. The pair, along with Adam Lallana, Fraser Forster and Jack Wilshere, joined in with the Capoeira demonstration during a visit to Rio's infamous Rocinha Favela. Showing off his moves: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge dances during the Capoeria demonstration with the Rochina Favela in the background . They balanced on one hand, raised their legs over the youngsters' heads and bent down like they were ready to grapple as one man played the drums. The . Capoeria is a martial art that was developed by slaves in the 16th century and combines dancing with acrobatics and music. The 'Three . Lions' contingent visited a sports complex attached to the Favela – or . slum – as part of a continued charity initiative which was started by . the FA and the players when they visited Brazil last year. The Favela is home to a staggering 70,000 people and is one of the poorest areas of Brazil. Acrobatics: The strikers moved into the centre of the circle, with Manchester United's Danny Welbeck performing a handstand . Steady: Sturridge then pulled off an impressive move, balancing on one hand on the artificial football pitch . The sports complex on the edge of the . Rocinha neighbourhood is said to have played a major part in the . regeneration of the area since it was opened more than four years ago. The . complex provides a football pitch and area which allows youngsters to . enjoy sports such as boxing , volleyball, tennis, swimming, martial arts . and  skateboarding. The complex also provides a 24hr Accident & . Emergency unit, a family clinic and a psychosocial clinic. During . the afternoon visit the players – who were joined by former England and . West Ham player and now FA Director of Football Development Sir Trevor . Brooking and Club England Managing Director Adrian Bevington -  met and . mixed with a group of children that regularly use the complex. At . one stage Liverpool striker Sturridge and Manchester United forward . Welbeck performed cartwheels with some of the children who in turn . showed the players their martial arts skills. To the floor: Welbeck bends his knees in tandem with one of the other dancers while a drummer plays in the background . The England World Cup squad have now . pledged to donate a five figure sum to the Rocinha complex through their . charity the  Footballers Foundation Charity . Arsenal . and England midfielder Jack Wilshere said during the visit: ‘The entire . squad is keen to gain an appreciation of our surroundings and . experience the culture of Brazil during our time here. 'The . visit to the Rocinha Sports Complex provided an incredible insight into . the unique and powerful role sport plays in this country. ‘With one of the poorest areas of the . city situated just metres away, the complex provides an opportunity, . through sport, for residents of the favela to transform and enrich their . lives.’ Kick: Welbeck then lifts his leg over a youngster's head during the martial arts demonstration . Smile: Pictured at the back of the photo (from left to right) Fraser Forster, Danny Welbeck, Adam Lallana, Jack Wilshire and Daniel Strurridge pose with the Capoerira dancers in front of the 'slum' Another player – Southampton’s Adam Lallana – said: ‘The Sports Complex has helped to completely transform one of the poorest and potential violent areas of Rio. 'The facility provides an incredible opportunity for children to enjoy the simple pleasures of sport – and in doing so can help to take their lives in the right direction. ‘It was an honour for the players to be invited to the centre today.’ Moves: The Brazilians also got the chance to be the centre of attention, performing cartwheels . Earlier in the day the England team staff and players welcomed more than 100 children, young people and local residents to their Urca training base in Rio de Janeiro as they began final preparations for their FIFA World Cup 2014 campaign which begins when they play Italy in the Amazonian city of Manaus on Saturday evening. At one stage Liverpool striker Sturridge laughed as he tried to copy the dance routine of a Brazilian child and joked: ‘I can't do that’ - before he then performed a double back flip as his personal finale. During the visit by the players the smell from the favela sewer wafted across a small 5-a-side Astroturf football pitch close to the multi-coloured shacks and huts making up the slum. Welbeck said after the visit: . ‘It is something I really wanted to do, it is great. I was here last year in Rio, and this time I am really feeling the vibe of the country. It was great to see the kids, they are just enjoying their lives.’ Midfield star  Lallana -  who carries photographs of his young son in his kit bag, said: . ‘The kids are unbelievable. It is nice to see a different side of Brazil, on the beach we only see the lovely waves and sea. The favela is completely different.’ Kicking out: Sturridge looks impressed as one of the youngsters manages to get almost horizontal to the ground while performing a flip .","Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck tried Capoeria in front of youngsters .

Flood alerts have been issued across a swathe of Britain after today's summer sun gave way to thunder storms and downpours across the country.

By Thursday, patches of the country will be back to dry, clear and warm conditions. Around 0.8in (20mm) of rain fell in some areas with Nottingham receiving a downpour of large hail stones, damaging some cars. A yellow 'be aware' weather warning has been issued by the Met Office for the east of England. In particular, Yorkshire and Humber, the East and West Midlands, the East of England and London and south east England. The warnings, in force until 8pm tonight, mean there is a moderate risk of some damage to infrastructure and local disruption. A Met Office spokeswoman stressed that the majority of areas would see less than 20mm rainfall. Summer is here?

Some places will get . lighter rain and not see any thunder or hail,' she said. 'What we are getting is fairly typical weather for early summer. From midweek onwards we are looking at sunny spells and fairly dry for most of the country with generally dry, cloudy conditions in the West. 'It is a mixture of sunshine and patchy cloud. There will be a little rainfall here and there but it will be fairly dry for the rest of the week.' Temperatures will be slightly lower than at the weekend with a highest temperatures predicted of 19C for Leeds, 20C for Southampton, 17C for Plymouth and 21C for Bristol.

The fresh storm prediction comes after the Met Office issued a severe weather warning last week for Saturday with forecasts of heavy, thundery rain battering parts of England, Wales and southern Scotland. But fears that some places could see flooding and an entire month’s rainfall in just one hour turned out to be misplaced, with Britain spared the worst as the summer storms swept the country. The heaviest downpour was registered in Santon Downham, Suffolk, which saw 0.7in (18.2mm) fall in one hour, followed by 0.6in (16.4mm) falling in Bickley, Worcestershire. It fell well short of the 1.2in (30mm) - almost half of the UK monthly average for the whole of June of 2.9in (73.4mm) - which had been forecast as a possibility. Last month the Shard in London - western Europe’s tallest building - was struck by lightning during a thunderstorm.

"By . Dan Bloom . An England superfan has left neighbours in no doubt of his favourite World Cup team after decking out every inch of his house with St George's crosses. Tony Baddams spent three weeks covering his four-bedroom terraced home in Southampton, Hampshire, with more than 300 flags, shirts and giant fluffy dice. There are so many of the red and white flags that they have covered up his windows, blocking out the sun - but the Chelsea supporter insists it is worth it. Spot the England fan: World Cup enthusiast Tony Baddams, 46, has decked out his terraced home in Southampton with more than 300 St George's cross flags, shirts and fluffy dice - even blocking out sunlight . Boisterous: The statement by Mr Baddams (right with his son Sean) has had a mixed reaction from neighbours . The football fan, 46, said he had been decorating his house for every World Cup since the 1980s and this year's was his best effort yet. He has not revealed how much he has spent on the stunt - but admitted he has to buy new flags for every World Cup because the summer sunshine makes them fade. 'I just wanted to show my support for the lads,' he said. 'I love it when people call me a true England fan, I am proud of being English and supporting all the time. 'It is a family effort and we use a big ladder for the roof and a step ladder for the flags over the windows. Mr Baddams' wife Anita (left) said she liked the display despite having no natural light . 'It has been a bit difficult with the wind and rain recently. You start to get blown off the ladder but it was all right because my wife was holding it at the bottom. 'I do not see a lot of flags going up these days and this year it has been my best and hardest effort because of all of the wind and rain.' His wife Anita, a carer, said she was not keen initially but has grown to love the over-the-top show of support. The 44-year-old said: 'At first I said to Tony, ""just put a couple up"". 'Tony being Tony said ""it's only once every four years - let's go the whole hog"". 'Now I've seen it finished, I really like it. It does block out the sunlight but I just keep the front door open. 'Even if England get knocked out we'll keep the flags up until the end of the tournament.' There has been a mixed reaction from neighbours of Mr Draper's home, which is a stone's throw from Southampton FC's home ground at St Mary's Stadium. One amused German neighbour buried the hatchet of 1966 to take photographs of the unusual sight. But another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'I think it is a bit scruffy and there are too many flags.' The tournament begins on Thursday in Brazil, with England's first match against Italy this Saturday in the Amazon rainforest city of Manaus. England manager Roy Hodgson will lead out the side in the Brazilian heat as they look to get off to a flying start before playing Uruguay and Costa Rica.

"By . Wills Robinson . Frantic: The nine-year-old boy can be heard screaming down the phone for help from his home in Manchester while his mother is beaten in the background (file picture) The harrowing moment a nine-year-old child calls 999 - begging for help as his mother is beaten by her partner - has been released by police. Agonising screams can be heard by the youngster's mother as the boy frantically pleads with the call-handler in Manchester to send help. He can be heard shouting 'please, please send the police' while another child cries uncontrollably in the background. On the other end of the phone, the operator keeps asking the scared youngster: 'Does your mum need an ambulance?' Officers then went to the scene but neither parent would give any information . about the incident and said they did not want any police involvement. Greater Manchester Police have released the recording of the horrifying call as part of major campaign against domestic violence before the World Cup starts. In another call, a distressed women tells the operator how her husband threw her up against the wall, 'trashed' her television and threatened to take her son away. When England got knocked out of the tournament four years ago, the force saw a 40 per cent increase in 999 calls - many for domestic violence. And they are warning offenders that extra officers are being drafted in to crack down on violence - as well as urging victims to get help. A recent study has shown domestic incidents increase by more than a third . when England loses a World Cup match - but also rise by 26 per cent when . the team wins. As a result forces across Britain are drafting in . extra resources, launching hard-hitting poster campaigns and even paying . personal visits to known offenders. In Essex 117 fans, seven of them . women, will reportedly be handed warnings after officers analysed their . history of domestic and footballing crime. A . similar tactic is being employed in Northumbria, where officers warn . they will be paying 'special attention' to people who are known to be a . risk. Officers are also set to visit known domestic abusers this week with ‘yellow cards’ given out warning them against violence. They will also be speaking to previous victims urging them to get help if violence flares again with extra officers on duty while England matches are on. Chief Superintendant Vanessa Jardine from Greater Manchester Police said: 'We know historically there is a big increase in domestic abuse incidents [during the World Cup]. 'When England got knocked out four years ago we had 350 999 calls made - a 40 per cent increase - and many of those were regarding domestic violence. 'There will be people living in fear, dreading the World Cup starting because of this and that’s a dreadful way to live. 'We know victims often suffer in silence but there is help out there and we would urge people to give us a call.' Prevention: The harrowing audio clip of the 999 call was released as a number of forces around the country, including Northumbria Police, begin domestic violence campaigns ahead of the World Cup .","Youngster frantically screams down the phone from his home in Manchester .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Evangelical painter Thomas Kinkade once was revered amongst Christians as the 'Painter of Light,' known for his sentimental scenes of country gardens and pastoral landscapes that led to a . commercial empire worth $100 million a year. His life - and ultimately his death - was much less pious, and far-less glamorous. Published reports about the years leading up to the troubled artist's death paint a much different picture than the heavenly landscapes that earned Kinkade millions - it includes drugs, alcohol, 'territorial urination' and sexual harassment. Scroll down for video . Troubled: Christian painter Thomas Kinkade was killed by a lethal overdose of Valium and alcohol . Inspiring: Kinkade was beloved by evangelicals for his sentimental scenes of country gardens and pastoral landscapes . Kinkade died in April 2012 from an accidental overdose from ethanol and Diazepam intoxication, or in common terms, of alcohol and . the tranquilizer marketed as Valium, the Santa Clara County Medical . Examiner-Coroner's Office said at the time. But his heart had grown so enlarged he had been vulnerable to a fatal heart attack at any point, according to the autopsy. In the years leading up to his death he had run into personal difficulties, including a 2010 bankruptcy filing by one of his companies and an arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence that same year outside Carmel, California. Kinkade had been estranged from his wife of 30 years, Nanette, at the time of his death, and his body was found in the bed he shared with his girlfriend of 18 months, Amy Pinto-Walsh at his Monte Sereno home, four hours after he was last known to be alive, said Joseph O'Hara, Santa Clara County's lead medical examiner. Some of his fingernails still held a residue of green paint, and his toenails were polished a glittery gold, the autopsy report said. DWI: Kinkade was arrested for driving while intoxicated, which was just one of his many public embarrassments, many of which were alcohol-related . O'Hara described the 6-foot, 254-pound Kinkade as mildly obese and noted that he suffered from systemic hypertension and cardiovascular disease. 'His heart was so big that at any time he was vulnerable,' O'Hara said. 'Apparently he had given up drinking and maybe he had just started again. His levels were definitely in the toxic range.' Several other drugs, including two other prescription tranquilizers, were present in his bloodstream. Kinkade's urine contained gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB, which occurs naturally in the human body but can also be used as the so-called date rape drug. O'Hara said the painter also had suffered several remote blunt force injuries. 'He had a bruise of his abdomen that was healing, a bruise under his scalp, a hemorrhage under his head, as well as multiple healed rib fractures,' O'Hara said. 'He took a tumble at some point.' The author of a recently published profile of the troubled artist on the Daily Beast website suggests that these injuries were caused by drunken tumbles he would take after drinking too much. Famous: Kinkade and tennis ace Serena Williams (center) attend an event during the 'We Are Family' recording session at Chalice Recording Studios . Kinkade's commercial successes did not endear him with the art establishment, who criticized him for appearing to appeal to the widest possible audience, his brother once told The San Jose Mercury News. The attacks on his work and the artist's split with his wife two years ago took a toll, and he turned to alcohol over the past four or five years, Patrick Kinkade said. 'As much as he said it didn't bother him, in his heart deep down inside it would sadden him that people would criticize, so hatefully, his work and his vision, when people didn't understand him,' said Patrick Kinkade, an associate professor of criminal justice at Texas Christian University. In a 2006 Los Angeles Times article detailing accusations made in court filings about Kinkade's treatment of employees and gallery owners, it says the artist had made several drunken scenes, including one at a Sigfried and Roy show, where he continuously shouted slurs at the entertainers. Estranged: Kinkade did his best to hide his drinking from his wife of 30 years, Nanette Kinkade (pictured) In another case, he fell off of a bar stool and then grabbed a woman's breast. In yet another, Kinkade is said to have urinated on a Winnie the Pooh figure outside of a Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim as part of what former employees say he called 'ritual territory marking.' While urinating on the Pooh figure, Kinkade reportedly yelled 'this one's for you, Walt,' in reference to Disney founder Walt Disney. Following his death, Kinkade's widow and girlfriend battled in the courts over the painter's estate, with girlfriend Amy Pinto-Walsh releasing handwritten notes allegedly written by Kinkade that are barely legible and presumably written while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In one of the scrawls, Kinkade allegedly writes, '""I, Thomas Kinkade, being of sound mind and body do hereby bequeath to Amy Pinto-Walsh $10,000,000 in cash from my corporate policy and I give her the house at 16324 and 16342 Ridgecrest Avenue for her security.' Mistress: Kinkade's mistress of 18 months, Amy Pinto-Walsh (pictured), fought with Nanette Kinkade for control of his estate following his death . Evidence: Kinkade's mistress claimed this barely legible note says Kinkade wanted to leave her $10 million and his Monte Sereno mansion . The artist appears to have written these notes while under the influence of drugs or alcohol - if he wrote them at all . In an equally barely legible document released by Pinto-Walsh, Kinkade allegedly wrote 'I, Thomas Kinkade, hereby bequeath my house at 16324 Ridgecrest Avenue, . Monte Sereno, CA to Amy Pinto in the event of my death. I also give the . sum of $10,000,000 to Amy Pinto to be used for the establishment of the . Thomas Kincaid Museum at 16324 Ridgecrest Avenue, Monte Sereno CA for . the public display in perpetuity of original art. This statement is null . and void if my relationship with Ms. Pinto ends as it is defined by me . in a future letter.' Nanette Kinkade and Pinto-Walsh reached a private settlement out of court over the artist's estate. 'My brother was a good man,' Patrick Kinkade tells the Daily Beast. 'The tragedy of my brother is he eventually fell to his own humanity. The triumph of my brother is that his art was never touched by that tragedy. His art was affirmation that there was hope, there was beauty, and a statement of love that wasn't touched by this.'","Kinkade's 2012 death was caused by an accidental overdose from ethanol and Diazepam intoxication .

"By . Julian Robinson . Gemma Cawte , pictured left with her five-month-old son Jack, was stunned after cafe staff tried to charge her 80p for a jug of hot tap water to warm her baby's milk . A furious mother has hit out after a council-run café tried to charge her 80p for a jug of hot tap water to warm her baby’s milk. Gemma Cawte had already spent £9.60 on lunch for herself and her daughter Bella, five, on an outing to Riverside Country Park in Gillingham, Kent. But when the 31-year-old asked staff at the café for some water to warm the milk for her five-month-old son Jack, she was told it would cost 80p. Ms Cawte had spent all her money buying lunch and was forced to feed the milk cold to the tiny baby - and the youngster promptly threw it up. Medway Council says the cafe is run under a lease agreement and that it has no control over the pricing. But civic chiefs have asked for the people that run it to reconsider charging for warming baby bottles. Ms Cawte, of Chattenden, Kent, said: 'I asked for some hot water and they said they couldn’t give me any because of health and safety. 'When I asked if they could put it in some hot water behind the counter instead. 'I was told I would have to pay 80p, the same price as a cup of tea. We had only taken £10 out with us. 'It is madness. I thought they would have been more helpful considering it was a family place. 'The woman in the cafe wasn’t apologetic at all. She just looked at me and said no she couldn’t do it.

"By . Darren Boyle . Former snooker star Stephen Lee, pictured, was fined £1,185 at Swindon Magistrates' Court after he admitted on count of fraud after he failed to send a cue he had sold to one of his fans to the buyer . Disgraced snooker player Stephen Lee is living on benefits after being banned from the sport for match-fixing, a court heard. Details of Lee's fall from grace came to light after he pleaded guilty to a charge of fraud at Swindon Magistrates' Court over the sale of his personal snooker cue. The court heard Lee, of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, agreed to sell his John Parris Ultimate to fan Marco Fai Pak Shek, based in Hong Kong, through Facebook for £1,600. But despite Mr Shek paying the money into the bank account of Lee's wife, the cue never arrived - and 39-year-old Lee continued to use it. Lee insisted he had always meant to send the cue but was distracted after becoming 'embroiled in a number of difficulties' relating to his professional life. Earlier this month, Lee was ordered to pay a total of £125,000 in costs after failing in his appeal to overturn a 12-year ban from snooker for match fixing. The five-time ranking tournament winner and former number world five was handed the ban after a 2013 tribunal found him guilty of fixing seven games in 2008 and 2009. Today magistrates ordered Lee to pay £1,815 after he entered a guilty plea to the charge of fraud by false representation between July 1 2013 and January 21 this year. John Fryer, chairman of the bench, told Lee the fine would be deducted from the £133 he receives in benefits every fortnight. 'In . arriving at our sentence at this matter, we have taken into account a . number of things - your previous good character, you have not appeared . before the courts before, and we have given you credit for your early . guilty plea,' Mr Fryer said. Mr Lee, pictured, told the court that he was unable to pay the £1,800 fine immediately as he has been living on benefits since he was banned for 12 years from playing snooker following a match fixing allegation . 'We also note that you are on benefits and your income is significantly lower.' Lee was fined £110 for the offence and told to pay Mr Shek £1,600 in compensation, along with £85 prosecution costs and a £20 victim surcharge. When asked if he could pay the £1,815 fine immediately, Lee replied: 'I can't pay that today, no.' Mr Fryer made a collection order for the amount, telling Lee: 'If the payments stop, someone will be knocking on your door.' Lee's appeal against his 12-year ban was thrown out by Nicholas Stewart QC earlier this month, with his original costs order also increased from £40,000 to £75,000. Lee, pictured, was ordered to pay £125,000 in costs after failing to overturn his 12-year snooker ban for match fixing in what the game's governing body called 'the worst case of corruption it had ever seen' The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association described his actions as 'the worst case of corruption' it had ever seen, while Lee said he was 'devastated' by the penalty. Prosecutor Michelle Hewitt told magistrates Lee offered his personal snooker cue for sale to Mr Shek for £1,600 and agreed for modifications to be made. 'But following the transfer of the funds, the defendant failed to send the snooker cue or make any arrangements for the modifications to be carried out as agreed,' Ms Hewitt said. 'When there was no sign of the snooker cue, a report was made to the police. They carried out an investigation and arrested the defendant. 'The defendant was still using the cue as his own personal property.' Following Mr Shek's formal complaint, made to police on January 24 this year, Lee sent the victim an email promising to 'personally deliver' the cue to Hong Kong. The email read: 'If you want the cue, you need to drop the charges and I will sign some pictures for you,' the court heard. Lee took to his Facebook page, pictured, to explain to a supporter that he was 'gutted' by the court appearance. He claimed that he had intended travelling to Hong Kong to deliver the cue personally . However, Mr Shek refused to drop the charges and the case against Lee continued. Representing Lee, Mark Glendenning said his client had repeatedly apologised to Mr Shek for failing to send the cue. He said the sale was arrange through Lee's Facebook page, where he had previously sold items to fans 'without incident'. Lee attempted to arrange for work to be carried out on the snooker cue but became distracted with issues in his personal and professional life, he explained. 'Life took over, Mr Lee found himself embroiled in a number of difficulties which have been much publicised in relation to his career and that took a great deal of his time and energy,' Mr Glendenning said. 'He accepts in full he should have sent this cue, the difficulty being with his personal life impacting on his professional life. 'There was an intention to send that cue to Hong Kong but things took over and it didn't get there.' Lee, who wore a black t-shirt, black jacket and jeans to court, did not wish to comment outside the courtroom . However, a message appeared on Stephen Lee's Facebook page stating that he was 'gutted'. The message read: 'Well the guilty plead (sic) was honest as I took the money from a fan and I new (sic) that I had a plan to be out in hong kong in march to meet with him my self and hand the cue over and have a frame with him.....' In reply to a comment of support, he added: 'I'm just gutted ......'","Shamed snooker star Stephen Lee agreed to sell the cue to a fan for £1,600 .

'He has achieved almost everything at club level and has been a great player at an international level too. 'He . comes to us straight from the English Premier League with Fulham, so he . has been playing at the highest level against top teams and top . players.'

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . In 2009, former Liverpool chief executive Christian Purslow sat alone in the stands to watch Raheem Sterling play for England Under 17s against Northern Ireland. ‘Just watching him play then, I knew he would go on to play for  England at the highest level,’ recalled Purslow yesterday as he spoke of the best £500,000 he ever spent, to sign Sterling from QPR. Liverpool’s academy director Frank McParland and chief scout Eduardo Macia had been to watch him play for the youth team at Rangers. They were convinced they had found something special and Purslow agreed. Have faith, Roy: Hodgson should select Raheem Sterling from the start against Italy . Backdrop: Raheem Sterling pings one in front of the stunning scenery surrounding England's training base . Nearly five years on, England have discovered a star before a ball has even been kicked at the World Cup in Brazil. Sterling (below) has to play on Saturday against Italy. Those who have watched him train or play, either in Miami last week or here at the Urca military base  yesterday, walk away with the same verdict. He is special. There is room for him at No 10 in this England team if Wayne Rooney moves out to the left and James Milner plays on the right against Italy. Danny Welbeck — reliable yet unremarkable — would be sacrificed. Rooney, whose finishing was of the highest order in training yesterday, provides experience and Milner adds security on the right in place of Adam Lallana. Roy Hodgson has to make this happen. Sterling, 19, is one of a dying breed — comfortable when running at defenders at high speed. The Liverpool forward enjoys it, too. This was evident yesterday when his twinkle-toed moves took him past his team-mates on a glorious day here in Rio. Even Lallana has been marvelling at Sterling’s ability since they joined up for the World Cup.‘He’s a great athlete and the more we see of him on the pitch the better it is for the country,’ said Lallana  yesterday. ‘It is great that he has taken his club form into the national set-up, but there are a lot of talented players in various positions. ‘Wayne played out wide the other day and Milner can play there. There is a lot of competition and that is healthy.’ Young Lions: Jack Wilshere, Sterling and Ross Barkley posing for photos during a portrait session . Smiles: Sterling and Luke Shaw take part in a recovery session after training on Monday . It is too soon to be talking of Sterling and Ross Barkley starting in the same team at the World Cup. That can come later. Barkley is another who wants to make things happen, but there is too much temptation to play fast and loose when he is in  possession. He will be better coming from the bench. Sterling’s star continues to rise and he was mesmerising during the intervals in the various drill sessions being put on by Hodgson during yesterday’s open training session. He was full of tricks, flicks and turns, with his mastery of the ball something to behold. He is a joy to watch. The Liverpool forward has no fear and that is something England must capitalise on in tournament conditions. There is also the obvious issue of trust, particularly when you factor in his age, lack of international  experience and his dismissal against Ecuador at the Sun Life Stadium last Wednesday. His rash challenge on Antonio Valencia was a mistake, but he showed maturity after the Manchester United winger grabbed him by the throat during that fiery exchange. Hodgson is convinced he has learned. Fracas: Sterling was sent off against Ecuador after a confrontation with Antonio Valencia . Team-mates: Sterling and Daniel Sturridge provided plenty of superb moments for Liverpool this season . Sterling’s game has benefited from an extended run in the Liverpool side this season alongside the PFA player of the year Luis Suarez and his England team-mate Daniel Sturridge. He has come a long way since the early phase of his Liverpool career, when he was one of three hugely- talented young British players signed by Purslow around the same time. Jonjo Shelvey, who arrived from Charlton, moved on last season and signed for Swansea after failing to become a regular fixture in the Liverpool set-up. Danny Wilson, who was a Scotland Under 17 international when he arrived from Rangers, has returned back north of the border to Hearts. Sterling has made the grade, though, forcing his way into the first team at Liverpool and forcing Hodgson to make a decision when he travels to Manaus. He has only made two starts for his country, but he is the man in form as the countdown continues to England’s opening group game. On Saturday evening, Sterling can make the difference.","Sterling can make the difference from the start against Italy .

"By . Julian Robinson . TV bosses have apologised after a blunder saw many tennis fans miss the dramatic winning points in the French Open last night. Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic had played two points in what turned out to be the last game in the tournament finale, which was being aired live on ITV. But with the game, and potentially the match, on a knife edge, viewers were told the coverage would be interrupted for the news and footage was switched to ITV4, the digital channel that many people are still unable to access. Scroll down for video . Victory: Rafael Nadal wins the French Open final but not everyone got to see it after ITV's gaffe . Switch: Fans were told in final game that coverage was to be interrupted by the news (file picture) Rafael Nadal went on to win the final few points and take the trophy, winning 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-4. But many missed out on the moment he clinched victory and the scheduling decision immediately sparked anger online. The French Open was listed for coverage between 1.30pm and 5.45pm on Sunday. At that point, local and then national news was scheduled to run between 5.45pm and 6pm before ITV's Soccer Aid started, which ran from 6pm to 10pm. Over on ITV4, tennis was listed to run from 5.40pm to 6.30pm, giving reviews a five minute overlap period. ITV has said this was always the schedule and made several announcements to inform viewers before the change over happened. But television presenter Nick Knowles took to Twitter to say: 'Can’t believe ITV have switched away from tennis final in last game of last set!!! What about everyone who can’t get ITV4?' Broadcaster Stuart Linnell called the move 'Probably the worst TV scheduling decision ever!' He added: 'ITV switching French Open Men's Final to ITV4 just as Nadal wins. Utterly ridiculous.' Outrage: Television presenter Nick Knowles was one of those angry at ITV's scheduling decision . Too late? ITV apologised after the final few minutes of the French Open were switched to ITV4 . Unlucky: Plenty cannot access digital-only channel ITV4 meaning they missed out on the final minutes . Tennis fan, Jenny Smith, said on Twitter: 'Immaculate timing @ITV just as it goes into the final game of the French open... Cut off to go to local news. Fabulous.' Another .

A number of factors, such as the geographical surroundings and signal strength, are believed to affect what channels some Freeview viewers' are able to receive. ITV said it had made viewers aware of the changeover a number of times in advance during the game. Rafael Nadal, right, and Novak Djokovic, left, had played two points in what turned out to be the final game in the tournament's grand finale, which was being aired live on ITV1 . A spokesman told MailOnline: 'On reaching the end of our scheduled slot on ITV we switched our coverage to ITV4, having made viewers aware of the changeover on air five minutes in advance and through ITV's Twitter feeds. 'The information was repeated several times on air and coverage on ITV4 overlapped for several minutes to ensure viewers need not miss any action. 'We apologise for any inconvenience the change in channels caused to any viewers.' It is not the first time ITV has been forced to apologise for a scheduling blunder. In 2010, their HD coverage cut off England's opening World Cup goal against the United States. ITV viewers saw Steven Gerrard's opening goal after four minutes but fans watching on HD were left bemused after the broadcaster suddenly switched to a Hyundai advert. Viewers of ITV HD had their coverage of the game suddenly cut short after just 3mins 26secs of play. Viewers were outraged after footage of England's goal against the USA in 2010 scored by Steven Gerrard, pictured . ITV blamed 'human error' at an outside company and apologised 'unreservedly' for the error. Coverage resumed at 3mins 46secs, with Gerrard celebrating his strike sparking outrage among England fans, who blasted the broadcaster on social network sites. A year earlier millions of viewers vented their disbelief and anger that ITV had cut to an ad break for Tic-tac mints and Volkswagen as the extra time winner was scored in the live FA Cup clash between Liverpool and Everton. Their rage brought a personal apology from ITV boss Michael Grade yesterday who described the incident as 'a shambles' and a 'technical cock up.' The goal, by Everton's Dan Gosling, came two minutes before the end of extra time. The incident happened four years after more than a million ITV HD viewers missed Steven Gerrard's England goal against USA in the 2010 World Cup. Coverage of the game on the high definition channel suddenly cut out at 3mins 26secs and switched to an advert before going blank. When footage resumed 20 seconds later, viewers saw Gerrard celebrating his goal.

"By . Peter Graff, Reuters . Sony has became the first World Cup sponsor to call for a thorough investigation into accusations bribes were paid to secure the 2022 tournament for Qatar, raising pressure on football chiefs who have threatened to move the tournament if the allegations are proved to be true. FIFA is conducting an internal investigation into the decisions to hold the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 Cup in Qatar. Qatar's bid in particular has attracted controversy from the outset because of the extreme summer heat during the months when the tournament is played and the tiny country's lack of domestic tradition. If it goes ahead, the dates are expected to be switched to later in the year, creating scheduling headaches for broadcasters and European clubs. Call: Sony have become the first World Cup sponsor to call for an investigation into accusations of bribes . Denial: Mohamed Bin Hammam has denied allegations he bribed officials . The Sunday Times has printed what it says are leaked documents showing bribes were paid to secure the event for Qatar, which the host denies. Former US prosecutor Michael Garcia, leading FIFA's internal investigation, is due to report in July, around a week after the World Cup finishes in Brazil. Until now, FIFA's sponsors have stayed silent. The Sunday Times quoted a Sony statement as saying: 'As a FIFA partner, we expect these allegations to be investigated appropriately. 'We continue to expect FIFA to adhere to its principles of integrity, ethics and fair play across all aspects of its operations,' added the statement from the consumer electronics company. Investigation: Michael Garcia is leading a FIFA investigation into the allegations . Although the Sony statement is carefully worded, it is unusual for a sponsor to say anything publicly on such a sensitive issue and appears to reflect concern over the knock-on effects on its image. 'This underlines that companies need to make sure that any high profile association enhances their reputation rather than damages it,' said Andy Sutherden, Global Head of Sports Marketing & Sponsorship at communications firm H+K Strategies. The Sunday Times printed new accusations on Sunday, just four days before the 2014 tournament kicks-off in Brazil, alleging that then-Asian football chief Mohamed Bin Hammam had brokered meetings between Qatari officials and governments to discuss bilateral trade deals. Qatar denies Bin Hammam was connected to its bid for the Cup. Bin Hammam has not commented. Controversial: The World Cup may be moved if the allegations are found to be true . FIFA has already banned him for life from over accusations he paid bribes to win votes for a bid to become FIFA president. That ban was overturned but another was imposed for conflicts of interest. FIFA earned almost £830million last year, including more than £350m from broadcasting rights and more than £230m from sponsors and other marketing partners. Sony is one of six main FIFA sponsors who collectively paid around £100m last year. Sony's sponsorship agreement expires this year, giving it particular leverage as it negotiates a new deal.","Electronics giant is a partner of FIFA .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Loic Courteau, long-time coach of Amelie Mauresmo when she played, illustrates her character by telling of the surprise that awaited him when he got back from holiday after the season when she made it to world No 1. ‘It was in 2004, we were at the US Open and there was a very nice car I saw on the street, an Infiniti,’ he recalled on Monday at the Aegon Championships, where he is now guiding Frenchman Julien Benneteau. ‘She didn’t say anything at the time but at end of the year I was on holiday and she called. I was in Morocco, she asked when I was coming back and told me she was coming to the airport to pick me up. She came with this same car to give me because she was No 1 in the world. She had found it for me.’ Many who know her intimately —and Courteau is among her closest confidants — speak of a thoughtfulness that is combined with an excellent tennis brain. Appointment: Andy Murray, pictured training at Queen's, has appointed Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach . Top job: The two-time Grand Slam winner will take over in time for  Queen's . Understanding: Loic Courteau used to coach the former world No 1 Mauresmo . This combination has swayed Andy Murray to hire her. ‘When . she is commentating on TV she says good things, sometimes the guys . don’t get it right but all the time she says the right things,’ added . Courteau. ‘What I like very . much is that when she decides on something, she goes to the end. Some . people you cannot talk to, but she is sensitive emotionally. ‘She is very clever, maybe for Andy’s team it will be different at the beginning but they are generous and will fit very well. ‘Maybe she and Andy should play mixed doubles together, that would be great!’ 'Excited': Murray said Mauresmo was someone he 'always looked up to and admired' Champ: Mauresmo won Wimbledon in 2006 and the Australian Open in the same year . Something the teetotal Murray will not have in common with his new coach is her passion for wine. When she won Wimbledon in 2006, Mauresmo gave herself a long-awaited treat — buying a bottle of 1921 Chateau d’Yquem. But . the signs are that the pair will gel better than she did with Marion . Bartoli, despite the fact that she was on her compatriot’s team when she . won Wimbledon last year. It . appears that the extrovert  Bartoli, who relishes a high profile, . grated with Mauresmo, who is much more private by inclination. ‘We were . not compatible,’ she revealed. Mauresmo . has been publicity shy ever since she came out as gay at the 1999 . Australian Open, something that happened with a fanfare she subsequently . regretted. Hurtful things . were said during that tournament, such as Martina Hingis describing . playing her as like facing ‘half a man’ because of her impressive . physique. Previous: Mauresmo already has experience of coaching man, having worked with Michael Llodra . Exit: Murray lost to Rafa Nadal in the semi-finals of the French Open in Paris . For someone with a . reserved nature who comes from a traditionally-minded family based just . north of Paris, the whole experience was not enjoyable. On . several occasions she has said she found being in England more relaxing . than being in her home country — and that becoming the first world No 1 . in a nation where tennis is massively popular brought an unwelcome . focus. Some who know her . well from French tennis believe that the  biggest obstacle to her . forming a successful partnership with Murray may be how she copes with . the pressure. She arrives this morning at Queen’s Club to begin work and . the attention will be fairly relentless until her new client finishes . his Wimbledon campaign. Murray . has factored all this in and does not believe it will be a difficulty — . not even the logistics of Mauresmo being unable to enter the men’s . locker room. ‘Obviously you . can’t sit down and chat in there, but there’s enough places where you . can chat.  The  players’ lounge is pretty large,’ he told the BBC. Laugh: Latvian Ernests Gulbis joked about Maria Sharapova or Ana Ivanovic becoming a coach to a male . Tonic: Murray will have to recover from the thumping he took at the hands of Nadal . ‘Normally . I speak about tactics the night before my matches and then 20, 30 . minutes before I go on court when I’m normally in the gym anyway. I . don’t see any  problems in that respect.’ Few know Murray better than Ross Hutchins, the British doubles player who is tournament director this week. He . pointed out that his close friend has a long history of picking coaches . through innovative hunches, rather than looking at their experience. Hutchins . also ventured that  Mauresmo will be given full responsibility for . guiding his career: ‘I’d imagine that she will be the boss. In most . sitiuations the head coach will be leading the show, organising the . team. I believe Amelie will do that but ultimately it is Andy’s call . about how much control she has. ‘I think she’ll be very smart, it’s not like she’s someone who is incapable of running his team.’ Ernests . Gulbis had a typically irreverent reaction to the appointment, however, . telling BBC radio last night: ‘I am waiting for a couple of . good-looking tennis players to also quit tennis so that I can also have a . new coach. ‘Sharapova, Ivanovic, Azarenka maybe. Who would make the better coach?’ Contact: Mauresmo said the pair had been discussing working together for a few weeks .

"By . Greg Beacham, Associated Press . Los Angeles' Justin Williams scored 4:36 into overtime after a turnover by Dan Girardi, giving the Kings a home win over the New York Rangers in the opening game of the NHL's Stanley Cup finals. Kyle Clifford had a goal and an assist for Los Angeles, and Drew Doughty made up for an early mistake by scoring the tying goal in the second period as the Kings came charging back from yet another early deficit in a postseason full of comebacks. Jonathan Quick made 25 saves as the Kings moved one victory closer to their second Stanley Cup title in three years. 'It certainly helps that we've done it time and time again,' said Williams, the repeat postseason hero dubbed Mr. Game 7 for his knack for series-deciding goals. 'It's a great result of the hockey game for us, definitely, but we have a lot of things to clean up. Certainly not our best game by any standards, especially ours, but we were able to get it done. That's the most important thing.' Hero: Justin Williams scored in overtime to guide the Los Angeles Kings to victory in game one . Nose in front: The Kings celebrate taking a 1-0 lead in the Stanley Cup finals . Game 2 is on Saturday in Los Angeles. Williams' goal came on what was the Kings' cleanest scoring chance of the night. Left alone in the slot after Girardi's pass from his knees went straight to Mike Richards, Williams put his eighth goal of the postseason past Henrik Lundqvist, who made 40 saves in what was almost a game-winning performance. 'There's a handful of guys who raise their game this time of year,' Kings defenceman Willie Mitchell said of Williams. 'He's one of them, and we're lucky to have him. ... I want him to be Mr. Game 1, 2, 3 and 4. We need four wins.' Los Angeles outshot New York 20-3 in the third period, becoming the first team to get 20 shots in a finals period in 16 years. The Kings also got a power play with 1:36 left, setting up a wild finish to regulation. Moments after Carl Hagelin was denied by Quick on a short-handed breakaway, Jeff Carter was stopped agonizingly short of a wraparound goal by Lundqvist, sending the Kings to their third straight overtime playoff game. Battle: Game two of the series will take place in Los Angeles on Saturday . Rough: LA's Alec Martinez and New York's Mats Zuccarello collide at the Staples Center . Benoit Pouliot scored on a breakaway and Hagelin got a short-handed goal in the first period to put New York on top, but the Rangers spent much of the final two periods on their heels. 'Not quite sure what happened there in the third,' Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said. 'Not sure if it was them being that good, or us stopping moving the puck and skating and going north-south. They definitely took it to us in the third, and they were able to get a bounce on the winning goal and put it in the back of the net.' The Kings and the Rangers played a combined 41 games in the first three rounds of the playoffs - just one fewer than the maximum - to emerge from the middle of the playoff pack. 'At this time of the year, you're not tired,' Lundqvist said. 'You're excited to be out there playing. We were looking to get the first win here, but we'll try it again in the next one.' The series is big news in the nation's two biggest cities. The last time a New York and Los Angeles team clashed in a major league decider was when the Yankees took on the Dodgers in baseball's World Series in 1981.","Los Angeles Kings take 1-0 lead in Stanley Cup finals .

Accuracy: Neymar elected for placement over power in scoring his free-kick . During a training session for the Selecao, the Barcelona striker clipped a delightful free-kick from 20 yards over a wall and into the top corner past a stranded keeper. It's the latest trick in the 22-year-old's arsenal, following an outrageous penalty also in training where he fooled the goalkeeper with which foot he was going to take the spot-kick with. Neymar's sweet set-pieces could prove crucial for Brazil during the World Cup, but Scolari clearly feels the host nation need more following a recent training session. Stranded: Brazil keeper Jefferson looks on as Neymar scores past him in training . 'When I don't like things,' said Scolari, 'I have to find a solution and field it on the pitch until I am satisfied. 'We have two friendlies and it is preferable to field him in either better or perfect conditions from the second match.' Neymar won't be the only Brazilian capable of scoring from a dead ball though, as Sportsmail looks at other members of the squad who may be standing over a free-kick this summer. Going the distance: Dani Alves (right) has a good track record with long range free-kicks . Dani Alves . Neymar's Barcelona team-mate will most likely be bombing down the flanks and trying to supply the striker with crosses at the World Cup, but the 31-year-old has previous in finding the back of the net from long range free-kicks. Unpredictable: David Luiz's free-kicks often trouble keepers with their top spin . David Luiz . The Chelsea defender was once branded a Playstation footballer by Gary Neville, but his free-kicks are something straight off a games console, with the 27-year-old often catching keepers off guard with attempts containing plenty of top spin. Controlling: Oscar's technique and skill have left many keepers fooled from free-kicks . Oscar . And when Luiz doesn't get a go, his Chelsea team-mate Oscar is more than capable of stepping up. The midfielder scored a stunning free-kick against Stoke in the FA Cup last season, disguising his strike enough to beat Asmir Begovic at his nearest top corner. Thumbs up from me: Hernanes can be just as accurate as Neymar in picking out a top corner . Hernanes . It's not just Neymar that can leave keepers rooted from free-kicks. Inter Milan's Hernanes can also find the postage stamp corners and it encouraged Inter Milan to snap up the midfielder from Lazio earlier this year. Power: Hulk's long range free-kicks could be an asset for Brazil at the World Cup . Hulk . For when skill and technique just isn't enough, Hulk can step up to the set-piece plate for Brazil with his powerful drives from long range proving an asset during his time at Porto.","Neymar leaves goalkeeper standing with 20-yard free-kick .

"Rio Ferdinand is an interviewer, . programme-maker and football expert for BT Sport . By . Rio Ferdinand . Starting at the top of the formation (and the talent), getting the best out of England’s best player, Wayne Rooney, could be a critical part of a successful tournament. Rooney is a centre-forward who thrives in that position and I don’t see why there is even a debate on this. He should be in that No 9 role, up front and centre, and allowed to play to his strengths. The keeper and back four effectively select themselves, not least because the centre-half pairing of Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka have become something like established, with a decent understanding.

Anfield connection: Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson will prove a shield to protect the defence . The obvious and ideal defensive midfielder, Michael Carrick, wasn’t selected. So Stevie Gerrard and Jordan Henderson should make up the two-man shield that adds protection to the back four. That leaves a line of three for a trio of young, swashbuckling, attack-minded players, and if fit and available then, right to left, I’d choose Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

"By . Greg Stutchbury, Reuters . Openside flanker Michael Hooper has been elevated to the Australian rugby team’s captaincy after hooker Stephen Moore was ruled out for the season due to a knee reconstruction. The 22-year-old Hooper had been widely expected to take the role after Moore tore his anterior and medial cruciate ligaments in his left knee in the opening minute of the Wallabies’ 50-23 victory over France in Brisbane on Saturday. Hooper, who had been appointed by coach Ewen McKenzie as one of his two vice-captains before the three-test series with France, led the side at Lang Park when Moore limped off. On the ball: Michael Hooper looks for support during Australia's victory over France on Saturday . Quick hands: Hooper rides a tackle from Yoann Huget before passing to team-mate Nick Phipps . 'It’s a massive honour to captain your country and I’m confident Michael has all the right leadership qualities to lead this team moving forward,' McKenzie said in a statement. 'I couldn’t have been more impressed with his performance on the weekend after Stephen went down, so we know the added responsibility won’t impact the high-level of play we all expect from him each week.' Hooper is McKenzie’s fourth test captain since he replaced Robbie Deans in the job less than a year ago. He dumped Queensland Reds captain James Horwill on the end of season tour last year and replaced him with loose forward Ben Mowen. Down and out: Stephen Moore receives treatment before limping off against France (below) Mowen was not considered for the squad this season, having elected to pursue his rugby career overseas at the finish of the ongoing Super Rugby season. Moore then held the job for less than a week and his first test in charge lasted less than a minute, prompting Australia’s media to call the job a ‘poisoned chalice’ for players selected to the role. Moore’s injury revives grisly memories of 2012, when Horwill (hamstring), then replacements David Pocock (knee) and Will Genia (knee), were blighted by serious injuries after being appointed to the role by former coach Deans.","Openside flanker led side after Moore limped off against France on Saturday .

"By . Chris Foy . Follow @@FoyChris . The last time England were in the ‘City of Sails’, they had become figures of fun and were mercilessly mocked as they made a shambolic exit from the World Cup. That was three years and a veritable lifetime ago. The locals aren’t laughing at Stuart Lancaster’s national team now. The joke has long since worn off. Instead, Kiwis are coming to terms – somewhat grudgingly – with the fact that England are emerging as very serious challengers to their beloved All Blacks’ global pre-eminence. Saturday’s tense first Test at Eden Park may just go down as the watershed occasion when the national team proved they really are capable of wresting the World Cup from New Zealand next year. Amid the devastation of losing a game they could have won, England will seize on some highly encouraging signs about their collective development.

What a savagely-weakened line-up . showed in this series opener was that they are amassing the depth of . talent to be prime contenders at their home tournament next year. They . exposed the fact that the All Blacks are afflicted by mortality — in . defiance of popular myth — and also obliterated the notion that weary .

These tourists will not accept the age-old perception that in . these parts, they are inherently inferior. English spirit no longer . withers in the Antipodes, thanks to the conviction generated by . heartening past results and the coaches’ ability to instil soaring . confidence in their players, even those who have been out of form or . lacking match-fitness. Manu Tuilagi is a case in point. The last time he was here he was lampooned after jumping off a ferry for a dip in the harbour.

Frankly, . given the uniquely trying circumstances, the visitors were not expected . to make a game of it. Forced to operate without around a dozen of their . leading players the Red Rose management worked wonders to bring the . best out of the men left standing. Certain . members of the starting XV had gone into this daunting fixture against a . backdrop of poor or disrupted seasons but almost to a man they . delivered, notably Freddie Burns and Kyle Eastmond as a raw 10-12 . combination.

"Wales head coach Warren Gatland is targeting an historic Test series win in South Africa and wants a marker to be set in Tuesday's tour opener against the Eastern Province Kings. Wales have never beaten the Springboks on South African soil and few are giving them a chance during this two-Test series given the likes of Sam Warburton, Leigh Halfpenny, Richard Hibbard, Rhys Priestland, Justin Tipuric and Scott Williams are missing through injury. Gatland's men were beaten 2-0 when they last toured South Africa in 2008 but, with the World Cup 15 months away, the Kiwi knows how important it will be for Wales to improve their poor record against the southern hemisphere's big three of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. Good start: Warren Gatland is hoping Wales can put down a marker against the Eastern Province Kings . 'The target is to win,' he said. 'I had only just been in charge when we were here in 2008. We were well beaten in the first Test and came back and were unlucky in the second Test. 'We were in front and had a couple of rough calls go against us in the second Test. 'We need to start well and get some confidence and hopefully we can win. 'A couple of years ago in Australia we were very unlucky, we were close to South Africa in the autumn and we are not here to make up the numbers. 'We are here to build, get some confidence and hopefully to win the series.' Out: Wales have a number of players out through injury including Leigh Halfpenny (right) Before the Test series gets under way, Wales will face the Kings, who play in the domestic Currie Cup tournament, in Port Elizbeth on Tuesday. Gatland has handed Lions flanker Dan Lydiate the captaincy as the tough-tackling Racing Metro back-rower looks to prove his fitness after five weeks out with a hamstring injury. Three of the four uncapped players in the touring party - Matthew Morgan, Jordan Williams and Steven Shingler - are handed the chance to impress, with the experience of fly-half James Hook, wing Alex Cuthbert and lock Ian Evans also called upon. Gatland is the first to admit he knows very little about the Kings, who are to enter Super Rugby in 2016 and are coached by former All Black Carlos Spencer, but is demanding a good performance against a typically robust South African side. 'I don't know a lot about them,' he said. Selected: James Hook's (right) experience will be key against the Eastern Province Kings . 'This is a cross as to whether they are in Currie Cup mode or getting ready for Super Rugby. But we are looking forward to it, getting to Port Elizabeth. 'It's a lovely place and a good stadium and it will be a massive challenge. 'Just because we don't know a lot about them does not mean they will not be typical South African side, they will be tough and physical. 'But we need to start this tour on the front foot and we will be looking for a good performance ahead of that first Test.' It is the first time Lydiate has been asked to lead Wales, although he did skipper the Lions against Melbourne Rebels last summer. M Morgan (Ospreys), A Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), C Allen (Cardiff Blues), S Shingler (Scarlets), J Williams (Scarlets), J Hook (Perpignan), R Williams (Scarlets), P James (Bath), S Baldwin (Ospreys), R Jones (Scarlets), J Ball (Scarlets), I Evans (Ospreys), D Lydiate (captain, Racing Metro), J Turnbull (Scarlets), D Baker (Ospreys).Replacements: M Rees (Cardiff Blues), A Jarvis (Ospreys), S Lee (Scarlets), L Charteris (Perpignan), A Shingler (Scarlets), G Davies (Scarlets), G North (Northampton), L Williams (Scarlets). Gatland has no doubt he is up to the task. He said: 'He did a good job captaining the Lions and I am sure he will do so again. He needs some rugby and has been unfortunate. 'He was playing some good rugby towards the end of the Six Nations and was getting some more rugby with Racing Metro, but he pulled his hamstring. 'But he is a guy who gets better with rugby under his belt.'","Warren Gatland hoping for an historic Test series win in South Africa .

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . Graham Gooch is on the outside now, but you wouldn't necessarily realise it. Discarded as England batting coach a few weeks ago, he still talks with the passion and wisdom of a man who cares deeply - and knows no other way. When a figure of his stature says that English cricket needs to shed its conservatism and 'look at the way we're going to win games', it's both polite to listen and almost counter-intuitive to reflect that he's no longer involved. Gooch had been passing on his knowledge to the England dressing-room since late 2009 before he received a call from Alastair Cook at the end of April informing him that his services were no longer required. Focused: England captain Alastair Cook decided on different approach following Ashes whitewash . Before that he was a selector. And before that he was England captain. He remains their leading Test run scorer, with a tally of 8,900. Quite simply, an England dressing-room without Gooch feels like Lord's without Old Father Time. 'It was always going to come to an end some time,' he told Sportsmail. 'I'll be in and around the game, but just not so much hands on. I'll be not so involved with the actual thing I've been involved with all my life.' The clamour for change after England's winter horror show was always more likely to focus on the batsmen than the bowlers. In 10 innings during the Ashes whitewash, they passed 300 only twice and failed to reach even 180 on six occasions. Something had to give - and, eventually, that something was Gooch. 'When you're getting bowled out in 50 overs, and the side are back in the field quickly, there's a price to pay,' he said. 'That's the reality. We know that. It's fair enough. Day out: Cook and golfer Paul McGinley attend Ladies day at Epsom Racecourse on Friday . 'Peter Moores and Alastair are quite entitled to make the changes. Alastair has had tough decisions to make. In a way that's good for him because that's what he had to do. He can't stand on sentiment. 'Would I like to have left in that way? No. It was absolutely not in my plan to be sacked by England. But I wish them and Alastair all the best. He's been a good friend, and we've had a very good relationship down the years. It was going to come to an end, obviously, at some stage - probably just a fraction prematurely from my point of view. But these things happen. It doesn't mean you don't care about them and want them to do well.' Chief among Gooch's hopes for England's new era - an era which begins with Cook's leadership skills squarely under the microscope after the 5-0 hammering in Australia - is a bolder approach. 'I was brought up under the captaincy of Keith Fletcher and Mike Brearley to play the pressing game,' he said. 'As a leader you have to try to make things happen. 'I was never schooled in letting the game unfold and seeing if you come out on top. You've got to take the initiative. You've got to press.' Hands on: England head coach Peter Moores chats with Eoin Morgan . Is that something Cook should have picked up after going head to head against Australia captain Michael Clarke during the back-to-back Ashes series? 'We have to look at the way we're going to win games,' said Gooch. 'You have to create the opportunity to win, and fight for it. You've got to push the game forward. That's the only way to play cricket.' Gooch, who was speaking at a Chance to Shine event in south London, believes that philosophy should extend to selection. England's 12-man squad for next week's first Test against Sri Lanka at Lord's was named on Thursday, and there was no room for Jos Buttler whose 74-ball 121 in the one-day series last week prompted many to push him for a Test debut. The selectors went instead for the tried and tested Matt Prior. And, while Gooch agrees with that choice, he had encouraging words for Buttler. 'I would not rule him out as a future keeper,' he said. 'Not that guys like James Foster or Chris Read would let you down at all. We've been too conservative. England have to be bolder.' Departed: Graham Gooch and former England coach Andy Flower . But it's hard to imagine that Gooch will be watching anyone more closely than Cook, his old protégé both at Essex and England, and a disciple of Gooch's near-religious emphasis on the importance of the daddy hundred - scores of 150 or more. 'I've seen him meet and conquer many challenges over the years,' he said. 'But he's in an interesting position now where he's got to kick on. You can' t have more of the same. He's got to take these exciting young players forward. 'He'll need his experienced players to help be leaders in the dressing-room as well. You can't just have one captain. But he's also got to be the guy who sets the tone and demands more from the players. He's entitled to demand more. You're playing for your country. It's the ultimate. You're entitled to demand more to get the best out of them - that's part of the job as captain.' Half an hour with Gooch is enough to convince you that cricket will never leave his bloodstream.

All-rounder Chris Jordan may be a nippy seamer, hard-hitting No 8 and slip fielder, but he is also theembodiment of England’s future and an oblique reminder of their past. Jordan, who is set to win his first Test cap for England against Sri Lanka at Lord’s on Thursday, was born in Barbados in 1988 — the summer in which two of his heroes, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, took 34 wickets as West Indies beat England 4-0. Now, the player, who was welcomed to English cricket when he won a scholarship at Dulwich College in 2006, will be given the chance to dish out Caribbean-style chin music against batsmen reared on the soporific pitches of Asia. Debut: Chris Jordan is set to earn his first Test cap for England against Sri Lanka at Lord's on Thursday . Unmoved: Jordan says the 'bit of chat' between cricketers on the pitch 'doesn't faze' him . On the two paciest pitches in the recent one-day series, which Sri Lanka won 3-2, Jordan claimed 3-25 at The Oval and 5-29 at Old Trafford. England won both games and Jordan is more than happy to repeat the dose in the two-Test series at Lord’s and Headingley. ‘If the bounce is there to exploit, we’ll try to do so,’ he said. ‘It’s something we’ve spoken about, and it worked quite well.’ Jordan’s performance at The Oval, where he tested out Sri Lanka’s lower order in particular, earned him an earful in the next game at Chester-le-Street, where England were skittled for 99. ‘As I came out to bat, I got surrounded and there was a bit of chat,’ he said. ‘But that stuff doesn’t faze me.’ Aged just 25, Jordan already has a self sufficient streak that bodes well. As a youngster watching West Indies play at Bridgetown’s Kensington Oval, he would provide throwdowns after stumps for Brian Lara. And when Bill Athey, the former England opener who lured him to Dulwich, came calling, the teenage Jordan’s response was to look up the school on the web to see what lay in store. He was impressed. ‘I was always ambitious and open-minded,’ he said. ‘I relished the opportunity to further my game.’ Sussex signed him ahead of the 2013 season, and he has never looked back as he set about reaching a series of targets. ‘I want to develop my fielding, my slip catching, my range-hitting, my death bowling,’ he added. Sri Lanka be warned. Familiar: England cricket fans will be hoping to see Jordan celebrating again against Sri Lanka .

Michael Carrick could be forgiven for thinking that Manchester United’s season cost him his place at the World Cup — and there is some justification for that belief. As someone involved in that extraordinary campaign, it’s safe to say it was a rollercoaster ride, and draining emotionally. It’s a real shame for Carrick that one  side-effect was losing his place on the greatest stage. He was downbeat about the news — and I know because I was with him when he got the call to say he wasn’t going. Nemanja Vidic and I took him to the pub for a consolation drink. Scroll down for videos... Left behind: Michael Carrick (L) was not selected for England's World Cup squad in Brazil . Cost of failure: Michael Carrick paid the price for a poor season at Manchester United, says Rio Ferdinand . If anything, I was even more shocked than Carrick. If there is an obvious replacement then fine, but there isn’t. He’s been under-appreciated in an England shirt and never had the respect he deserves. He’s the best holding midfielder England have. He knows the role. He’s not constantly wondering whether to stay or go because he plays it, week in, week out. But he’s not been utilised by the national managers, not given that run of eight, nine, 10 games over a sustained period to settle. Unsettled is perhaps a good description of our club season. We weren’t playing well and those fluctuations in consistency take their toll. United fans rightly want success and it gets stressful for everyone when it’s elusive. Year from hell: Manchester United suffered their worst ever season in the Premier League, finishing seventh . Shock to the system: Rio Ferdinand (L) admits the uncertainty surrounding David Moyes contributed to their woes . The pressure mounted. Questions started to be asked about David Moyes’s future as manager. That adds pressure all round. Who might he buy? Who would play? Was he even staying, or going? We didn’t know. He didn’t know. After 27 years of Sir Alex Ferguson, that uncertainty was a shock at United. It was always going to be a tough season. Moyes replacing Sir Alex has to be the toughest gig in football. You have to give Moyes some credit for his efforts but it was a tough year — and ultimately Carrick paid. I hope England don’t suffer now, too.","Michael Carrick was not selected for England's World Cup squad .

A community outraged over the death of a 14-year-old skateboarder who was struck by a car only 100 metres from his home on Saturday say it's the second time in just six months a child's been killed on the suburb's 'dangerous and deadly' roads. The tragic death of Ethan Stephenson, from Russell Island in Queensland, comes only months after nine-year-old Tyson Archbold died after he was hit by a car on nearby Canaipa Road in December. A student at Victoria Point State High, Ethan died at the scene of the crash when the driver of a four-wheel-drive ran into him on the island's main road, Centre Road, at about 5.20 pm. Police claim the driver of the red Land Cruiser had been drinking, however no charges have been laid. Scroll down for video . Ethan Stephenson, from Russell Island in Queenland, passed away on Saturday after being hit by a car only 100 metres from his home . Ethan's death has sparked outrage at the local council amongst residents, who are still also mourning the death of nine-year-old Tyson Archbold, who died after being hit by a car at the side of Canaipa Road in December of last year. Blaming the lack of a footpath and street lights on the main thoroughfare for causing the accidents, they have continued a campaign which began back in 2011. The grandmother of Tyson, Ingrid Selier, told the MailOnline she does have concerns regarding road safety in the area, but also suggested drivers involved in these incidents should be tested for drugs, not just alcohol. Ms Selier added that there needs to be a greater focus on road safety education. 'I believe that kids should have far more education on road safety, the law changed [so] that police can charge a youngster under 10 for not wearing safety gear, which currently police cannot do.' 'My daughter will be campaigning against the above concerns not footpaths.' Though she also voiced her concerns about the safety of the island's main road. 'Centre Road is a health hazard. I used to ride a bicycle down that street and always feared for my life as the road is very narrow. 'If a car passes a bike it has to almost cross onto the other side and hope no car comes from that direction. 'The times when I had to go into the gutter or off road into slippery gravel were numerous and women walk down that road on the road with prams.' Tyson Archbold was tragically killed on the same small island on a nearby road in December of last year . Russell Island is a small community located 40 kilometres south-east of Brisbane . Russell Island is a small island which is about eight kilometres long and just under three kilometres wide, located off the Queensland coast 40 kilometres south-east of Brisbane. The mother of one of Ethan’s close friends and a resident of Russell Island, Kate Hill, has taken the lead in the protests by sharing video footage of the condition of the island’s footpaths. 'I just promised my 14 year old son he will not lose another mate on this island because council do not provide basic infrastructure nor do they care,' Mrs Hill wrote. 'All we are asking for is a footpath and lighting on the main road that I believe is approximately 8.5km long.' The video shows an unknown person walking along a narrow path on the island's main road, which only extends up to two kilometres, according to Mrs Hill. The short path is boarded by dense shrubs on one side and the edge of a busy road on the other. The rest of the way, residents are forced to walk along the road. 'Ethan was a beautiful boy and he died way too soon from that something that could have been avoided,' Mrs Hill said. 'He was actually seen on that footpath and then was forced onto that road again to get home because there's nowhere to walk. Russell Island resident and the mother of one of Ethan's friends, is petitioning her local council for changes to be made . Ethan's death has sparked outrage amongst community members who blame a lack of basic pedestrian infrastructure for his death . 'We have a main road with very little lighting and no footpath. It's utterly and completely ridiculous. 'What we're trying to do is get as many people to write to councilors, our MP and our mayor and say this is inadequate. This is a basic duty of care, not just to our children but a lot of our population are elderly who have mobility scooters and they’re on the road because there’s no footpaths  - in the dark.' Another Russel Island resident, Melissa Warne, said infrastructure for the neighboring Macleay Island, would also be included in their demands. Residents have so far bombarded their local council with letters and plan to meet with their mayor in the coming week for discussions. Ethan's devastated high school friends have also planned to write tributes to the 14-year-old on a pole at their school. Tyson's death at the end of 2013 also sparked outrage from the small close-knit community, and friends and family were further upset when council apparently removed his road-side memorial from the place he was struck. The Forensic Crash Unit are still investigating both incidents, and charges are yet to be laid over either incident.

Jenny Dakin, 27, was with her mother Sharon, 51, and her partner Tyrone Allonby, 42, when she began to have contractions every five minutes in the cab. Jenny, a mother-of-two from Bolton, knew the baby wanted to come and had no choice but to push while on the back seat of the car. Speedy arrival: Sharon had to help deliver her granddaughter in the back of a taxi. Natasha weighed 6lb 4oz and is doing well after her dramatic entrance into the world . Luckily, cleaning supervisor Sharon was on hand to save the day as she delivered the baby near Burnden Retail Park. Grandmother-of-five Sharon explains how the drama unfolded: 'We phoned for a taxi at 11.24 and it arrived around 15 minutes later but the baby was born by 11.46. 'Jenny told me she needed to push and I said, ""don't be silly"". I looked over at her and the next thing I could see the baby's head so I know she was going to have to give birth there and then. 'I practically threw my phone at the taxi driver and shouted at him to ring 999 for help.' Sharon said the driver was as shocked as they were about the baby's speedy arrival. 'He jokingly said not to make a mess in the car but I could see he was absolutely terrified. He could barely speak and his face went very pale,' she recalls. Proud parents: Jenny introduces Natasha to her big brother, left, while Tyrone, right, also had to help deliver his daughter . 'We asked him to pull over but he said, ""I have to do my job and get you to hospital"".' Meanwhile, she said her daughter tried to remain calm. 'Jenny had her legs up on the passenger window but she just seemed determined to do what was best for the baby.' Sharon admitted that her 'basic instincts' kicked in and she successfully helped deliver her granddaughter, Natasha-Ann, who weighed 6lb 4oz and is now doing well at the Royal Bolton Hospital.

'It was all a big shock but my basic instincts kicked in and I did what I had to do. There was a huge round of applause for me when I got to the hospital and it only hit me later that I had delivered a grandchild.' The family arrived at the Royal Bolton Hospital shortly after the delivery where medics in the maternity unit took over. Tyrone, who also helped deliver his daughter, said: 'We are absolutely delighted and relieved that everything went well. I am only just coming back down to earth if I'm honest - I don't think it has fully sunk in yet. It was an amazing experience.' Jenny, who is due to leave hospital with and  Natasha today, thanked her mother for 'heroically' stepping in. She said: 'My mum did an amazing job. I never expected it to happen so quickly, but the main thing is that Natasha is okay.' Owner of Metro Taxis, Nick Astley, said: 'I've been in the taxi business for 30 years and I've never seen anything like this.

"By . Kate Lyons . It is miles away from his life as a surgeon in the suburbs of Brisbane, but Neil Wetzig is about to return to his second home - a hospital in the very poor and very dangerous city of Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It will be the 11th trip for the 58-year-old and the 10th for his wife Gwen, 60, to the hospital, which is located in the most dangerous part of the country, where rebel fighting is common and some of the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide live in the jungle. The couple, who have two children and four grandchildren began packing up their lives for a month each year and travelling to the troubled nation, after first visiting the hospital in 2003. '[A Congolese doctor] took me around the hospital and I could see the potential, and I thought we’ve got the expertise, we could do something about this,' said Neil. Neil and Gwen Wetzig have been travelling to the Democratic Republic of Congo since 2003, where they work at a local hospital treating locals and training doctors . Neil has treated child soldiers and other victims of the civil war, which has been raging in the country since 1996 . Over the years the couple have been shelled, treated wounded soldiers who were involved in a gunfight outside the hospital, been forced to evacuate to Rwanda, and treated local people who have suffered in ways that defy comprehension. Once Neil, a Brisbane father-of-two and grandfather-of-four, was at the hospital when someone came in who had been shot in a skirmish in the civil war. 'I had my passport in the top pocket of my theatre scrubs…. I operated on him and I got blood on it,' he said. 'My passport was stained with Congolese blood,' he said, a somewhat apt summary of his commitment to the troubled country. The Democratic Republic of Congo has suffered through civil war since 1998 and since then an estimated six million people have been killed in the conflict, most through dispossession and malnourishment, rather than through direct fighting. The horrors are particularly acute for women and the DR Congo is currently thought to have the highest rate of sexual violence of any country in the world. When Neil arrived at the hospital, it was run-down and under-resourced and he saw the opportunity to train up local doctors and make a difference in the lives of the local Congolese . A very common condition that Neil treats at the hospital is goitres, which are caused by thyroid issues, most commonly resulting from an iodine deficiency . Neil says that some of the things he has seen – some of which are too graphic to mention here – make him believe 'it is an evil place'. 'Last year I was introduced to this young lad, 13 or 14, he was one of the soldiers [in the war]. 'Because our hospital has the mandate of treating everyone who comes to them, in one ward we had child soldiers and the Congolese army fighting them. 'We've seen some pretty horrific things done to women, it's a key centre for fistula repair, which is due in many cases to sexual assault.' But it is also a place that has captured his heart and that of his wife, and prompts them to make return visits each year, taking teams of Australian doctors and nurses to train local hospital staff and provide medical care to locals. Each time the couple visit, and Neil is due to make his 11th visit this year, they pay their own way, which costs about $6,000 for each of them. They also foot the bill for in-patient care at the hospital while they are there, so as not to exhaust the budget of the hospital, which is often inundated with patients requiring surgery when they know that the Australian doctors are coming. One of the great challenges of being in the DR Congo, says Neil, is coming up with innovative ways of treating people in less than optimal conditions. 'You don't have the resources, you've got to improvise and use what you have,' he said. On his first visit, Neil found a hospital in the process of being rebuilt after being destroyed in a volcano blast in 2002. It had limited equipment and what equipment it did have would often blow due to power surges, as well as having no running water. Scrubbing up before surgeries required an assistant to hold up a bucket of water with holes poked in the side to create a flow of clean water for Neil to use. 'Our Congolese daughter': Mila arrived at the hospital after attempting suicide in 2009. After an operation by Neil she is now flourishing and has been adopted and financially supported by Neil and Gwen . Neil and Gwen paid Mila to study accountancy and she now works at the hospital managing the hospital's finances . The HEAL Africa Hospital was shelled a few years ago as part of the civil war, while Neil and Gwen were working there . Once, a three-year-old boy named Kuba was brought in to the hospital after swallowing a metal object, which got stuck in his airway, went septic and developed into pneumonia. 'We knew in Australia we would have the equipment to get that out, but we didn't in the Congo. We worked with the Congolese staff and said, “What have you got?” and used an endoscope, we eventually got this little metal stud out of his airway. 'Who knows what this three-year-old will go on to be? He could be a great leader in the country.' For Gwen, it is the relationships that keep her passion for the work alive, despite the difficult and dangerous conditions. 'We go back every year and they truly value that, that's a sign to them that we do really care,' she said. The Nyirangongo Volcano destroyed the HEAL Africa hospital in 2002 as well as half of Goma . Kuba, three, almost died after he swallowed a metal stud that got stuck in his throat (X-ray right). Neil performed a makeshift surgery on the boy and saved his life . One of the most enduring relationships the couple has is with a young woman named Mila, who was brought to the hospital in 2009 after she tried to take her own life by swallowing battery acid. The incident resulted in the narrowing of her oesophagus, making it impossible for her to eat. In Australia, this would be treated by surgery that involved opening her chest, which was not an option at the under-resourced Congolese hospital. 'We had to work out a way to do the surgery in our context,' said Neil, who was able to put a piece of her large intestine up through her chest, a surgery he had never performed before, allowing her to eat normally once again. 'She asked us could she be our Congolese daughter,' said Neil. Since then he and Gwen were able to support Mila through her accountancy training and she now works at the hospital managing its finances. Mila's income is sent back to her family and she has funded her sister's university studies. 'Five or six hours of stress in the operating theatre for me and it has made such a large difference in her life,' said Neil. The Wetzigs, who are both Christians and are motivated by their faith to continue their work, have funded the training of many doctors and nurses who work at the Goma Hospital. In 2010 they started AusHEAL a not-for-profit organisation to help people make contributions to the hospital and the work the Wetzigs do there. They are currently raising funds to provide scholarships to Congolese doctors to further their training and to purchase monitoring equipment for the hospital. The hospital is located in the north-east of the country, which is plagued by rebel fighting . The fighting in the DR Congo has claimed the lives of up to six million people since it began in 1996 .","Neil Wetzig is a 58-year-old surgeon from Brisbane .

"By . Bianca London . A  pair of love-struck pet pugs got married in a £2,000 ceremony, complete with wedding dresses, tuxedos and a 'best dog'. Bride Betty dazzled in a £100 custom-made white dress while Albert wore a smart tux topped off with a trilby and a bow tie. Wedding rings were exchanged and attached to collars in the moving ceremony. Happily ever after: (L-R) Julian Reynolds with Clive Phillips and Christine Reynolds with bride Betty and groom Albert at their pug wedding . The pair fell head over tail in love after meeting as puppies and soon became inseparable. They even had a joint stag and hen party at their local pub - where Betty wore the traditional 'L' plate and bunny ears to dance the night away with her doggie pals. Their owner Christine Reynolds, 52, a dog groomer from Milton Keynes, said: 'I know what people must think. 'I am barking mad, but I know my pugs are in love so getting them married seem like the right thing to do. 'Now that they are married they can sleep in the same bed and hopefully have some puppies together.' Christine bought Albert, now two, in 2012 to keep her elderly cocker spaniel, Hester, company. One year later she bought Betty, now aged one, and the pair hit it off instantly. You may now lick the bride! A pug couple have tied the knot in a lavish £2,000 ceremony in front of 30 guests .

Incredibly, a week before the big day, the pug couple had a hen night and stag do at the local pub. Albert wore a suit, and Betty wore an L plate and bunny ears as she danced the night away with her doggy pals while drinking dog-friendly cocktails. Christine said: 'Both dogs had a great time. It was their last night of single life. Luckily neither dog was unfaithful, and they were both happy to snuggle up together at the end of the night in their beds.' Leading up to the big day, Betty had her nails done and her fur trimmed. Dressed in a white gown with matching wedding lingerie, a diamante-studded veil and holding a bouquet of flowers in her mouth, Betty walked down the aisle to the traditional wedding march.

"By . Sadie Nicholas . Swallowing . balloons could be the solution for serial yo-yo dieters who are . reluctant to undergo more extreme weight-loss surgery. A new treatment . takes the form of two salt-water-filled spherical 'bubbles' that sit in . the stomach, giving the sensation of fullness, even when nothing is . eaten. The procedure involves no incisions or stitches, leaves no scars and is completely reversible. Gastric . balloons, as they are known, have been used for more than a decade in . Europe. But many more determined over-eaters say they still feel hunger . pangs, despite undergoing the procedure, which costs upward of £3,000. There is also the concern that after the implant is removed, the modest . weight loss is regained. Claire Cope has learned healthier eating habits, and pictured right, before she had the balloon fitted in 2010 . The latest device is said to fit the . curved shape of the stomach and  the manufacturers believe it has the . potential for greater weight loss, as the double balloon occupies 60 per . cent more space in the stomach than the traditional types. By the . time it is removed after six months - the period the manufacturer . guarantees that the balloon, which is made of medical-grade silicon, . will remain safely intact - the average user has lost two stone.Studies . have indicated that intra-gastric balloons can lead to clinically . meaningful weight loss of up to 40 per cent of excess weight after six . months. A US trial on 30 patients using the new ReShape Duo balloon . concluded that the weight loss in those who had the balloon was greater . than those who had diet and exercise counselling alone. Another benefit . was greatly improved gastrointestinal tolerance compared with those who . used a single balloon device. Costing £5,500, the procedure takes . just half an hour, during which the patient is sedated - but not with a . general anaesthetic - so they stay reasonably aware of their . surroundings but don't feel pain.A fine flexible tube with an . attached camera called an endoscope is inserted into the patient's . stomach via the mouth and is used to guide another tube called a . catheter and the uninflated dual balloon into place. The two parts . are then each filled with 450ml of saline, using a separate tube. This . is about 300ml more than is used to fill an old-style single gastric . balloon. After six months  the device is deflated and removed using a . similar procedure. Patients can go home the same day and the balloon . doesn't change the size or shape of the stomach - it simply ensures the . patient feels full. Costing £5,500, the the new ReShape Duo balloon procedure takes just half an hour . 'This treatment is most suitable for those with a . body mass index [BMI] of 27 to 35,' explains Dr Theodore Ngatchu, who . carries out the procedure at his clinic, 9 Harley Street in London. 'It . must never be used in people with a BMI of less than 27, but it  can be . useful in certain cases where a patient has a BMI of over 35 and needs a . head start with weight loss for medical reasons. 'For example, I've . put a gastric balloon into people who have heart disease and are . awaiting a bypass but need to lose weight in order to have major . surgery.' Side effects include nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps . for a few days as the stomach reacts to having an alien object inside . it. While this would result in early removal of a standard singular . balloon, the sympathetic shape of the new device helps reduce the risk . as the two balloons sit more steadily in the stomach. Dr Ngatchu . warns that ReShape Duo is not suitable for everyone. 'Those with a . hiatus hernia cannot have the balloon inserted as it can cause them to . have respiratory problems,' he says. 'Similarly, if you've previously . had gastric - that's stomach, not abdominal - surgery it's not possible . to have the balloon because there's an increased risk of rupture due to . weak scar tissue in the stomach and the combined pressure of the balloon . and the stomach muscles.' Claire Cope became one of the first people . in the UK to undergo the procedure in June 2012. She has since lost . more than two stone. Back then, she was an overweight driving . instructor with a BMI of 30 that rendered her clinically obese and left . her with pain in her feet  and ankles. With the device in her . stomach, she dropped from 13st 7lb to 11st 3lb and from a dress size 18 . to a 12. 'I'm 5ft 7in and until a decade ago I'd consistently been a . size 10 and weighed 9st 7lb,' says Claire, 40, who is now a retail . manager and lives in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, with RAF husband Jeff, . 55. They have two children Tom, 18,  and Gemma, 20. 'But then I turned . 30, stopped smoking, swapped cigarettes for biscuits and hunks of bread . spread with butter, and became a driving instructor. As my weight . soared, I was in thrall to every faddy diet going. I tried everything . but didn't lose a stitch.' Claire had the balloon inserted one . morning and was home by late afternoon. Three days later she was back at . work. Dieticians supervise the patient's progress for 12 months, . advising them on sensible eating and portion control. Claire says: . 'I continued to eat the same foods I have for the past 30 years but my . portion sizes were dramatically different and by the second week my . hunger had waned. 'I could no longer polish off a 12in pizza - two . slices were plenty. One potato with my Sunday roast and veg was enough . where once I'd eat a pile of them. The weight dropped off at a rate of . about 2lb a week.' Having lost 2st 4lb, Claire was understandably . anxious that she might start over-eating again once the balloon was . removed. Although she did gain 4lb, she has maintained her weight at . 11st 7lb for the past  12 months. Up to 80 per cent of people regain some weight within a year of having an intra-gastric balloon removed. Claire . admits: 'I was relieved when the hunger pangs I expected to kick in . didn't. The eating habits I learned during those six months with the . balloon remain intact. I still stop at a few squares of chocolate rather . than demolishing a whole bar.' Dr Ngatchu adds: 'It's important  to continue with sensible eating and regular exercise once the balloon has been removed.'

"By . Paul Donnelley . A five-year-old boy is following in his twin brother's footsteps after undergoing surgery to ‘put the magic back’ into his legs – enabling him to walk. Jacob Cook wanted to chase after his identical sibling Jordan but was unable even to sit up after being diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was just six-months old. The boys were born prematurely at 28 weeks in December 2008 and the differences between them became apparent when Jacob failed to achieve targets expected of babies. Boisterous boys: Twins Jordan and Jacob Cook, 5, seem like any normal pair of boys but Jacob was diagnosed with cerebral palsy on the day he was discharged from hospital, unable to walk . The son has got his hat on: Jacob in the intensive care unit as a premature baby a few hours after his birth in December 2008 . His condition was managed with physiotherapy until his parents raised £65,000 to go to America for an operation which is not routinely available on the NHS. Now Jacob can walk with the aid of a frame and is finally playing games with his brother. The boys’ mother, Lucy Fletcher of Summertown, Oxford, said: ‘When they were born, they weighed less than 6lb between them. ‘They were rushed to special care but considering how early they were they were quite healthy for their age. ‘We were in hospital with them for two months and on the day we left they gave both Jacob and Jordan routine brain scans. Mother's pride: Lucy Fletcher and son Jacob in hospital. Jacob and Jordan were born prematurely at 28 weeks . The Cook family: father Scott, Jordan, Jacob and their mother Lucy Fletcher at home in Oxford . Jacob wanted to be able to play like his brother but his condition prevented him until his parents raised £65,000 to send him to the US for an operation that is not readily available on the NHS . ‘They found Jacob had two cysts on his brain. We had made it and somehow they had both survived, so it was a huge blow.’ Doctors monitored Jacob's condition and despite initially making good process, his development slowed. Although his eyes were tracking correctly and he'd learned to roll over like his brother Jordan, he was soon flagging behind. Further tests revealed Jacob was suffering from cerebral palsy - an incurable condition that causes mobility and breathing difficulties. Lucy, 26, said: ‘Jacob was around six-months-old and he couldn't sit up. That's when he started missing the milestones. Jacob Cook riding his bike near his home in Oxford. Jacob was diagnosed with cerebral palsy on the day he was discharged from hospital, unable to walk . Jacob Cook, red t-shirt, and Jordan in a green t-shirt gardening on the decking in their home in Oxford, two months ago . ‘We got the diagnosis that it was cerebral palsy. I was a bit in denial as I wanted to believe everything was fine. ‘When I look back at pictures now, I can see his hands are always tight but as a first-time mum, I didn't know the difference.’ As Jacob and Jordan grew up, Jacob's cognitive abilities matched his brother's yet they were unable to run around and play together. Doctors managed his condition with regular physiotherapy until an operation became available in the US to help him walk.

Jacob Cook at a Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy party in March this year for all families who have had, or are going for the operation . The Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy procedure sees surgeons cut the nerves in the spinal cord that are sending the wrong messages to the legs, in turn strengthening Jacob's legs. His father Scott Cook, 32, said: ‘He's always been cognitively fine so his speech developed normally but he never learned to crawl or walk. He's very behind. ‘Jordan has brought him on more than anyone because he's always got his little playmate and he's always there helping him to do his physio.

Jacob was diagnosed with cerebral palsy on the day he was discharged from hospital . ‘We had to . raise £65,000 - £45,000 was for surgery and then we needed money for . rehab and physiotherapy following the operation.’ The family travelled to St Louis in Missouri, US, in June 2013, where Jacob's surgery was successful. ‘The care was brilliant,’ said Lucy. ‘We were looked after really well. ‘Jacob didn't fully understand what would happen but we told him that the doctor would put magic back into his legs to try to make them work. ‘We want him to be aware of what was happening, but we didn't want him to be disappointed if it didn't work. ‘He has asked the question 'why am I not like Jordan?' but I just explain that he was poorly as a baby. We have brought him up to believe he's got to get on with it.’ Since the surgery last year, both Jacob and Jordan have started school, and despite Jacob needing daily physiotherapy, they can now both walk around together as brothers. ‘He's never really been jealous of Jordan, which is nice,’ Lucy added. ‘He's been good at getting Jordan to help him and now he's at school he gets all the girls to get him what he wants too. ‘It's been very busy, and it's hard work, but he's definitely made a lot of progress. ‘He once had no mobility but he's worked really hard at his physio and he never complains and he gets on just fine.’","Jacob and Jordan Cook born prematurely at 28 weeks in December 2008 .

"By . Sophie Borland . Hospitals could be given more money from the Government if patients are happy with their care, according to the new NHS chief. Simon Stevens said in future, a higher proportion of funding given to trusts would be based on patients’ views – as well as the quality of care given and the prevention of disease. In a speech to the NHS Confederation Conference in Liverpool, he promised ‘far reaching changes in how hospitals and community services are funded’. A higher proportion of hospital and care funding will be given to trusts based on patient's views, the NHS chief said today (library image) At present, hospitals are given more money from the NHS if they reach certain targets for providing good care – for example preventing falls and bedsores, and offering patients screening for dementia. But Mr Stevens said he wanted a higher proportion of funding to be tied to patients’ overall experience of their time in hospital. It is not yet clear if this would be assessed through surveys such as the recently introduced ‘friends and family test’. Mr Stevens, 48, who is married with two children, took over from the beleaguered Sir David Nicholson in April. Last week – in his first interview since taking up the position – he called for small district hospitals to play a greater role  in caring for the elderly closer to home. Speaking yesterday, he said: ‘We need to take a new look at incentives. Simon Stevens, pictured, promised 'far reaching' changes to funding - adding quality of care and prevention of disease would also be taken in to account . ‘NHS England is currently expecting to spend up to £2.7billion on various performance incentives for community and acute providers [hospitals]. ‘We will be undertaking a hardnosed review of how these various schemes are structured, and what we for the money. ‘More broadly, across all NHS-funded services, we’ll be pushing for a steadily increasing proportion of payments tied to performance, quality and outcomes.’ He also told delegates that the NHS should be at the ‘forefront’ of treating patients based on their genetic make-up.","Funding to be given to trusts based on patients' views, NHS chief says .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Brian Davies, 53, is one of eight thalidomide victims who have launched legal action against the manufacturers of the drug, 50 years after the birth-defect epidemic . Thalidomide victims have launched a new legal bid 50 years after the controversial morning sickness drug was prescribed to their mothers. Papers have been filed at the High Court on behalf of eight people whose mothers took the anti-morning sickness drug when pregnant in the late 1950s and early 1960s, law firm Slater & Gordon said. They are seeking compensation from the drug's German maker Grunenthal and Diageo, which now owns the drug's UK distributor, Distillers Co (Biochemicals). Among those taking action is 53-year-old Brian Davies, from Gwynedd in Wales. He was born with severe defects of both legs, his left ends in a stump while his right leg has just two toes. The HGV driver says his condition has left him in constant pain, which is gradually getting worse as his legs and skin weaken over time. Despite being born with a number of known thalidomide symptoms at the peak of the birth-defect epidemic, Mr Davies has never received compensation. The . married father-of-two said: 'I’m very angry at the way I, and others . like me, have been treated over the years. I have never really been . given any support yet my disabilities have meant my life has been very . difficult. 'I’m not . the sort of person to let life get the better of me so I have made the . most of it, I go to work and I am proud that I provide for my family. But it has been hard. 'I . have to wear a prosthetic leg and suffer constant pain in my legs, hips . and back. I worry that the pain will keep getting worse and stop me . from doing my job.' Mr . Davies was told in the 1970s that because his condition only affected . his legs and not his arms that he would not be recognised as a . thalidomide survivor. He . said: 'I know I am luckier than many as I still have my arms but that . does not mean I should have been ignored. It’s a disgrace that so many . people have been denied justice in this way. 'In . my eyes it was simply the drug companies looking to save money and . ignoring the duty of care they have to people whose lives they have . ruined. 'Ever since I . was a child I have missed out on everyday pleasures, like playing . football with friends or swimming, things other people take for granted. 'Everyday . I am in pain and every day is a struggle. I hope that now we finally . get the justice that we have been demanding for so many years.' Between 1958 and 1961 the drug Thalidomide was used by expectant mothers to control symptoms of morning sickness. Between 1958 and 1961 the drug Thalidomide was used by expectant mothers to control symptoms of morning sickness . It was originally prescribed as a 'wonder drug' for morning sickness, headaches, coughs, insomnia and colds. Thalidomide babies often suffered missing or deformed limbs and extreme shortening of arms and legs, but the drug also caused malformations of the eyes and ears, genitals, heart, kidneys and digestive tract. Thalidomide was developed by German pharmaceutical company Chemie Grunenthal. It was first launched in October 1957 in Germany and in the UK in 1958 under the name Distaval. Between 1958 and 1961 the drug was used by expectant mothers to control the symtoms of morning sickness. As many as 10,000 babies across the world were born with deformities. Babies were born with missing or deformed limbs, extreme shortening of arms and legs. The drug was also found to cause malformations of the eyes and ears, genitals, heart, kidneys and digestive tract. Manufacturers withdrew the drug in November 1961 after reports of what amounted to an epidemic of births and malformed babies. UK marketeres Distillers (Biochemicals) Ltd, followed suit the following month. A UK Government warning was issued in May 1962. Source: The Thalidomide Society and The Thalidomide Trust . By the time safety fears led to it being pulled from sale thousands of babies worldwide had been affected. According to survivors' charity Thalidomide UK there are still 455 victims in the UK but it is estimated around 40% of victims died before their first birthday. In 2012 Grunenthal apologised for the drug for the first time, with chief executive Harald Stock saying 'we have been silent and we are very sorry for that'. Last year Diageo paid 89 million Australian dollars (£49 million) to just over 100 further Australians damaged by the drug, in a deal which led to a claim against Grunenthal being discontinued. Slater & Gordon lawyer Fraser Whitehead said: 'Grunenthal and Distillers have always claimed that the thalidomide disaster was an unavoidable tragedy and that they did everything expected of drug companies at the time. 'Our research has demonstrated that is nonsense. 'Both companies knew their drug was causing severe nerve damage and both were explicitly warned of the possibility thalidomide might cause severe malformations. 'Yet the drug was left on the market for many months afterwards. 'It is time those responsible are finally held to account for the mistakes of the past. Grunenthal, in particular, has done little make good the immense damage that it has done and it has to accept responsibility for those affected in the UK.' A Grunenthal spokesman said: 'Grunenthal confirms that the company received an email from Slater & Gordon today, announcing that they have been instructed to bring proceedings on behalf of eight claimants. 'Grunenthal has not seen the claims to which they refer and is, therefore, not in a position to comment further.'","Eight Thalidomide victims are seeking compensation from drug makers .

"By . Emma Innes . A diabetic mother whose weight ballooned during pregnancy put her life at risk when she stopped taking her insulin medication in a bid to slim down. Hayleigh Juggins ignored doctors' advice, halting the treatment for her diabetes having blamed the hormone for her weight reaching 19st. The 20-year-old was diagnosed with type one diabetes when she was 15 years old. When she fell pregnant three years later, she began taking high doses of insulin, which she claims led to rapid weight gain. Hayleigh Juggins, 20, is diabetic but she stopped taking insulin after the birth of her daughter, Angel. She hoped this would help her to lose weight after she ballooned to 19st . By the time she gave birth when she was 19, she weighed 19st and was wearing size 22 clothes. Horrified, she decided to disregard doctors’ instructions to take insulin after each meal and subsequently found herself shrinking. Stable today at 10st 10lb, Miss Juggins says that despite being pleased at gaining her dream figure, she will never again risk serious damage to her health by going against medical advice. She said: ‘There was a war within me - on the one hand I was distraught at having gained so much weight during pregnancy, but on the other I knew what I was doing was bad for me. Indeed, experts stress that skipping insulin can have devastating consequences, including brain damage and death. Libby . Dowling, Diabetes UK Clinical Advisor, said: 'Skipping  insulin to lose . weight is extremely dangerous. This is because if you haven't got enough . insulin in your body your blood glucose will get too high, which can . lead to devastating health complications. 'In . the short term it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, an extremely . dangerous condition that requires immediate medical attention and . treatment in hospital, and can even be fatal. And in the long term . skipping insulin can lead to complications such as blindness, stroke and . amputations. 'It . is crucial that people who are omitting their insulin are given rapid . access to psychological support as they are risking their health and . even their life.' Ms Juggings continued: ‘When I was told that I might lose my sight if I didn’t take the proper dosages of insulin, I knew I had to start looking after myself again. I wanted to see my little girl grow up.’ Miss Juggins dropped from 19st (left) to 10st 10lbs (right) after she stopped taking her insulin . Weight gain is a common side effect for people who take insulin. This . is because insulin allows glucose to enter the cells and if a person . eats more calories than they need to maintain a healthy weight, the . cells will get more glucose than they need. Glucose that is not used by the cells will accumulate as fat. However, . it is perfectly possible for most diabetics to maintain a healthy . weight while taking insulin if they are active and watch what they eat. If a person who has been told to take insulin does not do so, they risk a whole range of complications. This is because having high glucose levels in the body can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs. Prolonged . spells of high blood sugar levels can cause heart disease, strokes, . blindness, kidney disease, foot ulcers, sexual dysfunction and even . result in amputations. Skipping insulin can in severe cases, lead to brain damage or death. Source: Mayo Clinic and NHS Choices . Miss Juggins, a student, struggled with weight gain during her early years, eventually reaching size 22 by the time she was 14. She said: . ‘I had a few family problems at home, so I over ate. I relied on sugary . things, like cake and sweets, to make me feel better. ‘I . spent my pocket money on chocolate and snacks and waited until everyone . in the house had gone to bed before I took myself to my room and ate . the whole stash.’ When she was 15, she began mysteriously losing weight. She said: . ‘I had recently been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was in . counselling. 'People assumed I was losing weight because I was happier . and less dependent on comfort eating.’ Shortly afterwards she was shocked to be diagnosed with type one diabetes. She . said: ‘I kept asking for glasses of water because I was so thirsty. A . friend’s mother was a nurse and said it was a sign of diabetes. 'Not long . after I collapsed on a night out with friends and had to be taken by . ambulance to hospital. ‘I’d . experienced diabetic ketoacidosis, when my body couldn’t absorb sugar . for fuel. In hospital I was completely delirious - I found out later the . doctors told my mum that I could have slipped into a coma.’ Having immediately been diagnosed with diabetes Miss Juggins, of Biggleswade in Bedfordshire, was set on a daily routine of insulin injections which saw her take medicine up to four times a day. She said: ‘I didn’t appreciate the seriousness of my diagnosis at first. I didn’t want to be diabetic and found the change to my routine difficult. ‘I also put on a lot of weight, as a side effect of the insulin, and having been advised to eat a carbohydrate-rich diet. ‘I fell into the habit of taking time off insulin when I felt my weight was getting too high, and I found controlling my weight became a lot easier.’ When, aged 18, she became pregnant with her daughter Angel, now two, she was careful to increase her insulin intake to make sure her health was protected. But shortly after giving birth in May 2012, she realised she had reached 19st and was back to wearing size 22 clothes. Ms Juggins was told by doctors that she was risking blindness by not taking her insulin injections. As a result, she decided to start taking them as she wanted to ensure she would be there for her daughter, Angel . She said: . ‘I hadn’t realised what state I’d allowed my body to get into. I’d more . than doubled my insulin intake, but I didn’t realise it would have such . an effect on my weight.’ Many . patients requiring insulin treatment report weight gain as the anabolic . agent aids cells’ ability to absorb glucose. If more glucose enters the . cells than is used as energy, it accumulates as fat. Miss Juggins said: ‘I decided to continue with one daily dose but discontinued the injections after each meal. ‘The doctors had made it quite clear to me that I was insulin dependent. I knew that choosing not to take it was a life-threatening decision. ‘But I felt much happier about myself. I could feel that my body chemistry wasn’t right, but on the other hand, I was able to relax and felt much more like me as my weight fell away.’ In less than 18 months, Miss Juggins slimmed down to 10st 10lb, and was able to fit into size 10 clothing. But a routine check-up in January this year was enough to shock her back into resuming her proper dosage. She said: ‘I began signs of diabetic retinopathy. Unless I’m very careful from now onwards, there’s a chance I could go blind. Ms Juggins (pictured with friends since her weight loss) says she now realises her health is more important than her weight so she will continue to take her insulin injections . ‘It’s a . relatively simple situation to fix - I’m lucky the complications weren’t . worse. There might be problems in the future that I don’t know about . yet, but when I decided to stop taking the full insulin dose, I didn’t . care. ‘The . eye exam made me think about Angel. If I lost my sight, I wouldn’t be . able to see her grow up. The battle in my head came to end. ‘I wanted to lose weight- but I wanted to see my little girl more.’ Miss Juggins said she feels sympathy for young people who are diagnosed with diabetes and urged them to educate themselves as much as possible about the effects of the condition and treatment. She said: ‘Don’t act like the diagnosis is nothing, like I did. When I was first diagnosed, I felt very alone. I was given all sorts of different leaflets, some of which had very shocking language about how life-changing having diabetes is. It was scary. ‘By asking questions I’ve come to realise that the most important thing is figuring out the best course of action for you. I’m able to control it – it doesn’t control me. ‘Me and Angel are very close. She’s wonderful - very boisterous and energetic. I want to make sure I’m here for her as long as possible.’","Hayleigh Juggins put on weight while pregnant with her daughter, Angel .

"By . Emma Innes . Fizzy drinks contain more harmful sugars than the labels say, new research has warned . Fizzy drinks contain far more harmful sugars than the labels say, a new study has today warned. The drinks, including Coca Cola, Sprite, Dr Pepper and Mountain Dew, contain more fructose than people realise, the research revealed. They contain as much as 50 per cent more fructose than glucose, researchers say. The U.S. team behind the study say the human body was not designed to process this combination of sugars. As a result, they say the drinks can contribute to the development of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and liver disease. This is because unlike glucose, that is converted into energy, fructose is processed by the liver into fat. The study, by the Childhood Obesity Research Centre at Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, examined the ratio of fructose to glucose in 34 popular brands by analysing their chemical composition. The research, published online in the journal Nutrition, found that beverages and juices made with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) all contain 50 per cent more fructose than glucose. Dr Michael Goran said the blend called into question claims that sugar and HFCS are essentially the same. He said: ‘We found what ends up being consumed in these beverages is neither natural sugar nor HFCS, but instead a fructose-intense concoction that could increase one’s risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and liver disease. ‘The human body isn’t designed to process this form of sugar at such high levels. Unlike glucose, which serves as fuel for the body, fructose is processed almost entirely in the liver where it is converted to fat.’ The trade body responsible for HFCS manufacturers, the Corn Refiners Association, argued HFCS is only negligibly different than natural sugar, sucrose, which is made up of equal parts of fructose and glucose. However Dr Goran’s analysis of beverages made with HFCS showed a fructose to glucose ratio of 60:40 - considerably higher than the equal proportions found in sucrose and challenging the industry’s claim that ‘sugar is sugar’. And he argued labelling was inadequate to warn consumers of the fructose content. The research team purchased beverages . based on product popularity and had them analysed for sugar composition . in three different laboratories using three different methods. Researchers say the drinks could contribute to the development of diabetes and heart disease . The results were consistent across the different methods and yielded an average sugar composition of 60 per cent fructose and 40 per cent glucose in beverages made with HFCS. Dr Goran pointed out Americans consume more HFCS per capita than any other nation and consumption has doubled over the last three decades. Diabetes rates have tripled in the same period with much of this increase directly linked to sodas, sports drinks and energy drinks. He said: ‘Given that Americans drink 45 gallons of soda a year, it’s important for us to have a more accurate understanding of what we’re actually drinking, including specific label information on the types of sugars.’ Gavin Partington, British Soft Drinks Association Director General, said: 'HFCS is an ingredient not widely used in the UK and British soft drinks manufacturers rarely use it in their products. 'Health and medical experts state that the body cannot distinguish between fructose naturally present in fruit and vegetables and that which may be added; while the claim that fructose causes obesity or diabetes is advanced by some scientists, it is not the consensus scientific view. 'Today, most experts agree that HFCS and sucrose are so similar that substituting one for the other will have no distinguishable impact on obesity or health.'","The drinks, including Coca Cola, contain more fructose than the labels say .
So, they could contribute to the development of diabetes and heart disease .
This is because fructose, unlike glucose, is processed by the liver and turned into fat - glucose is converted into energy so is less harmful ."

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Scientists have created cyborg sperm that they can control using a simple fridge magnet. Dubbed ‘MagnetoSperm’, the bots have a metal-coated head and a bendable body that is around six times longer than human sperm. Researchers hope their tiny mechanical creations can be used to put together nanoscale products, aid drug delivery and even help improve egg fertilisation. Scroll down for video . The cyborg sperm is made from a strong plastic with a metal coating wrapped around its head using a technique called electron beam evaporation. Using a weak magnetic field, scientists from the Netherlands and Egypt have made the robot ‘swim; forward and steered it towards a fixed point . Like bacteria, sperm use a whip-like ‘flagellum’ to move themselves through liquid. Using a weak magnetic field, scientists from the Netherlands and Egypt have made the robot ‘swim' forward and steered it towards a fixed point. The cyborg sperm is made from a strong plastic with a metal coating wrapped around its head using a technique called electron beam evaporation. When force is produced from a moving electromagnetic field, the metal element is pushed in different directions. In December, the first ever biological robots that are powered by sperm were created by scientists in Germany. Researchers managed to trap single sperm cells inside metal nanotubes and remotely control their direction using magnets . Like MagnetoSperm, these biobots could be used in humans to deliver drugs to a very specific parts of the body or to help fertilise an egg. Oliver Schmidt at the Institute for Integrative Nanosciences in Dresden created magnetic nanotubes that were 50 microns long by 5 to 8 microns in diameter and dropped these into a fluid containing bull sperm. To trap the sperm and stop them from escaping, the tubes were narrower at one end and could be moved using a magnetic field, Professor Schmidt told MailOnline. ‘A sperm-driven micro-bio robot could be used for magnetically guided transport and delivery purposes in biomedical applications,’ said Professor Schmidt. ‘Of course, the vision of using magnetically guided human sperms for assisted fertilisation seems most compelling but is still far from being realised.' The researchers at the University of Twente in the Netherlands and German University in Cairo were able to steer the robot by directing the magnetic field lines. The MagnetoSperm can move along at up to 0.5 body lengths per second, while a human sperm can cover several times its body length in that time. ‘Nature has designed efficient tools for locomotion at micro-scales,’ said Dr Sarthak Misra, an associate professor at the University of Twente. ‘Our microrobots are either inspired from nature or directly use living micro-organisms such as magnetotactic bacteria and sperm cells for complex micro-manipulation and targeted therapy tasks.’ ‘As technology progresses and many products get smaller, it becomes difficult to assemble objects on nano- and micro-scales,’ added Dr Islam Khalil, an assistant professor of the German University in Cairo. ‘MagnetoSperm can be used to manipulate and assemble objects at these scales using an external source of magnetic field to control its motion.’ This isn’t the first time scientists have attempted to create robosperm.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . If you thought Amsterdam was a bike-friendly city, then think again. Each morning, the region’s train stations become swamped with a tide of wheels and frames. And each evening, confused cyclists attempt to pick their way through the mass of metal in an attempt to find their ride in the crowded racks. Now, a Dutch duo has invented a gadget that they claim will make finding bikes easier during the daily commute. Scroll down for video . A Dutch-due has come up with a gadget that they claim will make finding bikes easier during the daily commute. Their device comes in the shape of a GPS bicycle bell which connects to a rider's smartphone to direct them to their bike . The bike bell gadget by Frolic uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect to a user's smartphone. When a cyclist parks their bike and walks away, they break the bluetooth connection to their bike and the app will automatically drop a pin on the map on their phone. This gives the general location of bike using GPS. And with BLE, users can then use their phone to even more precisely locate their bike’s position. In the insanity of these bike parking lots, this may still not be enough. So Frolic have added the ability to remotely ring the bike bell directly from an app on the user's smartphone. Their device comes in the shape of a GPS bicycle bell which connects to a rider’s smartphone to direct them to their bike. It even rings out loud as the rider’s smartphone gets close – letting the owner known exactly where they parked their ride. Andrew Spitz and Ruben van der Vleuten, who are behind the Amsterdam-based design consultancy Frolic, were able to make a fully-functional prototype of their idea in just one day. If you thought Amsterdam was a bike-friendly city, then think again. Each morning, the region's train stations become swamped with a tide of wheels and frames. And each evening, confused cyclists attempt to pick their way through the mass of metal in an attempt to find their ride in the crowded racks . They started with a regular bike bell then removed all the components in the interior. They then added back in custom electronics and 3D-printed parts. The system connects to an iPhone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Walking away after from the bike drops a pin on to the smartphone's map, allowing GPS to guide the rider back. ‘In the insanity of these bike parking lots, this may still not be enough as you often stand right by your bike and have difficulties spotting it,’ the duo write on their website. ‘This is why we added the ability to remotely ring your bell directly from the app. This makes it easy to find your bike using your ears instead of your cluttered sense of sight.’ The system connects to an iPhone via Bluetooth Low Energy and walking away after from the bike drops a pin, allowing GPS to guide the rider back.

Andrew Spitz (pictured) and Ruben van der Vleuten, who are behind the Amsterdam-based design consultancy Frolic, were able to make a fully-functional prototype of their idea in just one day . From the outside, the device looks like an ordinary bike bell making it less likely to be stolen by thieves. ‘It was a challenge to get all the elements working in such a short time - the iPhone App as well as the hardware,’ Mr Spitz told MailOnline. ‘On top of that was the size. It was not easy to cramp all this technology inside the casing of a bell, but we managed to do so and it all functioned very well.’ The device is currently only a prototype and there are no plans to commercialise it. The chaos caused by overflowing bike racks around Dutch train stations is set to get worse, according to a recent report by Netherlands' railway infrastructure company, ProRail. Around half a million people in the Netherlands currently cycle to their local train station each day, amounting to about 40 per cent of all train passengers.

"By . Ben Ince . I cruised through my 20s with a lean physique and - at the very least - a four-pack. But a combination of age, a busy work schedule, a lack of exercise and a new-found love of cheesecake left me staring at 30 with blossoming love handles and an unseemly gut. To make matters worse, my wedding was fast approaching, and the last thing I wanted to do was to let my fiancee down by looking like a slob in front of all our friends and family. I was desperate to turn things around, get back in shape and look my best for our big day. Trainer Rich Phillipps, director of Embody Fitness, was there to offer a solution - but it wouldn’t be easy. Scroll down for video . Shaping up: Men's Fitness deputy editor Ben Ince, 29, went from fat to flat in eight weeks and dropped from 18 per cent body fat to 7 per cent, as well as reducing his waistline by 4 inches. Here, he is pictured (L-R) at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8 . For starters, I always thought my diet was pretty clean - I was wrong. For the first two weeks, Phillipps put me on a high-protein, no-carb diet consisting of a kilo of meat and fish a day, with only green veg, nuts and water to accompany it. This involved planning my food shops and batch-cooking my meals with military precision, and it wasn’t cheap. But once I got used to the idea of food being purely a fuel source, I settled into a manageable - if boring - routine. After the initial no-carb shock, Phillipps began reintroducing them to help me build muscle, allowing binge days of ‘clean’ carbs on the weekends. Formerly plain-seeming foods such as brown rice suddenly became the highlight of my culinary week. Before and after: Ben was desperate to get back in shape and look his best for his wedding day. Trainer Rich Phillipps, director of Embody Fitness, was there to offer a solution . It wasn't easy! By tinkering with the workouts and adding brutal upgrades - such as wearing a 20kg chain around his neck during farmer's walks to strengthen his upper back - Phillipps forced Ben's muscles to grow . The big day: Ben's fiance - who had been amazingly supportive throughout - was thrilled with the results . Meanwhile, I was making progress in the gym. After two weeks of full-body conditioning workouts - designed to improve technique and kick-start my metabolism - I moved on to three-way body part splits, training chest, back and triceps in one session, then shoulders, biceps and legs in another. The workouts combined big compound moves such as the deadlift and bench press with strongman exercises such as sled drags and Viking presses, finishing off with isolation moves including curls and flyes (when you lie on a bench use the pectoral and deltoid muscles to lift the weights inwards). By tinkering with the workouts and adding brutal upgrades - such as wearing a 20kg chain around my neck during farmer’s walks to strengthen my upper back - Phillipps forced my muscles to grow. By the end of the eight weeks, my body fat had plummeted from 18.5 per cent to 7.1 per cent, while my abs and obliques were completely shredded, holding just 6mm and 6.2mm of fat. Building muscle: Ben;s workouts combined big compound moves such as the deadlift and bench press with strongman exercises such as sled drags and Viking presses, finishing off with isolation moves including curls and flyes . I’d put on upper-body muscle too, as well as improving my posture by counteracting an imbalance around my scapula that had been giving me grief for years. What’s more, the diet had worked wonders for my digestive system and reminded me of how much fun weekends are without a crushing hangover. My fiance - who had been amazingly supportive throughout - was thrilled with the results. I hadn’t looked even remotely this good since the early days of our relationship, and while she wasn’t a fan of the obligatory photoshoot chest wax, my newly rediscovered abs more than made up for it. The only unexpected drawback was that none of my clothes fitted anymore, but thankfully I’d been planning to go suit shopping at the last minute anyway due to my best man being out of the country. When my wedding day finally arrived I looked and felt better than I had at any point in my entire adult life. And if I can do it, there’s no reason why you can’t too.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Miss Universe Thailand has resigned after being attacked on social media for being 'too fat' and for her political views. Weluree Ditsayabut, 22, won the crown last month, but came under fire for Facebook messages posted before the competition in which she said red shirt protesters 'should all be executed.' Disayabut tearfully announced she was . giving up the title that would have allowed her to compete in the . international Miss Universe pageant at a press conference this afternoon. Weluree Ditsayabut, Thai Miss Universe 2014, has resigned today after being attacked on social media for being too fat and for her political views . The red shirts are a political pressure group who support the deposed former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra against pro-royalist protesters who have seized control of the country's capital. The . actress and former talk show host said a hail of brutal comments on . social media had given her and her mother sleepless nights. According to the Bangkok Post, she said: 'I've made this decision on my own. I would like to thank all the judges who selected me as well as my parents, friends and those who looked after me. A tearful Weluree (left) told reporters that she had lost sleep over the online taunts. She was attacked after comments were discovered on her Facebook (right) saying red shirt protesters 'should all be executed' Weluree (centre) was a controversial choice for the crown, beating favorite Pimbongkod 'Ellie' Chankaew (left) in second place amid boos and jeers from the crowd . It is not clear whether runner-up Ellie will replace Weluree (pictured), as organisers of the pageant say they will have to speak to each contestant separately . 'I also want to thank the people who made comments about me, both good and bad ones, through the media. 'At . first, my family was happy for me when I was crowned. But there's no . more happiness following waves of criticism from the society.' Organisers of Thailand's Miss Universe competition have said future applicants will have their social media accounts vetted beforehand . Weluree was an surprise choice for the Miss Universe Thailand crown, beating crowd favourite Pimbongkod 'Ellie' Chankaew into second place. As Weluree was crowned, shouts of 'Ellie, Ellie' and 'Keep on fighting Ellie', could be heard from the crowd amid boos and jeers. However, it was not immediately clear who would replace Weluree as images of Pimbongkod kissing a man have also appeared online, causing controversy. Organisers of Miss Universe Thailand told reporters that they will have to review other criteria, such as social media, when screening and selecting contestants in the future. Weluree's comments struck at the heart of Thailand's long-running political crisis, expressing the attitude of the country's educated elite and royalists toward the government of then-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Yingluck, who was backed by many in Thailand's rural north and northeast, was forced to step down last month, and the military soon afterward staged a coup against the elected civilian government. Thai society has been sharply polarized since 2006, when Yingluck's brother, then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was ousted in a coup and subsequently fled into exile to avoid a corruption conviction. Since then until the recent coup, Thaksin's opponents and the Red Shirts staged competing protests in an ongoing battle for political power.Video Source YouTube .","Weluree Ditsayabut, 22, has resigned as Miss Universe Thailand .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . As petrol becomes ever more expensive, car manufacturers are racing to develop vehicles that are fast, fuel-efficient and can run on biofuels. Now a British manufacturer has launched a sports model that not only exceeds speeds of 190mph - it is said to be capable of driving from Land’s End to John O’Groats and back on a single tank of cooking oil. Makers Trident claims its Iceni model is the world’s fastest and most fuel efficient sports car - and it's pretty good looking too. Speedy: A British manufacturer called Trident has launched the Iceni sports car (pictured) that has a top speed of 190mph and can drive from Land's End to John O'Groats and back on a single tank of used cooking oil that can even be refined at home . Engine: 6.6 litre Turbo Diesel V8 . Gearbox: 6 speed fully automatic . Power/Performance: 395brake horsepower with 700lbs ft of Torque. Acceleration: 0-60mph in 3.7seconds . Top speed: Over 190mph. Interior: 'Tilt and slide' steering column, air conditioning, electric windows, specially designed heated and electric seats trimmed in leather, a CD player and digital radio with MP3 and Bluetooth. Fuel: Conventional diesel or pure biodiesel, such as cooking oil, virgin rapeseed, linseed palm, soya bean oil, kerosene and paraffin. Price: From £96,000 ($161,578). It can reportedly travel 2,000 miles on a single tank of mineral or bio-diesel and uses ‘torque multiplication technology’ to achieve its combination of speed, power and this fuel efficiency. Prices start at £96,000 ($161,578) for the most basic version. The Norfolk-based firm has unveiled three models - the Iceni Magna fastback and convertible as well as an estate version with a distinctive heart-shaped rear window, called the Iceni Venturer, all of which can go from 0 to 60 in just 3.7 seconds. The models run on pure biodiesel, such as cooking oil, virgin rapeseed, linseed palm, soya bean oil, kerosene and paraffin. Co-founder Phil Bevan told MailOnline that if the owner of one of his cars invested in refinery equipment - at a costs of £1,800 - they could make approximately 300litres of fuel a day by collecting used cooking oil from restaurants.

It can reportedly travel 2,000 miles on a single tank of mineral or bio-diesel and uses 'torque multiplication technology' to achieve its combination of speed, power and fuel efficiency . The cars also have enough room for four suitcases or even a set of golf clubs - essential for making the long trip from Cornwall to Scotland, which is 838miles by the most direct route. ‘The Trident cars deliver incredible speed and performance combined with outstanding fuel efficiency, achieved through our unique torque multiplication technology,’ said Phil Bevan, designer and founder of Trident. 'It is widely believed horsepower delivers power, speed and fuel efficiency, but it is torque that matters and ‘gets you off the line quickly,’ he told MailOnline. Distinctive: The model is reminiscent of older sports cars and has 39 . bespoke components, including a clever roof so that a passenger can remain under cover even if the . driver wants the roof down. The futuristic interior (left) and sports wheels (right) are pictured . Bevan claims Trident’s patented technology – a unique way of utilising torque multiplication to improve performance and efficiency - increases fuel efficiency by up to 20 per cent. The Iceni car ‘handles like a race car but rides like a saloon car and its shock absorbers are bespoke to give a grand touring feel,’ Bevan continued. 'It’s got a mid-front mounted engine, with everything is in the middle. It’s designed like a race car.’ British car makes use of fish and chips: The Iceni (pictured) can run on pure biodiesel, such as cooking oil from deep fat fryers, virgin rapeseed, linseed palm, soya bean oil, kerosene and paraffin .

The models have a distinctive look, reminiscent of older sports cars and incorporate over 39 bespoke components, including independent control of each car seat and even the car’s roof. This means a passenger can remain under cover even if the driver wants the roof down. The company said its car can be built to suit customers’ specifications, and that prices start at £96,000 ($161,578). Daniel Monaghan, co-founder of Trident added: ‘We have worked extremely hard to reach this point and the whole Trident team is thrilled to be bringing the world’s most fuel-efficient diesel sports cars to market.’ Not all torque: Trident claims that its patented technology - a unique way of utilising torque multiplication to improve performance and efficiency - increases fuel efficiency by up to 20 per cent .","Trident claims its Iceni model is the world’s most fuel efficient sports car .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Researchers say it is possible to repair a chronically diseased liver by forcing mature liver cells to 'go back in time' to a stem cell-like state. Switching off a liver-growth pathway in mature cells generates high levels of dedifferentiation, which means the cells can revert back to an unspecialized state and regenerate a diseased liver. The breakthrough, published in the journal Cell, could pave the way for liver cell transplants to cure genetic liver disorders. Cell transition: Scientists say when the Hippo pathway is inactivated, mature liver cells revert back to a stem cell-like state. This picture shows a group of cells transitioning from a mature cell type (green) to a stem cell type (red). White cells are the cells where Hippo is being inactivated . Research lead: Fernando Camargo (pictured) is an associate professor in the Harvard Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology . Harvard Stem Cell Institute scientists at Boston Children's Hospital made the discovery while investigating whether a biochemical cascade called Hippo, which . controls how big the liver grows, also affects cell fate. Switching off the . Hippo-signaling pathway in mature liver cells means they become . stem-cell like again, allowing them to give rise to functional . progenitor cells that can regenerate a diseased liver. 'I think this study highlights the . tremendous plasticity of mature liver cells,' research lead Fernando Camargo said, according to Science Daily. 'It's not that you have a very small population of . cells that can be recruited to an injury; almost 80 percent of . hepatocytes [liver cells] can undergo this cell fate change.' Camargo's team studied mice born with a genetic liver disease. They cultured healthy liver progenitor cells and transplanted them into the diseased mice. Over about four months, the transplanted liver cells engrafted and the animals' condition improved. 'People have been trying to use liver cell transplants for metabolic diseases since the early 90s, but because of the source of cells - discarded livers-- they were unsuccessful,' Camargo said. 'With this unlimited source of cells from a patient, we think that perhaps it's time to think again about doing hepatocyte or progenitor cell transplants in the context of liver genetic disorders.'","Harvard Stem Cell Institute researchers were studying whether the Hippo-signaling pathway, which controls how big the liver grows, also affects cell fate .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Joel Christie . A convicted serial killer dubbed the 'Serial Shooter' - who would gun down pedestrians, cyclists and animals in random late night drive-by shootings in Phoenix, killing six people - was likely hoarding antidepressants from a fellow inmate in the months before committing suicide, a state prison investigation said. Findings in an Arizona Department of Corrections report released Friday indicate another inmate gave 40-year-old Dale Hausner several amitriptyline pills a week over a two-month period at a Florence prison. According to the documents, the unidentified inmate told the Inspector General's Office that Hausner said he was having trouble sleeping. The inmate initially gave Hausner nine pills, before then giving out four or five each week. Final act: Convicted serial killer Dale Hausner committed suicide in June 2013 by overdosing on . antidepressants. An investigation has found he had hoarded as many as 56 pills from a fellow inmate in a nearby cell over the course of two months using a homemade fishing line . Death on Death Row: Hausner was found unresponsive in his cell at the Eyman state prison complex in Florence on June 19, 2013. He had been found guilty in a series of random shootings on pedestrians, bicyclists and animals that terrorized the Phoenix area in 2005 and 2006 . The inmate told officials he had medications to give because prison nurses didn't always watch him take what was a daily dosage. He would save any he didn't feel like taking. While the inmate recalled talking with Hausner about the idea of stockpiling pills to commit suicide, the inmate said he thought Hausner was taking them as he received them. According to the inmate, he would use a homemade fishing line to transport pills from his cell to another until they reached Hausner. It's possible Hausner had more than 56 tablets, the inmate said. He was found unresponsive in his isolation cell at Eyman state prison complex on June 19, 2013. He was pronounced dead about an hour later at a hospital in Anthem, according to Arizona Department of Corrections officials. Silent killer: Hausner's cause of death was . 'amitriptyline intoxication.' Amitriptyline is one of a variety of . antidepressant medications sold under the brand name Elavil . The Pinal County Medical Examiner's Office ruled his death a suicide and said the cause of death was 'amitriptyline intoxication'. Hausner was found guilty in a series of random shootings on pedestrians, bicyclists and animals. The former airport janitor was given six death sentences and hundreds of years in prison for killing six people and attacking 19 others in 2005 and 2006. Hausner was arrested in August 2006 with his roommate, Sam Dieteman, at the apartment they shared in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa. Inside, police found guns, news clippings of the killings and a city map marked with the locations of some of the shootings. Outlaws: Hausner (left) was arrested in August . 2006 with his roommate, Sam Dieteman (right), who pleaded guilty in two . of the killings and was sentenced to life in prison. Police were tipped off by one of Dieteman's drinking buddies, who told them he had been bragging about the killings . Death wish: Since his convictions, Hausner had . waived his appeals and asked in a letter to the court 'to be executed as . soon as possible', saying it would be best for the families of his victims . Dieteman, who pleaded guilty in two of the killings and was sentenced to life in prison, testified against Hausner, saying they cruised around late at night looking for strangers to shoot. The 'serial shooter' attacks and an unrelated serial killer case terrorized the community and kept neighborhood watch groups on high alert in the summer of 2006. Last victim: Hausner shot dead Robin Blasnek, 22, in Mesa, Arizona, on July 30, 2006, marking the end of his bloody rampage . Families stayed inside and authorities called meetings that drew hundreds of people. Since his convictions, Hausner had asked 'to be executed as quickly as possible'. County authorities have said that while he was awaiting trial, Hausner tried to kill himself with an overdose of cold tablets. Police were finally able to track down Hausner following the 14-month shooting spree after one of Dieteman's drinking buddies reported him to authorities, saying Dieteman had been bragging about shooting people. On March 13, 2009, Hausner was convicted of 80 crimes, including six counts of first-degree murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, cruelty to animals and other charges, according to the station AZ Family. He was found guilty of murdering David Estrada, Nathaniel Shoffner, Jose Ortis, Marco Carillo, Claudia Gutierrez-Cruz, and Robin Blasnek. Even though Hausner had denied any involvement, he took an odd turn during the penalty phase of his trial when he apologized to the families of every victim. Dale Hausner's brother Randy said of his death: 'It's a shame it happened this way rather than the victims getting a final say at his execution, but either way, it's over.’ Following Hausner's death, his most recent lawyer, Garrett Simpson, said: 'I have rarely met a person who had a more miserable life. 'He was a very wounded soul, and I am really sorry his life worked out like that, and that's taking nothing from the appalling losses that were afflicted.’ 2005 .

"By . Lydia Warren . An elementary school principal shot himself dead as police drove to search his home a week after he was seen in his office with a fifth-grade girl with the lights switched off. Deputies were heading towards Lance Clement's rural home in Hanford, California at 7.30am on Friday to serve him with a search warrant when they heard a gun shot inside, Lt. John Golden said. When authorities reached his front door, Clement's wife met them and told them that her 42-year-old husband, with whom she has children, had just shot himself dead. The Orange Center Elementary principal had led the school for four years - but he'd been under investigation for a week after a school employee saw him in his office with the young girl, police said. Suicide: Lance Clement, 42, shot himself dead as police arrived at his California home last week to serve him with a search warrant. A week earlier, he had been seen in his office with a child with the lights off . The employee called the sheriff's office the next day. Sheriff Margaret Mims told the Fresno Bee that investigators had spoken with Clement and the child and had determined that nothing inappropriate had happened. But authorities remained concerned after interviews more than 20 students at the school revealed Clement had often summoned young girls to his office, most often from the fifth grade. The interviews produced evidence of one case that may have led her office to seek charges of sexual battery or lewd acts with a minor, Mims said. They also revealed that Clement had given several of the girls gifts. Discovery: Clement's wife opened the door to police officers and told them her husband had killed himself . 'Definitely, unethical behavior took place,' the sheriff said. Following the interviews, authorities obtained a search warrant for Clement's home after they found the hard drive missing from his school computer, Mims said. They plan to continue the investigation with computer they found in the search and, despite Clement's death, they believe 'parents need to know'. She added that an investigation could also establish if any child needs counseling, she said. School trustees took Clement's keys and placed him on administrative leave with pay on Wednesday, which was the last day of school, said staff with the Fresno County Office of Education. Former Orange Center school board member Gene Balthrop said the allegations and suicide left him 'in complete shock', adding that the board has never received any complaints about Clement. Found: Clement had been put on administrative leave and his computer hard drive was found to be missing from his office. Police were arriving at his home, pictured, when they heard the gun shot . Orange Center Elementary serves about 350 students from pre-kindergarten to grade 8 and is located a little less than a mile outside the Fresno city limits. Before he became principal there four years ago, Clement spent three years as principal of Parkview Middle School in Kings County. Before that, he was a part-time bus driver, janitor and basketball coach at other schools. Gus Amos, a board member of Armona School District, for which Clement previously worked, said he was 'very well-liked'. 'He . dazzled us with his knowledge, with his demeanor,' Amos said. 'He was . great with kids. I don't think anyone didn't like Lance.' The school board will vote to name an interim principal next week.","Deputies heard a gun shot as they approached Lance Clement's home on Friday - and his wife opened the door to tell them he had shot himself .

"By . Damien Gayle . and Claire Ellicott . Lunatic: Jonathan Limani was jailed indefinitely after admitting cutting off his manager's head with a cheese knife because 'God told him to' An Albanian immigrant who hacked a restaurant manager’s head off with a cheese knife was allowed to move to Britain despite five years of violent and psychotic behaviour in Europe. Jonathan Limani, a paranoid schizophrenic described as a ‘highly dangerous individual’, had been sectioned twice and was being investigated for assault when he was allowed to move to England. The family of his victim, Chris Varian, yesterday said authorities had made a ‘catalogue of errors’ in letting Limani move from Sweden to become a waiter at the four-star The Oxfordshire in Thame. Limani, 34, denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter  by reason of diminished responsibility at Oxford Crown Court yesterday. Limani – who had been working at the hotel for only a fortnight – killed his boss because the ‘voice of God’ had told him to, a psychiatrist told the court. Mr Varian, then 32, had gone for a break to the smoking area. Limani took a cheese knife, followed him out and stabbed him before sawing his head off. Alan Blake, prosecuting, said kitchen porter Guy Hathaway-Pearce saw ‘the defendant kneeling on the ground holding Mr Varian’s neck’. Mr Varian was unconscious and Limani looked ‘transfixed’. The decapitation had taken a ‘certain degree of time and energy’, according to the post mortem. Limani pleaded guilty to manslaughter . by reason of diminished responsibility, with the prosecution accepting . he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the killing. Limani had been sectioned twice and diagnosed with psychosis in Sweden and Switzerland. He was taking medication erratically. He served a year in prison in Switzerland for heroin trafficking in 2004. He was under investigation for assault in Sweden – where he claimed asylum – when he moved to Britain. After his arrest here, he was detained in Broadmoor and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and a personality disorder. Yesterday, Mr Varian’s father Nigel said his son’s death was ‘macabre’ and his family suffered ‘daily torture’. He demanded to know why the killer was allowed into the country. Oxford Crown Court heard how Limani looked 'transfixed' as he sawed right through the restaurant manager's neck with a cheese knife (file picture) ‘He had a five-year history of . psychotic violent behaviour,’ he said. ‘We hope the Government can take a . serious look at this case. It seems so easy for this sort of thing to . happen again.’ Judge Anthony King said Limani was a ‘highly dangerous individual’. Sentencing him to life behind bars, . with a minimum tariff of 19 years, Judge King said the killing . of Mr Varian was an act of 'extreme and ultimate violence.' 'Extreme and ultimate violence': The killing took place at the Oxfordshire Golf Club near Milton Common, Oxfordshire, where both men worked . Before he can go to jail, Limani will . be sent to a secure hospital for further psychiatric treatment. Should . his mental health improve he will go to jail to serve his sentence. The Home Office said Limani was not on its warning list when he was allowed to move to Britain. Butchered: A post-mortem examination determined the cause of Chris Varian's death to be decapitation . Police officers discovered Mr Varian's . body at a loading area at the rear of the £6million golf club, where . Limani lived on site. Limani was detained at the scene. Limani, who had only been in the . country for three weeks before butchering Mr Varian, was a known . psychotic, having twice been detained for mental health problems in . Sweden. Less than a month before coming to the . UK, the lunatic killer had allegedly tried to wrestle a handgun from a . police officer as he was arrested over an assault. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Tolmie . said: 'Thames Valley Police has a duty to thoroughly investigate all . incidents of this nature and present the facts together with the Crown . Prosecution Service to a court. 'Every murder is by its very nature . traumatic and very emotional for the family and friends involved but . this particular case is horrific due to the level of injuries inflicted. 'This may be the end of the judicial . chapter but as far as the family are concerned, their pain and loss will . always remain. My thoughts continue to be with them at this very . difficult time.'","Jonathan Limani admitted to Britain despite being detained for mental health problems twice in Sweden .

"By . Associated Press . Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has pulled his support from a deal to sell the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and will pursue his $1billion federal lawsuit against the NBA, his attorney said Monday. 'We have been instructed to prosecute the lawsuit,' said attorney Maxwell Blecher. He said co-owner Donald Sterling would not be signing off on the deal to sell. Donald Sterling issued a one-page statement dated Monday titled 'The Team is not for Sale' and said that 'from the onset, I did not want to sell the Los Angeles Clippers.' Scroll down for video . Deal off: Donald Sterling has walked back his agreement to sell the Los Angeles Clippers to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer as he pursues a lawsuit against the NBA, arguing they violated his constitutional rights . The $2billion sale was negotiated by his wife Shelly Sterling after Donald Sterling's racist remarks to a girlfriend were publicized and the NBA moved to oust him as owner. The lawsuit alleges the league violated his constitutional rights by relying on information from an 'illegal' recording that publicized racist remarks he made to a girlfriend. It also said the league committed a breach of contract by fining Sterling $2.5million and that it violated antitrust laws by trying to force a sale. 'I have decided that I must fight to protect my rights,' Donald Sterling said. 'While my position may not be popular, I believe that my rights to privacy and the preservation of my rights to due process should not be trampled. I love the team and have dedicated 33 years of my life to the organization. I intend to fight to keep the team.' Out of the game: Sterling's wife Shelly Sterling had brokered a deal to sell the team to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2billion . Donald Sterling had agreed to ink the deal and drop the suit last week assuming 'all their differences had been resolved,' his attorneys said. But individuals close to the negotiations who weren't authorized to speak publicly said he decided to not sign the papers after learning the NBA won't revoke its lifetime ban and fine. 'There was never a discussion involving the NBA in which we would modify Mr. Sterling's penalty in any way whatsoever. Any suggestion otherwise is complete fabrication,' NBA spokesman Mike Bass said. Shelly Sterling and her attorney Pierce O'Donnell declined to comment through representatives. Shelly Sterling utilized her authority as sole trustee of The Sterling Family Trust, which owns the Clippers, to take bids for the team and ultimately negotiate a deal with Ballmer. The deal would be record-breaking if approved by the NBA's owners. Sterling was banned from the NBA for life after audio recordings were . released of him making racist statements in private conversations with . then-girlfriend V. Stivian. Pictured on June 3 on the right leaving a police precinct in New York after an alleged attack outside her hote, and three days later arriving at the Los Angeles Airport on the left . An individual familiar with the negotiations who wasn't authorized to speak publicly said Monday that there were two options for Donald Sterling — to either sign or go to court. But even if he wins in court, he's ultimately winning a judgment against himself because his wife Shelly Sterling has agreed to indemnify the NBA against all lawsuits, including by her husband, the individual said. Donald Sterling's comments to V. Stiviano included telling her to not bring black people to Clippers games, specifically mentioning Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. They resulted in a storm of outrage from the public and players and even prompted President Barack Obama to comment on what he called Sterling's 'incredibly offensive racist statements.' Donald Sterling said in his statement that he was 'extremely sorry for the hurtful statements' he made privately but said them out of anger and jealousy and didn't intend for them to be public. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life and asked the Board of Governors to force him to sell his team after the tapes were released. Pictured above at a press conference on June 8. The board decided to not to hold that vote after Sterling initially agreed to the deal . NBA Commissioner Adam Silver ultimately decided to ban Donald Sterling for life, fine him millions, and began efforts to force Sterling to sell the team. Those efforts ended with Shelly Sterling's deal with Ballmer. If this deal ultimately goes through, its terms allow Shelly Sterling to remain close to the organization by allowing for up to 10 per cent of the team — or $200million — to be spun off into a charitable foundation that she would essentially run. Shelly Sterling and Ballmer would be co-chairs of the foundation, which would target underprivileged families, battered women, minorities and inner city youths. Under the deal Shelly Sterling would also get the title of 'owner emeritus' and be entitled to continuing perks such as floor seats, additional seats at games and parking. One of the individuals said the deal also includes conditions that allow Ballmer to buy back the 10 per cent portion of the team for a pre-designated price upon Shelly Sterling's death. The deal Sterling dropped would have entitled his wife (left) to 10 per cent of the team and other privileges such as floor seats and parking .

"By . Ashley Collman . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's shot at the White House took another hit this weekend when he angered a key Republican donor with a comment about Israel. Christie was one of three governors and potential 2016 candidates to speak at the Republican Jewish Coalition's spring meeting in Las Vegas on Saturday. Hoping to court the financial support of billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, Christie spoke fondly about his 2012 trip to Israel, which was paid in part by the RJC. Scroll down for video . Someone didn't do their homework: Christie (left) was forced to apologize to billionaire Republican party donor Sheldon Adelson (right) after a speech on Saturday in which he referred to the areas of Israel inhabited by Palestinians as 'occupied territories' 'I took a helicopter ride from the occupied territories across, and just felt personally how extraordinary that was, to understand the military risk that Israel faces every day,' he said. But Christie's use of the term 'occupied territories' angered many in the room. Christie was referring to the areas inhabited by Palestinians such as the West Bank or Golan Heights, where Israel maintains a military presence. Many conservative Zionists find the term 'occupied territories' offensive since they believe Israel has a legitimate claim on the lands. Visiting the Holy Land: Christie used the term 'occupied territories' while referring to his 2012 trip to Israel, in part funded by the Republican Jewish Coalition . Impressed: It was during that trip that Christie had the opportunity to meet President Benjamin Netanyahu and the governor said he was 'extraordinarily taken by his strength and resolve'. Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, told Politico that he confronted Christie after his speech. Klein says he told Christie he should have 'at minimum' referred to the areas  as 'disputed territories'. 'Chris Christie either does not understand the issues surrounding Israel, or he's hostile to Israel,' Klein told NorthJersey.com. After the speech, Christie personally apologized to Adelson in a private meeting at the mogul's office at the Venetian hotel and casino. Sorry: Christie personally apologized for offending Adelson in a private meeting at the Venetian hotel and casino . A source told Politico that Christie 'clarified in the strongest terms possible that his remarks today were not meant to be a statement of policy.' Christie also made it clear 'that he misspoke when he referred to the ""occupied territories"". And he conveyed that he is an unwavering friend and committed supporter of Israel, and was sorry for any confusion that came across as a result of the statement'. The source says Adelson accepted the apology. But other than his 'occupied territories' slip up, Christie's speech was the most celebrated of the evening, receiving three standing ovations from the 400-person crowd. Republican governors Scott Walker of Wisconsin and John Kasich of Ohio also spoke at the meeting. Adelson personally skipped all of Walker's speech, and showed up six minutes into Christie speech, to sit front and center. In his speech, Christie took a hard stance in support of Israel, calling out President Obama's wavering support for the nation. 'We cannot have a world where our friends are unsure of whether we'll be with them, and our enemies are unsure whether we'll be against them,' he said. He also spoke highly of Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he met on his 2012 trip. Christie said he was 'extraordinarily taken by [Netayahu's] strength and resolve'.","The presidential hopeful spoke at the Republican Jewish Coalition's spring meeting on Saturday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The number of people with diabetes in Britain has reached an all-time high – with over four million people now living with the disease. Currently, 3.2million have been diagnosed with diabetes – over 90 per cent with the obesity-related Type 2 – but over 850,000 more are unaware they have the deadly condition. However, this is only set to get worse as the country fails to tackle the ‘epidemic’ rates of obesity, the NHS warns. Record: The number of people with diabetes in Britain has reached an all-time high - at more than four million . The Department of Health predicts that the proportion of people with diabetes will jump from 7.3 per cent of the population in 2012 to 8.8 per cent by 2030. Now, people aged between 40 and 74 in England are being urged to have an NHS Health Check to spot the first signs of the disease. The checks could also highlight certain diets or lifestyles that may lead to diabetes, or spot other illnesses, such as heart disease or kidney failure. Since the programme was launched in 2009, the Department of Health estimates it has prevented 1,600 heart attacks and strokes, at least 650 premature deaths and more than 4,000 new cases of diabetes each year. Concern: The number is only set to get worse as the UK fails to tackle the 'epidemic' rates of obesity, the NHS warns (file picture) Early detection of diabetes allows patients to respond by managing the illness to stop it from getting worse. But campaigners argue prevention is better than a cure - and efforts must be made to stop people developing the disease in the first place. Last year, more than 1.3 million English patients people took an NHS Health Check. Public Health England (PHE) is trying to raise awareness of the programme to mark Diabetes UK’s annual Diabetes Week. Patient Rashmikant Joshi was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes after his GP carried out the check. He said: 'Through the NHS Health Check I received an early diagnosis and treatment. I was encouraged to take control of my own health and now no longer need insulin, thanks to a healthy diet and regular exercise. 'Communities that may be at a higher risk of certain conditions, like diabetes, may not be aware of the benefits a simple NHS Health Check can have.' Professor Kevin Fenton, the PHE's director of health and wellbeing, said: 'With Type 2 diabetes becoming more common, the NHS Health Check presents an opportunity for individuals to take steps earlier, such as weight control, to prevent or even reverse diabetes in its early stages. 'It is important that those eligible take up the offer of an NHS Health Check so their risk of serious, but potentially avoidable conditions, can be assessed, leading to early intervention. 'PHE is committed to increasing physical activity and reducing physical inactivity across England and these aims are prominent in a number of public health campaigns.' Barbara Young, Diabetes UK Chief Executive, said there are currently 630,000 people living with undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes. 'The sooner we can identify them, the sooner they can start getting the support and healthcare they need to manage the condition,' she said. Support: People aged between 40 and 74 in England are being urged to have an NHS Health Check to spot the first signs of the disease, or other deadly illnesses such as heart disease and kidney failure (file picture) 'At the moment many people who could benefit from the NHS Health Check are missing out on the opportunity, we would urge anyone aged 40-74 to get one. It could be one of the best things you ever do for your health.' But Neville Rigby of the International Obesity Forum said: 'It’s important that everyone wakes up to the real risk of diet-related diseases like diabetes and heart disease, not just for the overweight and obese who are at greater risk. 'We won’t solve this growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases until we have tackled the fundamental problem of providing affordable healthy food and break the junk food habit generations have grown up with. 'The urgent challenge is not simply to tell the over 40s to have a health check to get treatment for the rest of their lives, but most importantly to deal with prevention early in life. 'There is a lag between weight gain increasing the risk for type 2 diabetes, the disease taking effect and then being diagnosed and treated. 'There is a real price to pay for having failed over so many years to address this. 'We know that researchers found remarkable differences in the number of adults under 80 already dying from diabetes - 50 per cent more in London than in some others parts of the country. 'And the 3.2 million diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is just the tip of the iceberg given Britain continues to have an unhealthy diet and little is really being done to introduce effective measures to combat this.'","Number of people living with diabetes in Britain has reached all-time high .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The National Science Foundation has suspended a researcher after the organization discovered that the unnamed employee was using powerful, government-funded supercomputers to mine bitcoins, the popular virtual payment system, according to a government report published earlier this year. The researcher's scheme was revealed in the agency's semi-annual report to Congress compiled by the NSF's Office of the Inspector General. 'We received reports describing a researcher’s abuse of NSF-funded . supercomputing resources at two universities to conduct bitcoin mining . activities,' the report said. Miner: The NSF suspended a researcher who used government-funded computers to mine bitcoins . The benefits of mining bitcoins is described by Fox News as an 'alternative to buying bitcoins on an exchange.' 'The so-called ""miners"" are rewarded with the virtual currency for using their processing power . to verify transactions, a task which requires significant compute . resources. Because the cryptocurrency has no central authority or banks, . transactions are managed and bitcoins are issued collectively across a . peer-to-peer network.' According to the report, the researcher misused more than $150,000 in supercomputing equipment. The bitcoins generated were valued between $8,000 and $10,000. Scam: According to the NSF, the researcher misused more than $150,000 in government-owned supercomputers . 'Both universities determined that this was an unauthorized use of their IT systems,' the report states. 'The researcher asserted that he was conducting tests on the computers, but neither university had authorized him to conduct such tests.' According to the report, the unnamed universities found that the researcher had accessed the supercomputers remotely in an attempt to conceal what he was doing. In one example, he accessed the computer through a 'mirror site' located in Europe. In addition to the government-wide suspension, the NSF terminated the researcher's access to all NSF-funded supercomputers. Bitcoin: Each unit of the popular digital currency is worth about $652 in U.S. currency . According to the Harvard Crimson, a similar mining of virtual currency was discovered at Harvard University earlier this year. In the Harvard case, a researcher was using the university's supercomputers to mine Dogecoin, a type of digital currency similar to bitcoin.","A government report claims an NSF researcher generated bitcoins valued between $8,000 and $10,000 .

"By . Sarah Dean . She gives directions to over 100 million people in GPS devices around the world and has become the Australian voice of Apple's knowledge navigator Siri. But singer Karen Jacobsen, from Queensland, had no idea that her voice was going to be used for the high-profile role - and that she would become known as 'Australian Karen' - when she recorded 50 hours worth of directions in a studio in America, in 2002. It wasn't until a surprising phone call in 2004, from a friend who was using GPS to drive back to New York from Maine at Christmas, that she found out just how well known her own voice had become. Australian Siri: Karen Jacobsen, from Queensaland, had no idea that her voice was going to be used for the high-profile navigation systems role . And despite now being known recognised all over the world as Apple's Australian Siri, Karen told Daily Mail Australia she was 'the last person to own an iPhone'. From the age of seven, growing up in Mackay, a city on the eastern coast of Queensland, Karen had dreams of making it in the Big Apple. Big dreamer: From the age of seven, growing up in Mackay, a city on the eastern coast of Queensland, Karen had dreams of making it in America . She watched her blonde-haired Australian icon Olivia Newton-John on TV in America, saw how successful she was, and thought: 'I want to be a singer and move to America.' Karen, who played the lead in her school shows growing up in Mackay, told her parents and 'everyone who would listen' of her ambitious plans. 'Some of them said ""she'll grow out of it""... but I was very clear all along that my life was going to be about music,' she said, speaking from the place she now calls home - Manhattan, New York. 'My parents were so supportive... all those years of piano lessons,' she added. After spending her childhood in Mackay, Karen moved to Brisbane to study music at Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University. Next she moved to Sydney, where she worked in the piano bars of five star hotels and made her musical theatre debut in the original Australian cast of Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story. After ten years working in Sydney, she said: 'You couldn't turn the TV on in the 1990s without hearing my voice on the TV or radio in Australia.' But Karen was still harbouring her big dream - to move to America. She decided to finally up sticks to the Big Apple when she noticed a lot of people close to her 'were making big plans in their life'. Real passion: Karen moved to New York from America in 2000 to continue working as a singer and entertainer . Her sister was having a baby and her parents were planning their retirement. 'I wasn't sure how to start again, I was doing very well in Sydney... but I felt it was time I followed what I really wanted to do.' Karen boarded the plane with one suitcase and 'big dreams'. 'Sometimes now I think ""what was I thinking?""... I didn't have that persepctive at the time... I sold everything and told everyone I was going, they said I was ""crazy"". 'I knew a handful of people in New York. Some very dear friends let me sleep on their sofa bed in Union Square for a month before I found my own place... in the first year there were the highest highs and the lowest lows.' It was two years before Karen got the audition for the lucrative role. She refuses to say how much her big break earned her but did say: 'They were two long years before that came along in 2002.' Big Apple: Karen left her hometown of Mackay (left) behind and boarded a plane to New York(right) with just one suitcase and 'big dreams' in 2000 . When Karen pitched up for the audition all she knew was it was for a 'text-speech system'. She recorded 50 hours of instructions, with her time in the studio being broken up into four hours a day over three weeks so that her voice didn't get tired. 'I'd record from 9-1pm, have lunch and go back to the hotel and write songs,' she said. It wasn't until a couple of years later, in 2004, that she found out what the recordings were being used for, during a surprising phone call from a friend. 'I was back in Australia for Christmas and a friend called me and left me a voicemail message saying ""my husband and I are driving back to Maine and we turned the Australian voice on our GPS on - and it was you, you directed us back to New York"".' Karen admitted she didn't even know what a GPS was in 2004, let alone how her voice had been used for it. 'I've been asked to speak at events about women in technology - but I am literally just a woman in technology not someone that knows loads about it. 'I was the last person in the world to get an iPhone,' she laughed. A decade in America: Karen performed at a concert to celebrate her ten years in NYC at The Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York . Karen's voice is now used on software systems including the 'intelligent personal assistant' Siri on Apple devices and GPS navigation system Tom Tom, Garmin and Navman. Her friend isn't the only person who has recognised her voice, now she is often stopped in the street by strangers. 'When it first started happening it was really a bit bizarre and I thought it was a once off,' she told the ABC. World famous: Karen's voice can be heard on Apple iPhones when listening to Siri and on GPS systems around the world . 'But I have to say just about every time I meet someone there is that level of familiarity, like I'm a member of their family or someone close to them. It's always stories about how we got lost and the time we recalculated.' It's not often Karen and her family use GPS navigation themselves - as they live in Manhattan in New York, where cars aren't a necessity - but she says when they go on holiday she does have to listen to instructions from herself. And while on holiday in Hawaii with her husband and her six-year-old son Hayden, Hayden heard her voice on the directions and repeated all the lines, adding 'daddy' on the end. Karen met her husband in New York, through a friend in the music industry. They are set to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary in just a couple of weeks and she admits that after lots of hard work, everything has come together for her after moving to the Big Apple. 'When you take a really big risk, when you follow what it is you know is right for yourself, you can't go wrong,' she said.","Karen Jacobsen, originally from Queensland, recorded 50 hours of lines for a 'text-speech' system in 2002, in America .

Imich said 'My father lived to his 90s, so I got good genes and was living a hygienic life too' Long life: Dr. Alexander Imich, pictured, was born on February 4, 1903 . In a video interview with Reuters, Imich simply credited his long lifespan to 'good genes.' Imich has also suggested that it may be because he and his wife never had any children during their marriage. 'My father lived to his 90s, so I got good genes and was living a hygienic life too.' Imich also alluded to having other aspirations. 'There are things I would like to achieve,' he said. 'But I'm not quite clear about what and how.' Speaking to NBC 4, Imich expressed shock at receiving the record. He said: 'I have no idea how this happened.' Imich was born in Poland on February 4, 1903. Though a New York Times report details how Imich experienced anti-Semitism while pursuing a career, he eventually studied chemistry and later parapsychology. Not the oldest! Though Dr. Alexander Imich may be the world's oldest living man, there are 66 women in the world older than him . That report said Imich 'participated in numerous inexplicable encounters' after he became interested in a Polish medium and eventually published 'Incredible Tales of the Paranormal' at age 92. He emigrated to the U.S in 1951 with his wife Wela and settled in Connecticut, the paper says, and moved to New York after her death in 1986. Speaking to the Times, Imich listed some other possible reasons for his lifespan.They included not having children, participating in athletics, and abstaining from alcohol. Though Imich may have been the world's oldest living man, there are 66 women in the world older than him, according to the Gerontology Research Group's data, with the oldest being 116-year-old Misao Okawa.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Paging doctor lead-foot. A prominent Boston surgeon with a well-documented need for speed was arrested over the weekend after police caught him driving his luxury sedan at nearly 120 miles per hour. Dr. Adel Malek, a 48-year-old Harvard University graduate and chief of neurovascular surgery at Tufts Medical Center, was clocked doing 118 mph in his 2011 Audi A8 by a police aircraft on Sunday while cruising down a New Hampshire highway. The posted speed limit on Interstate 89 - where Malek was stopped - is 65 mph. Lead foot: Dr. Adel Malek's driving record is nine pages long and his license has been suspended three times . This is far from the first time the doctor has been stopped for speeding - in fact, his driver's license has been suspended multiple times after accumulating dozens of speeding tickets. According to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, Malek's driving record is nine pages long - and that only includes violations he acquired in the Bay State. 'It shows a history of speeding violations dating back to the 1980s. The . driver has been suspended three times for accumulating multiple . violations over a set period of time, a 60-day suspension in 2009 for . seven surchargeable events, a 60-day suspension in 2008 for seven . surchargeable events, and a 30-day suspension in 1995 for five . surchargeable events,' MassDOT spokeswoman Sara Lavoie tells the Boston Herald. Busted: Malek was clocked doing 118 mph on a New Hampshire highway on Sunday . 'Before . reinstating each time he had to complete a driver retraining course and . pay a reinstatement fee.' Malek graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1994. He completed his residency at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Unlike his driving record, Malek has an unblemished medical disciplinary record and has won awards for his research on aneurisms. In 2012, U.S. News and World Report named Malek as one of the best doctors in the U.S. Fancy: The Audi A8 can cost anywhere from $75,000 to $135,000 and can have up to 500 horsepower . Malek's work has been published in several medical journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association. The doctor was charged with reckless driving, but was released on bail shortly after.","Dr. Adel Malek is the chief of neurovascular surgery at Tufts Medical Center in Boston .

"By . Associated Press . and Joel Christie . The gunman who killed one student and wounded two others at a small . Seattle college last week had stopped taking his medications because he 'wanted to feel the hate', and he detailed his plans in a handwritten . journal for two weeks before the attack, a prosecutor said Tuesday. 'I just want people to die, and I'm gonna die with them!' Aaron . Ybarra wrote the day of the shooting, King County Prosecutor Dan . Satterberg said. Satterberg released new details of the allegations as he filed . charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and assault against . Ybarra, 26. Satterberg is seeking an exceptional sentence of life in . prison. Authorities say Ybarra has been held on suicide watch without bail at . the county jail since a student pepper-sprayed the gunman and ended the . rampage Thursday at Seattle Pacific University. Charged: Aaron Ybarra, 26, is being charged with multiple felonies in last week's shooting that left one person dead and two wounded at Seattle Pacific University, King County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Satterberg said Tuesday . Ybarra typically would face 69 to 86 years in prison if convicted of the charges facing him, but prosecutors will argue that an aggravating factor -- a 'destructive and foreseeable impact on persons beyond the victims' -- allows for a life sentence . Shooting suspect Aaron Ybarra stands in shackles at a hearing in a King County Jail courtroom Friday, June 6, 2014, in Seattle . Ybarra's lawyer, Ramona Brandes, has said her client has a long . history of mental issues but is aware of the trauma caused by the . shooting and is sorry. She did not immediately return a message seeking . comment Tuesday. The journal, recovered by police from Ybarra's truck, parked near the . shooting, reflects Ybarra's admiration for the school shooters at . Virginia Tech and Columbine High School but does not clearly explain why . he targeted the Seattle college, Satterberg said. Ybarra considered other universities — Washington State, Eastern . Washington and Central Washington were mentioned — but apparently . dismissed them because they were too far away, the prosecutor said. Instead, weeks before the shooting, Ybarra took a tour of Seattle . Pacific, a private Christian college in a leafy neighborhood north of . downtown. He remarked on how friendly and helpful the academic counselor . and students were who showed him around, Satterberg said. During the tour, Ybarra learned the academic year would soon end, solidifying his plans, Satterberg said. Ybarra shot Paul Lee, 19, in the back of the head with a . double-barreled shotgun outside Otto Miller Hall after Lee turned to run . away, according to the charging documents. Some of the birdshot pellets . struck another student, Thomas Fowler, standing several feet away. He tried to shoot a woman nearby, but the gun misfired and she escaped, a detective's probable cause statement said. Ybarra then entered the building, encountering a man seated at a . table, the statement said. Ybarra ordered the man not to disrespect him, . but did not shoot, the detective wrote — instead turning the gun on . student Sarah Williams, who was coming down some stairs. Williams was wounded and remains hospitalized in satisfactory condition. Because one of the barrels of the gun had misfired, Ybarra essentially had a single-shot weapon, Satterberg said. As Ybarra tried to reload, Jon Meis, a student building monitor, . rushed out of his office, pepper-sprayed the gunman, grabbed the weapon . and hid it in his office, the prosecutor said. Meis came back and helped . another student hold the gunman down until police arrived. Ybarra fired just two shots but carried nearly 50 shells and had 25 . more in his truck, because he planned to kill many more people, . Satterberg said. He also had a large hunting knife and planned to slit . his own throat, the detective's statement said. Victim: Paul Lee, 19, a freshman at SPU, has been identified as the student who was shot in the head and killed . 'Hero': Jon Meis, 26, is being credited with . stopping the would-be murderous rampage by tackling the gunman as he . stopped to re-load. Meis is seen here with his fiancee Kaylie Sparks, . whom he will marry June 21 . This is the scene of the deadly shooting inside a . science building at Seattle Pacific University on Thursday. Shotgun . shells can be seen littering the ground . Tragedy: A victim is loaded into an ambulance on the campus of Seattle Pacific University after a shooting Thursday afternoon . This is Aaron Ybarra, 26, who allegedly opened fire at Seattle Pacific University, killing one and wounding three . 'In the defendant's plan to murder innocent students, he did not . anticipate the courage of Jon Meis,' Satterberg said. 'Mr. Meis, though a . reluctant and humble figure in this tragedy, undoubtedly saved many . lives. He emerges from this awful crime as an example of how we all . would hope we would act to confront a killer.' Ybarra gave an hourlong police interview after his arrest, saying he . didn't specifically target any of the students but had a 'hatred for the . world in general', the probable cause statement said. He told . detectives he had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and . transient psychosis but had stopped taking his medicine about six months . earlier because he wanted to feel his hate, it said. The standard sentencing range for the charges is 69 to 86 years in . prison, but Satterberg said he is seeking an exceptional sentence under a . rarely used aggravating factor: that the crime had a 'destructive and . foreseeable impact on persons other than the victim.' Speaking to KING5, Ybarra's friend Jason Wells described the 26-year-old as a 'good kid' who was 'dislodged from reality,' at least in part due to his alcohol problem. 'He would say, ""I’m going to kill everyone,""' Wells said. 'I never took him seriously.' The Seattle Times reported that Ybarra had a fascination with mass shootings, particularly with the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. Classmate Briana Clarke told the Seattle Times that Meis, who was on duty as a hall monitor, sprayed the attacker in the face, grabbed him around the neck and then wrestled him to the ground. 'There were a lot of shells on the ground..it looked like he was planning to go the distance and Jon stopped him,' another student told KOMO-TV. Several other students then piled on the attacker and held him until police arrived. 'But for the great response for the people at Seattle Pacific this incident would have been much more tragic,' assistant police chief Paul McDonagh said Thursday night. One of Meis' roommates, Ryan Salgado, told The Seattle Times he seemed to be in shock afterward. A spokeswoman at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center said Friday Meis wasn't injured, but was suffering from mental anguish and was treated and released Thursday. Ybarra, 26, says he is a former janitor at LA Fitness. According to reports, he still lives with his parents in a Seattle suburb . Students who fled Otto Miller Hall were patted down and scanned by officers to ensure they were not armed . Armed: Police entered the house with their guns drawn last night. Authorities say the suspect is not a student . Paul Lee was shot in the head and died at a nearby hospital. Sarah Williams was struck in the neck and remains in critical condition. Two other students, Thomas Fowler and another man in his 20s, were wounded but are in stable condition after sustaining minor injuries. Lee hailed from Portland, Oregon, and was a graduate of Westview High School. The 19-year-old’s grieving friends took to Twitter to express their disbelief at his violent and untimely death. 'Paul Lee. I can't even believe you're gone. Ante up, math class, and just seeing you around campus and dancing with you brightened my life immeasurably. I am blessed and honored to have known you. You will live on through all of us and I expect you to teach us your dance from heaven at 6pm tonight,’ Sarrah Rasmussen commented on Instagram. The college freshman was universally described as a positive person who always wore a smile on his face. His favorite pastime was dancing, and he belonged to several hip hop dance clubs in Portland and Seattle. 'Paul Lee was a ray of light in my classroom for three years,' Westview Japanese teacher Brian Bangerter said in a statement. 'It was impossible be around him and not feel happy. Everyone who knew him felt close to him.  He will always be remembered for his infectious positive attitude.  I know I will never forget him.' Medics work on one of the victims from the . deadly Seattle Pacific University shooting before taking the subject to . the hospital for treatment . Students were evacuated from Otto Miller Hall, . where the shooting took place, and led single-file out of the building . by armed officers . The gunman has been identified as Aaron Ybarra. Authorities say he is not a student and has no connection to Seattle Pacific University or to any of his victims. Detectives are still trying to determine why he targeted the college. KING-TV reported that Ybarra lives with his parents in the Seattle area. He has reportedly confessed to the shootings and even bragged about the carnage he inflicted on the campus. Authorities say he did not expect to survive the rampage. His Facebook page says he is a former janitor at LA Fitness and attended Edmonds Community College prior to 2012. In the panic, police believed there was a second shooter and searched for up to an hour, possibly delaying medical attention for the wounded, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports. Witnesses said the gunman barged into Otto Miller Hall - the science and engineering building for the university - about 3.30pm on Thursday. One witness told KIRO-TV that the gunman held his weapon on three students and told them not to move, when they did, he shot and wounded two and shot another student in the face. The victim who was shot in the face was rushed to the hospital, where he died. 'The shooter began to reload his shotgun and a student that is the building monitor inside the hall confronted the shooter, was able to subdued the individual, and once on the ground, other students jumped on top of him and were able to pin the shooter to the ground until police arrived,' Seattle Police Captain Chris Fowler said in a press conference. Seattle Pacific is a small Christian college associated with the Free Methodist Church with a student body just of about 4,370.","Former janitor Aaron Ybarra, 26, was charged with first degree murder and two counts of attempted murder on Tuesday following the Seattle Pacific University shooting on June 5 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Chicago police have used DNA evidence to link two crimes carried out eight years apart and the person responsible for both offenses could still be at large. Both crimes are more than 10 years old. The older of the two crimes took place in 1992, when an 11-year-old girl was raped and murdered. Holly Staker was babysitting two younger children in Waukegan, Illinois, when she was murdered. Juan Rivera, pictured left and then in his late teens, was interrogated by police for four days before confessing to the murder of Holly Staker, right, in 1992 . The crime was very high profile at the time and the man found guilty, Juan Rivera, then in his late teens, was interrogated by police for four days before confessing to the crime. Despite a lack of physical evidence linking him to the crime scene, Rivera was convicted on the strengthen of his confession which police said included details that only the killer would have known. Rivera continued to maintain his innocence and despite being found guilty of the crime three times and spending nearly 20 years in prison he finally had his conviction overturned in 2012. One of the critical factors in his successful appeal was the 2005 DNA testing that proved his semen was not the sperm found in Staker’s body, reports the Chicago Tribune. Juan Rivera was released from prison in 2012 on the basis of the DNA evidence, while lawyers for Marvin Tyrone Williford have argued that he deserves a retrial based on the new evidence . The two murders occurred eight years apart, but in the same area of Illinois . Since his release, Rivera has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against authorities involved in his case. Cops have now linked DNA from the semen found in Staker with DNA obtained from a two-by-four used to brutally beat a man, Delwin Foxworth, eight years later in 2000. Lawyers for Rivera have said that the failure to identify and arrest Staker’s real killer allowed that individual to take part in Foxworth’s murder. 'While Mr. Rivera fought to clear his name and officials fought to keep him in prison, the man who really committed the crime was free to commit this additional crime,' Steven Art, one of Rivera’s attorneys, told the Chicago Tribune. Foxworth, then 39, was attacked by three men who invaded his home in January 2000. Juan Rivera, left, is greeted after exiting Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Ill., in January 2012 after spending more than 19 years in prison . When he refused to give them any money, they doused him with gasoline and set him on fire. He later died as a result of the attack. Police identified three suspects but in the end arrested only Marvin Tyrone Williford, now 43. He was convicted in 2004 largely on the strength of an eyewitness identification and was sentenced to 80 years in prison. Williford never confessed, and no physical evidence linked him to the crime. He has always maintained his innocence. According to his attorney, David Owens, the DNA match to Staker’s killer adds strength to his client's innocence claim. At a hearing on Tuesday, Owens argued that Williford deserves a new trial based on the new evidence. The judge has scheduled another hearing for next week. Despite the DNA matches, the identity of the potential suspect in both murders remains unknown. Authorities have entered the genetic profile into DNA databanks but have not obtained a match with a known suspect.","Chicago police have used DNA evidence to link two crimes carried out eight years apart .

"By . Associated Press . and Louise Boyle . Nothing gets between President Obama and his love of fast food after he nipped out of the White House for a second-day running to satisfy his cravings. The President was accompanied by his education secretary Arne Duncan for an unannounced lunch on Tuesday at FireFlies Restaurant in Alexandria, Virginia. Obama went to the burger joint after owner Mary Lisa Lichens wrote to him earlier this year to  explain how the government shutdown in October had affected her small business. She had asked him to stop by some time and try the best burger around. President Obama and Secretary Duncan escaped the White House today and had lunch at FireFlies Restaurant in the Del Ray neighborhood of Alexandria, Virginia . Obama shares a light moment with guests as he has lunch at FireFlies Restaurant in the Del Ray neighborhood of Alexandria, Virgina . Obama took her up on that offer on Tuesday and said after lunch that he was 'very . happy' with his order of American burger, fries and sweet tea. Secretary Duncan . ordered the same food with a Diet Coke to drink. FireFlies staff member Gregg Sanders told MailOnline today that they had no warning the President was stopping by with Mr Duncan and his Secret Service entourage. Mr Sanders said: 'It got very hectic and lots of people poured in to see him but he was very laid back and pretty chill. He made everyone feel at ease around him.' Owner Ms Lichens was unable to make it to the restaurant in time for Obama's visit, so the President called her on the phone. The owner wasn't in today, but the President phoned her to say how much he enjoyed his burger . The President didn't just give a big tip to his waiter, he also gave out hugs . Mr Sanders said: 'He called her on the phone from the restaurant so that she had the opportunity to talk to him. He thanked her for a great burger.' Server Dawn Sanders also told MailOnline that the President left his server, Anthony, a big tip. She added: 'He just popped in. There was a lot of commotion but he greeted all the customers and was very nice.' Burger runs are becoming somewhat of a regular thing for Obama. Last month, he and Vice President Joe Biden surprised diners at a Shake Shack burger restaurant in Dupont Circle in the capital.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A 34-year-old East Texas woman who made headlines last month by posing as a high school sophomore has pleaded guilty to failure to identify. A judge in Longview on Tuesday sentenced Charity Johnson to 85 days in jail under a plea agreement. The con artist who pretended to be a 15-year-old girl was also ordered to pay a $277 fine. Punishment: Charity Johnson, 34, seen on . the left while pretending to be 15-year-old high school sophomore . Charity Stevens and right in a booking photo after her arrest, has been sentenced to 85 days in jail . Ms Johnson already has served nearly a month in jail following her May 13 arrest. Charity Johnson was taken into custody seven months after she enrolled at New Life Christian School in Longview as a sophomore. The . bizarre tale of deception has left many people in the small East Texas . community in a state of disbelief, including 23-year-old Rickie . Williams, who had been dating Johnson since last summer. Williams said Johnson, who has been using the last name Stevens and posing as an orphan, told him she was 18 years old. Another person who bought into Johnson's sad tale of abuse and loss was Osarieme Obaseki, 40, who runs the Dallas-based What About Us non-profit organization helping women and girls. Tricked: Rickie Williams, 23 (left), has been dating Johnson (right) since last summer . Obaseki told ABC News last month that Johnson first contacted her in April claiming to be a 14-year-old girl in need of help. The two formed a bond and continued exchanging phone calls, with Johnson calling the woman only six years her senior 'Mom.'  She was living with her guardian, Tamica Lincoln, in Longview at the time, but made no mention of that to Obaseki. Their relationship culminated on Mother's Day when Johnson took a train to Dallas to visit Obaseki, even bringing her a homemade holiday card. But over the course of Johnson’s visit, Obaseki's sister became suspicious, pointing out to her that the high school sophomore had the body of a grown woman. Sensing that something did not add up, Obaseki called Lincoln – a phone call that set in motion a chain of events which eventually led to Johnson being exposed as a fraud. ‘It’s just been a lot of lies and cover-up,’ Obaseki said. ‘Nobody I spoke to has said it’s ever been a financial situation. She had money! It’s not that, at all.’ Truth comes out: On Mother's Day, Johnson (left) was photographed with Osarieme Obaseki, 40, the head of a Dallas-based group helping girls, who became suspicious when her sister pointed out that the high school sophomore has the body of a grown woman . Charity Johnson, was arrested on the night of May 13 - more than six months after she enrolled in New Life Christian School in Longview pretending to be a 15-year-old orphan. According to school officials, Ms Johnson came to New Life last October accompanied by a guardian who turned out to be younger than the fake tenth-grader. During the enrollment process, Johnson gave the name Charity Stevens and indicated that she was 15 years old. Tamica Lincoln, 30, who took on the role of Johnson's guardian last March, told the station KLTV the bogus teenager told her that she had been abused by her biological father, who has since died along with her mother. Scam: Johnson enrolled in New Life Christian School in Longview, Texas, last October, claiming she was a home-school student without any prior transcripts . The two women met while working together at a McDonald's located inside the local Walmart, and Johnson confided in Lincoln that she had no place to stay after losing her parents. Lincoln brought the suspected con artist four years her senior into her home 'as a child,' bought her clothes and did her hair. She even attended parent-teacher conferences to talk about the fake sophomore’s impressive academic performance. 'She acted like a kid. She did her homework. She got good report cards,' the 30-year-old Longview resident told ABC News. Johnson’s web of lies began unraveling when Lincoln got a call from Obaseki, the head of the Dallas-based charity. Playing the victim: Johnson was taken in by a Good Samaritan after allegedly lying to her that she had been abused as a child and that her parents have died . Growing doubts: Tamica Lincoln (left), Johnson's guardian, and her mentor, Ray Ward (right), became suspicious about her identity and went to police . Ms Obaseki told Lincoln that she ran a background check on 'Charity Stevens,' which provided more questions than answers. Lincoln . then decided to make inquires of her own and called a manager at the . McDonald's where both she and Johnson worked. The staffer pulled up the . high-schooler's file, which indicated that her birth year was 1979 and . her real name Charity Johnson. On May 13, Lincoln and the phony orphan’s mentor, Ray Ward, alerted . police to the alleged fraud before heading over to the high school. School officials said Johnson came in last October as a home-schooled student without any prior transcripts. Officers who responded to Lincoln’s Longview home asked Johnson to identify herself, and in response she gave them the name Charity Stevens – the same moniker used on her school application. Sticking to her ruse: Hours before her arrest Monday night, Johnson posted this photo of her posing with a horse stature under the Instagram user name Charite Love . Sob story: Ms Johnson told Lincoln, her co-worker at a McDonald's who is four years her senior, that she had lost both her parents and had no place to live . Online persona: On Facebook and Twitter, Johnson called herself 'Charite' and shared photos of herself looking like a teenager . The woman was charged with failure to identify/giving false, fictitious information. Looking at Johnson’s fake Facebook,Twitter and Instagram account created under the nickname Charite, it is easy to understand how those around her could have bought in to her tale of woes. In the photos posted online, Johnson looks like a shy, fresh-faced girl with a pink bow in her neatly combed hair and sparkly manicure. However, in her booking photo, Johnson dressed in a striped jail garb looks not a day younger than her 34 years, with a lined, puffy face and a tangle of hair.","Charity Johnson, 34, pleaded guilty to failure to identify by giving police false name 'Charity Stevens'

"By . Snejana Farberov . A former Connecticut state police trooper, 43, has been charged in the brutal rape of an 81-year-old woman – but his lawyer insists their relations were consensual. Jeffrey Laporto, a married father of two from Windsor, is facing two counts of first-degree sexual assault and one count of first-degree unlawful restraint. Police allege Laporto met the victim at a Windsor Locks hotel bar. A conversation that ensued led to both going to her room just after midnight Friday. Scroll down for video . 'Vile crime': Former Connecticut state police trooper Jeffrey Laporto, 43, is facing two counts of first-degree sexual assault and one count of first-degree unlawful restraint for allegedly raping a 81-year-old woman . Rendezvous: Laporto and the octogenarian met in a bar at Quality Inn on Route 45 in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, Thursday night . The victim’s son called police about two hours later reporting the rape. Police say the octogenarian was taken to hospital for treatment of ‘extensive internal injuries.’ Windsor Locks' police chief described the attack as ‘a sickening crime’ and praised his investigators for arresting Laporto less than 24 hours after the incident. During his arraignment Monday, Mr Laporto’s attorney, Donald Papcsy, told Judge Kathleen McNamara his client and the alleged victim were seen drinking together in a hotel bar before consensually heading to the woman's room, reported Hartford Courant. It was revealed during the hearing that the 43-year-old former state trooper is a self-employed real estate agent. Bond Commissioner Paul Maselek said Laporto is being treated for a health issue, which his attorney said was a problem with his back. Papcsy also said his client is a U.S. Navy veteran who served in both Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield. Family man: Mr Laporto, a U.S. Navy veteran and real estate agent, has a wife (right) and two young daughters . Laporto has no prior criminal record. He was fired from his job as a state trooper three years ago for unspecified reasons. He currently lives in Windsor with his wife and two young daughters. The alleged rape took place between midnight and 12.30am Friday at Quality Inn on Route 75 in Windsor Locks. Police were called to the motel by the 81-year-old's son. When responding officers entered the woman's room, they reportedly found her badly injured and in need of medical care. Detectives were able to determine that the octogenarian and Laporto retired to the woman's room between midnight and 12.30am after having a conversation over drinks in the hotel bar. Laporto's lawyer insisted in court Monday there was no dispute between the pair at any point during their encounter. Unlikely lovers: Laporto's attorney, Donald Papcsy (left), insisted in court that his client and the elderly woman were on friendly terms and engaged in sexual relations consensually . After the arraignment, Mr Papscy told reporters that his client and the elderly woman were adults and there was nothing illegal about their tryst. ‘It’s very common in today’s world to see 80-year-old people with much younger girlfriends and spouses,’ the attorney told the station WFSB, citing disgraced NBA owner Donald Sterling and his 31-year-old girlfriend V. Stiviano as a case in point. Mr Laporto was released from jail after posting $250,000 bond. He is due back in court June 23.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Hail to the chief: Egypt's former army chief Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi has been sworn in as the country's new president amid tight security in Cairo . Egypt's former army chief Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi has been sworn in as president amid tight security. The field marshal’s inauguration in Cairo yesterday came less than a year after he ousted elected president Mohammed Morsi, following protests against his rule in which hundreds were killed. The day was declared a national holiday – as soldiers in armoured vehicles kept order in the city. Mr al-Sisi, 59, took the oath of office for his four-year term at the Supreme Constitutional Court as Morsi did two years ago. Morsi and other members of his radical Muslim Brotherhood party are now on trial for charges that carry the death penalty. Mr al-Sisi said: ‘Throughout its extended history . . . our country has never witnessed a democratic peaceful handover of power. The time has come to build a more stable future.’ He entered court with interim president Adly Mansour, who will return to his post as chief justice. The building, designed to look like an ancient Egyptian temple, is a short distance away from a military hospital where longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, toppled by the 2011 uprising, is being held. Forced out of office after 29 years in power, Mubarak was convicted last month on graft charges and sentenced to three years in prison. He is also being retried over the killing of protesters during the 18-day revolt. Sunday was declared a national holiday for Mr al-Sisi's inauguration and police and troops deployed throughout Cairo. The entire Cabinet, as well as Mr al-Sisi's wife and children, attended the swearing-in ceremony. Mr al-Sisi is Egypt's eighth president since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1953, the year after a military coup. With the exception of Morsi and two civilians who served in an interim capacity, all of Egypt's presidents have come from the armed forces. A 21-gun salute greeted al-Sisi as he arrived at the Ittiahdiya presidential palace in Cairo's upscale district of Heliopolis after being sworn in. He welcomed dozens of local and foreign dignitaries, including the kings of Jordan and Bahrain, the emir of Kuwait and the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, the largest and wealthiest of the seven sheikdoms that make up the United Arab Emirates. The five Arab nations backed al-Sisi's ouster of Morsi. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Emirates since have provided billions of dollars to shore up Egypt's ailing finances. Mr al-Sisi is Egypt's eighth president since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1953, the year after a military coup . Mr al-Sisi won a landslide victory in presidential elections held last month, receiving nearly 97 percent of the vote, with a turnout of 47.45 percent. The three-day election was declared free of fraud but was tainted by the extraordinary means used by authorities to get the vote out, including a threat to fine those who stayed home, a one-day voting extension, and allowing free rides on trains and buses to encourage voters to travel to their home districts to cast their ballots. It was also held against a backdrop of vastly curbed freedoms in the 11 months since Morsi's ouster and a massive crackdown on supporters of his Muslim Brotherhood, hundreds of whom have been killed in clashes with security forces. Morsi's supporters boycotted the vote and have also called for massive demonstrations to mark Morsi's July 3 ouster, though their ranks have thinned considerably. An Egyptian woman wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with Mr al-Sissi's picture celebrates his inauguration . The pro-military media has meanwhile demonised not only the Brotherhood but also secular icons from the 2011 uprising. Morsi's Islamist backers - thousands of whom have been jailed since his ouster - accuse Mr al-Sisi of crushing Egypt's infant democracy. Many of the secular youths behind the 2011 uprising say he has revived Mubarak's police state, pointing to a law passed last year that restricts protests as well as the jailing of a number of well-known activists. A man walks under a poster showing Mr al-Sisi which has been defaced with red paint . In interviews, Mr al-Sisi made it clear that his priorities are security and the economy, maintaining that free speech must take a back seat while he fights Islamic militants and works to revive the ailing economy. But while many support Mr al-Sisi's fight against the militancy, his plans for the economy have generated less enthusiasm. He has advocated heavy government involvement in the economy, with state-sponsored mega-projects to create jobs and the government setting prices for some goods. At the same time, he has vowed to be business-friendly and encourage investment. He has spoken of reshaping the map of Egypt by expanding Nile provinces into the desert to make way for development outside the densely populated river valley. His answer for funding his projects is billions of dollars from oil-rich Gulf nations and Egyptian expatriates.","Inauguration comes less than a year after he ousted Mohammed Morsi .

"By . Robert Verkaik . Tony Blair's Government allegedly lobbied against the release of material regarding prisoners' torture . Britain has tried to block the release of US ‘torture files’ that could prove how the Blair Government was complicit in the capture and ill-treatment of dozens of terror suspects, it was claimed last night. US Senators are within weeks of publishing a top-secret report on America’s torture and rendition programme carried out in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The 6,300 files will expose the horror of the CIA’s waterboarding and other tortures and could also reveal the extent of British co-operation in the programme. Claims that Britain has put pressure on the US to halt the release of the documents have emerged in legal correspondence in the case of Abdel Hakim Belhadj, a senior Libyan politician and former opponent of Colonel Gaddafi who is suing Britain over his kidnap and forced return to Libya in 2004. Mr Belhadj is relying on intelligence provided by the UK former ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, who says Foreign Office (FO) sources have secretly briefed him about Britain’s diplomatic lobbying against the release of the highly sensitive material. In a letter to the FO, Mr Belhadj’s lawyers say: ‘The report and its executive summary is likely to feature information about [Mr Belhadj and his wife] who in 2004 were held in a CIA black site in Bangkok and rendered in a joint MI6-CIA-Libyan operation to Gaddafi’s Libya.’ They add: ‘It therefore appears HM Government is seeking to dissuade the US Government from disclosing details about our clients’ rendition...’ The true extent of British complicity in torture and kidnap of dozens of detainees has never been fully disclosed. Plight: Abdel Hakim Belhadj is suing Britain over his kidnap and forced return to Libya in 2004 . Mr Murray says: ‘Britain has lobbied the US against the publication of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on torture and rendition. 'The lobbying has been carried out “at all levels” – White House, State Department and CIA.’ The FO declined to comment.","Details have emerged in legal case between Britain and Libyan politician .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Call of duty: San Marino, California, Mayor Dennis Kneier has admitted to throwing a bag filled with canine excrement onto a walkway belonging to a local resident . In political disputes mud-slinging is not uncommon, but the mayor of a small California town may have crossed the line by flinging feces into a rival’s yard. San Marino Mayor Dennis Kneier was caught on a surveillance camera Saturday hurling a small plastic bag filled with dog excrement onto a resident's walkway. Kneier has since admitted to his foul transgression and apologized, saying he should have disposed of the animal waste properly. Speaking to the Whittier Daily News, the mayor said he was walking home from a local park with his wife at around 6pm Saturday when they stumbled upon a bag of feces on Charlton Road. Instead of throwing it in a garbage bin, the head of the municipality picked it up and flicked it onto a pathway belonging to Philip Lao. The homeowner told NBC Los Angeles he recognized the mayor on surveillance video and called police, who responded to the home and photographed the sack of pungent evidence. Scroll down for video . Feces-flinging mayor: Mayor Kneier (pictured) was caught on a surveillance camera carrying a small sack of dog excrement he had found and then throwing it onto Philip Lao's property . Mea culpa: After police became involved in the case, the mayor issued the homeowner an apology . Lao and Kneier have been at odds over a proposed dog park in San Marino - a wealthy suburb of Los Angeles with median household income of nearly $200,000, which more than 13,000 people call home. The provenance of the bag of waste at the center of the controversy remains unknown as neither Kneier nor Lao own a dog. Mr Kneier said he delivered an apology letter cited by Pasadena Star-News to Lao, which read: ‘Dear Phil, Late in the day this past Saturday, June 7, Liz and I were returning from a walk in Lacy Park when we noticed a bag of dog waste in your west parkway near the lamp post. Rather than leave it or dispose of it properly, I placed it on your side walkway. This was a mistake, for which I apologize. It won’t happen again. Sincerely, Dennis Kneier.’ Lao turned the surveillance footage to police but declined to file charges against the mayor. Sign of trouble: Lao and Kneier have been locked in a dispute over a proposed dog park backed by the mayor, who was also upset over 'no poop zone' signs posted on his opponent's front lawn . Philip Lao suspected that Kneier flung the bag as payback for opposing his plan to create a dog park in Lacy Park near his home, saying that pets tend to get into scraps when left unattended for hours by their owners. Lao also has run afoul of the mayor by posting signs on his front lawn that read 'no poop zone.'","Dennis Kneier, mayor of San Marino, California, has admitted to tossing bag of excrement onto Philip Lao's property .
