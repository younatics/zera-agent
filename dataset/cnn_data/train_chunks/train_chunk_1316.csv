"A total of 14 people were arrested and four taken to hospital as around 30,000 revellers poured into a county town for its renowned Bonfire Night celebrations. The streets of Lewes in East Sussex - dubbed the bonfire capital of the world - were turned into a riot of colour and noise as rival bonfire societies paraded through.

East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service . reported a quiet night, with fire crews called out to deal with six . incidents, including an out of control bonfire.Of the 14 arrests, . Sussex Police said two were for throwing fireworks and others were for . being drunk and disorderly and public order offences. Police said there were no serious incidents of violence or disorder among the crowd, and the number of arrests and injuries were on a par with last year. Superintendent Laurence Taylor, the event's police commander, said: 'The Lewes Bonfire continues to be an incredibly popular event. At public events of this size there is always the potential for incidents of criminal activity and anti-social behaviour.' He added:'The policing of this event involves . months of preparation, planning and consultation with the bonfire . societies, the other emergency services and partners with the main aim . being to help provide a safe environment for the participants and . spectators on the night. 'Around . 18,000 people travelled into Lewes by train and officers from both .

The town's Bonfire Society parade through the crowds in a rather sinister procession which is described as 'not suitable for yummy mummies or small children' on the official website . The autumn festival has special . meaning in the county town where bonfire societies commemorate a . two-year martyrdom known as the Marian Persecutions. Under . the reign of Edward VI, Mary Tudor fell under pressure to abandon her . Catholic views, but was able to re-enforce them when she ascended to the . throne in 1553. The Queen infamously ordered the burning of 288 Protestants in turn, 17 of whom were killed in Lewes.

Pirates, . priests and Romans are among the guises of choice at this evening's . events where scores of local residents have braved the autumn chills to . catch a glance at some of the most eye-catching outfits. Earlier . this week the town's council issues warnings to spectators, advising . them to wear protective eye and ear equipment in anticipation of the . event's large scale. More than 80 people required treatment by ambulance crews at last year's celebration, with seven ending up in hospital. Bonfire societies dress up as the 17 Protestant martyrs who were burned to death under the order of Mary Tudor between 1555 and 1557 in Lewes, East Sussex . Participants carry burning crucifixes through the spectator-lined streets to commemorate the martyrdom which occurred between 1555 and 1557 . The date has added meaning for Bonfire Societies Lewes, while for most it remembers the treason of Guy Fawkes who attempted to blow up the House of Lords in 1605 . In . 2011, eight people required treatment at the Sussex Eye Hospital. Two . were left blind, and three now have the risk of life-ling glaucoma. The . event's website announced road closures ahead of tonight's festivities, . with traffic being diverted around the outside of the town as thousands . march through its streets. On-street parking is also suspended in parts of the town due the event, which costs £5 to attend. For most the celebration relates to . the events of the November 5, 1605, when Guy Fawkes among other traitors . attempted to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of . Parliament. Fawkes, . alongside 14 other Catholic men, hatched the plan in a bid to kill . Protestant King James  inside the building by planting gunpowder beneath . its foundations.

Children . in the Devonshire village of Ottery St Mary were also taking part in a different variety of festival which involves tossing a burning barrel between them while running through village streets. Wearing protective gloves and neck gear, the children carried the barrel on their heads for short stints throughout the village before passing it on.

One of the event's organisers said visitors are often startled when they arrive at the festival, having expected to attend a fireworks display . Having attracted crowds as large as 20,000 in the past however, some spectators are a little startled by what they see. Andy Wade of the Ottery Tar Barrels Festival Committee said: 'A lot of the complaints we get afterwards are from people who didn't know what to expect. 'People come expecting a firework display, and don't realise what they're coming to,' he told the Telegraph.","Thousands of spectators line the streets in Lewes, East Sussex, to watch the festival - the country's largest .

"Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar is not guaranteed his starting place back even when fully fit because of the form of stand-ins Ciaran Clark and Jores Okore. Manager Paul Lambert insists the Holland defender has a ‘fight’ ahead to earn selection given Villa have not lost since the deputy centre backs stepped up. Clark, 25, and Okore, 22, have started the last four Premier League games due to calf injuries to Vlaar and Philippe Senderos, as well as Nathan Baker’s knee problem. Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar (right) is back in contention for a starting place in central defence . But the form of stand-ins Ciaran Clark (left) and Jores Okore mean Vlaar is not guaranteed a place . Draws with Southampton and Burnley were followed by wins over Crystal Palace and Leicester City. Vlaar, whose last game was the draw at West Ham United, is back in training and in contention for Saturday’s game against West Bromwich Albion - but he is by no means a certainty once he is 100 per cent fit. ‘You earn the right then you’re in the team,’ said Lambert. ‘Your job is to stay in it. Those two lads have been playing really well now. ‘I’m sure Ron, Philippe and Nathan will know that there’s a really big fight on for them to get in the side. You need that competition for people to play on top of their game. The Villa skipper trains at Bodymoor Heath ahead of this weekend's clash with West Bromwich Albion . ‘Ciaran and Jores have been absolutely excellent for us and have struck up a good understanding. They’re in form and there’s a good little partnership developing there. ‘In the four games they’ve played together they’ve been outstanding, the two of them. Sometimes you just stumble on things and it works. ‘To be fair to Jores, he had 14 months out before he played Southampton and that’s a long, long time out of football. ‘To come in and perform the way he has - his standards have been exceptionally high. And Ciaran seems to be thriving on the responsibility, helping him through it.’ Lambert will set two personal records if Villa win at The Hawthorns. Villa have not gone six games unbeaten under his stewardship, nor won three games on the run.

"The nation's love of live sport continues to grow with an astonishing 67 million tickets sold for events held in the United Kingdom in 2014, it has been revealed. The 2014 total falls short of the record 75m who attended UK sports events in 2012, according to analysis by the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. But if the figures for the London Olympic and Paralympic Games are removed, attendances at all other professional sports events grew by three per cent in the two years. Football remains by far the nation's favourite sport, with a whopping 42.8m attending live matches across the 12 months. The Premier League (13.9m) and the Championship (9.4m) boasted the first and fourth highest aggregate attendances of any domestic football leagues across Europe during the 2013-14 season. Manchester City won last season's Premier League, which was watched in the grounds by 13.9m fans . Andy Murray roars in frustration at Wimbledon (left) while Lewis Hamilton toasts victory at Silverstone . Rory McIlroy claimed his maiden Open Championship at Hoylake in July . Glasgow's Commonwealth Games became Scotland's best ever attended sports event, with 1.3m tickets sold for its 11 days of competition. Wimbledon has long been the best attended annual sporting event in the UK - mainly thanks to its 13-day duration. Once again the All England Club claimed game, set and match over its rival events, with almost half a million spectators flocking to SW19 to watch Andy Murray's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to defend his crown from Novak Djokovic and the rest. The ATP Tour Finals, also won by Djokovic, at London's 02 Arena attracted 264,000 visitors, meaning tennis accounts for two of the top-four best-attended events of the year. A bar chart representing the table of the UK's best-attended sporting events, with figures in the 1,000s . Golf also takes two spots in the top 10, with the Ryder Cup, won by Europe at Gleneagles, fifth on the list with 240,000 spectators. Almost as many fans witnessed Rory McIlroy win his first Open Championship at Hoylake, as 203,000 crammed into Royal Liverpool Golf Club in July. Silverstone’s 50th British Grand Prix, won by Lewis Hamilton in front of his home fans in July, attracted 298,000 spectators to make it the second best-attended event in the UK. But horseracing continues to be the UK’s second most popular sport - five of the top 10 are occupied by equestrian events. Football remains the nation's favourite sport to watch live, as these Spurs supporters demonstrate . Tennis fans Ellyn Jacobson, 20, and Amber Sime-Blease, 22, queued for tickets to Wimbledon last summer . Over 200,000 golf fans watched McIlroy and Europe win the Ryder Cup in Scotland in September . Usain Bolt helped make Glasgow 2014 Scotland's best-attended sporting event ever . Glasgow 2014 does not make the top 10 because some of its events were free to attend. And the headline figure of 67m would have been even higher if free sporting events counted towards the overall total. Around 4.8m cycling fans lined the route of the three UK stages of the Tour de France in 2014. Hundreds of thousands also attended the London Marathon. The good news for British sports fans is that 2015 looks set to be another bumper year. Rugby union's World Cup, held in England and Wales, is expected to lure 2.3m visitors. This would be 46 per cent of the total number who attended rugby union matches in the 2013-14 season, which amounted to 4.9m.","Attendance figures for UK Sports events in 2014 revealed .

"As parents rush to fill their children's stocking ahead of Christmas, a list featuring toys from both the past and present that Brits thought were simply unforgettable has been released. Retro favourites Space Hoppers, My Little Pony and Mr Potato Head join more recent classics such as Buzz Lightyear figures, Furbies and Tamagotchis in being named some of the most iconic children’s toys ever. Entries from the Toy Story franchise proved popular after the release of the first movie in 1995 and were remembered for their appearance again in 2010 after Toy Story 3 was made. Iconic: A new list  features toys from both the past and present that Brits thought were simply unforgettable, from Space Hoppers, Connect 4 and Cluedo to Furbies, Sylvanian families, Game Boy and My Little Pony . Other blasts from the pasts included the 1966 Viewmaster, the 1982 Glo Worm that lit up when squeezed, slinkies and Care Bears that are still stocked today. In the Nineties, electronic talking Furbies and handheld digital pets, more commonly known as Tamagotchis, were the must-have toys. Modern day entries included the Xbox One, the Elsa doll from Frozen and Nerf guns. One respondent said: 'The most iconic toy ever has to be the Viewmaster, it’s an absolute classic. It’s weird to think how simple the concept actually was but they were such a big hit. It’s a shame my children will never understand the appeal.' Another said: 'I remember getting a Tamagotchi for Christmas and being absolutely delighted. I think it was the best present I ever got. 'If I could still walk around now with my handheld Tamagotchi and not be looked at weirdly then I definitely would.' Famous toys: The list of popular toys included Care Bears, left, which are still on sale today, and Furbies, right, which are still a hit among children and come in a range of patterns, colours and prints . Tamagotchi, left, were an international craze but now X Box has won the affection of children worldwide . Another added said: 'I have to say that the Toy Story merchandise will always be the most iconic. I remember struggling to get my son the Buzz Lightyear figure back in 1995, it was sold out literally everywhere. Buzz is such an icon.' A spokesperson for MobileSlots.com, which commissioned the research, said: 'There have been a lot of amazing toys over the years, it’s interesting to see how something so simple like a Viewmaster was once seen as iconic and nowadays they’ve been replaced by games consoles and gadgets. 'Toys have also become more iconic off the back of popular animated films like with Toy Story and currently with the Frozen frenzy. Merchandise is a big part of the toy scene.' Then and now: Rubik's Cube baffled children in the Eighties but now it's all about the Frozen Elsa doll, right . Remember them? Sylvanian families were the biggest seller of 1987. The Lilliputian animal characters included a meerkat, bear and bunny families who lived in dolls' houses stuffed with collectable furniture . But if you're looking to snap up an Elsa doll, a nightmare looms this Christmas with evidence there is a desperate shortage of Britain’s best-selling doll. Stores are unable to keep up with demand for Frozen Snow Glow Elsa, an interactive doll that sings, speaks and lights up, with an official price of £34.99. Many household chains and websites, such as Tesco, Toys R Us and Argos, list it as being ‘unavailable’, while any new stock is being snapped up as soon as it arrives on shelves. A girl's best friend: Cabbage patch dolls were a hit in the Eighties and made a resurgence in 2004 . Etch A sketch . Tamagotchi . Furbies . Rubik's cube . Cabbage patch dolls . Space Hopper . Sylvanian Families . Beanie babies . Barbie beetle car . Buzz Lightyear figure . Slinkies . Mr Potato Head figure . Battleships . Gameboys . Viewmaster . Teletubbies figures . Glo Worm . Elsa doll . Care bears . Such is the demand from parents desperate to avoid tears on Christmas morning that eBay entrepreneurs are cashing in by charging as much as £79.99 - a mark-up of almost 130 per cent. Elsa, the lead character from Disney’s Frozen film, is driving a phenomenal surge in sales in a wide range of merchandise linked to the inspirational animated fairy tale. Sales of dolls and merchandise linked to the Disney film are on course to hit an all-time high for any movie franchise – overtaking the phenomenally successful Toy Story.","Top 50 favourite toys from the Seventies, Eighties and Nineties revealed .

"A schoolgirl who had one leg amputated for medical reasons is now begging surgeons to cut off her other foot - so she she can run faster and compete at the paralympics. Danielle Bradshaw, 15, decided to have her right leg removed in 2010 after a congenital disorder left it useless. The teenager was then fitted with a prosthetic limb, meaning she could abandon her wheelchair and start enjoying sports for the first time in her life. Scroll down for video . Danielle Bradshaw, 15, had her right amputated for medical reasons four years ago. She is now begging surgeons to cut off her left foot, which is causing her medical complications - so she she can run faster and compete at the Paralympics . She started sprinting on an Oscar Pistorius-style running blade - but says the strain on her 'good' leg is now causing her constant pain and slowing her down. She now wants her left foot - which has deformed toes and severe tendon damage - removed so she can run with two prosthetics and achieve her dream of competing in top-level paralympic events. Her stepfather Darren Quigley, 53, said: 'We always thought the good leg was good and that was it, but in the last two years it's taken a lot of strain. 'She's taking daily medication, wearing ankle and knee braces and even has a plate under her knee to support her. It's all slowing her down. 'Danielle just wants to run and won't let anything hold her back - not even her foot.' Miss Bradshaw, from Tameside, Greater Manchester, was born with developmental dysplasia of both hips and a dislocated right knee. The condition meant her hips would frequently dislocate and her right leg was unstable. At two months old, doctors cut tendons in her leg and operated more than 12 times in an attempt to improve her quality of life. But despite their best efforts, she was forced to rely on a wheelchair and was only able to get out with the aid of crutches. At just 11 years of age, Miss Bradshaw shocked friends and family by begging doctors to remove the crippled leg so she could fulfil her dream of taking up athletics. Miss Bradshaw (left) pictured with the paralympian Oscar Pistorius, says the strain on her 'good' leg is now causing her constant pain and slowing her down . The teenager was born with a condition called developmental dysplasia of both hips and a dislocated right knee - meaning she had to rely on a wheelchair before her 'bad' leg was amputated . Her step-father added: 'She's always been interested in sports and doing anything active. 'I remember when she had her leg in plaster after an operation and I caught her on the trampoline at the back of the house. There's no stopping her. 'Every operation or set back has been frustrating for her. Danielle just wanted to get out of her chair and run, to do what everyone else was doing.' Soon after the operation at Sheffield Children's Hospital in September 2010, Danielle was fitted with a prosthetic leg, presented to her by TV host, Fern Britton. She then took up running 100m sprints and it before long, she was competing across the county as a disabled athlete. She won various medals, including gold and silver at the England Athletic Championships, and has now set her sights on the Rio Paralympic Games in 2016. But her constant training and competing has started to take its toll on her 'healthy' left leg - and her race times have suffered as a result. Miss Bradshaw now believes in order to fulfill her Paralympic dreams, she will have to have her left foot amputated. Mr Quigley said: 'Danielle's said to the surgeon that if they won't amputate she'll go elsewhere. Miss Bradshaw now wants her left foot - which has deformed toes and severe tendon damage - removed so she can run with two prosthetics and achieve her dream of competing in top-level Paralympic events . Doctors are expected to make a decision on the fate of her left foot in the next two months . 'No is not a word in her dictionary. If she wants something, she's going to get it. 'Sport is her life and she doesn't want it taken away from her. She competes in throwing events as well, but running has always been the main focal point and if you take it away from her it would devastate her. 'She loves the freedom of running. What child wouldn't?' Miss Bradshaw said: 'Getting the running blade made everything a lot better. 'It enabled me to get into more sports and opened up a lot of activities for me that I couldn't do before. 'I want to become really good at what I do - the discus, shot and running. I also want to encourage more disabled people to get into sport. 'I'm not hoping for the operation, I just want to get better like anyone else would want. I'll take anything to fix it, though. Nothing will stop me doing my sport.' Her family hope the hospital will make a decision on the amputation by November.","Danielle Bradshaw, 15, has the condition developmental dysplasia .

"They seem to be promoting a nutritious alternative to burgers and fries. But adverts for healthy Happy Meals are not all they seem, an obesity conference heard. They don’t lead to children choosing healthier food – and actually make them like fast food more, a Liverpool University study found. Scroll down for video . Happy Meals don’t lead to children choosing healthier food – and actually make them want burgers and fries . The researchers said the finding shows the power of McDonald’s branding – and accused the fast food giant of quickly and cleverly getting round advertising rules. McDonald's is frequently accused of helping to perpetuate childhood obesity. A Happy Meal contains a main item (typically a hamburger, cheeseburger, or small serving of Chicken McNuggets), a side item (french fries, apple slices, or a salad in some areas), and a drink (milk, juice, or a soft drink). In some countries, more healthy options such as apple slices, a mini snack wrap or salads are available as options. In the study, 59 boys and girls aged between seven and ten years old were shown a series of adverts for toys. They were then asked to choose a main course, drink and side order from the options available for McDonald’s Happy Meals. They were also asked how much they liked junk food. The process was repeated two weeks later – but this time some of the toy commercials were substituted with ones for McDonald’s. Despite being shown a Happy Meal made up of fish fingers, fruit and a bottle of water, the youngsters still favoured burgers and fries when asked to choose their own meal. Plus, they said they liked fast food more after seeing the Happy Meal ads, the UK Congress on Obesity  in Birmingham heard. Researcher Emma Boyland said that showing fruit and water rather than milkshakes and chips meant the commercials ‘cleverly’ complied with regulations on the advertising of food to children. She added that holes in the rules mean that fatty and sugary food can still be advertised during TV programmes like X Factor, despite them being watched by millions of children. A Happy Meal contains a main item (typically a hamburger, cheeseburger, fish fingers or Chicken McNuggets), a side item (french fries, fruit slices, or a salad in some areas), and a drink (milk, juice, or a soft drink) Dr Boyland said that in an ideal world, all advertising to children would be banned. She said: ‘It sounds extreme to say you shouldn’t advertise to children but children don’t understand persuasion and advertisers shouldn’t be trying to sway children’s choices.’ McDonald’s said that it adheres to some of the most stringent marketing regulations in the world, it has worked hard to improve its menu and it does not advertise fatty and sugary foods to children. One in three children is overweight and obese by the time they leave primary school in the UK. Research published earlier this month found obese children are up to six times more at risk of high blood pressure – an adult condition commonly linked to heart disease. Young obese girls have the biggest problem, with a 5.9-fold chance of developing it compared with those of healthy weight, while the risk is four times greater for obese boys. The study from Germany also shows that children and teenagers who are overweight are more likely to have high blood pressure readings.","Researchers said the finding shows the power of McDonald’s branding .

"People living in the North West of England are more likely to be admitted to hospital for alcohol-related liver problems than anywhere else in the country. A new map shows the places in England which have the highest rates of emergency admissions for alcohol-related liver disease, with the North West and the North East coming out on top. Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Lancashire were the areas with the highest rates of admissions, according to a map created by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). Scroll down for video . The map - published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre - displays how many people per 100,000 adults were admitted to hospital in an emergency for alcohol-related liver disease between April 2013 and March 2014 in each area of the country. The North West had the most admissions, the West Country the least . Bath, Gloucestershire, Swindon and Wiltshire in the south had the lowest rates. Death rates linked to alcohol-related liver disease have risen 'considerably' over the last few decades, according to NHS officials. Liver disease kills 11,000 people a year in England, despite the fact that major causes such as alcohol misuse and obesity are preventable. The new figures show that hospitals across the country admitted 10,500 cases of alcohol-related liver disease between April 2013 and March 2014. This equates to just over 200 admissions a week. In Greater Manchester, the place with the highest rate of admissions, there were 1,010 admissions in total - or just over 19 per week on average. In Merseyside there were 414 admissions in total – or about eight per week on average- and in Lancashire there were 472 admissions in total - or about nine per week on average. The places with the lowest rates of admissions were Bath, Gloucestershire, Swindon and Wiltshire where hospitals in the regions 472 admissions in total - or about nine per week on average. Wessex also had a low rate of admissions, 330 admissions in total - or about six per week on average. HSCIC chairman Kingsley Manning said: 'This map paints a powerful picture of one of the many impacts that alcohol has on patients and the NHS in this country.' Liver disease kills 11,000 people a year in England, despite the fact that major causes such as alcohol misuse and obesity are preventable . Alcohol-related liver disease happens because prolonged drinking over many years can reduce the liver's ability to regenerate, resulting in serious damage. The conditions does not usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged, which means during tests it is frequently misdiagnosed for other conditions. Cirrhosis is the final stage of alcohol-related liver disease, which occurs when the liver becomes significantly scarred. People at this stage have only a 50 per cent chance of living for at least five more years. The NHS Blood and Transplant Service announced in April this year that alcoholics suffering from severe liver disease will be allowed to have transplants on the NHS for the first time. But hundreds of alcoholics have been refused liver transplants in the past five years because they have not been able to stop drinking. The most effective way to prevent the condition is to stop drinking and to stick to the recommended limits, with at least two alcohol-free days a week, NHS guidance recommends.","Health officials have mapped the top places for alcohol related liver disease .

"A teenage boy has been publicly hanged after being convicted of killing an athlete billed as 'Iran's strongest man'. Despite calls from Amnesty International for an 11th-hour stay of the 17-year-old's execution, Alireza Molla-Soltani was sent to the gallows at the scene of the crime in the city of Karaj, west of the capital Tehran. A large crowd of people had gathered to witness the hanging and security forces were present 'to ensure the sentence was carried out without any glitches,' the official IRNA news agency reported. 'Iran's strongest man' Ruhollah Dadashi (pictured) was stabbed to death in July, and the 17-year-old responsible has been executed. The teenager said at his trial he had killed only in self-defence after a driving dispute with Dadashi . The boy was said to have cried and begged forgiveness before he was put to death. Molla-Soltani was sentenced to be hanged last month for stabbing the popular athlete, Ruhollah Dadashi, to death in mid-July. The teenager said at his trial he had killed only in self-defence after a driving dispute led him and two other youths into a confrontation with Dadashi, according to Amnesty. A spokesman for the prosecution, Ali Ramezanmanesh, said the boy had reached 'religious maturity' and was over 18 years of age. 'The law views religious maturity as its criterion which is calculated according to the lunar calendar, therefore the convict is over 18 and there are no legal impediments' in the way of the hanging, he told Fars news agency. The Islamic lunar calendar is some 11 days shorter than the solar calendar, with 354 days a year. 'Executing juvenile offenders is strictly forbidden under international treaties that Iran has signed up to,' said London-based Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. Britain's Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said: 'I am appalled by the images of the public execution today in Iran of Alireza Molla-Soltani. 'He was only a 17-year-old boy and to be subjected to one of the worst forms of execution, suspension strangulation, is abhorrent. 'This form of punishment has no place in the modern world.  Iran’s own President Ahmadinejad has previously declared that Iran does not execute children under 18 years of age. In April this man was hanged in the Iranian town of Shiraz after being convicted of armed robbery, kidnapping and the killing of two policemen . 'To do so contravenes the international obligations Iran has signed up to. 'I call again on the Iranian authorities to end these inhumane practices.' Along with China, Saudi Arabia and the United States, Iran has one of the highest numbers of executions each year. The latest hanging brings to 202 the number of executions reported in Iran so far this year, according to an AFP tally based on media and official reports. Iranian media reported 179 hangings last year but international human rights groups say the actual number was much higher, ranking the Islamic republic second only to China in the number of people it executed in 2010. Tehran says the death penalty is essential to maintain law and order, and that it is applied only after exhaustive judicial proceedings. Murder, rape, armed robbery, drug trafficking and adultery are among the crimes punishable by death in Iran.","Teenager insists he stabbed athlete to death in self-defence .

"Kim Kardashian is allegedly being paid $1million to spend an evening with a member of the Saudi royal family. Mrs Kardashian-West is set to fly out to Saudi Arabia in January, as a special guest of the prince, according to reports. The 34-year-old's rumoured visit follows a proposal made by a young Saudi prince on her Instagram, offering her 'one million per night'. Scroll down for video . Expensive guest: Kim Kardashian, pictured last night, is allegedly set to fly out to Saudi Arabia to spend an evening in the company of a young Saudi Arabian prince . A few weeks ago, a young man named Adel Al-Otaibi, posted the proposal in a comment on one of Mrs Kardashian-West's many selfies. Mr Al-Otaibi, allegedly a member of the Saudi royal family, wrote: 'I'm Saudi and I'll pay you one million per night Mai'. Now, 'urban website' MediaTakeOut reports that the mother-of-one has accepted the offer, and will fly out to Saudi Arabia early next year. The mother-of-one has not confirmed the report, which has sparked discussion on Saudi Arabian online forums. Her trip to Bahrain in 2012 sparked demonstrations that required police to fire tear gas into the crowds. Wonder what he sees in her: This is the Instagram selfie that prompted the young Saudi Arabian man to make the above comment, containing an offer of $1million per night . All inclusive? Mrs Kardashian-West is said to have accepted an offer of $1million to visit the prince . Life of the party: Kim and her mother Kris Jenner poses with Rihanna and rapper Big Sean at The Inaugural Diamond Ball in Beverly Hills last night . Belle of the ball: Kim Kardashian was paid $500,000 to attend the 2013 Vienna Ball as the date of 81-year-old billionaire Richard Lugner, who branded her 'annoying' after their night together . It is no secret that celebrities charge for appearances at clubs and parties, but some cash in incredible fees for a show. Jennifer Lopez was reportedly paid $1.5 million to sing Happy Birthday for the president of Turkmenistan in 2013. Earlier this year, Mariah Carey is said to have taken £1million to perform at a private celebration in London for the son of the Sultan of Brunei, and last year she was paid a cool £635,000 to sing for Angolan President Josè Eduardo Dos Santos. US band The Eagles was once reportedly paid £3.5million by an unknown benefactor to play one song, Hotel California, at a private party in New York, while American billionaire David Bonderman paid The Rolling Stones around £3.5million to perform for an hour at his 60th birthday party in 2002. Jordanian news website Al Bawaba advised her to 'pack an abaya', the robe-like dress commonly worn by women in conservative parts of the Muslim world, and to remember that Saudi Arabia is 'as far away from her fave glitzy and glamorous hot spot Dubai as could be'. Mrs Kardashian-West, owner of the world's only internet-breaking backside, is often paid to appear at parties and club nights. She famously accepted $500,000 to attend the 2013 Vienna Ball as the date of 81-year-old billionaire Richard Lugner. After their night on the tiles, the 81-year-old complained to reporters that Mrs Kardashian-West had been 'annoying' and had refused to dance with him. 'Kim is . annoying me because she's not sticking to the program,' he said. It was reported elsewhere that Mrs Kardashian-West had told her entourage that Mr Lugner had been 'aggressive', and grabbing her . and asking her to lose her security to be alone with her.","Kim Kardashian is allegedly flying to Saudi Arabia in January .

"Liverpool have provided the biggest indication yet that Luis Suarez will remain at the club this summer after managing director Ian Ayre provided compelling assurances to the club's major sponsors, Standard Chartered. Sportsmail understands that Ayre delivered an address on Monday morning in front of a watching audience - including Peter Sands, the group chief executive of Standard Chartered PLC - at the bank's London headquarters, where the Liverpool chief was joined by Anfield legend Kenny Dalglish. Standard Chartered have been the club's main shirt sponsor since 2010 and their current deal is estimated to be worth in the region of £20million a year and will run until the end of the 2015/16 campaign. Going nowhere: Luis Suarez will not be sold in the summer, according to Ian Ayre . Such financial commitment brings grand expectations and Sportsmail understands that the sponsors were impressed to hear a rousing talk from Ayre, who maintained that Liverpool are confident that Suarez will remain at the club and he also revealed that the club are hopeful that their identified summer transfer targets will be signed as Brendan Rodgers' side seek to impress in European competition next season. Although Ayre admitted that Liverpool's remarkable success in the Premier League this season could see the vultures circle around Suarez in the summer transfer window, with Manchester City and Real Madrid understood to be monitoring the Uruguayan, the managing director insisted that the club is not in the business of selling its star assets. In a significant demonstration of the club's ambition in front of leading Standard Chartered officials, Ayre is also understood to have cited a strong working relationship with both Suarez and his agent, praising the striker as quiet, family man whose off-field conduct has impressed many within the walls of Anfield in recent times. Marksman: Suarez is the Premier League's top goalscorer with 29 after an impressive season for Liverpool . Consistent: Liverpool have repeatedly knocked back any transfer interest in Suarez since he arrived . Liverpool, who currently sit top of the Barclays Premier League with five games remaining, believe that the motivation behind the Uruguayan forward's discontent last summer was solely based upon his wish to compete on the biggest stage, rather than any desire to squeeze more cash out of his employers or to earn more money elsewhere. However, as Liverpool have now guaranteed that they will dine at Europe's top table with UEFA Champions League football next season, the club are convinced that he will remain at Anfield and that he will remain true to the new four-and-a-half year contract that he signed in December. To ensure that Liverpool build upon their most encouraging campaign for many years, it is understood that background checks have already been made on the mentality and attitude of the key targets that the Brendan Rodgers would like to bring in to Anfield this summer and Sportsmail understands that preliminary contact has been made with several clubs in anticipation of the summer transfer window. The emphasis is on players that will enrich and blend into the current squad, rather than disrupt the current set-up. On the road to glory: Brendan Rodgers has his eyes on the Premier League title . Ready to build: Liverpool director Ian Ayre says Suarez is not for sale . Although Ayre did not make direct reference to Brendan Rodgers' contract situation, Sportsmail believes that he indicated to the sponsors that long-term deals are in the pipeline for key members of the club's staff at the end of this season, stressing that Liverpool are determined to commit to this new era under their Northern Irish manager. Rodgers' current contract is set to expire in the summer of 2015 but there is an appetite from both the manager and the board to extend that deal when the time is right - most probably in the close season. Meanwhile, Liverpool are also moving gradually closer to securing a long-awaited expansion of the club's Anfield stadium. The club need to acquire one last block of flats to secure the expansion but they are increasingly confident that any remaining issues will soon be resolved and that planning permission will be granted in the near future, as Liverpool aim to bring their all-seater capacity up to 60,000. The possibility of moving from the club's iconic home is now a none-starter, with Liverpool's owner John W Henry underlining his feelings to the board that nothing can replicate the unique 'feeling' inside Anfield.","MD Ian Ayre gives compelling assurances to club's major sponsors Standard Chartered .

"Having a tea break can significantly boost mood and increase workers' productivity, scientists found . Bosses worried that staff are wasting time on tea breaks could not be more wrong, for a new study suggests drinking a cuppa could unlock their hidden potential. The research found the process of making and drinking a cup of tea boosts mood and tended to enhance creative problem solving. The work was carried out by researchers for the Unilever food giant, which makes the Lipton tea brand and is opening a string of tea shops under the T2 brand, however it has been independently reviewed and accepted by a scientific journal. Lead scientist Suzanne Einother said: ‘These findings appear to confirm what many of us suspect; that the close to sacred ritual of the tea break can effectively boost your mood, which in turn can lead to other benefits such as improved problem solving. ‘We suspect this effect is down to a combination of elements including aspects of tea preparation and the taste and aroma during consumption as well as simply taking a break from other activities.’ The presence of caffeine and theanine, which is an amino acid that has been linked to relaxation, may be factors in the positive results. The experiments were carried out by the company in Holland and involved a group of 150 people, including 116 women, who described themselves as regular tea drinkers. One group were asked to make and drink a cup of tea, using hot water, milk and sugar, as they normally would, a second was given some sweets and the third was given a glass of water. Participants were then tested to assess their mood, creativity and motivation to assess the impact. The tests asked people to recount a recent happy event, take part in word games, draw an alien creature, and solve anagram puzzles. The study found people who drank the tea had a greater desire for success in the tests than those given water, while they also had a faster response time when faced with difficult problems . The team’s scientific paper said: ‘There was a significant effect of the condition on valence – pleasure - and arousal. Water consumption provoked lower pleasantness than tea consumption.’ It said the simple process of getting up from a desk to take a break and have a cup of tea may lead to a longer improvement in mood and well-being. The paper stated: ‘With the ever-growing evidence on the role of positive emotions in short and long term well-being and success, it is viable that simple everyday activities generate small improvements in mood which may accumulate to greater benefits over time.’ However, significantly, the study found that giving a control group some sweets before they carried out the tests was just as effective in boosting mood, if not even more beneficial. The results are due to be published in the journal Food Quality and Preference and may well encourage a return of the tea break, which has come under pressure with staff reluctant to be seen as slackers. Tea contains caffeine and theanine, which are linked to relaxation, and could be making tea drinkers happier . A host of other studies have found physical benefits from drinking tea to add to the improvements in mood. People who drink tea four times a day for six weeks were found to have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which may play some part in the results seen by the Unilever team. Recent research in China found people who drink two or three cups of tea a day were 37 per cent less likely to suffer a hip fracture. Another by a team in Paris suggested it is particular good for heart health because of the presence of beneficial flavonoids, which are a type of antioxidant. Other studies have claimed that drinking three to four cups of tea a day can cut the chance of a heart attack and help prevent certain types of diabetes.","Researchers found making and drinking tea enhances problem solving .

"Studies have shown that people from Denmark are officially the happiest people on Earth, and now scientists think they know why. According to research from the University of Warwick, genetics could be the key to explaining a nation’s levels of happiness. Researchers who looked at survey data from 131 countries found that the closer a nation was genetically to the Danes, the happier its people were. University of Warwick researchers have investigated why Danes are so happy (stock image shown). The country regularly tops polls of the world's happiest people. They found there was a correlation between Danish genes and happiness, while people with Danish ancestry were also happier . Economists at the University's Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy (Cage) looked at why certain countries top the world happiness rankings. Last year's World Happiness Report from the United Nations ranked Denmark the happiest nation on Earth, with an average life satisfaction score of 7.69 out of 10. It was followed by four other northern European countries, Norway, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden. The UK was ranked 22nd on the list of 156 countries, with a score of 6.88. The world's most miserable country was said to be Togo, west Africa, which managed only 2.93 on the satisfaction scale. Other African countries also dominated the bottom of the ratings.Denmark has also topped the European Commission's ""Eurobarometer"" table of citizen well-being and happiness every year since 1973. The research, published by the German economic research institute IZA in its Discussion Paper series, could help to solve the puzzle of why a country like Denmark so regularly tops the world happiness rankings. Danish birth was also associated with specific versions of a gene that influences brain levels of the mood chemical serotonin. Compared with people from other countries, Danes were less likely to possess a short version of the gene linked to low levels of life satisfaction. ‘The results were surprising,’ said Economist Dr Eugenio Proto from Cage. ‘We found that the greater a nation's genetic distance from Denmark, the lower the reported wellbeing of that nation. ‘Our research adjusts for many other influences including Gross Domestic Product, culture, religion and the strength of the welfare state and geography.’ The researchers used data on 131 countries from a number of international surveys including the Gallup World Poll, World Value Survey and the European Quality of Life Surveys. The researchers linked cross-national data on genetic distance and well-being. Whether money can buy happiness or not (stock image shown) is cause for debate, but it seems one sure-fire way to ensure your well-being is simply to have Danish DNA. The new research was published by the German economic research institute IZA in its Discussion Paper series . The second form of evidence looked at existing research suggesting an association between mental wellbeing and a mutation of the gene that influences the re-uptake of serotonin, which is believed to be linked to human mood. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps to relay nerve signals. ‘We looked at existing research which suggested that the long and short variants of this gene are correlated with different probabilities of clinical depression, although this link is still highly debated,’ Dr Proto continued. ‘The short version has been associated with higher scores on neuroticism and lower life satisfaction. ‘Intriguingly, among the 30 nations included in the study, it is Denmark and the Netherlands that appear to have the lowest percentage of people with this short version.’ A deficiency of the chemical in the brain is strongly linked to depression while levels are boosted by the drug Ecstasy. Compared with people from other countries, Danes were less likely to possess a short version of the gene linked to low levels of life satisfaction. 'The results were surprising,' said Economist Dr Eugenio Proto from Cage. In this library image a group of folk dancers in California celebrate the 'Danish Days' festival in 1964 . The final piece of evidence looked at whether the link between genetics and happiness also held true across generations, continents and the Atlantic Ocean. Co-author Professor Andrew Oswald, also from the University of Warwick, said: ‘We used data on the reported well-being of Americans and then looked at which part of the world their ancestors had come from. ‘The evidence revealed that there is an unexplained positive correlation between the happiness today of some nations and the observed happiness of Americans whose ancestors came from these nations, even after controlling for personal income and religion. ‘This study has used three kinds of evidence and, contrary to our own assumptions when we began the project, it seems there are reasons to believe that genetic patterns may help researchers to understand international well-being levels. ‘More research in this area is now needed and economists and social scientists may need to pay greater heed to the role of genetic variation across national populations.’","University of Warwick researchers investigated why Danes are so happy .

Junior dos Santos performs a public workout ahead of his heavyweight clash with Stipe Miocic . Dos Santos has not fought since losing to world champion Cain Velasquez 14 months ago . Dos Santos' fans have made the trip from Brazil to Phoenix, Arizona for this weekend's fight . 'That last year was a tough year for me,' he admitted to Sportsmail. 'Since my last fight in October last year, everything has been hard. But it was a good time to be thinking about everything – what’s happening in my life and my career. To try to do something better for me, to take care of me, to take care of my body and get better results. 'But right now I'm happy. I will be competing again so that’s everything that I want - to be in the Octagon, to be doing what I love to do.' The Brazilian, ranked No 2, believes victory will set him up for another shot at the title. 'My main objective in my career is to be the champion again,' he added. 'I really believe I can. I'm just trying to be stronger mentally, to put everything in the right place right now in my career, and have the same desire to win that I always had. The win against Miocic is going to put me in the line to fight for the title again. Dos Santos and Miocic square up ahead of their five-round heavyweight headliner this weekend .

"It might make up more than 80 per cent of the known universe, but as of yet scientists have still not managed to directly observe one of the universe’s greatest mysteries - dark matter. In recent months there have been detections from the sun and in orbit around Earth, but now scientists think they have found it in neighbouring galaxies. They spotted photon emissions coming from space - and one of the best possible explanations is that they came from particles of dark matter. Scroll down for video explanation . Research led by Leiden University in the Netherlands has found particles in other galaxies that could be dark matter (illustrated). They analysed X-ray signals emitted by the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy. The signal could not be attributed to any regular form of matter . Two groups have recently announced that they have detected a signal that could be a sign of dark matter, with the research to be published next week in Physical Review Letters. One of them, which included Netherlands-based Leiden University scientists Dr Oleg Ruchayskiy and Dr Alexey Boyarsky, found it by analysing X-rays emitted by two celestial objects - the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up: the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces.There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light, but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the universe. After having collected thousands of signals from the Esa's XMM-Newton telescope and eliminated all those coming from known particles and atoms, they detected an anomaly that, even considering the possibility of instrument or measurement error, caught their attention. The signal appears in the X-ray spectrum as a weak, abnormal photon emission that could not be attributed to any known form of matter. Above all, ‘the signal's distribution within the galaxy corresponds exactly to what we were expecting with dark matter, that is, concentrated and intense in the centre of objects and weaker and diffuse on the edges,’ explained Dr Ruchayskiy. ‘With the goal of verifying our findings, we then looked at data from our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and made the same observations,’ added Dr Boyarsky. The discovery was made using Esa's XMM-Newton telescope (illustration shown). The researchers detected an anomaly that, even considering the possibility of instrument or measurement error, caught their attention - as it could be the best sign of dark matter yet . The signal comes from a very rare event in the universe: a photon emitted due to the destruction of a hypothetical particle, possibly a ‘sterile neutrino’. If the discovery is confirmed, it will open up new avenues of research in particle physics. ‘It could usher in a new era in astronomy,’ said Dr Ruchayskiy. And Dr Boyarsky said: ‘Confirmation of this discovery may lead to construction of new telescopes specially designed for studying the signals from dark matter particles. ‘We will know where to look in order to trace dark structures in space and will be able to reconstruct how the universe has formed.’ The research, to be published in Physical Review Letters, included EPFL scientists Dr Oleg Ruchayskiy and Dr Alexey Boyarsky. They found the signal by analysing X-rays emitted by two celestial objects - the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy (shown)","Research led by Leiden University in the Netherlands has found particles in other galaxies that could be dark matter .

"Princeton Mom Susan Patton has waded into the campus rape debate, saying sexual assault 'really is a clumsy hook-up melodrama'. Ms Patton, who sparked uproar earlier this year by saying young women should dedicate time at college to 'finding a husband', said rape victims should question how they had come to be in a situation where they could be attacked. Saying rape could be a 'learning experience' for female students, Ms Patton's remarks caused controversy again as she leapt to the defence of accused rapists. Scroll down for video . Princeton Mom Susan Patton waded into the college debate, saying sexual assault was often a 'clumsy hook-up melodrama' Speaking to Carol Costello on CNN, Ms Patton said there was more than one type of rape. She said: 'We're now talking about or identifying as rape what really is a clumsy hook-up melodrama or a fumbled attempt at a kiss or a caress. In many cases this is what it is. 'It makes one wonder, why don't you [rape victims] get up and leave? Why, as a woman, do you not tell a man who is making advances you're not comfortable with, ""Stop. Leave"". 'There's rape and then there's rape.' Wading into the campus rape debate which has raged in colleges since last month, when Rolling Stone magazine published the account of a female student at the University of Virginia (UVA) who claims she was gang raped, Ms Patton said men accused of sexual assault were treated as if they were guilty. 'Any young man on any college campus who is accused of having sexually assaulted a woman starts from the position of being guilty until they can prove their own innocence,' she said. In an interview with CNN's Carol Costello (right), Ms Patton questioned why rape victims did not tell men making advance they are not comfortable with to stop . Clearly uncomfortable with Ms Patton's comments, Costello asked: 'If your daughter gets horribly drunk and a man takes advantage of her sexually, and she’s passed out drunk… she deserves it?' Ms Patton replied that women should 'stay sober enough' to leave a situation if things get out of hand. Asked if she was suggesting women should change their behavior, rather than teaching men not to rape, the Princeton Mom replied: 'We could teach burglars not to steal, but better advice: Lock your door.' The Rolling Stone article sent shockwaves through the university community after the magazine published Jackie's account of being gang-raped by seven men at a UVA fraternity two years ago. Misrepresented? These are the three friends who ran to alleged rape victim Jackie's aid, the night she told Rolling Stone she was gang raped by seven men at the University of Virginia. Identified as Cindy, Andy and Randall in the article, they say their real names are Kathryn Hendley (left), Alex Stock (center) and Ryan (asked for his last name to be withheld, right) Next to Jackie's account of the horrifying assault, one of the most appalling aspects of the story were the apathetic reactions of her three friends 'Randall', 'Andy' and 'Cindy', who she called for help after escaping the fraternity that night in September 2012. According to the magazine, the victim said her friends told her to 'remember where your loyalty lies', and that she should not open UVA to criticism. Today they came forward to refute claims made in the article, insisting that they urged Jackie to report the incident to police, but that she declined.","Princeton Mom Susan Patton wades into UVA campus rape debate .

"The CIA said enhanced interrogations helped capture Dhiren Barot in 2004 . Al Qaeda's top British terrorist was captured after CIA spies tortured former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, it was claimed today. Crucial information provided by Mr Begg while he was being held helped identify 'dirty bomber' Dhiren Barot who was plotting terror attacks on London, according to the long-awaited publication of a report into CIA torture programmes in the wake of 9/11. The report claims that drawings by Mr Begg – who claims to have been beaten and deprived of sleep in Guantanamo Bay – helped lead British security services to Barot, who had gone to ground in London. Barot – also known as 'Issa al-Britani' or 'al-Hindi' – was tracked down in 2004 before being found guilty two years later of planning to detonate a dirty bomb and launch an attack on the Tube. The revelation will prove highly controversial as it appears to contradict the findings of the Senate's intelligence committee report which found that the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation techniques' did not yield information crucial in stopping terror attacks. It even stated specifically that torture techniques – including waterboarding, rectal feeding and sleep deprivation – at Guantanamo were not central to Barot's arrest, or any other significant breakthrough. The report criticises the CIA for making 'inaccurate' representations that 'enhanced interrogation' was effective and necessary in producing 'otherwise unavailable intelligence'. It said Barot's arrest 'resulted from the investigative activities of UK government authorities.' Scroll down for video . Former Guantanamo Bay Detainee Moazzam Begg rejected claims he provided information which helped track down a terrorist . Taliban and al-Qaida detainees in orange jumpsuits sit in a holding area during in-processing to the temporary detention facility in 2002 . The Government asked for information to be kept out of the US Senate report detailing the scale of torture in CIA prisons, it emerged last night. After initially insisting that no representations were made to keep secret evidence about British complicity in CIA interrogation programmes, Downing Street yesterday changed its story. Asked on Wednesday about requested redactions, David Cameron’s official spokesman said there had been ‘none whatsoever, to my knowledge’. But yesterday his deputy said: ‘My understanding is that no redactions were sought to remove any suggestion that there was UK involvement in any alleged torture or rendition. 'But I think there was a conversation with the agencies and their US counterparts on the executive summary. ‘Any redactions sought there would have been on national security grounds in the way we might have done with any other report.’ But the report also described how Mr Begg not only suggested where Barot – an old acquaintance – might be found in London, but provided a sketch good enough to identify him, according to report footnotes revealed in the Independent today. One reference in the report states: 'While still in Pakistani custody, Begg provided reporting on UK-based extremists in the context of terrorist training camps, including information on an individual who would play a key role in 'Issa's' identification and capture.' In October 2003, CIA officers wrote: 'Our latest information, based on [foreign partner reporting] and a detainee's assessment [Moazzam Begg in US military custody], is that Issa is believed to currently be located in Wembley, a suburb of London.' According to the CIA document, Begg's 'description and resulting sketch of UK contact Issa al-Hindi' – whose true identity was then unknown – 'was compared to a still shot of an unidentified man taken from a surveillance video of UK extremists.' The comparison 'revealed that the man in the video probably [was] the elusive Issa al-Hindi.' Just months later, in August 2004, Barot was arrested. Mr Begg has also reacted furiously to the claim. In a letter to The Independent last night, lawyers for Mr Begg rejected any suggestion that he 'volunteered or co-operated in the provision of information to any intelligence service'. They added: 'Insofar as he was tortured and under extreme and unlawful continuing duress for three-and-a-half years in Bagram and Guantanamo he, as every other individual subject to such treatment, cannot be regarded in any proper sense of the words to have 'given or provided information' voluntarily.' Mr Begg was arrested in Pakistan in 2002, and was held at Bagram, Afghanistan, before being sent to Guantanamo Bay. He was among former detainees who received an out-of-court payment over claims British officials were complicit in his torture. Mr Begg was arrested again this year – accused of attending a terrorism training camp in Syria. But the charges were dropped in October after it emerged MI5 knew of his activities. A parliamentary probe into the complicity of British spies in US torture programmes will not get fully under way for at least six months, it was claimed today. The revelation will pile further pressure on David Cameron to launch a full-judicial inquiry to get to the bottom of how much MI6 and the Foreign Office knew about CIA ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’. The Prime Minister earlier this year asked the Commons intelligence and security committee to complete a probe started by former judge Sir Peter Gibson into whether UK spies and ministers turned a blind eye to the torture of detainees by the CIA. That inquiry, set up in 2010, stalled because of police investigations into the rendition of two suspects to Libya, before any MI5 or MI6 officers were questioned. But a member of the committee told the Times it was unlikely to start examining witnesses before the general election – raising concerns that the probe has been kicked into the long grass. The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg has said he is open to a full public inquiry into Britain’s involvement in torture. Mr Cameron has not ruled this out if the current investigation by the Intelligence and Security Committee does not settle the issue.","Information provided by Moazzam Begg  helped identify Dhiren Barot .

"Facebook is said to be thinking about launching a dislike button, as an alternative way for members to show they care, without appearing insensitive . When a pet dies, or a Facebook user posts about bad news, clicking the Like button to express sympathy doesn’t feel quite right. So, with this in mind, the social network is said to be thinking of alternative ways for its members to show they care, without appearing tactless or insensitive. Mark Zuckerberg admitted he is working on a dislike button - but it is unlikely to be called dislike. Speaking at the firm’s offices in California, Mr Zuckerberg said: ‘We need to figure out the right way to do it so [the button] ends up being a force for good, not a force for bad.’ He continued that people could use a button designed to express negative sentiment in the ‘wrong way’, that could be deemed cruel or mean. However, when such a button will be introduced is not known, and the site has been talking about the feature since 2010. In the meantime, people can send a Dislike sticker in Facebook Messenger posts. It is available as part of the Likes sticker package, which also includes a heart, a peace sign, a protest fist, a hand holding a bunch of flowers and a glass of Champagne, among others. According to recent research, the most annoying Facebook posts that would warrant the use of a dislike button are those that brag about dieting and exercising.

This was followed by people who share every meal, and cryptic statuses designed to seek attention by being deliberately vague. Facebook scams have previously exploited user’s demand for a dislike button to install malware and infect accounts. In particular, the Enable Dislike Button scam claims to offer the opposite to a like button and began appearing on many Facebook users' walls back in 2011. If and when Facebook launches a dislike button, or similar, it will be included as part of the site and not available through a download or link. Sweatband.com asked 1,793 people who their most annoying contacts on social media are. 1. Diet and exercise boasters - 53 per cent . Users who post about every calorie they consume and every second they spend exercising. 2. Those who share every meal - 45 per cent . Wannabe chefs who share pictures of every meal they eat. 3. Cryptic status writers - 42 per cent . Vague updates that seek attention. These enquiries are usually met with 'I don’t want to talk to about it'. 4. Game inviters - 37 per cent . Users who ask friends and followers to play the same game as them to aid in their progress. 5. Proud parents - 36 per cent . When parents constantly update their followers on their children. 6. Oversharers - 32 per cent . Social media users who share incredibly personal details. 7. Checker-inners - 26 per cent . Users who share every single place they go to. 8. Event spammers - 25 per cent . Users who invite people to every event they can think of, even when you don't live in the same city - or even country - as them. 9. Constant engagers - 22 per cent . Those who like and comment on everything, from friend statuses and photos to brand updates. 10. Self-promoters - 19 per cent .

"There is another fight of significance for British boxing taking place here this Saturday night. Amir Khan will be the star attraction as he battles Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand Garden. But meanwhile, just a stroll down the Las Vegas Strip at the Cosmopolitan, Ireland’s Andy Lee will be taking on Matt Korobov for the vacant WBO middleweight title. VIDEO Scroll down for Andy Lee: Hard fight but I have the tools to beat Matt Korobov . Andy Lee with trainer Adam Booth ahead of his world title fight with Matt Korobov on Saturday night . Korobov (left) was an amateur star but has taken his time to adapt to the professional game . Billy Joe Saunders, whose victory over Chris Eubank Jnr established him as the mandatory challenger to the winner, will be in London watching the live BoxNation telecast of that fight with keen interest. Not only is his big chance coming, at just 25, but if Lee prevails he will beat both Saunders and Tyson Fury in the race to become the first member of the travelling community to win a world title. Even so, Saunders will be rooting for Lee: ‘We’re mates and I won’t be jealous if he pulls it off. I will be delighted for him. And if he does come through it will make for a massive domestic fight for us next year.’ Lee, whose only previous world title shot ended in defeat Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr, is again the underdog. Korobov enjoyed a stellar amateur career, winning multiple world titles. But it has taken the talented Russian time to adapt to the professional ring. Lee remained on course for a world title shot with a stunning knockout of John Jackson in June . Billy Joe Saunders (right) will face the winner after his victory over Chris Eubank Jnr (left) last month . However he seems to have settled into the paid ranks now and is a heavy betting favourite to see off Lee. Saunders sees it rather differently, believing Korobov would be the easier opponent and saying: ‘I think his style would suit me perfectly. He’s good but the way to beat him is to keep him busy, keep the pressure on, wear him down – and that’s what he will get from me if we meet. ‘With Andy you have to bring your A-game or you’ll be in trouble. He will be dangerous in the first few rounds.’ Nevertheless, he slightly favours Korobov to prevail, saying: ‘I keep wavering between the two but in the end I think Korobov will edge it on points.’ Korobov v Lee will be televised live on BoxNation from 2am Sunday morning.","Andy Lee takes on Matt Korobov for the WBO middleweight title .

"Islamic State militants fighting in Kobane have released a slick Call of Duty-style video produced using aerial footage taken from a drone and shots of soldiers rampaging through the besieged Syrian city that appear to have been filmed on state of the art helmet-mounted cameras. The four-minute video appears to show the  militants engaged in fierce gun battles with Kurdish resistance forces, who have bravely battled ISIS since their terrorists first attack there September. The footage also features a number of cut away segments showing massive explosions inside Kobane, which video captions claim show ISIS fighters carrying out suicide bomb attacks.

Similarities: The new ISIS video resembles a scene from the popular video game Call of Duty (pictured) Terror: The footage features a number of cut away segments showing massive explosions inside Kobane, which video captions claim show ISIS fighters carrying out suicide bomb attacks . The video was released on December 9 through one of ISIS' many YouTube channels and has since been repeatedly shared by militants and their sympathisers on Twitter and Facebook. It begins by showing jihadis charging through the battered streets of Kobane brandishing large assault rifles, which are fired indiscriminately at targets around the city. The footage - which seems to have been shot on a helmet camera - is clearly dubbed to include the additional sound of gunfire, with each scene cleverly edited to make it appear as if the terrorists are characters in a video game. The clip then cuts to the same kind of high-quality aerial shots of Kobane that were previously seen at the start of a recent ISIS propaganda video featuring the British hostage John Cantlie.

Rampaging: The video, which has not been independently verified, was released by an Aleppo-based branch of ISIS' propaganda wing . Filmed using a drone - a type of unmanned aircraft - the film shows the rubble-strewn streets and surrounding desert of Kobane, which lies just a few yards south of the Syrian border with Turkey. At several points the camera freezes and a caption pops up identifying each location where an ISIS suicide bombing allegedly took place. A few seconds of footage showing the explosion then appear, before the drone continues its journey to the next attack site. The video, which has not been independently verified, was released by an Aleppo-based branch of ISIS' propaganda wing. Usually such films are put out by the better known Al-Hayat Media Centre, which has become infamous for creating the terror group's sickening videos showing the beheading of Westerners, including Britons David Haines and Alan Henning.

YPG fighters wander through destroyed centre of Kobane, where fighting has taken place since September . Kobane has been under attack from ISIS militants since mid-September, when the terror group assaulted its southern suburbs in an attempt to seize control of the strategic border city. The terror group quickly encircled the city, raping and murdering its inhabitants, but brave Kurdish YPG fighters supported by U.S. airstrikes have since pushed ISIS back out of central Kobane. Yesterday the U.S. confirmed it had launched a further 20 airstrikes against ISIS targets, including raids near Sinjar, Qaim, Ramadi, Mosul and Samarra, as well as inside Kobane. Taking their rest: Fighters from Kurdish popular defense units YPJ (women) and YPG  (men) gather during a short break break before heading out to assault for new positions in Kobane . Smoke rises in Kobane after American warplanes carry out an attack on an Islamic State-held building . Earlier this week Brett McGurk, deputy special presidential envoy to the coalition to counter ISIS, told the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee that America and partner nations have conducted more than 500 airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria - the vast majority of them in Kobane. 'As of today, that assault has failed and has resulted in nearly 1,000 ISIL fighters killed, including many leaders,' he said, using an alternative acronym for the terror group. However Republicans and Democrats complained that the White House's response to ISIS has been lackluster, with Rep. Ed Royce, the committee chairman, saying Washington is 'still dithering.' Royce said ISIS still controls essentially the same amount of territory it did in the summer and U.S.-backed groups in Syria still do not have the support they need to fight the extremists - and defend themselves from bombs dropped by Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces. Islamic State terrorists fighting in Iraq have released a video showing jihadis posing with a drone that was shot down near the city of Kirkuk. The three-minute video begins by showing a Elbit Skylark drone crashed in a grassy area having crash landed in an area under the control of ISIS militants. It then shows the terrorists waiting several hours before going to recover the drone - suggesting they were in an area of Kirkuk close to the frontline with the Iraqi army, who they feared may attack them attempted to perform the recovery without the cover of darkness. Proud: The three-minute video begins by showing a Elbit Skylark drone crashed in a grassy area having crash landed in an area under the control of ISIS militants . Having recovered the drone, the terrorists then take it into a covered room, where it is proudly displayed in front of ISIS' chilling black banner. Close-up shots reveal the drone to have markings and instructions written in English, suggesting it is likely to have been either an American military drone, or one provided to the Iraqi army by the United States, who expensively trained and largely equipped the domestic security forces. Skylark drones, developed by Elbit Systems, are miniature unmanned aerial vehicles designed  for tactical surveillance and reconnaissance missions. During operation, it sends real-time video to a portable ground station. Camera: Close-up shots reveal the drone to have markings and instructions written in English . The reason the drone appears largely intact despite having apparently crash-landed is because it contains a small inflatable cushion that reduces damage in the event of a ground impact. As the Skylark can cover a distance of up to 25 miles in a single journey, it has widely been used for surveillance in war zones, including in both Afghanistan and Iraq, . Countries known to still be using this particular model of drone include France, Australia, Canada and Israel.","Four-minute video shows ISIS militants engaged in fierce gun battles .

"Defence: Former CIA chief Michael Hayden told CNN that 'rectal hydration' was a legitimate 'medical procedure' used when detainees were dehydrated . The CIA's former director general  has defended the use of rectal hydration on terror suspects following a series of damning revelations over the agency's  interrogation methods on detainees following the September 11 attacks. Michael Hayden told CNN that the tactic was a legitimate 'medical procedure' used when detainees were dehydrated. He said the the decision to perform the invasive method of rehydration was made because giving them intravenous fluids with needles was too dangerous. 'I'm not a doctor,' he told CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper. 'What I am told is that this is one of the ways that the body is rehydrated.' The revelations came after Senate Intelligence Committee Democrats released a report detailing a variety of 'torture' techniques meted out on terror suspects at a top-secret network of black sites dotted across the world. They include claims interrogators blended the food of at least five detainees - including two of the most infamous, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Abu Zubaydah - before 'rectally infusing' the concoction into their bodies. It comes as US spymaster John Brennan admitted on Thursday that some CIA interrogators had used unauthorized and 'abhorrent' tactics in the past decade and said he believes torture tends to lead to false intelligence. In an extraordinary news conference, broadcast live from the agency's Langley headquarters in what is believed to be a first in CIA history, Brennan mounted a stout defense of his officers, saying the vast majority of them did not mistreat prisoners. But, in the wake of a damning Senate report into CIA treatment of Al-Qaeda suspects that triggered global revulsion, he confirmed that some had gone beyond their orders and abused detainees. Brennan said the torture came amid fear of another wave of violence from Al-Qaeda after the September 11, 2001 attacks, as the Central Intelligence Agency scrambled to take on a task it had virtually no experience with. 'We were not prepared,' he said, describing how then president George W. Bush had approved the so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' now denounced as torture. The report by the Senate Intelligence Committee Democrats includes claims interrogators blended the food of at least five detainees - including two of the most infamous, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (left) and Abu Zubaydah (right) - before 'rectally infusing' the concoction into their bodies . 'Abhorrent': It comes as US spymaster John Brennan (pictured) admitted on Thursday that some CIA interrogators had used unauthorized and 'abhorrent' tactics in the past decade and said he believes torture tends to lead to false intelligence . President Barack Obama halted the program upon taking office in 2009 and has since described the Bush-era use of torture by the CIA as counterproductive and an affront to American values. 'In a limited number of cases, agency officers used interrogation techniques that had not been authorized, were abhorrent and rightly should be repudiated by all,' Brennan said. Amid a political row about whether Bush was right to order tough tactics in the wake of the attacks, Brennan said it is impossible to know whether harsh interrogations had won useful intelligence. Damning: The revelations came after Senate Intelligence Committee Democrats released a report detailing a variety of 'torture' techniques meted out on terror suspects at a network of top-secret black sites dotted across the world . 'I tend to believe that the use of coercive methods has a strong prospect for resulting in false information,' he said. Brennan said information from detainees was indeed useful in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, but it was impossible to say whether the 'enhanced' interrogation had been necessary. 'There's no way to know if information obtained from an individual who had been subjected at some point during his confinement could have been obtained through other means,' he said. Brennan refused to say whether the methods amounted to torture, but said the CIA was no longer involved in detaining and interrogating suspects and has adopted reforms to prevent such abuses from happening again. As the program had been scrapped, it was time to 'move forward,' he said. But Brennan blasted this week's Senate intelligence committee report that accused the CIA of misleading the US government and public for years about the scale and success of its torture methods. Committee chair Senator Dianne Feinstein, who released the report after a long wrangle with the CIA over what should be redacted, responded to Brennan point-by-point during his appearance. 'CIA helps keep our nation safe, strong. Torture does not. We must learn from our mistakes,' her staff wrote on Twitter. She said the 500-page executive summary released on Tuesday was a small part of a 6,700-page report, and denied that lawmakers had cherry-picked damning material. And she disputed the idea that it could not be known whether torture -- known as enhanced interrogation techniques, or EITs -- had led the CIA to its quarry. 'Study definitively proves EITs did not lead to bin Laden. Page 378,' her staff tweeted. The report into the spy agency's abuse of Al-Qaeda suspects in a network of secret prisons around the world between 2002 and 2009 triggered global outrage and demands for justice. Rights groups demanded US prosecutors charge officials who approved the torture. 'If we don't hold officials accountable for ordering that conduct, our government will adopt these methods again in the future,' said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. 'Small part': Committee chair Senator Dianne Feinstein, who released the report after a long wrangle with the CIA over what should be redacted, said the 500-page executive summary released on Tuesday was a small part of a 6,700-page report, and denied that lawmakers had cherry-picked damning material . Obama has condemned the torture, but has refused to say whether he thinks it is sometimes effective. White House spokesman Josh Earnest refused a 'yes or no' question as to whether Obama believes that torture saves lives. 'The most important question is: Should we have done it? And the answer to that question is 'no',' he said. 'The president does not believe that the use of enhanced interrogation techniques was good for our national security.' According to the report, Bush only learned details of it in 2006, four years after it started in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. But, speaking to Fox News, former vice president Dick Cheney denied Bush was kept out of the loop. He said the then-president 'was in fact an integral part of the program and he had to approve it.' Detainees were beaten, waterboarded -- some of them dozens of times -- and humiliated through the painful use of medically unnecessary 'rectal feeding' and 'rectal rehydration'.","Michael Hayden said the tactic was used when detainees were dehydrated .

"While Tim Krul has been hailed as the hero for Holland in the quarter-final penalty shoot-out his antics as Costa Rica players approached to take their kicks went beyond gamesmanship. The Newcastle goalkeeper should have been told to stop his face-pulling and sledging by Uzbek referee Ravshan Irmatov who had been excellent until that point.

However, because Irmatov failed even to warn Krul it is hard to blame the Dutchman too much for continuing to try to unsettle the Costa Rica penalty-takers. There was debate as to whether it was fair for Holland coach Louis Van Gaal to make the late substitution which enabled him to put on the goalkeeper he thought best to face the spot-kicks.

"It is a growing health issue that threatens to trigger cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Sitting for longer than four hours a day increases a person's chance of suffering chronic disease. Now, inspired to address the lack of physical activity in modern work life, one French designer believes he might have created the answer. With just two legs, the 'Inactivite' chair relies on the user engaging the muscles in their core to keep it upright. Benoit Malta, the man behind the creation, said he wanted to encourage movement for those office workers who spent around 70 per cent of the day sitting down. Scroll down for video . With just two legs, the 'Inactivite' chair relies on the user engaging the muscles in their core to keep it upright . The chair passively stimulates other parts of the body, in a similar way to an exercise ball, forcing the user to have better posture. French designer Benoit Malta said he was inspired to combat physical inactivity . The chair creates a slight discomfort, as the user has to keep shifting position to keep it stable. It passively stimulates other parts of the body, in a similar way to an exercise ball, forcing the user to have better posture. The chair is not meant to be sat in for long periods, just a couple of hours at a time. Mr Malta worked with ergonomists and physical therapists to refine the structure, which took nine months to research and develop. When the chair is not being used, it has to be propped against a wall or table. And despite looking risky, the design prevents people from falling while using it. 'Our living spaces are conceived with the idea of time-saving and cutting down on physical activity,' said Mr Malta. 'Stationary behaviour is so common now, most people have little physical activity during the day. 'People watch a lot of TV and work on computers and many people suffer from spine and muscular problems because of this stationary behaviour. 'Companies are coming up with products to make our lives easier, such as autonomous vacuum cleaners or other domestic robots, but trying to offer consumers an easier life creates lots of health problems. Mr Malta worked with ergonomists and physical therapists to refine the structure, which took nine months to research and develop . A study published last year found those office workers who spend more than four hours a day sitting down are at greater risk of chronic illnesses, including cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Those sitting for at least six hours were significantly more likely to have diabetes. The research involved 63,048 middle-aged men but U.S. scientists said the findings are likely to also apply to women. Professor Richard Rosenkranz, who led the study at Kansas State University, said the more people sat, the bigger the health problems. He said ‘We saw a steady stair-step increase in risk of chronic diseases the more participants sat. ‘The group sitting more than eight hours clearly had the highest risk.’ The latest study follows research in 2012 on 222,000 people which found sitting down too long increases your risk of dying within three years, even among the physically active. 'Our houses are becoming more and more comfortable and people would not imagine a house built with the idea of discomfort. 'But discomfort can put the body in motion and out of its chronic stationary posture. 'The chair is an important part of your life, as most of us stay sitting for more than 70 per cent of the day. 'The challenge of the chair was to propose a product which tried to encourage movement. 'I wanted to design a chair that had a visual impact but was also efficient on the human body. 'The structure of the chair was designed in order to prevent people falling out - the legs have been inclined 12 degrees relative to the vertical axis and the height of the back was designed to help prevent it. 'At the moment, the chair is a unique piece. I didn't design it to be sold by a furniture brand and mass produced. 'Design is not just about filling a gap in the market, the practice of design can be used to make people think about ourselves to change our behaviours. 'I hope it will encourage people to try to be more active.'","The 'Inactivite' chair aims to encourage the user to move at their desk .

"England breathed a sigh of relief after it emerged that Chris Robshaw’s shoulder injury will keep him out for only ‘three to four weeks’. The England captain was ruled out of Saturday's European Rugby Champions Cup match against Leinster, raising fears he could need an operation on the shoulder which would rule him out of the Six Nations. But a statement from Harlequins said that ‘following consultation with a specialist, the RFU and the Harlequins medical team, Robshaw is expected to return in three to four weeks’. Chris Robshaw is set to be fit to captain England at the Six Nations despite his shoulder injury . Robshaw, 28, will not need surgery, but he stands to miss Premiership games against Newcastle, Northampton, London Welsh and Leicester on top of the trip to Dublin. The European Champions Cup clash with Wasps on the third weekend of January offers his most likely route back to playing, with Quins completing their European group campaign against Castres a week later. While a bitter blow to his club, the news that Robshaw’s absence will be limited to up to a month will be welcomed by England. The openside, who played every minute of the autumn series, will be at the helm when England open their Six Nations against Wales in Cardiff on February 6 and will almost certainly lead the assault on the 2015 World Cup. Elsewhere, fly-half Quade Cooper has made himself available for World Cup selection after signing a contract extension with the Australian Rugby Union until the end of 2015. Robshaw captained England to victory over Australia at Twickenham last month in their autumn international . The 26-year-old Queensland Red lost the Wallabies’ starting No 10 position to New South Wales Waratah Bernard Foley when sidelined with a shoulder injury but played an impact role off the bench during the season-ending tour to Europe. Wallabies coach Michael Cheika said: ‘I’ve really enjoyed coaching Quade on tour. He’s clearly a quality player and has proven himself at state and national level for many seasons.’ A mercurial talent with 53 Test caps, Cooper has struggled to reach his once-dazzling best after suffering a serious knee injury at the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand, the country of his birth.","Chris Robshaw suffered a shoulder injury against Leinster .

"I’m trying to keep my anger in check so let’s start with the positive. Rory McIlroy, the world’s No 1 golfer, is on the shortlist and deserves to be after a sensational season. Lewis Hamilton is on it too after exploiting to the full a technically outstanding car to complete a brilliant series of drives which took him to the Formula One championship. They are joined by Jo Pavey, the mother of two who, aged nearly 41, pulled a beautifully executed tactical race to win the 10,000 metres at athletics’ European Championships in Zurich. Her triumph in August made her the oldest female to win a gold medal in the history of the championships. Sam Burgess fractured his cheekbone a minute into the NRL final in October, but played on to the end . Burgess thunders into the Harlequins defence with his first touch of a rugby ball in union for Bath . The Rabbitohs legend will make his first start for Bath at inside centre against Montpellier on Saturday . What a story – so good, in fact, that Pavey, along with McIlroy and Hamilton, have been rightly recognised as proper candidates for the Sports Personality of the Year award which will be announced on BBC 1 on Sunday evening. But as for the remaining seven on the shortlist – do me a favour! I just can’t believe that one of sport’s outstanding players can’t even make the top 10. I’m talking about Sam Burgess, rugby league player supreme and now, having decided to switch codes, destined to be a major figure if England are to have any chance of winning rugby union’s World Cup next year. Golf star Rory McIlory (left) and British Formula One hero Lewis Hamilton have both made the shortlist . Lewis Hamilton (Formula One) Rory McIlroy (Golf) Charlotte Dujardin (Dressage) Charlotte Evans (Skiing) Carl Froch (Boxing) Kelly Gallagher (Skiing) Max Whitlock (Gymnastics) Adam Peaty (Swimming) Gareth Bale (Football) Lizzy Yarnold (Skeleton racing) Jo Pavey (Running) I know Burgess has been playing in Australia for four years and only recently returned to this country by signing for Bath. But he was an awesome teenager for Bradford Bulls and made his international debut when only 19. South Sydney Rabbitohs recognised Burgess’s supreme talents and co-owner and acting superstar Russell Crowe persuaded Burgess to choose his club as the battle to secure his signature hotted up. He had an outstanding four years for the Rabbitohs and earned a reputation as teak tough, a no-nonsense forward whose ball handling skills put him up there with the best sportsmen and women in the world. His final game in Australia makes him a sporting icon, a legend, a hero all rolled into one. For those unfamiliar with this instance of sporting greatness, a little recap. The South Sydney Rabbitohs played Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in the 2014 NRL Grand Final and in the very first tackle of the game Burgess fractured a cheekbone and an eye socket. Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe (left) brought Burgess to play rugby league in Sydney four years ago . Despite the pain, Burgess in an extreme act of selflessness played on, not wanting to let his team-mates down. He was in supreme form in the game, which his side won, and he was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for best player in the grand final - the first South Sydney player to claim the medal in 43 years. Burgess has also made the shortlist for the coveted Golden Boot Award. The award is given to the player deemed to have been the best in the world that season. Burgess could become the third British player to receive the award since it was restarted in 1999, following in the footsteps of Kevin Sinfield (2012) and Andy Farrell (2004). What more does a player have to do get his talent recognised in his home country? I simply cannot believe that the panel that compiled the shortlist — including Olympians Rebecca Adlington and Denise Lewis, Paralympian Baroness Tanni-Grey Thompson and footballer Jason Roberts (quite how he ranks with the first three goodness only knows!) plus BBC bigwigs I’ve never heard of — can ignore one of the great British sporting heroes. Burgess celebrates the Rabbitohs' first NRL Grand FInal win in 43 years with team-mate Greg Inglis . So when the Great British Viewing Public are sitting by their televisions on Sunday evening and the counts come in for the shortlist also-rans like dressage’s Charlotte Dujardin (unless the horsey brigade get behind her!), breaststroke swimmer Adam Peaty and boxer Carl Froch, spare a thought for one man whose talent has been totally ignored. How can it possibly be Sports Personality of the Year when the one sportsman who oozes bravery and talent in equal measure doesn’t even make the shortlist? Stand up, Sam Burgess — you’re my SPOTY winner! The shortlist compilers and the Great British Viewing Public don’t have a clue.","Sam Burgess signed for Bath after a stellar rugby league career .

"Bowing her head in shame, a senior Korean Air executive whose 'nut rage' delayed a flight made a grovelling apology for exploding with rage after her snack was served in a bag. Screaming Cho Hyun-ah, a senior vice-president at the airline, angrily demanded the removal of a crew member from a flight for failing to serve nuts in a bowl. She then forced the Incheon-bound flight to taxi back to the terminal at New York's JFK Airport to kick the junior flight attendant off the plane. Scroll down for video . Cho Hyun-ah, a senior vice-president at Korean Air, apologised for delaying a plane leaving New York's JFK Airport over the way she was served nuts . Korean Air Flight 86 was already on the runway for its departure from when Cho lost her temper at the unidentified worker after they broke protocol and placed the a bag of macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class, instead of putting them in a bowl . Cho demanded that the attendant bring out the company’s in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines. When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered pilots to turn the plane around so he could get off the flight . Korean Air Lines had earlier excused her behavior even as it apologized for inconveniencing passengers. It said it was 'natural' for Cho to fault crew's ignorance of procedures . Clad in a long black coat, with her head bowed in shame Cho told reporters in an almost inaudible, trembling voice that she was 'sorry' about the December 5 incident. 'I sincerely apologize.' she said, gloomy-faced, adding that she will 'apologize sincerely' at a meeting with the victimized crew member. Adding to her humiliation, her father and airline chairman Cho Yang-ho called her behaviour 'foolish' and said that he regretted that he didn't raise her better. He added that his eldest would resign from her executive roles at all affiliates of Hanjin, the group that controls Korean Air. Flight 86 was already on the runway for its departure when Cho lost her temper after an unidentified worker placed some macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class.

When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him to get off the flight. 'The chief flight attendant failed to get the right manual, and this led Cho to believe he was not qualified for that job,' a Korean Air official told the Korean Times at the time. Cho's father, the chairman of Korean Air called his daughter foolish and said he regretted not raising her better: Cho Yang-ho also the public for forgiveness. Transport ministry officials are now checking whether she violated aviation safety law . Without giving the 250 passengers on board a warning, the pilots decided to give in to her demands and return to the airport to drop off the attendant, delaying the flight by around 20 minutes. Her entitled actions caused an uproar in her home country and abroad. South Korean media called the 40-year-old a princess and while others branded her an embarrassment to her country. Earlier this week, Cho resigned as Korean Air's head of cabin service but retained other executive roles at the airline and its affiliated companies. In a separate probe, prosecutors searched the headquarters of Korean Air Lines on Thursday after a civil society group laid a complaint about Cho's behavior on the plane.

"The Harvard Business School professor who blasted a family-run Chinese restaurant for overcharging him $4 has previously attacked a sushi place in a dispute over a Groupon. Associate professor Benjamin Edelman complained to the owners the of Sichuan Garden in Brookline, Boston, after he was charged $1 more on each of the four items he ordered for takeout recently. But it wasn't the first unsatisfactory encounter that caused him to vent his frustrations via email. After the Osushi restaurant in the city's Back Bay refused to apply his Groupon coupon toward their prix fixe menu in 2010, he threatened to take his complaint to the city's licensing board. Ben Edelman, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard,apologized after his threatening email exchange with a Chinese restaurant made headlines, but it wasn't his first . In the email, published by Boston.com, he claimed he would fight to strip the establishment of its alcohol license 'if it does not honor its contractual commitments'. He wrote: 'I call on you to honor my three Osushi Groupon vouchers. 'I also call on you to extend their validity for six weeks to reflect the day imposed by our resolution of this dispute. 'If I don't hear from you within the next 15 days, or if we can't resolve this matter privately, I will forward my complaint to the City of Boston Licensing Board, writing in opposition to your Common Victualler License and Alcoholic Beverages License. Mr Edelman sent threatening emails to the management of Osushi restaurant, pictured, after staff refused to apply his Groupon to the prix fixe menu in 2010 . 'I will argue that the City of Boston ought not renew such license to a restaurant that does not honor its contractual commitments.' But instead of apologizing to the stubborn customer, like Sichuan Garden did recently, Mr Edelman was banned from returning to the sushi restaurant. Osushi restaurant's management replied to the email, blasting his ego and saying he should be 'ashamed' of his business practices. They added police would be called if he ignored the warning and added they would give him a refund for his Groupon because  'NO ONE in retail should have to deal with someone who's [sic] ego is as large as yours'. Osushi opened in the lobby of The Westin Hotel in Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood in 2002, but closed last year. Apologetic: Ran Duan, the son of the restaurant's owners who manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden, responded to Edelman in a courteous way . 'I will argue that the City of Boston ought not renew such license to a restaurant that does not honor its contractual commitments.' Osushi restaurant's management replied to the email, blasting his ego and saying he should be 'ashamed' of his business practices. After initially going to great lengths to get Sichuan Garden to credit him $12, Mr Edelman apologized profusely for his bullying behavior .

Osushi opened in the lobby of The Westin Hotel in Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood in 2002, but closed last year. The Sichuan Garden incident began on Friday when Edelman ordered $53.53 worth of takeout from the restaurant and was shocked when the bill was $4 more than he had added up using the online menu. The restaurant owner's son Ran Duan admitted that their website was 'out of date' and that the prices of each dish had gone up about $1, causing the Harvard Business School professor to send a barrage of threatening emails that were made public by Boston.com. He demanded a $12 refund - three times the amount he was overcharged - and also contacted local officials to demand the restaurant compensate all other customers who might have been affected. But on Tuesday, Mr Edelman posted a message on his personal website admitting that his lengthy emails with Mr Duan were 'out of line' and that he has reached out to the restaurant to apologize. 'Having reflected on my interaction with Ran, including what I said and how I said it, it’s clear that I was very much out of line,' he wrote on his website. 'I aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others, no matter what the situation. Clearly I failed to do so. I am sorry, and I intend to do better in the future.' He added he had also reached out to the owner to apologize to him personally as well. Mr Duan said he has been overwhelmed by the support he has received from people as far afield as Australia offering donations and support with his website and legal advice. Mr Edelman had ordered takeout from the Sichuan Garden in Brookline, Boston, pictured . 'I just want to make clear that we are not a business in financial distress. We have been blessed with the support of our amazing community and hospitality family that has understood the value of a hard working family. Your support and kind words are more then enough,' he wrote. Duan said he had also increased an increase in business as a result of the publicity that the story had generated and that he had received 'overwhelming' support from Harvard graduates and the student body. 'I believe that one man’s actions should not be the burden of another. I just want to apologize to Harvard for all the negative association they have been linked with this ordeal. I also believe that something good can come out of all this situation,' he wrote.

"Early humans first began to master fire around 350,000 years ago, helping to drive the development of complex culture among our ancestors, new archaeological evidence has revealed. Flint fragments discovered in a cave in the limestone cliffs of Mount Carmel, close to Haifa on the Mediterranean coast of northern Israel, have provided the oldest signs of humans controlling fire. The Tabun Cave is an archaeological site that holds evidence of having being inhabited by humans and their ancestors for around 500,000 years. Flints found in the Tabun Cave showed signs of having been blackened and turned red by flames while others showed characteristic round pits where part of the stone had flaked off in the heat in what are called 'pot lids' By examining flint debris and tools found in the cave, archaeologists found that some of them show discolouration, cracking and small round depressions that are signs of exposure to fire. The researchers looked at flints from 100 layers of sediment in the lowermost 16 metres of the cave. In those that are older than 350,000 years, none of the flints were found to be burned. However, after that there is a sudden explosion in the number of flints that were exposed to fire. Exactly when humans first began using fire to make their lives easier remains one of the most controversial topics in archaeology. The earliest suggested date is around 1.5 million years ago. However, some research suggests that our ancestors first began using fire to cook their food as far back as two million years ago. Cooking meat played a vital role in human evolution, making it easier to digest, reducing the time it took to feed and requiring smaller teeth. A study in 2011 by biologists at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts compared the body patterns, DNA and other characteristics of modern humans, non-human primates and 14 extinct hominins. They found used the information to look for patterns when eating time began to reduce. They calculated that if humans were ordinary primates living off raw food, eating would take up 48 per cent of their day. However, modern humans spend just 4.7 per cent of their day to food consumption. They suggest that the evolution of smaller teeth in Homo erectus around 1.9 million years ago coincided with a change in diet that may have been driven by the cooking of food. Given that wildfires rarely spread into caves due to the lack of vegetation, the scientists believe these flints were burned in the fires built within the cave by prehistoric humans. The discovery means our human ancestors in this area of Israel mastered control of fire nearly 50,000 years before other widely accepted evidence  found to support the regular human use of fire. It could bring new understanding to the development of culture and human behaviour. While 350,000 years ago, the lower Paeleolithic period, is too late for fire to have played a role in the development of human's big brains as some scientists have suggested, it would have played a key role in the origins of social behaviour, argue the scientists behind the latest study. It has also been suggested that control of fire was one of the key developments that allowed early humans to spread into colder climates, but this expansion had already begun by 350,000 years ago. Dr Ron Shimelmitz, an archaeologist at the University of Haifa who led the new study, said: 'Understanding the time frame of this ""technological mutation"" will help explain aspects of our anatomical evolution and encephalization over the last million years. 'It will also provide an important perspective on hominin dispersals out of Africa and the colonization of temperate environments, as well as the origins of social developments such as the formation of provisioned base camps.' Early humans are widely accepted to have gained complete widespread control of fire by around 125,000 years ago with the ability to kindle and light fires themselves. However, the time when human ancestors first gained this essential technological ability has been highly controversial. Tabun Cave at Mount Carmel in northern Israel holds evidence of early humans from up to 500,000 years ago . The Tabun Cave was discovered in the limestone cliffs of Mount Carmel around 14 miles south of Haifa, Israel . Some anthropologists claim that early humans, such asHomo erectus, began exploiting fire as long as 1.5 million years ago while still in Africa. However, much of this evidence - which consists of heated clays and charcoal fragments - is disputed and could have occurred as a result of natural bush fires. There are some who believe that fire played an instrumental role in the evolution of early hominins around two million years ago when our teeth and guts became smaller. They have also argued that fire played a key role in the evolution of larger human brains. However, many experts believe that early uses of fire may well have been opportunistic where early humans used natural bush fires rather than lighting fires themselves. The artifacts found at these sites often show few signs of burning, suggesting fire was not used regularly, according to Dr Shimelmitz and his colleagues, whose research is published in the Journal of Human Evolution. They say their findings at Tabun Cave are supported by evidence from other recent discoveries. Burnt flints, bones and ash found in the Qesem Cave in Tel Aviv, Israel, point towards the use of a hearth in this cave that has been dated to around 300,000 years ago. Dr Shimelmitz, along with other researchers from the University of Haifa and the University of Arizona, said: 'While the earliest evidence of fire associated with hominin activities is much older, the data presented here indicate that fire became a regular and constant part of hominin behavioral adaptations in Eurasia only after 350,000 years ago. 'The benefits of fire for processing food, altering raw materials or enhancing social interactions would be fully realized only when use of fire shifted from opportunistic and occasional to habitual and regular. Thousands of flints fragments with signs of exposure to heat and fire have been discovered in the Tabun Cave. They begin appearing in the lower Paleaolithic period around 350,000 years ago but none are seen before then . 'Regular use of fire changed hominin existence and influenced the direction of evolution in our lineage in a diversity of ways . 'To the extent that humans' physical, cognitive and social evolution was affected by the emergence of habitual fire use, we should be able to trace evidence for such impacts most clearly in the hominins that inhabited the landscape over the last 350,000 years ago.' Tabun Cave has proved to be a rich site for archaeological evidence and is thought to have been inhabited intermittently through the Lower and Middle Paleolithic ages between 500,000 and 40,000 yaers ago. Around 82 feet of sand, silt and clay have built up in the cave, allowing archaeologists to date the signs of human habitation left in each layer. Among the remains found there were the skull fragments and bones from a female Neanderthal, that is thought to be around 120,000 years old. Large numbers of deer bones have also been found there, which has led to suggests that is served as a place where animals were trapped and then butchered by humans. Hundreds of flint tools, used to scrape and cut, have also been discovered together with thousands of fragments that have broken off as tools were shaped. Flint handaxes are among the stone tools to have been discovered in sediment layers in Tabun Cave in Israel . However, Dr Shimelmitz said it was still unclear how the fires were started in the cave and may have been either by sparking kindling or keeping fire alight from natural bush fires. He said: 'The changes in burning frequency at Tabun and Qesem not only signal the point in time where the use of fire became habitual, but also indicate that humans had mastered the art of kindling fire. 'Unfortunately there are no means currently available to directly determine how ancient fires were started, so the latter remains simply a hypothesis for the time being.' Dr Simon Underdown, an athropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said the latest findings in Israel were 'exciting'. He said: 'While we have evidence of fire use going back to almost 1 million years, it only appears irregularly and does not seem to have be a widespread behaviour - perhaps just being used by one or two bright sparks. 'Crucially this paper shows that by at least 350,000 years ago fire was being regularly used as a tool by our ancestors. 'Having the ability to make and control fire, along with projectile weapons and stone tools, further cemented our position as an apex predator of the Pleistocene. 'Fire use is one of the most important developments in human evolution but also very difficult to recognise in the archaeological record. 'Burnt material could have been from intentional campfires or from natural events such as bush fires. 'Fire allows food to be cooked which increases the calories in the diet while reducing the amount of energy our ancestors needed to use collecting it. But fire was also an important social tool. 'The heat allowed expansion into cold areas and the light extended the day and offered protection from predators. 'The attraction of an open fire is an old and primordial one for humans and here we can see the origins of that fascination.'","Burnt flints from Tabun Cave in northern Israel may help to rewrite history of human evolution and development of culture .
Control of fire is too recent to explain the evolution of humans' big brains .
But it would have shaped the development of human culture and behaviour .
Fire use seems to have occurred after humans expanded into cold climates .
Evidence is thought to be 50,000 years older than any previously finds ."
"Liverpool have taken the first steps to make Luis  Suarez the highest paid player in their history after they flew to Barcelona to begin talks with his agent. Ian Ayre, Liverpool’s managing director, met Pere Guardiola — the brother of Bayern Munich manager Pep — in Catalonia on Tuesday to talk about Suarez extending and improving his terms, which are now in the region of £100,000 per week. Suarez extended his contract in August 2012. It runs until June 2016. VIDEO: Watch Suarez win Player of the Year at the Football Supporter's Awards below .

Suarez has spearheaded Liverpool this season with 17 goals from 12 league games . Wealth management: Steven Gerrard (left) is set to fall behind Luis Suarez in the Anfield pay stakes . And the Uruguay international has proved, with 17 goals in 12 Barclays Premier League games this season, that he is one of the top performers in the world and Liverpool are anxious to reward him — and keep him out of the arms of rivals. If Suarez agrees to a deal that would take him past Steven Gerrard in Liverpool’s earning list, it would complete a remarkable journey. He was angling for a move to a Champions League club in August and accused Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers of ‘breaking promises’ by not letting him leave.

'He could sign a new contract now, take the £200,000 a week, the team finishes outside the top four and you have the same shenanigans. 'I want him to stay but there needs to be clarity.

"David Warner scored his second century of the match as Australia set the platform for a final-day push for victory in the first Test against India in Adelaide. The in-form opener added 102 to his first-innings 145, the second time in 2014 that he has scored two tons in a Test, having notched 135 and 145 against South Africa in March. The left-hander now has 1,061 runs in seven Tests this year, with six centuries and three half-centuries. David Warner celebrates as he reaches his second century on day four of the first Test in Adelaide .

Warner (right) celebrates his century with Australian team-mate Steve Smith with the late Phillip Hughes' Test cap number 408 displayed on the pitch . Warner was not without some fortune on a niggly fourth day at the Adelaide Oval, though, as he was given out when on 63 only to be brought back as bowler Varun Aaron had over-stepped, an incident which saw tempers flare between the sides. The Australia opener also gloved a ball to the wicket-keeper down the leg-side but was given not out, while he was also dropped at gully by Murali Vijay on 89. Warner was finally dismissed in the final session, bowled round his legs attempting a reverse sweep at Karn Sharma, but Australia went on the offensive in the closing stages. Some late hitting from Steve Smith (52 not out) and Mitchell Marsh (40 off 26 balls) helped Australia close the fourth day on 290 for five with a lead of 363, which leaves India facing a likely battle to avoid defeat on day five. The tourists were earlier bowled out for 444 having resumed on 369 for five, with Nathan Lyon finishing with five for 134. The off-spinner was looking just as dangerous as he was the evening before and he snared Rohit Sharma caught and bowled for 43.

Lyon also claimed the wickets of Wriddhiman Saha and Ishant Sharma while Peter Siddle sent back Karn Sharma and Mohammed Shami - who led a late counter-attack with a quickfire 34 - as India were bowled out before lunch. That left Australia with a lead of 73 and they quickly set about adding to that advantage, making lunch on 32 without loss. The hosts lost Chris Rogers softly soon after the resumption, the opener sweeping Karn Sharma to Rohit Sharma at midwicket for 21, but his fellow left-hander Warner was motoring along at the other end. The batsman took a moment to applaud when news came through of Sean Abbott's figures of six for 14 for New South Wales in his first match since bowling the ball which killed Phillip Hughes, and Warner also took another moment to remember his former team-mate when he reached 63. Australia captain Michael Clarke walks from the field after being dismissed on day four . A tribute to Hughes with the number 63 can be seen from inside the scoreboard at the Adelaide Oval . Soon after Warner was trudging off, thinking he had been clean bowled by Aaron as he attempted a huge sweep. But Aaron had over-stepped his mark, and when Warner returned he mocked Aaron's celebrations as he echoed his screams of ""Come on!"" back at the bowler. That raised the temperature out in the middle and angry words were exchanged between the players more than once with the umpires forced to intervene - something that was repeated again later in the day. It did not rattle Australia however, and although Shane Watson (33) and captain Michael Clarke (seven) came and went, Warner - while riding his luck - brought up his 11th Test hundred and with the help of some late fireworks from Marsh, which included 24 off a Karn Sharma over, put hosts in a strong position to push for victory.","David Warner scored another century in first Test against India .

"It may look like a set of incredible close-up photographs of exotic wildlife and nature – but these pictures actually feature people who have been cleverly painted from head to toe before strategically posing for the spectacular shots. The astonishingly detailed artworks have been created by the world’s number one body painter, Johannes Stoetter. The 35-year-old artist, who lives in Italy, used five people to recreate the lifelike tropical tree frog – which has quickly become one his most impressive creations. The fine-art painter spends up to five months painstakingly planning and perfecting each one of his amazing creations. Each work of art then takes up to eight hours to complete using special breathable paint. The stunning creations, which include fruit made from painted heads, have earned Johannes the World Body Painting Champion title. Scroll down for video . Mr Stoetter used five people to recreate this lifelike tropical tree frog. One person can be seen in the centre, acting as the frog's backbone, while two others can be seen crouched on the floor, acting as the frog's back legs. Two others are sat upright either side of the 'backbone' with their arms and hands strategically placed to replicate the front legs . The 35-year-old artist, who lives in Italy, plays tricks with the mind thanks to his incredible talent for body art in which he makes his subjects disappear into their backgrounds. Here, the centre pineapple - which is a person's painted head, is almost a replica of the fruits either side . Mr Stoetta was crowned the World Body Painting Champion in 2012 after spending years demonstrating his incredible talent for including intricate detailing when painting human bodies. In his latest set of pictures his artworks replicate exotic nature and wildlife shots . Mr Stoetter, from South Tyrol in Italy, said: 'I did my first body painting experiment in 2000. Five years earlier I had the idea to paint a human body but it took me until I was 23 to try it' The incredible artworks created by Mr Stoetta are mind-blowing and demonstrate the intricate and painstaking attention to detail he applies to each of his creations . The stunning creations, which include fruit made from painted heads, have earned 35-year-old Johannes the world body painting champion title .

The BT Sport choices are Dover Athletic vs Crystal Palace, Accrington or Yeovil vs Manchester United and Everton vs West Ham. The decisions are set to cause travel chaos for fans.

"Most travellers will have had the misfortune of sitting next to an unruly or inconsiderate plane passenger at some point. But spare a thought for the cabin crew who have to endure the irritations of poorly behaved customers on a daily basis. In fact, flight attendants encounter such regular frustrations that they have now been moved to compile lists of passengers' most irritating habits. Scroll down for video . Cabin crew are constantly badgered by demands for upgrades and requests to hold connecting flights . Air stewardess and blogger Sarah Steegar, who works for a major US airline, has revealed her biggest gripes, which include asking the crew to call ahead to hold connecting flights, and constantly asking for upgrades to business and first class. She also admitted that passengers who display ‘aeroplane imperialism’ was a major source of irritation, particularly criticising those who leave litter around their seat. Others have vented their anger at passengers who demand water immediately upon embarking the aircraft and ordering food with their headphones still on. Below is a list of the most reviled passenger habits and questions, which have been detailed by Ms Steegar and others in online blog FlyerTalk, news.com.au and lifestyle website Thrillist.com. Inconsiderate passengers also frequently ask flight attendants to put their bags in the overhead lockers . Doing exercises in the aisles or the galley . One attendant joked to Thrillist.com: ‘Have you heard of that new fitness revolution sweeping the nation where you do yoga in the one space flight attendants have to do their jobs? Yeah, we haven't either’. Passengers who notice empty seats in business class and ask to be upgraded . Occasionally passengers may be upgraded if there is a problem with their economy seats, but upgrades usually only occur at the check-in desk. Passengers who ask flight attendants to put their bags in the overhead lockers . ‘It’s simply not a flight attendant’s job to lift your bag into the overhead locker’, says Ms Steegar. ‘They can help push your bag further in once it’s up there, but lifting it causes too many injuries.’ Asking cabin staff to call ahead to hold a connecting flight . Ms Steegar explained that cabin crew do not have the authority to demand changes to flight schedules. Economy passengers asking to use the first class bathroom . Flight crew never sanction passengers to move between the different class cabins. According to lifestyle website Thrillist.com, attendants rarely find anything more annoying than passengers who keep their headphones in place when speaking to staff . Frequently asking to borrow pens . Although it may appear to be a harmless question, passengers apparently get hugely upset when cabin crew are unable to fulfil the request. Leaving your headphones on while giving your drink order . According to lifestyle website Thrillist.com, attendants rarely find anything more annoying than passengers who keep their headphones in place when speaking to staff. ‘It’s great that remixed Bonnie Tyler gets you super-pumped for that Sacramento to Boise flight, but keeping those Beats glued to your head and screaming “I'll take the whole can” is generally infuriating to everybody around you,' said one. Asking to arrange a switch between seats so a passenger can sit next to their friend . ‘I know it’s no fun to travel separated, but I have no real authority to make people move’, says Ms Steegar. ‘If you’re asking me it means you saw that the seat map was full, you didn’t try at the gate. If it was easy it would have been done already, right?’ 'Aeroplane imperialism' Ms Steegar writes in her online blog: ‘This point involves behaviour that treats the aircraft like personal IKEA furniture. 'Also, no nail clipping, no flossing, please. We want you to feel at home as in ""very welcome"", not for you to literally act like you are ""at home"". 'Or they might, say, leave the wall covered with stickers, which isn’t hurting anything, it seems. 'Except somebody else has to take all those down like they’re the maid, when they only have 10 minutes to clean the whole cabin.' Flight attendant Sarah Steegar says passengers are constantly asking to be upgraded on journeys . The electronic device wars . Refusing to turn off electrical devices when asked to by the plane’s captain is a huge source of frustration for flight attendants. Ms Steegar added: ‘When you act like I – or you – don’t know what ""off"" means, I start thinking ""HULK SMASH!"". 'Like when I had to say to a guy – repeatedly – ""I know your iPad is not off because there are words on the screen"".' 'Generalized obliviousness disorder' ‘Here’s how it plays out,’ says Ms Steegar. '""Please step out of the aisle"". We repeat. We want to say, ""See that line of people to the door? They’re not admiring you; they can’t get past you. Move into your row to dig that book out of your suitcase. I know it’s tight but you can do it"".' Passengers talking during safety demonstrations have become a constant source of anger for cabin crew . Demanding water immediately upon boarding . 'Interestingly, they’ve got these places in airports now where they sell water in convenient plastic containers,' joked one unnamed attendant. 'Perhaps you should ask every other passenger on the plane, because they all seem to know about them.' Talking loudly during the safety demo . One attendant succinctly revealed how frustrating this habit is for cabin crew, telling Thrillist.com: ‘Thank you kind sir for keeping the entire section posted on the latest trends in Las Vegas real estate - something that’s clearly more relevant to the entire plane than, say, HOW THE HELL TO GET OUT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG.’","Sarah Steegar is a flight attendant for a US airline and an online blogger .

"The tables are set, but this abandoned hotel has not seen a single guest for more than two decades. The beds are covered in creeping moss and the corridors, which years ago would have thronged with paying guests, are now eerily silent as the long ago abandoned Plaza Hotel, located in Germany, slowly decays. These haunting pictures taken by a so-called urban explorer tell the story of a once-loved building which has been left to succumb to the forces of nature. Reclaimed by nature: A small tree has taken root on the floor and moss covers the mattress in one of the bedrooms . Atmospheric: A set table lies untouched inside the abandoned Plaza Hotel, located in Germany . Untouched: The bar stands in surprisingly good condition inside the abandoned Plaza Hotel, in pictures taken by London-based photographer Andre Govia . Ruin: The dining table inside the abandoned hotel looks ready for service but the broken slabs of plaster littering the floor tell another story . London-based Andre Govia, 37, decided to venture into the forbidding former guest house for a project documenting his love of abandoned buildings. 'I . have always loved exploring abandoned buildings and one day I was given . an old camera and decided to start documenting the decay,' said Mr . Govia. 'The atmosphere . inside the hotel was creepy and damp; I constantly felt like I was being . watched from the dark corners of the restaurant. Decay: Paint and plaster hang from the wall inside on of the rooms inside the abandoned German hotel . Distressed: A thick layer of dust and dirt cover the floor of one of the hotel's bedroom after years of being allowed to fall into disrepair . 'People are always very interested in the state of the buildings and the way it has been left to rot. 'Most feel that it's a waste and I would agree.' Boasting a swimming pool and at least 50 rooms, the four floor hotel was left abandoned in the mid 1990s. Dry: The swimming pool, which would have once been thronging with guests, lies silent today . Collapse: Debris from collapsed ceilings and walls litter the floor . Andre . explains: 'The most interesting items in the hotel were the retro . fittings and bar area that was almost untouched from decay due to the . position. 'The roof . above them has not collapsed like a lot of other rooms in the building, . which enables them to stay unspoiled for a while longer. 'Inside was cold and damp under as often you find in a building that has been left. 'I . hope my photographs show the way decay has a beauty and also the way . our surroundings are able to be reclaimed by nature when left to fade . away.' Inhospitable: London photographer Andre Govia visited the abandoned hotel to capture the decay in a series of haunting pictures . Dated: Time seems to have stood still inside the abandoned Plaza Hotel, located in Germany . Its majestic dome still directed toward the heavens, now covered in graffiti and left to rust - inside the stunning abandoned astronomical observatory atop a Spanish mountain. Standing 2,605m above sea level in the region of Andalucia, the Mohon del Trigo observatory has been empty for nearly 40 years. The observatory at Mohsn del Trigo was built in 1902 after planners judged the clear skies of the isolated Sierra Nevada mountains to be perfect for stargazing.

Due to several technological advances . the station was obsolete by the middle of the twentieth century and a . new observatory was built nearby in 1976. Mohsn . del Trigo was stripped and abandoned but today it still stands high . above the Spanish countryside, cutting a striking image against the . mountain vistas. Urban explorer Dominique Svenson, 54, ventured inside the derelict structure. Vandalised: Graffiti vandals have used the walls inside the abaconded observatory as their canvas . Decrepit : While the Mohon del Trigo observatory was once a centre for observing the galaxy, it is now a vandalised, rusting wreck . Crumbling: Urban explorer Dominique Svenson said the observatory was in a 'pitiful state', crumbing away under due to the harsh elements . She said: 'It stands in perfect solitude on a steep rise, high above the hustle and bustle of the world below. 'Although . the inside is in a pitiful state, with graffiti on the walls and the . structure showing clear signs of deterioration, the atmosphere is . peaceful. 'I reached the . observatory in the early evening after an exhausting hike but couldn't . resist going a bit further to an adjacent elevation to take a panoramic . picture of the robust building against the landscape.' Mrs Svenson said the vast interior evoked the atmosphere of a golden age of astronomical research. Heyday: Astronomers would come from around the world to wonder at the universe from inside the Mohon del Trigo observatory . She . said: 'While I was there I imagined years gone by. I thought of . astronomers looking through their telescope, the stars shining through . the dome and the milky way spanning high above. 'As . I was leaving the observatory I turned back, and felt respect for this . sturdy little building that has withstood the elements for so long, . battling constant wind and snow. Sometimes snow covers it completely.' Mrs Svenson, of Granada, Spain took the photographs in June 2012. Stargazing: The Mohon del Trigo observatory once housed a 32cm reflector telescope under its impressive dome . New residents: A new set of residents have taken up residence inside the Mohon del Trigo observatory . When . it was first built the observatory belonged to the Jesuit religious . order. It was equipped with a 32cm reflector telescope donated by the . Jesuit University of Georgetown, USA. The observatory was assigned to the University of Granada in 1972. The structure is still owned by the university today. In its heyday Mohon del Trigo observatory was used intensively by astronomers from all over the world. In . particular, a long-standing collaboration was established with the . Royal Greenwich Observatory which involved a frequent interchange of . personnel. Decay: The gears which once would have positioned the dome have now become rusted and corroded after years of being exposed to the elements . Corrosion: The dome is now firmly stuck in position and the moving gears rusted . View of the heavens: The observatory's rusting dome is still open to the stars . Crystal clear: The stunning clear blue sky and clean air attracted the first stargazers to the mountains in the Sierra Nevada range of Andalucia where they later built this observatory . During the height of the Cold War, this top secret site would have been an impenetrable fortress. The site was home to one of the former superpower's classified weapons manufacturing plants called Hydropribor which made cutting edge underwater munitions.

"With abundant sunshine, palm trees and a view of a volcano and , it's rather a distracting spot for a library. But Hawaii hopes to build Honolulu-born Barack Obama's presidential library on the beach, with a dramatic view of his hometown's iconic Diamond Head volcanic crater. Visitors would enjoy panoramic views stretching from Diamond Head to the island's lush mountains. And the state's abundant sunshine would generate solar power and support vegetable gardens on site. And officials claimed yesterday, the deadline day for proposals, that the prime 8-acre spot on a rocky shoreline between Waikiki and downtown Honolulu, combined with the state's many tourists, would make the facility one of the nation's most heavily visited presidential centers. An artist rendering shows one of the proposals for a Barack Obama presidential library on a Hawaiian beach . U.S. Senator for Hawaii Brian Schatz said: 'You can't beat waterfront land in Honolulu, with all due respect for the other cities.' Hawaii is competing with bids from Chicago, where Obama spent much of his adult life, and New York, where he attended Columbia University as an undergraduate. A group supported by Hawaii's governor, the University of Hawaii and several other institutions, including Punahou School, where Obama attended from fifth grade until he graduated from high school, submitted its ideas to the Barack Obama Foundation. It included designs from four separate architect teams. Most feature vast, covered, open-air spaces to take advantage of the island's breezes - with one promising to harness the state's plentiful sunshine for solar power. Vegetable gardens would carry on the agricultural tradition first lady Michelle Obama has begun at the White House. An artists rendering shows an aerial view of one of the proposals, which features large, open spaces to take advantage of the state's abundant sunshine . Officials claimed the facility could be one of the nation's most heavily visited presidential centers. Pictured, a CGI image shows one of the designs for the library with a view of the beach . Columbia University said it submitted a proposal for a center in West Harlem, where it is building a satellite campus, but did not reveal any details. And the University of Illinois at Chicago submitted its plan with its community partner North Lawndale in two big binders in a gray box about 3 1/2 inches thick. The Hawaii group emphasized the designs aren't final and are only meant to offer examples of what is possible at the beachfront site. Hawaii would benefit from an influx of capital to build the center — which is expected to come largely from out-of-state fundraising — and $23 million to $42 million in additional state and city tax revenue, the group said. Paul Brewbaker, a Hawaii-based economist, said the library could draw from the eight million tourists who travel to the islands each year, but he questioned whether it would be one of the most-visited presidential centers. He added many people don't view Hawaii as a place for work, and scholars might balk at going there for research. It's also expensive to fly to and stay in Hawaii, he said. The president and the first lady will announce their choice by the end of March. Sen. Schatz said he believes Hawaii has a good chance, even though Obama has spent most of his professional life far from the islands.

"Bernie Ecclestone believes one of his most trusted female aides could succeed him as Formula One supremo, almost a decade on from suggesting a woman's place was in the kitchen rather than a race track. Sacha Woodward-Hill is a name relatively unknown to those outside of Ecclestone's plush Knightsbridge offices from where many of his deals have been done over the years. But as chief legal officer she has steered the 84-year-old through numerous trouble spots and court cases, including his bribery trial in Munich earlier this year, and is as dedicated a right hand as anyone could be. Sacha Woodward-Hill is one of Bernie Ecclestone's most trusted aides . It is understood Woodward-Hill holds 17 directorships in F1-connected businesses so understands its workings as well as Ecclestone himself, and in that sense appears the perfect fit. It is also believed she has a good rapport with Donald Mackenzie, the co-chairman of private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, F1's primary shareholders. Asked directly about Woodward-Hill at an end-of-season briefing, Ecclestone said: 'The people here (in Knightsbridge) would be able to easily follow through what we have put in place. Formula One supremo Ecclestone has been troubled by legal fights and court cases . LYDIA NSEKERA . The Burundi FA president last year became the first woman elected to FIFA's Executive Committee, winning the vote ahead of Australia's Moya Dodd and Sonia Bien-Aime of the Turks and Caicos Islands - they also joined the committee on a one-year basis as 'co-opted members for special tasks'. DEBBIE JEVANS . Jevans was a key figure in London's bid to host the 2012 Olympics and was installed as director of sport for the dual event, the first woman to hold such a post. It was such a success that Jevans was appointed chief executive officer of the 2015 Rugby World Cup - another first for a female administrator. LESA FRANCE KENNEDY . The granddaughter of NASCAR founder Bill France, the 44-year-old is president of International Speedway Corp, which owns and operates several tracks used in the series. She is also a member of the NASCAR board of directors and in 2009 was named as Forbes' most powerful woman in sports. MONISHA KALTENBORN AND CLAIRE WILLIAMS . Within Ecclestone's own sport, Indian-born Kaltenborn was Formula One's first female team principal when she succeeded former Sauber chief Peter Sauber in October 2012, and has been an outspoken voice in the discussion over the future of some of the lesser marques. Claire Williams was promoted to deputy team principal of Williams in 2013. HEATHER RABBATTS . Millwall's executive deputy chair was the FA's first female board member. The Jamaica-born barrister was critical of the all-white, all-male make-up of the FA Commission, which later added former England defender Rio Ferdinand to its ranks, and she also chairs the governing body's inclusion advisory board. KARREN BRADY . Brady was just 23 when she was appointed as managing director of Birmingham City in 1993 and then moved along with club co-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold when they took over West Ham in 2010. She was central to the club securing the future use of London's Olympic Stadium. MARINA GRANOVSKAIA . Roman Abramovich's long-serving associate is an influential figure at Chelsea and has been heavily involved in the signings of Fernando Torres, Diego Costa and the returning Didier Drogba, as well as the return of Jose Mourinho as manager. 'Perhaps if I controlled the board I would probably say it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a woman being the chief executive. 'If I died there are enough people in the company who could continue running it the way we have set things up. 'Would they (CVC) want a front guy? Particularly if they run an IPO (float the sport on the Stock Exchange) then the City would want to see someone I suppose and the right person would come along.' It is all a far cry to his comments in 2005 shortly after the United States' top female motorsports star Danica Patrick had just finished fourth in the Indianapolis 500. Ecclestone remarked at the time: 'You know I've got one of those wonderful ideas... women should be dressed in white like all the other domestic appliances.' He could hardly say the same about Woodward-Hill, who helped prepare him for his trial in Germany where he could have been jailed for 10 years if found guilty. Ecclestone took advantage of local legislation to buy his way out of the case midway through at a cost of £60million. Assessing the past 12 months, Ecclestone added: 'I would say it's been difficult. 'Certain stages of the year have not been as easy as they could have, but I've not been distracted. I have been able to keep my focus.' After relinquishing numerous board positions to concentrate on the case, as of Monday this week Ecclestone was reinstated. As far as Ecclestone is concerned, he still has plenty to offer as he said: 'I'm happy here as long as the board are happy. 'When I think I can't deliver any longer I shall retire, but I'm not at that stage, not at the moment. 'I still enjoy what I do. The good thing is every day I get up and I never know what is going to happen. It keeps me on my toes.' Asked as to whether he felt he was still needed, Ecclestone replied: 'I've a little bit of experience. 'I'm in a good position with people who trust me, rely on me, I shake hands with them and they don't need a contract. They know that's it, the end of it. 'The only thing is it takes an awful long time to develop that sort of reputation, and whoever does what I do it will take an awful long time for them to achieve that I suppose.' A fresh face Ecclestone will have to contend with is a new chairman of F1 with former Nestle CEO Peter Brabeck-Letmathe due to step down because of ill health. Paul Walsh, former CEO of one of the world's largest spirits manufacturers Diageo, is poised to take up the reins.","Sacha Woodward-Hill is Formula One's chief legal officer .

"Exchanging hugs while unloading bags out of the car, they could be friends meeting up for a camping trip - were it not for their accompanying arsenal of machine guns. They are instead believed to be the latest batch of foreign fighters who have left their homelands to join the Islamic State's horrific uprising in Iraq and Syria. Pictured in secluded woodland, the new recruits appear to have been dropped off in the Iraqi stronghold of Fallujah, presumably to take their positions at a terror training base. Images posted online show them taking equipment out the boot of a 4x4 vehicle while dressed causally in tracksuits and trainers. One is even holding a shopping bag. New recruits: Pictures posted online appear to show the latest batch of foreign fighters who have travelled from their homelands to Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State's bid to create a caliphate . Warm welcome: Pictured in secluded woodland, the new recruits appear to have been dropped off by ISIS militants in the Iraqi stronghold of Fallujah, presumably to take their positions at a nearby base . They are then seen carrying khaki ammunition vests, rucksacks and AK-47 automatic weapons to an unknown location. The images, which appear to originate from ISIS's propaganda wing, were posted on Twitter by respected ISIS analyst Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Centre in Qatar. Under the photographs, Mr Lister comments: 'Jihadi tourism #ISIS photos shows ""arrival"" of new foreign fighters in #Fallujah #Iraq.' MailOnline has not been able to independently verify the images. Day trippers: Dressed casually in tracksuits and trainers, with one even carrying a shopping bag, the men take equipment out the boot of a 4x4 . The Islamic State has reportedly relaxed its vetting of foreign fighters in recent weeks to boost the numbers fighting for their self-declared Caliphate stretching across northern Syria and Iraq. In an effort to weed out spies, foreign fighters wanting to join the insurgency previously needed references from jihadist groups and a background check. The change comes as more evidence emerges from the region that Islamic State are swelling their ranks with child soldiers radicalised at military bootcamps-cum-madrasas. But ISIS remains brutally committed to preventing anyone even suspected of wanting to desert ranks from leaving the terror group. Loaded up with ammunition vests, rucksacks and automatic weapons, the men head to an unknown location . Unwilling fighters were reportedly rounded up in Raqqa, the insurgency's de facto capital in Syria, and publicly executed for trying to escape back to their home countries, it was claimed last month. A source told the International Business Times UK the executed men, who were mainly foreigners, were killed after 'the discovery of lies'. It has not been possible to verify the claims. ISIS seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year. The loss of Fallujah - where American troops engaged in some of the heaviest fighting of the eight-year U.S.-led war in the country - foreshadowed the later loss of Mosul and much of northern Iraq. Recent coalition air strikes have begun to turn the tide over the last few months, with the jihadists losing ground in Iraq and only able to hold on to their positions in Syria. But the fear of causing civilian casualties has meant that ISIS strongholds in Mosul, Tikrit and Fallujah have been spared much of the U.S.-led onslaught.","Images show new recruits unloading weapons and equipment from car .

"Surfing's elite came out in force today to take on the enormous waves  at Praia do Norte in Nazare, Portugal. The weather forecast predicted three days of solid swells off the coast of the small fishing village, with readings as high as 41 feet on the first day. Nazare is where US surfer Garrett McNamara, one of many in attendance on December 11, set the world record of having surfed the largest wave - 30 metres - in January 2013. The massive waves are caused, in large part, by the region's geography - off the Praia do Norte coastline is the biggest underwater ravine in Europe, called Nazare Canyon. The huge canyon runs 125 miles, from out in the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to less than half a mile from the coastline. Praia do Norte is also among one of the most westerly points in all of Europe, meaning that the wind, along with the ocean swell caused by the canyon, sweeps across the Atlantic unhindered, adding even more fuel to the gigantic wave potential.

"Philippe Coutinho is laughing at the bone-juddering memory. His command of English is limited but he understands the question perfectly. With the help of universal sign language — a fist crashing against a hand — Coutinho is being taken back to his introduction to the rough and tumble of English football, when he realised artistic midfielders are not afforded the same time and space as on the continent. Standing next to Coutinho in an interview room at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground, you cannot help but wonder how he survives. He is 22 but his boyish face and diminutive frame make you think he is not long out of school. Philippe Coutinho left Brazil at the age of 18 to pursue a career in European football . Silk, rather than steel, is a quality that you would associate with this young man from Rio de Janeiro. Looks, though, are deceptive. Daniel Sturridge may have given Coutinho the nickname ‘David Blaine’ for his magical abilities but those talents would not be on show without inner steel. Coutinho left home at 18 to chase his dream with Inter Milan. He had to contend with homesickness and constant upheaval at the San Siro and, given the circumstances, it would have been easy to shirk the challenge. But nothing was going to get in the way of his ambitions — especially not a few heavy tackles. ‘My parents stayed with me in Italy for a while, that helped at first,’ says Coutinho. ‘But then they went home and it was hard. When they left you start to appreciate how big a step it is leaving behind everything that you know. Coutinho made the move from South America to join Italian side Inter Milan in 2010 . Jose Mourinho was in charge of the Italian side when Coutinho signed, but he left before the Brazilian joined . Coutinho was helped by Rafa Benitez at Inter Milan, but feels he never played with confidence and struggled . BORN: June 12, 1992 in Rio, Brazil . HEIGHT: 5ft 7in . WEIGHT: 11st 2lb . FORMER CLUBS: Vasco da Gama (09-10), Inter Milan (10-13), Espanyol (loan 12) TOTAL TRANSFER FEES: £11.6m . CLUB GAMES: 128. Goals: 19 . INTERNATIONAL CAPS: 5 . ‘My home was a simple place, near a few favelas. The famous Favela da Mangueira was close by. I never had any problems in childhood, my father (Jose Carlos) worked hard to give me and my brothers (Cristiano and Leandro) every opportunity. ‘My dad has always been passionate about football. But it was one of my friends’ grandmother who told my father to get me into the soccer school. She said I had talent. I signed for Inter when I was 16 but moved when I was 18. You miss your family and friends but you have to deal with it. I have been away four years now and I still miss them. My ambition was to succeed and you have to get on with life.’ Perhaps a family reunion at Christmas is one of the reasons Coutinho has started to spark back into life again; his family and the family of his wife, Aine, stayed with him for the festive period, meaning 18 people were squeezed into his home in Liverpool’s leafy suburbs.They returned to Brazil on Thursday but any sadness at their departure has been balanced by Liverpool’s schedule; on Tuesday, after all, there is the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea and a reunion with the man who helped entice him to Europe. Brendan Rodgers pounced to sign Coutinho from Inter Milan for £8.5million in January 2013 . Coutinho was surprised at the physicality of the English game and was helped to adapt by Rodgers . Jose Mourinho was in charge at the San Siro in 2008 when Inter struck a deal with Vasco da Gama for Coutinho; he would have liked the opportunity to work with Mourinho but his successor at Inter, Rafa Benitez — a man Liverpool fans hold close to their heart — played a key role in helping him settle. ‘I trained with Inter for two days when I went to sign,’ Coutinho reveals. ‘I met Mourinho and had a couple of conversations with him. He was helpful because it was someone who spoke Portuguese. I never got the chance to work with him as he left in the summer I joined. By then, Rafa Benitez had come in. He was very helpful. Training was good but I didn’t play well at Inter. I didn’t have confidence.’ Sent to Espanyol on loan, where he regained belief under Mauricio Pochettino, he has thrived since Rodgers signed him two years ago. Having missed the World Cup, he is now a regular in Brazil’s squad and Rodgers has been important to his development. ‘He has helped a lot,’ Coutinho agrees. ‘He gave me time to adapt. The physicality takes you by surprise. When you put your head up in England, you see two or three players ready to hit you. Coutinho has thrived at Liverpool and scored some big goals, including this one against Manchester City . The Brazilian feels his Liverpool team are improving of late after a slow start to the season . ‘The intensity, the speed is what really takes time to adjust. You can never relax for a minute in one game. In Brazil, Italy and Spain you have time and space to play the ball.’ Movement and control, technique and vision, Coutinho has all the attributes The Kop associates with its leading men and when a new era dawns without Steven Gerrard the onus will be on the 22-year-old to step forward and show why Rodgers thinks so highly of him. Coutinho is one of a number of players who Liverpool want to secure on long-term contracts and the idea of committing for a lengthy period appeals; what appeals even more, however, is the prospect of winning some silverware. The 22-year-old says he would be happy to stay at Liverpool for a long time and wants to win trophies . ‘The start to the season was slow but we are improving and results have been much better over the last few weeks,’ he said. ‘If we could win a trophy that would be very important for the team and the club. ‘The major difference is the (3-4-3) system we are now playing. We have more options in each position. We press high, we are creating more opportunities and we have intensity again. We have our confidence back. ‘It is not a hot topic for me about signing a new contract. But I would be very happy to stay here for a long time and, maybe, I could become like one of the great players who have been here. I want to win trophies here of my own.’ Philippe Coutinho was speaking ahead of Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final first leg on behalf of Capital One — the card in your corner.

"A Brooklyn judge sexually harassed his Orthodox Jewish secretary and fired her when she complained about his behavior, a new lawsuit claims. Brooklyn civil court Judge David Schmidt, 61, tormented his court secretary Sharon Sabbagh, 57,  forcing her to give him hugs before she left work and pick up his soiled underwear, it is alleged. The lawsuits also claims he stroked her face, often strutted about his chambers shirtless and regaled her with seedy stories about his sex life with his mistress. Ms Sabbagh says Judge David Schmidt 'dehumanized' her, adding judges are supposed to upload the state's human rights laws. Pictured, Kings County Supreme Court . The Brooklyn Supreme Court suits says he told her he bought his lover underwear from Victoria's Secret and that they have phone sex regularly, adding: 'When I have sex with my wife, I think of her.' The judge, who was elected to the bench in 1995,  also allegedly told his secretary that when his mistress 'sits across from me, she sits with her legs open so I can see her crotch, she wouldn't do that if she didn't want me'. Ms Sabbagh, who has been a court secretary for 24 years, says the judge fired her in January, the day after she complained about his behavior. The suit names Schmidt, the state Office of Court Administration, the state, and the two other judges who were told of the judge's sleazy behavior. The lawsuit alleges Judge Schmidt told his secretary he bought his lover underwear from Victoria's Secret. Pictured, the lingerie giant's 'Angels' at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show earlier this month . It states Ms Sabbagh complained about Schmidt to a judge on the court's anti-discrimination panel last year but received no assistance. And when she took her complaint to the court's most senior judge, the judge told Schmidt who then fired her. According to the suit, Judge Schmidt also forced her to look at a handwritten 'sex poem' he wrote to his mistress, and made fun of her religious head covering. She claims he told her in a packed courtroom: 'Ew, that's an ugly sheitel, I hate it.' Ms Sabbagh told The New York Post through her attorney Jack Tuckner: 'I'm extremely sad and hurt that I lost my job with the court system because of my complaints about how Judge Schmidt dehumanized me, even though everyone who worked with me knows what he's like and how he treated me. 'I'm embarrassed to have to bring this lawsuit but what else could I do? 'No one deserves to be treated this way, especially by judges who are supposed to uphold the state's human rights laws.' The New York Post reported Judge Schmidt refused to comment on his former secretary’s allegations last night.","Suit claims Brooklyn civil court Judge David Schmidt sexually harassed Sharon Sabbagh .

"She's more often seen in a cocktail dress but Samantha Cameron today proved that she's not afraid to don questionable outfits if there's a good cause involved. The Prime Minister's wife donned a Christmas knit designed by George at Asda as she threw open the doors to No.10 to a group of schoolchildren. The beaming youngsters, all of whom were wearing festive jumpers themselves, had come from all over the country for the event. The Prime Minister's wife joined more than 40 youngsters as they swapped the winter woollies . The festive knitwear was designed to raise money for the charity Save the Children . But the biggest smile of all belonged to Mrs Cameron, 43, who was wearing a light blue creation featuring falling snow and robins. Also wearing knits by the supermarket were the children, all aged between four and 11, who had travelled to Downing Street from schools around the country. These included Stewart Fleming School and Courtland Primary School in London, Sea Mills Primary school in Bristol, St Johns & St Peters CofE in Birmingham, Linthorpe Community School in Middlesborough and Birchfields Primary school in Manchester.

Christina Eilman, was 21-years-old when the crime occurred and she suffered permanent brain damage from the fall and has needed constant medical care ever since. Eilman, who is bipolar, was taken into police custody at Midway Airport after suffering a . mental breakdown on her flight from California. Scroll down for video . Trauma: Here's Christina Eilman shortly after she was raped and plummeted from a seventh story window. She was released by cops instead of being taken to a mental hospital for an evaluation. The city of Chicago agreed today to give her $22.5 million . Rather than bring Eilman to a hospital, . police released her after 29 hours in custody, despite her parents calling at least nine times to . warn them about her mental health status and that she was having an episode. Police later testified at a deposition hearing that she was visibly agitated and should have been taken to the hospital. Witnesses said she was throwing herself against the bars in her jail cell. Horror: This is the Chicago building where Christina Eilman plummeted, resulting permanent brain damage . Eilman, a former UCLA student, was released near a housing project in a crime-ridden neighborhood on the city's notorious South Side when she encountered the sex fiends who attacked her. She was dressed in just short shorts, a cutoff top and boots and was without her cellphone. After being gang raped at knifepoint, she either fell or was pushed from a seven-story window, she suffered severe brain trauma and the 27-year-old will not recover. Better times: Christina Eilman is smiling as she's surrounded by her parents before she was brutally assaulted and left for dead . 'I’m embarrassed to think that a poor girl like this would have been so . callously treated by members of the Chicago Police Department,' Alderman Edward Burke said, according to CBS/Chicago. Her family had been seeking as much as $100 million in damages for pain and suffering and to cover Eilman's never-ending medical bills. Before the tragedy: Here's Christina Eilman a few months before she was attacked and forever changed . Never the same: Eilman's scar from tracheotomy is visible in this recent photo.

Eilman, now 27, suffered permanent brain damage.Alton Logan received $10.25 million forIn 1982, Logan was arrested for shooting a security guard during a robbery. He was later convicted despite there being no physical evidence against him.He was later charged in a lawsuit that police knew another man possessed the dead security guard's weapon but kept that information quiet,keeping Logan behind bars. Logan was arrested in 1982 for shooting Lloyd Wickliffe, an off-duty Cook County corrections officer . who was working as a security guard, during a robbery attempt at a McDonald’s restaurant. Despite no physical evidence linking him to the crime, Logan was convicted. He later alleged a cover-up engineered by police Commander Jon Burge. Burge was later sent to federal prison for lying about abusing and torturing suspects. Logan was freed in April 2008 after lawyers for Andrew Wilson — a convicted cop killer  — revealed that he had admitted . to killing Wickliffe. The attorneys didn't come forward until Wilson died in prison in 2007 because of their oath of confidentiality. Logan alleged that . cops who arrested Wilson knew he had Wickliffe's .38-caliber gun that . was stolen off him after he was murdered. The two settlements came after the city's alderman agreed at a vote this afternoon. “As I sit here today, I’m both embarrassed and ashamed,” said Finance Committee Chairman Edward M. Burke, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. 'It is time to put . this behind us — and we are trying diligently to put these cases behind . us,' city lawyer Stephen Patton said today. 'But, we have to be very dilligent for the next type of misconduct, for . the next type of practice that could lead to exposure. 'We are trying . to be on the top of the next [type of misconduct] And hopefully, . nothing will be as egregious as Burge,' Patton said at the alderman hearing.

"Mitt Romney said on Sunday that President Barack Obama is naive when it comes to Russia, has shown ‘faulty judgment’ about Moscow's intentions and could have done more to try to deter its annexation of Crimea. The 2012 Republican presidential nominee said Obama didn't have the foresight to anticipate Russia's moves and should have been working earlier with allies to make clear the penalties that Russia would face if it moved into Ukraine. Romney did acknowledge that such steps may not have been enough though to hold back Russia President Vladimir Putin. Mitt Romney said President Barack Obama is naive when it comes to Russia and has shown 'faulty judgment' ‘Had we communicated those things, there's always the potential that we could have kept them from invading a country and annexing it into their own,’ Romney said on CBS' Face the Nation. During the 2012 campaign, Romney took criticism from Obama for saying Russia was America's ‘number one geopolitical foe,’ rather than al-Qaida. Now Romney seems to be claiming the right to say, essentially, ‘I told you so.’ ‘There's no question but that the president's naivety with regards to Russia, and his faulty judgment about Russia's intentions and objectives, has led to a number of foreign policy challenges that we face,’ Romney said. ‘And unfortunately, not having anticipated Russia's intentions, the president wasn't able to shape the kinds of events that may have been able to prevent the kinds of circumstances that you're seeing in the Ukraine, as well as the things that you're seeing in Syria.’ Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who just returned from Ukraine, said it was Romney who was naive . He said the U.S. should now welcome nations that seek entry into NATO, should forgo cuts to the U.S. military budget and reconsider putting a missile defense system into the Czech Republic and Poland, as once planned. During the 2012 campaign, Romney had tried to portray the Democratic incumbent as soft on Russia. Writing in Foreign Policy magazine, he said that ‘for three years, the sum total of President Obama's policy toward Russia has been: “We give, Russia gets.”’ Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who just returned from Ukraine, said it was Romney who was naive. Durbin, referring to Putin, a former officer in the Soviet KGB, said Putin is ‘a bully and we've got to call him for what he is. But this notion that some sanction is going to stop a former colonel in the KGB from his ambitions of a Russian empire is naive. Romney also used the appearance to criticize Hillary Rodham Clinton, Obama's first secretary of state who now is considering a presidential run in 2016. Failed 2012 Republican presidential nominee Romney said Obama didn't have the foresight to anticipate Russia's moves and should have been working earlier with allies to make clear the penalties that Russia would face if it moved into Ukraine . Romney said he couldn't think of a major country that had greater respect and admiration for the U.S. than it did ‘after five years of the Obama administration and Secretary Clinton.’ ‘You look over the past five years and say, “what's happened?” Good things have not been bursting out all over,’ he said. Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, said on CBS that Romney suffered from ‘political amnesia.’ ‘Osama bin Laden is gone. The war in Iraq is over. Afghanistan is coming to a close. And this president has worked with many of these nations successfully to put pressure on Iran, the sanctions, bringing them to the negotiating table,’ Durbin said. He said Romney has ‘forgotten those facts.’","Failed 2012 Republican presidential nominee Romney said Obama could have done more to try and deter Russia's annexation of Crimea .

"Andy Prowting died on Wednesday, eight months after noticing a mole on his back . A man who developed skin cancer after getting sunburnt in Turkey has died - just 18 months after returning from his holiday. Andy Prowting noticed a large, brown mole appear on his back six months after the trip to Turkey last July. Tests found it was cancerous and the 24-year-old from Havant, Hampshire, had the mole removed in April this year. But in August, he learned the cancer had spread to his bones and liver - leaving him with only around nine months to live. With no treatment available in the UK, Mr Prowting's family and friends rallied together to create a fundraising group. They hoped to raise £60,000 to fund potentially life-saving treatment at a clinic in Houston, Texas, and collected £45,000 over a five-week period from August. But before he could travel to the U.S., Mr Prowting lost his battle, passing away on Wednesday night - just four months after receiving his terminal diagnosis. Last night, writing on Andy's Army Facebook page, his mother Julie Williams said: 'This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do. 'I am devastated to inform you all of Andy's passing. 'He is free from pain now. I am so heartbroken, he was my life. I will love you forever Andy.' Friends and family have since paid tribute. Nicola Dolphin wrote: 'RIP Andy. You always had a smile on your face even through the toughest times.' Karen Fuller added: 'Andy was so strong all throughout his illness and always showed his lovely smile. Heaven has gained one in a million. 'Andy will be missed by many. I will hold all my lovely memories of Andy close too my heart. 'Still hard to believe he's flying high with those angels.' In September, Andy spoke about his diagnosis. He said: 'I was in Turkey last July and even though I was applying sunscreen every hour, I got burnt,' he said. 'In January I felt something on my back and got my mum to check. July 2013: Mr Prowting goes on holiday to Turkey, where he suffers bad sunburn, despite using sunscreen . January 2014: Notices a lump on his back that is growing quickly. Sees his GP, is referred to a dermatology centre and is diagnosed with malignant melanoma .

August 2014: Mr Prowting is referred to Southampton to take part in a chemotherapy clinical trial. Doctors reveal the cancer has spread through his body and he has just months to live . December 10, 2014: Mr Prowting dies . 'There was a mole and we kept checking it and noticed it was growing a lot and I went to see my doctor.' After being referred to a dermatology centre, the security guard was diagnosed with malignant melanoma. Surgeons removed the mass as well as lymph nodes under his right arm and tissue from his back at Portsmouth's Queen Alexandra Hospital in April as part of an aggressive course of treatment. After three months off work to recover, he was referred to Southampton General Hospital, to take part in a chemotherapy trial in August. But when doctors ran tests, they found the cancer had spread to Mr Prowting's bones and liver. As his was a rare secondary form, neither hospital could treat it. It was then the 24-year-old and his family learned about a clinic in Houston, Texas, which offers treatment to stop the growth and spread of cancer. It accepted the chance to treat him after reviewing his medical notes. But the family needed to raise £60,000 for the treatment. Friends, family and strangers organised fundraising events and took part in sponsored activities to raise more than £45,000. The money raised will now go to the teenager and young adult cancer unit at Southampton General Hospital in Southampton. Scroll down for video .

After having it surgically removed, he learned he had just months to live as the cancer had spread through his body . Mr Prowting with his fiance Sarah Barclay. The couple got engaged after re-kindling their relationship, just a month before Mr Prowting passed away . Last night, Andy's devastated mother broke the tragic news of his death on Facebook . Skin cancer is among the most common forms of the disease in the world, affecting hundreds of thousands of people in the UK every year. There are different types of skin cancer - non-melanoma and melanoma diseases. Melanoma - which Mr Prowting has been afflicted by - is a serious and fast spreading disease. Beginning in the skin, it spreads through the body and contaminates inner organs. The most common symptom of this form of cancer is a new mole, most frequently appearing on the back, arms and legs, or changes to an existing mole. These types of moles are often itchy and bleeding and may larger than the norm. NHS Choices has devised an ABCDE checklist to distinguish between melanoma moles and ordinary blemishes: . Applying sunscreen and wearing sensible clothing in the sun is recommended to avoid skin cancer . The more moles a person has on their body, the higher your risk of melanoma. It doesn't guarantee a person will definitely get melanoma, but it means a person should take greater care in the sun. The larger a mole, the higher the risk of melanoma. A large mole is one greater than 5mm in diameter. People with just one unusually shaped or very large mole, have a 60 per cent increased risk of melanoma. Non-melanoma cancers refer to a group of cancers which slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin. While not all forms are preventable, it is possible to lower the chance of non-melanoma cancers in a number of ways. Applying sun screen and dressing sensibly while in the sun is advisable as is avoiding sunbeds or sunlamps which emit UV rays. Exposure to UV rays is thought to be one of the biggest triggers for skin cancer, though family history, fair complexion and having lots of moles or freckles also increase a person's chance of developing it.","Andy Prowting discovered a mole on his back after trip to Turkey .

"The younger brother of Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has been found guilty of raping and sexually assaulting his daughter from the age of four. Liam Adams, 58, a one-time IRA commander, has been convicted of attacking his child Aine, who waived her right to anonymity to help bring him to justice. The 40-year-old was attacked over a six-year period between 1977 and 1983 when she was aged between four and nine. After the verdicts she said: 'I can now begin my life at 40 and lay to rest the memory of the five-year-old girl who was abused'. On trial: Liam Adams, 58, arrives at Belfast Crown Court, where he was found guilty of sexually abusing his daughter Aine, who was hugged after the verdict yesterday .

"She is famous for writing songs about her menagerie of famous ex-boyfriends. And it seems the subject of Taylor Swift's most recent failed relationship is no exception. The 22-year-old singer has finally revealed her 2012 hit single I Knew You Were Trouble is about her ex-boyfriend Harry Styles. Speaking about her spirited performance at the 2012 Brit Awards in front of Harry and his One Direction bandmates, the singer was asked how she felt performing the number while her ex was watching. Revelation: Taylor Swift, pictured at this year's Brit Awards, has revealed she wrote her hit I Knew You Were Trouble about One Direction star Harry Styles . Taylor told The Sunday Times: 'Well, it’s not hard to . access that emotion when the person the song is directed at is standing . by the side of the stage watching.' Speculation had been rife that Taylor had penned the song about the One Direction star when they first briefly dated in Spring 2012, and the star appeared to confirm the rumours were true in the interview with The Sunday Times magazine. Speaking about her performance of the song at this year's Brit Awards where she stripped down to a sultry black outfit, she said: 'You’re balancing the analytical side of your brain which is telling you where to go and how . to go there, with the other side of your brain, which is saying ""Feel . everything you’re singing, and show it on your face. '""Feel everything . exactly as you felt it when you wrote the song.""' Acrimonious: Taylor, pictured with Harry Styles at the beginning of December last year, broke up with the boyband heart-throb in the new year . The song contains the lyrics: 'I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright. But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Trouble: The star's single hit the top five in the U.S. billboard chart . 'And when I fell hard you took a step back, Without me, without me, without me. The chorus continues: 'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in. So shame on me now. Flew me to places I'd never been. Til you put me down.' Even more damning perhaps, goes the line: 'A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be. And now I see, now I see, now I see.' Harry remained cordial despite uncomfortable scenes at the February London award ceremony, where the former couple were said to have refused to make eye contact backstage. And in an exclusive chat with the Mail Online: 'I thought . her performance was really good, she looked great.' After a brief fling in Spring 2012, Taylor was heartbroken when Harry was photographed kissing American model Emma Ostily in New Zealand in April. However, the young couple gave their romance another try last November. But just days into the new year, they split up after less than two months together following a bitter row on a Caribbean holiday. On January 5, she quoted a line from I Knew You Were Trouble on her Twitter page: 'Til you put me down.' The country singer is famous for her songs about her ex-boyfriends. Back to December is supposed to be about Taylor Lautner, while Dear John is a scathing homily to John Mayer. Recent hit We are Never Ever getting back together is rumoured to be about her ex Jake Gyllenhaal.","Wrote song for her album Red after she first dated the One Direction singer in March 2012 .

"Surrounded by her children, Katrina Young is a picture of contented motherhood. But there was a time when this mother of ten feared she would never know the joy of having a child. She and husband Robert tried for two long and frustrating years to start a family with no success. Meet the Youngs: Front row from left, Alexi, 8, Robert holds Athena, 2, Electra, 9, Katarina holds baby Nakita, Benicio, 7. Back row from left, Gianni, 14, Yannis, 11, Alanis, 12, Kalika, 5, and Nico, 17. Family time: Katrina and Robert on holiday with their children in Cornwall in 2008 . Then came a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, which can cause infertility, and a warning from doctors that Mrs Young might never conceive. But that was 17 years ago. And she has since proved the doctors wrong – ten times over. Nakita, the latest addition to the Young family, was born in September. She joins Nico, 17, Gianni, 14, Alanis, 12, Yannis, 11, Electra, nine, Alexi, eight, Benicio, seven, Kalika, five, and Athena, two. Mrs Young, 36, met her husband Robert, 54, a builder, when she was just 16. She said: ‘I was young when I met Robert, but I knew then that I really wanted to be a mum, and because he was from such a big family himself, he was keen to have children too. ‘We’d been trying for two years and each month I would be devastated when I hadn’t fallen pregnant. ‘I’d only ever wanted to be a mum and that dream was being taken away from me. It was very hard to accept.’ Defying medicine: Katrina with first born son Nico aged four months, left, and daughter Electra in 2001, right . Happy memories: Daughter Alanis who is now 12 aged six months, left, and father Robert Young with six month old son Gianni who is now 14, right . Mrs Young was given a drug to help stimulate her ovaries. Despite the fact that she did not hold much hope of the treatment working, she became pregnant with her first son Nico, now 17. A year later and desperate to conceive a brother or sister for baby Nico, Mrs Young booked a doctor’s appointment, thinking she might need to go back on the medication. But she never went because she discovered she was pregnant with second son Gianni. Then and Now: Katrina and Robert Young on their wedding day in 1999 at the Brooklands Hotel in Scarborough, right and at home celebrating their tenth baby, left . Mrs Young, who works for the NHS as a support worker, said: ‘It was such a surprise. ‘Nothing had happened for a year, then just before I was due to start taking the drug again, I fell pregnant without any help at all. Once I gave birth to Gianni, the babies didn’t stop coming. ‘When I fell pregnant with my first baby, I thought I’d just been very lucky. To have had ten children despite what the doctors told me, it really seems like a miracle.’ The family live in their four-bedroom terrace home in Scarborough and use a 15-seater minibus to get around. But they may have to find a bigger house soon as Mrs Young hopes to have another child. She said: ‘I’d always wanted a family of five, but we just kept going. I’d like to have another one. Then I’d have enough for a whole football team. ‘People do stare at us when we go out as a family – you can see them counting the heads in disbelief. ‘I love my big family – and I certainly proved the doctors wrong.’","Katrina Young and husband Robert failed to conceive for two years .

"It may boost lashes and hide signs of fatigue but your mascara could be wreaking havoc with your eyesight. A new survey has revealed that British women are putting themselves at severe risk of eye infections by using mascara that is up to ten years out of date. Unbeknown to many of us, mascara has a four month use-by date but, according to new research, 70 per cent of women regularly use mascara and eyeliner for much longer than that. Beware the mascara! A new study shows that some eye make-up expires after four months but many women continue using it and put themselves at risk of serious eye infection . Researchers also found that two thirds use mascara which is over a year old and some women continue using the same mascara for up to ten years, with one fifth not even realising that make-up has a use-by date. So what's the problem? Specialists at eye hospital group Optegra, who commissioned the research, are warning that wet products like mascara, which are applied to close to the eye's surface, are a breeding grounds for bacteria. Breeding bacteria: Specialists warn that if mascara smells, you should stop using it and because it's applied so close to the eye, it puts women at serious risk of eye infection . Consultant ophthalmic surgeon Anna Maino said: 'It’s worrying that so many use old eye products well past the use-by date, sometimes 10 years out of date.' Sharing her advice for avoiding any infection, she warned: 'They should look for a small open jar symbol with a number showing how many months it should be used once opened. 'We are urging all women to check their make-up bags. Then they should do their eyes a favour and get rid of anything that’s out of date, especially if it smells. 'Cosmetics normally contain preservatives to help prevent bacteria growth but storing them in a hot place will make it easy for bacteria to thrive. 'Get into good make-up hygiene habits by sharpening eye pencils between applications, washing brushes regularly and turning out old make-up.' Mascara and liquid eyeliner – discard after four months . Liquid foundation and creamy eye shadow – discard after six months . Powder eye shadow – 12 months .

"One in ten households in the UK now have assets worth more than £1million, experts have found. Soaring house prices in London, rising share prices and brimming pension pots mean that more people than ever are sitting on huge virtual nest eggs totalling £5.5trillion in Britain. But the figures analysed by the London School of Economics also show a growing wealth gap, with the richest one per cent now having 850 times more in assets than the poorest in society. A picture of Britain's wealth: One in ten households had assets worth £967,200 in 2010, but experts say this is now worth at least £1million . Figures show the very wealthiest own an . average of £2.8million of assets compared to the average £3,600 of debt . by those most struggling to get by. Professor John Hills, who lead the study, found that 10 per cent of UK homes had total assets of £967,200 in 2010, but an upturn in the UK economy since then means this 'has pushed the entry point into that wealthiest tenth over the million-pound mark today', he said. Around 2.5million of households are in this enviable position. And the majority are those most well-off . are middle aged, having benefited from decades of rising house prices . and also various inheritances. Academics said today that this proves that Governments policies in key areas like tax and benefits are inconsistent and fail to narrow the increasing wealth gap in the UK. Housing boom: The richest are middle aged and have been sitting on property that has increased hugely in value over recent decades . The research was funded by the Nuffield Foundation with support from the Economic and Social Research Council. 'Our research shows that there are very sharp differences in treatment between people.  Some are strongly encouraged and helped by the tax system to accumulate wealth in particular forms, while others face strong disincentives from means-testing to do so.  People can even face both at the same time. These systems often reinforce wealth inequalities, rather than narrow them,' Professor Hills said. The study showed that a typical family has total household wealth of £232,000 – although many of them feel far from wealthy and regularly face a struggle to make ends meet. While they have significant assets, much of it is tied up in something which they cannot actually use to pay for the weekly food shop or their rising energy bill, such as their pension pot or their home. The Office for National Statistics has also looked at the same figures and found there are huge regional variations in the number of millionaire households. Regional breakdown: According to the ONS, this graphic shows how wealth is distributed in Britain, with highest concentration of millionaire households is in London and the South East . The South East is the biggest winner, with 15.5 per cent – or more than one in six – of households in the richest 10 per cent, compared to only 6.9 per cent in Scotland and 7.6 per cent in the North East and North West. Their research shows the effect of the house price boom. Many of the millionaire households bought their properties decades ago and have seen their value soar. There are 668,500 households between the age of 45 and 54 and 929,600 households between the age of 55 and 64 who are in the richest top 10 per cent of Britons. Because they are nearing retirement, they often have very large pension pots.","UK's richest people now have 850 times more in assets than the poorest .

"Arjen Robben was labelled a cheat after winning the penalty that allowed Holland to complete an amazing World Cup comeback against Mexico in Brazil.

"We all know it’s time to start panicking about Christmas when the festive sandwiches hit the shops. Every High Street chain brings out their own version, but not all are created equal. In general, the fillings tend to follow two main themes — there’s the meaty ‘full works’ roast dinner sandwich, which is usually turkey with bacon, stuffing and cranberry sauce, or there’s the vegetarian cheesy number, more often than not embellished with some kind of spiced, fruit chutney. But are any of them any good? And can anyone do anything different this year? I pitted some of the main players against each other to see who’s king of the festive sandwiches in 2014. Starbucks Turkey & Bacon Panini, £3.99 . Turkey breast, pork, sage and onion stuffing, festively fruity cranberry sauce, smoked bacon, rich gravy, spinach and crispy onions on rustic ciabatta. Fat: 17g . Sugar: 10g . Calories: 477 . This has a vaguely Christmassy taste, but is rather bland; odd considering there are so many fillings. The main detectable flavour is the stuffing, which is the common curse of Christmas sandwiches — nothing else really stands up to it. I can find no evidence of any ‘rich gravy’ or ‘crispy onions’. Overall, it has a sort of strange manufactured smell to it, a bit like you’ve used a new appliance but forgotten to take the plastic cover off first. 4/10 . Costa Cheeseboard with Chutney Panini, £3.95 . Creamy French Brie, mature Cheddar, Red Leicester, tangy cranberry sauce and baby leaf spinach on seeded stone-baked sourdough ciabatta. Fat: 20g . Sugar: 7.5g . Calories: 515 . I’m not sure this bread quite knows what it is (anyone heard of a seeded ciabatta before?), but I know what it isn’t — the right choice for this sandwich. It crisps up on top, yet is unpleasantly soggy around the edges. I also have to subject the filling to serious scrutiny before I detect any Cheddar or Red Leicester inside. It’s basically just a Brie and cranberry toastie with spinach that frankly, tastes a bit like it’s ‘on the turn’. Not impressed. 2/10 . EAT Festive Full Works Bloomer, £3.65 . Turkey, cranberry sauce, pork, sage and onion stuffing, smoked ham, reduced fat mayonnaise and salad leaves on multi-seed bloomer. Fat: 19.5g . Sugar: 15.7g . Calories: 583 . This is a very generously-filled sandwich with distinct layers that look really rather pretty for a pre-packed effort. I particularly like the fact that EAT has done away with the usual flabby cold bacon, and replaced it with ham; a wise decision. Sadly it does succumb somewhat to the Christmas Sandwich Curse in that it tastes mainly of stuffing and cranberry sauce — but if you’re into both of those then this is ahead of many in its field. A point for improvement: as ever with EAT sandwiches, the bread could be fresher. 6/10 . Morrisons Turkey, Bacon and Stuffing, £2.29 . Turkey, smoked bacon, pork stuffing and cranberry chutney on malted bread. Fat: 11.7g . Sugar: 6.7g . Calories: 426 . A basic approach, this; just turkey meat, stuffing and chutney. Not a leaf or extra in sight. The turkey here is formed into small chunks rather than sliced, which makes for a crumbly filling that is rather unpleasant to eat. As for the bacon, it’s just offensive: limp, and greasy. There’s an odd chemical sagey back note to the stuffing. Overall, I get the sense that a pile of Christmas leftovers has been mixed together to make this filling. A truly depressing sandwich. 1/10 . Pret’s Christmas Lunch, £3.60 . Free-range turkey, crumbly pork stuffing, cranberry and port sauce, crispy onions, spinach and mayo on malted bread. Fat: 20.3g . Sugar: 11.1g . Calories: 540 . I like how Pret has tried to do something different by adding the crispy onions, which do bring a pleasing textural contrast, but they have such an overwhelming flavour it’s all I can taste while I’m eating — and also for about three hours afterwards. They even trump the stuffing — quite an achievement. It’s all a bit sweet, too. To be honest I feel for Pret with this one, as overall the ingredients are fresh and you can sense it’s made the effort. For once, however, this falls a step behind its big High Street rival, EAT. 5/10 . Sainsbury’s Christmas Triple, £3.50 . One prawn mayo sandwich, one turkey feast sandwich (turkey, malted bread, chestnut and thyme stuffing, mayo, cranberry and apple chutney) and one mature cheddar and caramelised red onion and mayo sandwich. Fat: 28g . Sugar: 14g . Calories: 643 . I think Sainsbury’s is running with a three-course Christmas dinner idea here; prawn ‘cocktail’ to start, traditional Christmas dinner as a main course, and cheese to finish. Shame none of them are any good. The prawn mayo is really fishy and stale tasting. There’s quite a generous fill on the turkey feast, but like the Morrison’s version, it has unappetising small chunks of turkey meat inside. The stuffing reigns supreme once again, and it all just tastes a bit old. The cheese is partnered with some very sweet red onions. Meh! 2/10 . M&S Turkey and pigs in blankets on sage and onion bread, £3.50 . British pork sausages and bacon, British roast butter basted turkey breast, cranberry chutney, spiced mayonnaise and spinach on sage and onion bread. Fat: 23.8g . Sugar: 14.1g . Calories: 552 . I really like the idea of the sage and onion bread, which is a lovely way of incorporating that stuffing flavour, without over powering everything else. Also, pigs in blankets have got to be one of the best bits of Christmas dinner. The bacon here is better than in any other Christmas sandwich I’ve tried and the cranberry sauce isn’t sickly sweet. It’s generous, satisfying and meaty — the best of its kind by miles. 7/10 .","You know it's Christmas when the festive sandwiches hit the shops .

"Hackers behind the massive Sony breach flashed a disturbing message on the company's computers on Thursday, according to reports. The group purporting to be the Guardians of Peace or #GOP, who have claimed responsibility for the attack, sent the message to 'several' computer screens at the studio, a source told The Wrap. The insider, who did not reveal the specifics of the warning, said it left recipients feeling 'disturbed'. Sony Pictures has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment. The message - the fourth by the group - comes just weeks after the GOP apparently sent a similarly threatening message to staffer's computer screens in late November. Scroll down for video . Threat: The Guardians of Peace reportedly sent another threat to Sony computers on Thursday. Pictured is a screen grab showing a waning that the group allegedly sent to company computers in November . That message featured an image of a demonic skeleton and the words: 'Warning: We've already warned you, and this is just a beginning. We continue till our request be met. We've obtained all your internal data including your secrets and top secret.' Then on December 5, the group sent an email threatening the well-being of workers and their families, the Wrap reported. 'Removing Sony Pictures on earth is a very tiny work for our group which is a worldwide organization. And what we have done so far is only a small part of our further plan,' it said. The group has demanded that the studio stop its release of 'The Interview,' which stars James Franco and Seth Rogan and which lampoons North Korea. So far the hacked information has been humiliating for Sony Pictures Entertainment. The corporation are understood to have known about the leak since February but chose to keep it quiet, according to Gawker. In one leaked email, it emerged that co-chairman Amy Pascal calls Angelina Jolie a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' during a heated email conversation with Hollywood producer Scott Rudin. Pascal has since issued an apology saying: 'The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am.'

She added: 'Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.' Other emails show they exchanged racially insenstive comments about President Obama. On the eve of a fundraising breakfast being attended by the President at the home of DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, Pascal and Rudin went over things she could discuss with Obama while at the event in October 2013. 'Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' Pascal asks Rudin, a reference to the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained that dealt with the subject of slavery. '12 years,' responds Rudin, referencing another slavery film, this time Steve McQueen's 2013 Academy Award-winning work 12 Years a Slave. Rudin has also apologized for the comments. 'I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive - and not funny at all,' he said. 'To anybody I've offended, I'm profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused.'

"Armed robber Keith Haney, 54, was awarded £500 compensation after delays in the prison system breached his human rights . A paedophile and a dangerous armed robber have won hundreds of pounds in compensation after judges controversially ruled delays in the prison system breached their human rights. In a ruling certain to spark outrage among victims, Keith Haney, 54, and Geoffrey Massey, 55, were awarded controversial pay-outs because they were forced to spend longer in prison. The Supreme Court said a shortage of places on treatment courses meant the criminals had been forced to endure ‘excessive delays’ to their release dates. It is feared the decision could open the compensation floodgates and lead even more prisoners to bring legal claims if they are not freed on schedule. The ruling is also another blow to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling who last week was told his ban on sending books to inmates in jail was unlawful. Taxpayers have already spent more than £20,000 in legal aid so they could fight the cases which had already been thrown out by the High Court and Court of Appeal. Haney, a career criminal from Fenham, Newcastle, was jailed for life in 2003 for a ‘very serious’ armed bank robbery committed with two other masked men. The raiders – at least one of whom carried a sawn-off shotgun – jumped down from the roof of the Lloyds TSB branch in Ryton, Newcastle, after closing time while only a skeleton staff was on duty. They ordered four terrified female bank clerks to lie on the floor and think of their families, then forced their way into the safe and escaped with £78,000 cash. Haney was told in June 2011 he would shortly be moved to an open prison at HMP Kirklevington Grange, North Yorkshire (pictured). The move was postponed because of a 'logjam' Haney, who was arrested by armed police outside Newcastle General Hospital as he took his girlfriend to be treated for a broken arm, was later handed a life sentence under the ‘two strikes and you’re out’ policy. At the time of the offence he had been out on licence for just two months following an eight-year sentence for an attempted raid on a security van in Wallsend. He had also received a five year sentence in 1992 for his part in another armed robbery on a security van. Haney was told in June 2011 he would shortly be moved to an open prison at HMP Kirklevington Grange, North Yorkshire. But the move was postponed because of a ‘logjam’ caused by other prisoners whose progress through the system had been affected by the shortage of treatment courses. Judges at the Supreme Court ruled Haney had endured a 12-month delay and awarded him £500 compensation. In the second case, Massey, who had a string of criminal convictions for robbery, fraud, theft and indecent assault, was convicted in May 2008 of a series of sex offences against young boys. The former railway guard, from Leicester, was given an IPP (imprisonment for public protection) sentence with a minimum term of two-and-a-half years. Paedophile Geoffrey Massey also received a pay-out following a hearing at the Supreme Court (pictured above) in Westminster . But a shortage of sex offender treatment places meant his release was ‘delayed unacceptably’ by about a year, said the Supreme Court. He was awarded £600 compensation. Both cases were a breach of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to liberty. The judges said the delays had ‘deprived [them] of a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate that [they were] no l longer a danger to the public.’ The court rejected similar claims by sex offender Andrew Robinson, 53, who has a series of convictions against young girls, and Faisal Kaiyam, 33, serving a minimum term of two years and eight months for a offences including robbery. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We welcome the Court’s findings that indeterminate sentence prisoners are not being detained arbitrarily, even if there are regrettable delays in providing them with access to course work which they definitely need in order to reduce their risk. ‘We will study other parts of the judgment carefully to determine how best we can support those on indeterminate sentence towards their potential release.’","Keith Haney, 54, and Geoffrey Massey, 55, awarded controversial pay-outs .

"Taxes on low alcohol wine should be cut to encourage people to get less drunk, a health minister has said. Jane Ellison told a Parliamentary committee she had been in talks with the big supermarkets amid growing concern that the booze content had ‘gone up and up and up’ in the last 30 years. She said she wanted to spark a ‘shopping revolution’ with more people choosing cheap and lower-strength wines. Ministers are increasingly concerned by middle-class drinking, with the strength of wines getting stronger . Mrs Ellison told the Lords committee said there was a ‘frustration’ that European law made it impossible to give tax breaks to low-alcohol drinks. She said: ‘There are some areas of frustration. We do need to return the flexibility, to be able to go further. ‘One of my particular interests would be in trying to use market forces to drive the low-alcohol market. Over time we have seen the level of alcohol in wine creep up and up and up. ‘I would love to be able to do more to create more of a market for these low alcohol products.’ Under EU law, wine must be taxed at the same rate - regardless of its strength. Products also cannot be described as wine unless it contains more than five per cent alcohol. But Mrs Ellison said she wanted to have the ‘flexibility’ to cut taxes on low-alcohol market. However, cutting the cost of lower-strength wine is likely to raise concerns that people will simply increase the volume of alcohol they drink. Public health Minister Jane Ellison said the level of alcohol in wine had crept 'up and up and up' A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘The Government supports any future changes to the EU rules to allow duty on wine to rise in line with alcoholic strength, as is the case with beer. ‘However, such a change would need agreement across Member States. ‘In the meantime we continue to work on ways to help people drink less, including through encouraging the availability and choice of lower strength products.’ Mrs Ellison also revealed that the UK had been blocked from forcing alcohol giants to include a calorie count on beer, wine and spirits.","Jane Ellison revealed she had been in talks with the big supermarkets .

"Oscar Pistorius flew into a rage after learning that prosecutors had been given permission to appeal his murder acquittal - opening the door for a stiffer 15-year prison sentence. State lawyers yesterday won their bid to challenge the manslaughter verdict handed down to the Paralympian for killing his girlfriend for which is serving a five-year prison sentence. A fellow prisoner at the Kgosi Mampuru II jail in Pretoria said the double-amputee athlete 'lost it' after hearing the ruling on the radio. The source said: 'He got up and stomped. He went straight to the gym. He started lifting weights like it was going out of fashion. He is p***** off.' Legal experts said it was unlikely that Pistorius would now be released on house arrest after serving just ten months of his  sentence as he had previously hoped. Scroll down for videos . Judge Masipa has ruled that prosecution lawyers can appeal against the decision not to convict Oscar Pistorius of murder after he admitted shooting Reeva Steenkamp at his home on Valentine's Day last year . The prisoner told the South Africa Times: 'Who wouldn't be (angry)? He was definitely expecting to be out by August. 'Pistorius can barely console himself over the fact that he will be here for Christmas and New Year, instead of jolling with his family and friends.' Prosecution lawyers applied for leave to appeal after Judge Thokozile Masipa in October sentenced the Paralympic gold medallist to five years in jail after a trial that attracted worldwide interest. The state lost an application to challenge that sentence - although it could still petition that decision. Pistorius admits shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp four times through a locked toilet door on Valentine's Day 2013, insisting he thought she was an intruder. After a seven-month trial, Judge Masipa found him guilty of culpable homicide, equivalent to the UK crime of manslaughter, after throwing out a more serious charge of murdering Miss Steenkamp. South Africa's State Prosecutor Gerrie Nel arrives at the high court in Pretoria, South Africa . State prosecutor Gerrie Nel said in his application to appeal that the judgement was 'shockingly inappropriate' and requested permission to seek a murder conviction, which would carry a minimum 15-year jail term. Nel argued that even if Pistorius did not know Steenkamp was behind the door when he fired, the athlete showed intent to kill whoever was in the small toilet cubicle. Pistorius's jail term will not be extended unless the state convinces the Supreme Court of Appeal to overturn the original culpable homicide verdict. Tiaan Labuschagne, of South African law firm Greyvensteins, said an appeal court will decide whether or not Judge Masipa made a mistake in her interpretation of the law when she found Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide. If the panel decides Judge Masipa did err, they will look back at the facts presented in the original trial and could then convict Pistorius of murder if they decide the facts of the case support that, Mr Labuschagne said. Nathi Mncube, the prosecution spokesman, said he hopes the appeal will be 'expedited' but acknowledged that the process can take a long time. In arguing for an appeal, the prosecution said the judge incorrectly interpreted a legal principle. Under that principle, a person should be found guilty of murder if he foresaw the possibility of a person dying because of his actions and went ahead anyway. 'We're happy,' Mr Mncube said after the hearing. Once prosecutors appeal the conviction, the appeals court will review the case to determine if the verdict was appropriate. Pistorius could be out of jail and serving out the rest of his five-year sentence on house arrest by the time prosecutors can appeal his conviction, an expert said today. Terry Price, a top South African criminal advocate, said the appeal wasn't likely to be heard until summer 2015. Pistorius was sentenced to five years in jail on October 21, but according to South African law he can be eligible for release to house arrest after serving just one-sixth of that sentence, equivalent to 10 months. That means that if the Commission of Prisons agrees he's no longer a risk to the public Pistorius could be out by August 21. Mr Price said the appeal was likely to be heard by South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. 'There's a big question mark over the meaning of dolus eventualis,' he said, referring to the legal principle the interpretation of which lies at the heart of the appeal. 'Whether she (Judge Thokozile Masipa) applied it correctly or not is the issue. 'The Supreme Court of Appeal will want it because they want to clear up exactly what it means.' Ahead of the application, Miss Steenkamp's mother, June, said she hoped any appeal hearings would finally get to the truth about her daughter's death. She told Alex Crawford from Sky News: 'I wanted the truth (at the trial), but it seems some of the puzzle is missing. 'There's only two people who know what happened. One of them's my daughter and she's not here anymore.' She said an extended prison sentence for the athlete would not make the grieving process any easier for the family. Mrs Steenkamp added: 'What difference is it going to make to me? I wanted to see him go down the steps [to the court cells]. 'So it doesn't really matter how long - he's going to know that he can't go around hurting people.' Mrs Steenkamp and her husband Barry previously said they felt 'let down' by South Africa's justice system after Pistorius was acquitted of murder. In a bizarre twist, Mannie Witz, one of South Africa's leading defence lawyer who specialises in murder trials, said Pistorius could actually apply for bail even though it 'would cause a public outcry'. He told MailOnline: 'They could reasonably ask the court why must their client wait a year or more in custody while waiting for an appeal against his conviction and sentence. 'The prosecution are appealing against his conviction and sentence and he could end up with a lesser sentence than the one that was handed down.' 'Shockingly inappropriate sentence': Addressing Judge Masipa in the same Pretoria court where the murder trial was conducted, prosecutor Gerrie Nel (above) said she had erred in her interpretation of the law . Judge Masipa (above) granted the appeal and the case will now be heard in South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein, the country's judicial capital . Another lawyer said the decision to throw out the Shrien Dewani murder trial in Cape Town yesterday may have a bearing on the appeal because the courts would want to show they are rigorous and fair. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel argued in appeal papers filed last month that Judge Masipa misinterpreted the law when she ruled Pistorius did not intentionally shoot Miss Steenkamp, describing the sentence as 'shockingly light' and 'inappropriate'. Pistorius, a South African athletics superstar after the double amputee competed against able-bodied runners in the Olympics, can qualify for house arrest after serving one sixth of his sentence - 10 months - behind bars, which would mean he could serve the majority of his time outside prison walls. Reeva Steenkamp's parents Barry Steenkamp and June Steenkamp, previously said they felt 'let down' by South Africa's justice system after Pistorius was acquitted of murder, bit found guilty of manslaughter . Hood said that with the decision of a Cape Town court  to throw out the Shrien Dewani case - another high-profile murder trial involving a beautiful young woman killed in the dead of night - South Africa's courts need to demonstrate they are rigorous and fair. 'From a perception point of view, both public and internationally, we need to tell everybody that we have a robust and effective legal system.' Pistorius, who celebrated his 28th birthday last month, has been serving his sentence in a Pretoria prison. Behind bars: Pistorius admits shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp (pictured) four times through a locked toilet door on Valentine's Day last year, telling the court he thought she was an intruder . 'He's encountering many beautiful stories from prisoners. There are people there who have committed crimes but whose lives have changed,' said his older brother Carl, in an interview with You magazine, a South African tabloid. Pistorius has been accused of receiving special treatment in South Africa's notoriously corrupt prisons, where there is frequent reports of inmates using cellphones and even drinking alcohol behind bars. Yet Carl dismissed claims his brother is living the good life, saying Pistorius relies on weekly 45-minute visits with his family to leave cash at the canteen so he can supplement his standard prison diet with tasty snacks, including baked beans and canned pilchards. 'He now lives moment by moment,' said Carl. 'There's no fairytale.'","Successful appeal could lead to a stiffer 15-year prison term for murder .

"A long awaited autopsy on the body of a hooker whose 2010 disappearance and death exposed the Long Island serial killers victims has revealed she had no drugs in her system when she died, a report claimed on Thursday. This raises the terrifying possibility that Shannan Gilbert, 24, might not have died in a drug fueled haze in Oak Beach as previously assumed, but may have been fleeing the serial killer as she furiously banged on doors in the neighborhood. Indeed, if Gilbert is the 11th victim, it would mean that she wasn't running away from a client while high and didn't die in the local marshes in a stupor. Murdered? The revelation that Shannan Gilbert had no drugs in her system raises fears that she was killed by the Long Island serial killer on the night of May 1, 2010 . The May, 2010, search for Gilbert revealed 10 other bodies along the Long Island coast and police have yet to make an arrest more than four years later. Gilbert's body was eventually found in December, 2011 and her death is still listed as 'undetermined'. Since the Jersey City sex worker's disappearance, her family have claimed that she was killed by the as-yet unidentified serial killer, but Suffolk County Police have said they do not believe that to be the case. However, forensic expert Mitch Holland told Newsday that the failure to find any drugs could mean that the time Gilbert spent exposed in the marshes meant that they could have exited or been removed by the water. It has been assumed that the New Jersey woman went missing after fleeing from a client's home in Oak Beach. She was last seen racing into the night. Thick bramble: Clothing and other items belonging to Shannan Gilbert were found in the marsh in the community of Babylon . New search: Officers had to use heavy, earth-moving equipment to excavate the site in 2011 . Police began searching for her last December when they came upon the first of what would become ten homicide victims' remains. They were strewn along several miles of thicket along a parkway leading to Jones Beach. Gilbert's disappearance prompted the investigation which led to five bodies found in burlap sacks on Gilgo Beach last December. The bodies have been positively identified as prostitutes advertising on Craigslist. Since then, five more bodies have been found which have yet to be identified. Police said they think Gilbert's disappearance is unrelated to the other bodies but a single killer may be responsible for the ten dead. Relatives of Megan Waterman and Maureen Brainard-Barnes, whose bodies were among the ten found, visited the scene on the first anniversary of the grisly discovery. Map: The locations where eight of ten bodies were found near Gilgo Beach since December 2010. The remains of Shannan Gilbert make it 11 . Grim task: Investigators used metal detectors and K-9s to search for victims of the serial killer . 'It's been a living hell,' Waterman's mother Loraine Ela told reporters on Monday. 'It really is. Not a day doesn't go back where I don't think of Megan.' A police officer and his cadaver dog were following up on the disappearance of Gilbert when they came across the first set of human remains on December 11, 2010. Two days later, three more bodies were found. By April, the total had risen to 10 bodies, all strewn along several miles of Ocean Parkway, on a barrier island south of Long Island that leads to Jones Beach. Authorities at first believed several people could be involved, but Police Commissioner Richard Dormer has said recently that detectives now suspect one serial killer is likely responsible for all ten deaths because the victims all had some connection to the sex trade. The victims included eight women, an Asian man wearing a dress and a toddler. Police believe the women were prostitutes and suspect the man was involved in the sex trade because he was wearing women’s clothing. The toddler is believed to be the child of one of the prostitutes.","Police have always assumed Shannan Gilbert was running from a client in a drug-fueled stupor .

"It may be almost an entire decade since the Boxing Day tsunami wiped out 230,000 people in southeast Asia, but for Richard Nott it is as raw as if it happened yesterday after the unthinkable loss of his son and daughter-in-law. Richard will never forget the joy he felt when he received a call from his son Christian, and his wife Moi, to say they were pregnant on Christmas Day in 2004. But that feeling of overwhelming happiness only lasted 24 hours as the Sydney couple died in a beach hut in Khao Lak, Thailand when the 98-foot freak waves smashed in from the Indian Ocean. 'I didn't want them to go to Thailand because of the social unrest - it never occurred to me that a tsunami would be the problem,' he said. Scroll down for video . Christian and Moi Nott's wedding day just two months before the tsunami took their lives in Thailand - pictured with his father Richard (left) and his sister Fiona (right) Their whole lives were ahead of them as they had announced to their families that they were pregnant on Christmas day - the day before the tsunami hit . Christian, 34, a chef and photographer, and Moi, 31, a Channel 9 producer, met about five years earlier and had been living with Richard for six months in the family home in Pymble, on Sydney's north shore, before the horrendous tragedy. 'Most people say opposites attract but they were both very similar - we used to say Moi was a clone of him,' he said. If the 72-year-old could describe his son in one word it would be 'rejoice'. 'His positive attitude was his art of living,' he said. 'He was exuberant and demonstrative about his feelings something I never experienced from my father - he was the antithesis of that.' Richard was only able to bring himself to watch their wedding video just last week. 'It was a combination of great joy and despair,' he said. 'They would have been wonderful parents - I almost had a chance to be grand dad and make up for the mistakes the first time around.' Richard was only able to bring himself to watch Christian and Moi's wedding video last week . Richard said the emotions were as raw as if the couple had just died yesterday . Since his wife died of a heart attack 30 years ago - when Christian and his sister, Fiona, discovered their mother's body - Richard took on the role of both father and mother. 'A day away of someone you love is equal to a year - so 10 years in some ways seems like 100 years,' he said. 'It's such an emotional involvement for us and our friends.' With the incredible capacity to see the positives of enduring such an unspeakable tragedy, Richard said it could have been worse as Fiona, who had just been holidaying with the couple in Vietnam, had originally planned to also join her brother and sister-in-law in Thailand. 'If she wasn't invited to a wedding in Sydney - I would have lost the lot of them,' he said. 'So when you look at adversity you have got to think how much worse off you can be.' Christian and his sister Fiona (left) had a close bond that could never be broken . Moi was so similar in personality to her husband that she was described by Richard as a clone of his son . On the fateful day, while waiting for the news of Christian and Moi's whereabouts, Richard fell off his roof when the ladder slipped away while he was cleaning the gutters and broke several vertebrae. His daughter Fiona, who lives in Hong Kong but was home for Christmas, took charge in coordinating the search for their bodies. Christian's body was found within a few weeks by computer generating a match with his teeth from a photograph. But his wife's remains took many more months to retrieve - then both bodies were flown back to their families six months later. Richard could not speak highly enough of how the Thai and Australian authorities handled the unprecedented crisis. 'It was incredible,' he said. 'The government even offered to do another post-mortem when they came home.' Fiona is returning to Thailand with her father for the 10 year anniversary of the Boxing Day tsunami . Christian and Moi's bodies were returned to their families in Australia six months later . A year later, the couple's belongings were retrieved including carry bags, wallets, phone and their wedding rings. 'I asked for a hair lock but he was too far gone,' he said. 'They told me his body was in tact because he had two or three broken ribs which means he would have passed and subsequently drowned.' A decade on, Richard still dreams about his son three times a week. 'He sometimes appears as a small boy and sometime as a grown man - it reopens the immediacy of the situation - so yes 10 years has passed in record time,' he said. 'He did appear to me in a dream once and told me the whole tsunami never happened to him and his life was still carrying on,' he said. 'He said he has moved into another dimension which we are not a part of but we are still there with him in our own way.' The couple died in a beach hut in Khao Lak, Thailand (pictured) when the 98-foot freak waves smashed in from the Indian Ocean . Richard said he has to move forward otherwise he would 'roll into a ball and pull the stone across the cave and fade into nothing'. 'But the loss and the emotional yearning and loneliness of not having them there is still as raw as it was 10 years ago,' he said. 'It doesn't seem to soften things to that extent with someone that you are profoundly connected to.' Richard, who went to Thailand six months after the horror and then two years later, is going over again with his daughter, Fiona, for the 10 year anniversary.

"An NYPD officer who was filmed using possible excessive force is on paid sick leave following the incident. Evans Mazile repeatedly hit Donovan Lawson, 20, with his baton after the boy allegedly doubled up with his 15-year-old girlfriend while going through the turnstile at the Myrtle subway stop in Brooklyn on November 20, thus not paying his toll. After the young man refused to produce identification for the officer, Mazile said he would have to arrest him. Scroll down for video . Evans Mazile (left), the NYPD officer caught on film as he beat Donovan Lawson with a baton, (right) is on paid sick leave after reportedly hurting his wrist during the incident . Bad scene: Lawson, who allegedly entered a Brooklyn subway station without paying the fare, was treated at a hospital and then sent to Rikers . That's when Lawson got upset and pleaded with the officer not to arrest him according to DNA Info, saying that he was on probation following a robbery charge. Then, when Mazile grabbed Lawson and told him to sit down, a request the boy refused, things suddenly took a turn for the worse. 'Mazile punched Lawson several times in the face and even tried to overwhelm him by spraying him in mace, but Lawson blocked it with his hands,' said multiple sources. 'Then Mazile pulled out his baton, slamming Lawson on the head with enough force that the sound of the blow was clearly recorded by several shocked straphangers.' In both video and photos, it is clear that Lawson is bleeding profusely. Both men ended up being taken to the hospital, with Lawson then going to the New York City prison facility on Rikers Island and  Mazile going on a sick leave that has been paid and so far lasted three weeks. Blood: Lawson was hit so hard that his blood covered the floor of the subway and got on bystanders . Now, an investigation is being launched into the incident. Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson is probing to see if too much force was used and if evidence should be presented to a grand jury. Lawson has been charged with  trespassing, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration and theft. At the time he was on parole for a robbery that occurred in February 2013 in which he punched and pull a BB gun on someone before stealing their cell phone and cash, for which he spent 18 months in prison. He has chosen to go to trial on the current charges rather than take a plea. As for Mazile, he has had eight previous Civilian Complaints against him, one of which came after he reportedly used excessive force while hitting a suspect in the head.","NYPD officer Evan Mazile is on paid sick leave after hurting his wrist during an incident on November 20 at the Myrtle subway stop in Brooklyn .

"Police have released a video of their interview with the accused gunman in June’s deadly shooting at Seattle Pacific University (SPU), including  an admission that he found it ‘so fun’. Aaron R. Ybarra, 27, of Mountlake Terrace, Washington, opened fire at the university on June 5th killing Paul Lee, 19, a freshman, and injuring Sarah Williams, 19, and Thomas Fowler, 24. He was stopped by Jon Meis, a student building monitor, who pepper-sprayed him and grabbed the shotgun Ybarra was carrying, before helping another student hold him down until police arrived. In the newly released video of police questioning Ybarra, he talked openly about his enjoyment at firing the first round. ‘You’re like, I can’t believe that I’m doing this, but once you do it, you’re like: “Oh my God, it’s so fun.”’ Aaron R. Ybarra was questioned by Seattle police in the hours after the shooting at Seattle Pacific University and described shooting his first victim as 'so fun' During the interview Ybarra spoke openly about his mental problems, feelings of hatred, and how he had stopped taking his prescription medication and seeing his psychotherapist . He described struggling with with mental problems since he was a child and developed obsessive compulsive disorder. He developed routines, including one involving his bedroom furniture, and after his parents changed the furniture in his room, he became overcome with feelings of hatred. His compulsions went from good to evil he said. Ybarra had been seeing a psychotherapist for his OCD and transient psychosis, but stopped attending sessions. He began drinking on a daily basis and stopped taking his prescriptions of Prozac and Risperdal. ‘I stopped because I was stubborn and I wanted to feel my hate. Plus I didn’t think it was working... I was thinking “what’s the point of being good when the world’s against me.”’ Ybarra, pictured appearing at his arraignment, pleaded not guilty to first degree murder. When interviewed by police he said: ‘I was meaning to die… but I got caught instead' In the video Ybarra talks of feeling nothing but 100 per cent hatred towards the world, and that he didn’t even feel remorse for his actions. ‘I don’t get respect from people, they don’t take me seriously. When I was growing up people wouldn’t take me seriously, they would laugh at me.’ In the time leading up to the SPU shooting he said he increasingly began identifying with the perpetrators of the shootings at Columbine and Virginia Tech. On June 5th he packed a knife, a shotgun and 75 rounds and drove to SPU. Jon Meis, a student building monitor, pepper-sprayed Ybarra and grabbed the shotgun he was carrying, before helping another student hold him down until police arrived . Otto Miller Hall on the Seattle Pacific University campus, where Ybarra intended to take hostages in a suicide mission that ended with him shooting three students on June 5 . ‘I’d been planning the attack at SPU because I had to stay local. Washington State University was supposed to be the main target. I wasn’t really targeting anyone specifically. I just had hatred towards the world, but I didn’t want to attack my own city.’ The victim: Paul Lee, 19, a freshman, was shot dead, while fellow students Sarah Williams, 19, and Thomas Fowler, 24, were injured . He also revealed how he planned out the attack, touring the campus two weeks beforehand. ‘I used two girls to give me a private tour. I didn’t have to ask, I acted like a transfer student and the way I approached them made them want to give me a tour.’ Speaking about the day of the attack, Ybarra revealed that his intention was to take hostages at Otto Miller Hall on the SPU campus. ‘I was trying to hold two people hostage, just to have a little fun, but they didn’t take me seriously, they were laughing at me… I said hey, you two get inside… this one girl and one guy. They were talking to each other. They were just standing there laughing at me. 'And then I pointed to that one guy that I shot and I said: “Hey you. Get inside,” and he said: “Haha, you think you can scare me with that thing?”’ ‘That’s when I got mad, and I was going to shoot people anyway, and I was really mad at him for doing that… that was the first guy that I shot, when he turned his back.’ Ybarra shot Paul Lee in the back of the head with a double-barreled shotgun outside Otto Miller Hall. Some of the shot pellets struck Thomas Fowler, who was standing several feet away. He tried to shoot a woman nearby, but the gun misfired and she escaped. Ybarra then entered the building, turning the gun on student Sarah Williams, who was coming down some stairs. 'I said: “I don’t want to have to hurt you”. She laughed at me too and just kept walking. That made me mad too.’ Williams was wounded, and as Ybarra tried to reload, Meis made his move disarming and restraining him until police arrived. During the his interview with police Ybarra explained: ‘If I had a choice to not feel this way I wouldn’t have done this. I wouldn’t have wanted to kill people. I wanted to live a happy successful life, but my hate got in my way. The compulsiveness was overcoming me.’ ‘I was meaning to die… but I got caught instead.’ Despite the statements made in the police interview, Ybarra has pleaded not guilty to first degree murder.","Police have released video of the first interview with Aaron Ybarra following his shooting spree at Seattle Pacific University in June .

"Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) is under pressure over his alleged role in turning Luxembourg into Europe's biggest tax haven during his time as prime minister . Jean-Claude Juncker has admitted he has been ‘weakened’ as pressure mounts on him over his alleged role in tax avoidance. The president of the European Commission spoke out as a senior figure at Amazon claimed he had behaved like a ‘business partner’ – setting up special deals for the retail giant while he was prime minister of Luxembourg. Bob Comfort, the former head of tax for Amazon, said Mr Juncker had fiercely courted the online firm and had even ‘helped solve problems’ to make it easier for them to base themselves there. Months after arriving in Luxembourg in 2003, Amazon secured a confidential deal from the local tax office. Two months ago that became the subject of a formal inquiry by the European Commission. The allegations will add further to the pressure on the arch-federalist EU chief over his alleged role in turning Luxembourg into Europe’s biggest tax haven when he was prime minister. It emerged earlier this week that his regime had agreed tax deals with film studio Walt Disney and commodities group Koch Industries. The two companies engaged in complex restructurings and channelled hundreds of millions of dollars in profits between 2009 and 2013 through Luxembourg subsidiaries that enjoyed tax rates of less than 1 per cent. Speaking to the French newspaper Libération, he admitted he had been ‘weakened’ by the revelations – known as ‘Luxleaks’. He even faced a censure motion in the European Parliament. ‘Subjectively speaking, I have nothing to reproach myself more than others would have to reproach themselves,’ he said. ‘But, objectively speaking, I was weakened because the Luxleaks suggests that I would have participated in schemes which infringe elementary rules of ethics and morality.’ Amazon has been accused of tax dodging in the UK. Last year it paid only £4.2million in UK tax despite sales of £4.3billion. The latest allegations about Amazon’s links with the government come from an interview Mr Comfort did in the Luxembourg newspaper d’Lëtzebuerger Land. ‘The Luxembourg government presents itself as business partner, and I think it’s an accurate description: it helps to solve problems,’ he said. Mr Comfort recalled meetings with top civil servants from the finance ministry and Mr Juncker, who was then serving as both prime minister and finance minister. ‘His message was simply: “If you encounter problems which you don’t seem to be able to resolve, please come back and tell me. I’ll try to help”.’ The mounting controversy around Luxembourg’s accommodating approach to multinationals’ tax planning came as George Osborne revealed details of a new ‘diverted profits tax’. The new tax, also called the ‘Google tax’, was announced in the Autumn Statement last week and the Chancellor has claimed it will raise £1billion in the next five years. The mounting controversy around Luxembourg’s accommodating approach to multinationals’ tax planning comes as George Osborne (pictured) reveals details of a new ‘diverted profits tax’. The new measures will target companies shifting profits out of the UK in artificial ways, with a punitive 25 per cent tax rate from April next year. A Treasury source told the Guardian: ‘HMRC already has a pretty good idea of the companies that use these kind of structures and will be issuing notices to those companies. ‘Companies then have 30 days to dispute the payment but if HMRC believes they are using the structure they would have to pay immediately. ‘Obviously there may be companies that may not be on HMRC’s radar. We would expect them to report to HMRC that they are using these structures. If they don’t, that would be illegal.’ The Treasury expects the tax to hit companies such as Amazon and Google that make billions of pounds from sales to UK customers but book the revenues in companies overseas. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said: ‘This is an important symbolic statement but it is really on the margins. ‘What you really need is international agreement and a really, really tough, determined HMRC.’ Mr Juncker has denied any wrongdoing. Last month, he said: ‘I am not the architect of the Luxembourg model because this model doesn’t exist.’ He insisted that his government did no more than compete hard for inward investment as others did.","Jean-Claude Juncker under pressure over his deals as PM of Luxembourg .

"A pair of drug dealing brothers have been jailed for more than 13 years after police found £20,000 in cash hidden inside their oven and microwave. Tanveer Riasat, 32, and Naseeb Riasat, 29, hid thousands of pounds inside electrical appliances at their rented bed-sit in Moseley, Birmingham. The heroin dealing pair were caught by police after officers spotted Tanveer, who is known as Silver, acting suspiciously in his car on July 1 this year. Brothers  Naseeb Riasat (pictured left) and Tanveer (right) hid £20,000 in cash inside their oven and microwave . During a search of the vehicle police found £1,000 hidden in the glove-box, as well as a set of house keys to the drugs den in the Kings Heath area of the city. Tanveer was arrested on suspicion of money laundering, but when officers entered the bed-sit they found 100 wraps of cocaine under the sofa and £20,000 in cash hidden in the kitchen appliances. A court heard Tanveer tried pinning the blame on a drug user he claimed to have given a lift to and said the user 'must have dropped his keys'. He pointed officers to an address in Moseley, Birmingham, where he said the man who owned them lived. Some of the cash officers found while searching the drug dealing brother's bed-sit was stashed in a microwave . Officers found even more money hidden in the oven - they also found drugs including cocaine and heroin . Police descrobed the bed-sit as a 'drugs hideout' where they found bags of cocaine, heroin and cash . But his lie backfired when police found his brother Naseeb at the addict's property  - and when they searched his car, officers discovered keys to the same drugs den. At Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday Tanveer was jailed for eight years after being found guilty of money laundering and possessing heroin and crack cocaine with intent to supply. Naseeb admitted the same offences and was sentenced to five years and four months in prison. Speaking after the case PC Mark Bates, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Tanveer has previous convictions for drug dealing and when officers found £1,000 in cash hidden in his car they suspected it could be linked to drugs. 'Their suspicions were proved right when the keys opened up a drugs hideout with bags of cocaine and heroin plus around 100 wraps prepared for street dealing. When officers searched the bed-sit they found 100 drug wraps for street dealing under the sofa (pictured) 'He pointed police to an address in Anderton Park Road, Moseley, and a man he suggested owned the flat keys - but his plan backfired when police found his brother Naseeb at the house and another set of keys to the drugs flat. 'Naseeb admitted his involvement but Tanveer maintained his innocence even though we found his fingerprints in the bedsit.' Tanveer was previously jailed for five years in 2007 for supplying Class A drugs, whilst Naseeb has also spent time in prison for drug dealing. PC Bates, who is part of East Birmingham Police's Organised Crime Team, added: 'People continually tell us how tackling drug dealing in their community is their number one priority - it attracts an undesirable element and associated crime - and no-one should put up with it in their streets. 'If anyone has any concerns around drug dealing then please call us on the 101 number and we'll take action.'","Tanveer and Naseeb Riasat stashed their drug money in kitchen appliances .

Founded by King Edward III in 1348, . the Order of the Garter is the country’s oldest order of chivalry and . the last remaining honour to be given at the discretion of the . sovereign.

The Duchess of Cornwall, known for her great sense of humour, entertains Kate and Sophie as they enjoy the procession . Tender moment: Crowds line the streets of Windsor to watch the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Charles during the procession to the annual Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle today . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge share a tender moment as they leave the chapel after the ceremony . There's one way to ensure you’re not outdone by a stylish new addition to the family – turn up wearing almost the same thing. Yesterday Sophie and Camilla co-ordinated their outfits with Kate in shades of beige, cream and blush. And all three wore the seemingly obligatory nude heels. Kate gave her Alexander McQueen coat dress (£2,290) another outing after she wore it at last year’s Trooping the Colour. Sophie’s Bruce Oldfield suit with shawl collar was first worn to Zara Phillips’s wedding last summer. Also sticking to an old favourite was Camilla, in a custom-made Anna Valentine cream chiffon dress and pink coat. This glamorous trio is proof, if any were needed, that a style that looks good on a woman in her 30s can also be reworked for a lady in her 60s. Nicole Mowbray . As the procession wound its way . through the grounds of Windsor Castle to St George’s Chapel,  a lively . Camilla regaled a giggling Sophie and Kate with amusing tales.

Valentine cream chiffon dress and pale pink coat with a dramatic Philip . Treacy hat. And the Countess of Wessex, 47, looked elegant in bespoke Bruce Oldfield suit and saucer-shaped hat. It was hard to spot the difference when it came to shoes, however. Kate was in her trusty LK Bennett £185 nude Sledge heels. Camilla’s slightly lower £165 heels . were from Stuart Wietzman at Russell and Bromley while Sophie went for . platform Jimmy Choos at  £435. There was one other big star on the . day. Prince Philip, 91, joined the Queen for the half-mile walk from the . castle to the chapel. She looked delighted to have him at her side . again. Celebration: Camilla and Kate are all smiles as they leave the chapel after the ceremony, while William seems relieved to be able to remove his velvet hat .

The two departed in a coach after the ceremony . By Royal order: The Queen herself hands out the Order of the Garter, and unlike the OBE or CBE honours list, she does not need to consult the . Government to discuss who will receive the honour. Membership in the Order is strictly limited and includes the monarch, the Prince of Wales, not more than 24 companion members, and a number of supernumerary members . Members of the Garter Princess Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester (centre right); Prince Andrew, Duke of York; Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex; Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Charles, Prince of Wales join the procession . Baroness Soames and Sir John Major led the procession from Windsor castle to the chapel today . Charles, Camilla, William and Kate returned by carriage to the castle after the new members were welcomed to the Order . No doubt grateful for the sunny weather, the royals travelled by open top carriage - a far cry from the wet weather of the Jubilee weekend . The Order of the Garter is the most senior and oldest British Order of Chivalry, founded by Edward III in 1348 . Majestic: There were spectacular scenes at Windsor Castle today as the Queen was joined by fellow Garter members for the annual ceremony at St George's chapel . 2011: Kate wore the same Alexander McQueen coat-dress on 16 June last year for the Trooping the Colour ceremony on the Queen's official birthday . She has earned the moniker High Street Kate thanks to her penchant for Zara, Reiss and Whistles. But the Duchess of Cambridge has long been fond of a designer outfit - although she is careful to recycle the most expensive ones on subsequent events, avoiding falling into the trap of being seen as simply a well-appointed clothes horse. Kate's Alexander McQueen coat-dress, a £2,290 garment designed by Sarah Burton, the designer behind the duchess's lace wedding dress, had been debuted by Kate almost exactly one year ago today. Kate chose the dress to wear for the Trooping of the Colour ceremony on 16 June last year, another spectacular occasion of pomp and pageantry that saw the duchess turn up to support her husband as her wore yet another dramatic outfit. The choice of cream today was a wise one - the simple hue made for a neutral backdrop that allowed the vibrant colours and rich fabrics and feathers of her husband's Garter costume to shine. Equally, just as it did it's last airing, it co-ordinated perfectly with Camilla's cream dress - this time an Anna Valentine piece. And Sophie Wessex's pink Bruce Oldfield skirt suit topped the trio off nicely. Deborah Arthurs .",Kate wore cream Alexander McQueen outfit she previously wore for Trooping the Colour last year .
"A sad love story for one man may end up brightening some people's days this holiday season in South Dakota. The man dropped a 14-karat gold, half-carat diamond engagement ring along with a note in a Salvation Army kettle outside a sporting goods store in Mitchell. The ring and note were taped to a $10 bill. The note partially reads: 'This ring made me the happiest man in the world when she said yes, and the saddest when she returned it.' A Salvation Army store in South Dakota received an expensive, albeit heartbreaking, kettle donation this week . The man added that he hopes the ring can be used 'to make some kids happy'. Salvation Army office manager Sheena Loudner says the ring has been valued at $1,200. She says the group is going to try to get some bids on the ring and sell it. Mitchell Major Vickie Cole agreed. 'My heart goes out to that man who gave it,' Mayor Cole told Keloland TV. 'His heart was broken and a time that could've been a very joyful time, but then he gave from his heart and said this could help children.' 'Young people, students, families that want to get together and share with their children what this money will help and it's their way of showing how one hour or two hours will bring a change in someone's life.' Donations: The ring was collected by these Red Kettle volunteers in Mitchell, South Dakota . Surprise: The anonymous donor had wrapped the ring in a $10 bill, so the collectors were unaware of who placed it in the bucket . Major Cole is hoping to have $35,000 from the kettles by the end of the campaign. However the ringers have only raised about $9,000 and there are only two weeks left. As it stands the highest bid for the engagement ring is $750. Meanwhile, last week an anonymous benefactor placed a separate diamond ring - valued at $1,850 - and her wedding band in one of the kettles placed outside Boston's North Station. The rings were accompanied by a note in which the woman said she hoped they would be sold and the money used to buy toys for needy children. She said her husband always had a giving spirit - especially at Christmas time. 'To honor his memory, I donate this ring,' the note said. Big donation: This diamond ring, valued at $1,850, and a wedding band were placed in a red donation kettle outside Boston's North Station last week . The Salvation Army said the rings, given by an anonymous widow in honor of her late husband, were accompanied by a note in which the woman said she hoped the money would buy toys for needy children . 'I'm hoping there's someone out there who made lots of money this year and will buy the ring for 10 times its worth. 'After all, there's no price on love or the sentimental value of this ring. But money will help the kids. 'May everyone have a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!' Salvation Army Major David Davis said Monday the 'incredible' donation warmed the hearts of bell-ringers and other volunteers. 'We're so moved and incredibly grateful to the generous individual who made such a loving and kind donation,' Davis said. 'This heartwarming gift boosts all of our staff, bell-ringers and volunteers.'","14-karat gold ring and a note were wrapped in a $10 note .

"A former Rotary Club president allegedly arranged to have his wife killed because his marriage was colliding with his desire to indulge in bondage and masochism with other women. Bob Bashara, 56, the son of a late Michigan judge, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Jane Bashara, whose body was found in her Mercedes-Benz in a shabby Detroit neighborhood in 2012. He's accused of coercing a handyman to strangle her in their garage in Grosse Pointe Park. Final arguements: Bob Bashara, left,  speaks to his attorney Michael McCarthy during a break during closing arguments in this trial . Double life: Bashara maintains that he and Jane were happily married and that she knew about his girlfriend . Adressing the juryr: Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Lisa Lindsey makes closing arguments in the trial against Bob Bashara . During the murder trial prosecutors called several witnesses to the stand including a bartender, a local Grosse Pointe business owner and a medical examiner who testified his wife, Jane Bashara, had very few defensive injuries - indicating she did not have the ability to fight back. The handyman who prosecutors say Bashara hired, Joe Gentz, pleaded guilty to killing Bashara's wife in late 2012, saying Bashara paid him to kill to do so. Bashara is currently in jail for trying to hire a hitman to kill Gentz, who was already behind bars at the time. Again, Bashara denies having any role in his wife's death. Calculating: Bashara, a former Rotary Club president arranged to have his wife killed because his marriage was colliding with his desire to indulge in bondage and masochism with other women . 'Plot': Joe Gentz is serving 17 years in prison for the murder of Jane Bashara but has refused to testify against her husband, Bob . Balancing act: Prosecutor told jurors  at the conclusion of a long trial that revealed Bashara living a secret life in suburban Detroit . Prosecutors told jurors on Wednesday that the trial had revealed how Bashara lived a secret life in suburban Detroit. 'He created one world; he was living in another,' prosecutor Lisa Lindsey said during closing remarks. 'And when those two worlds collided, Jane Bashara ended up dead.' The prosecution said the life he created revolved around 'Master Bob' and his desire to maintain control and create a new life with his mistress. The prosecution used Bob's own words to tell pat of the story. First, pointing out how Bob worked to get police to investigate other theories, such as his wife Jane's alleged drug use and that she may have been killed by a drug dealer. Bob's own emails took center stage and revealed his intense desire to be with his mistress and not his wife. 'He would say anything and do anything to be with Rachel Gillett. Several people have indicated such,' said Lindsey. Bob's connection to Joe Gentz -- the calls, the text message and the desire to take him out -- was pointed out once again to jurors. During the long trial, jurors heard testimony from police, the Bashara children, friends and even girlfriends who talked about Bashara's sex dungeon below a bar, the Hard Luck Lounge. He was known as 'Master Bob.' Strangled: Jane Bashara, right, was found dead in her Mercedes SUV in January 2012 a day after her husband Bob, left, reported her missing . Other woman: Mistress Rachel Gillett described details of the couple's kinky sex life during testimony . Bashara's mistress, Rachel Gillett, told the jury that they had talked about bringing another woman into their relationship. The defense admitted that Bashara had major financial problems but he knew his wife had a job and savings. His defence argued that it would not have made sense for him to kill his wife when he had a steady stream of income.me. There is no dispute that handyman Joe Gentz killed Jane Bashara, but Lindsey said he was threatened and coerced to do it by Bob Bashara. Jurors didn't hear from Gentz. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for a minimum sentence of 17 years in prison, but then said he wouldn't testify against Bashara. Kinky: Bashara's former business associate testified the married father of two had operated a sex dungeon under a bar he owned called the Hard Luck Lounge . Complicated: Jane Bashara's friend said she never trusted her husband, who constantly lied to her, took money and flirted. Others have suggested Bob relied on his wife's income and had no real reason to kill her . In closing remarks, defense attorney Michael McCarthy said there's plenty of reasonable doubt about the case. He said that Bob Bashara's adultery doesn't make him responsible for murder. 'Bob had no desire for Jane to die. He and Rachel Gillett would continue to live this double life he had,' McCarthy said. Lindsey will make a rebuttal argument Thursday before jury deliberations. With more than 70 witnesses and 500 pieces of evidence, one of the largest tasks for the jury will be keeping all of the pieces in place. Bashara is already in prison for trying to have Gentz killed in jail, in 2012.

"A western lowland gorilla has been born at London Zoo as part of breeding programme for critically-endangered species. Following an eight and a half month gestation period, 15-year-old mother Mjukuu gave birth to the baby, her second infant, last night. The new arrival was discovered by delighted Zoo staff this morning. Gorilla keeper Daniel said: 'We are thrilled with the birth of a baby gorilla here at ZSL London Zoo and mum and infant are both doing really well. Scroll down for video . Western lowland gorilla Mjukuu holds her adorable new baby close in their enclosure at London Zoo . Western lowland gorillas  are classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Their numbers have drastically reduced in the last two decades - by more than 60 per cent. Found in tropical rainforests of Angola Cameroon; Central African Republic; Congo; Equatorial Guinea; Gabon, illegal poaching, disease, and habitat loss have all been blamed for the species dwindling numbers. Scientists estimate that even if all the threats to the gorillas were removed, it would take the population some 75 years to recover. West lowland gorillas are now part of the European Endangered Species Breeding Programme (EEP) to boost their numbers. 'Mjukuu gave birth overnight, surrounded by the rest of the troop – who all seem very pleased, and quite intrigued, by the new arrival. 'Western-lowland gorillas are critically endangered in the wild, so this infant is a really important addition not only to the Zoo, but for the European conservation breeding programme.' The infant is the first offspring of the Zoo's silverback male Kumbuka, who arrived in May 2013 from Paignton Zoo. Kumbuka quickly settled in to life at London, and took his role as group leader in his stride. Female Mjukuu soon won the attention of the strapping silverback, and keepers were delighted when she fell pregnant less than a year after he arrived. London Zoo has now released a video of mother and baby where Mjukuu is seen gently cradling the newborn and hugging it towards her. A Zoo spokesman said the protective mother was keeping her baby very close and would often been seen 'stare lovingly' at the new addition to the family. Keepers will now leave the infant in the capable hands of mother Mjukuu allowing her to bond with her new baby, and allow the rest of the troop to get to know the new arrival.

"Ben Panangian, who has been romantically linked to convicted Australian drug smuggler Schapelle Corby, has been jailed for 10 months for using marijuana. Ben Panangian, who claims he and Corby are 'just friends', was sentenced in Bali after being found with two packages of the drug. The stand-up paddleboard instructor escaped the more serious charged of drug possession which carries a 12- year jail term. Judge Beslin ruled Panangian is 'an active drug user, especially of marijuana,' News.com.au reported. Scroll down for video . Ben Panangian appeared in Bali's Denpasar District Court on Thursday to be sentenced . Schapelle Corby's ex boufriend Ben Panangian, pictured here in 2009, has been jailed for 10 months . He was found with 0.64 grams of the drug when arrested on August 20 and another package of 6.58 grams was found in his wardrobe. Panangian admitted using marijuana since the age of 14 and smoking it on Kuta Beach. Judge Breslin said: 'The defendant is still young so the defendant can change his behaviour in the future. The defendant is a victim of his behaviour and victim of narcotic circulation.' In November, when appearing at Denpasar District Court, one of the judges on the panel questioned Panangian twice about his relationship status with Corby. Schapelle Corby (left), seen here with Panangian in the town of Kuta, was released from a Bali jail in February this year . The police document of  Bernard P. Simanjuntak, also known as Ben Panangian, at the Denpasar Prosecutor Office in Bali, in October 2014 (left) and his home in South Kuta (right) Panangian admitted using marijuana since the age of 14 . Panagian was adamant that the infamous Australian is just a friend. 'Friend or friend?' the judge asked. 'I know her just as a friend,' Panangian said. However, shortly after his arrest in August, Daily Mail Australia visited his home in South Kuta where the landlord at Panangian's rented apartment said Corby visited Panangian in the morning and afternoons at his house about two to three times a week. ‘She comes in the afternoon and leaves by the evening,’ landlord Myoman Yasa said.

"Two former British soldiers who flew to Syria to fight Islamic State fanatics were held at Heathrow as terror suspects after flying home for Christmas. Jamie Read, 24, and James Hughes, 26, left to help Kurdish forces battling the extremists following the beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning. They were not paid and only received food, equipment and shelter. When they landed they were taken to separate rooms and questioned for six hours. Volunteers: Jamie Read, left, and James Hughes, right, were fighting IS in Syria . He told the Sun: 'I was raging. They kept asking why we went, who we were with and were we being paid? We weren't, of course.' Mr Read says he hopes to head back to the war-torn nation, as the conflict with ISIS is 'unfinished business'. Mr Read's partner Leeann Fleming, 24, previously said: ‘The plan is that he will be home for Christmas – and to see him home safely would be the best Christmas present ever. ‘I am very worried about him. I spoke to him only a couple of days ago over Skype. He’s fine and safe. I never know his location when we speak. I miss him lots of course and I can’t wait to be reunited with him.’ The pair met in Turkey when Miss Fleming, of Newmains, Lanarkshire, was 16 and they have been in a relationship for the last six years. She added: ‘I think he’s really brave for what he is doing. But that is his personality. I am not surprised by what he has done. ‘He spoke about it and now he has done what he said he would do. So it is not much of a shock to me.’ Couple: Mr Read with his girlfriend Leeann Fleming. She said: 'I think he’s really brave for what he is doing.

Speaking from the frontline after seeing villages ransacked and locals killed by IS forces, he said: ‘My family were nervous and obviously worried about my wellbeing – we have gone into an unknown world. ‘But I’m a firm believer that if you want to do something you have to do it, not talk about it.’ When he left Scotland, Mr Read, originally from Cumbria, joined up with Mr Hughes, of Worcestershire, after meeting on an anti-IS Facebook page. They flew from Manchester to Istanbul before making their way to war-torn Kobane. They are part of a 20-strong foreign legion helping the Kurds’ Peoples Defence Units, the YPG. The YPG has confirmed 11 of its fighters have been killed by gunfire and suicide bombings in the town, which has seen some of the fiercest fighting of the Syrian civil war.

"A library boss in New York City faces losing his job after he allegedly went on a rampant $40,000 spending spree, blowing cash on lavish dinners, concert tickets and trips abroad. Thomas Galante, director of Queens Library, could be axed next Wednesday after a newly-installed board of trustees found he was using his corporate credit card to expense trips on alleged library business to Barcelona, Amsterdam, Athens, Helsinki, Aspen and Newport Beach in California. He also charged $23,000 to a furniture store which went to kit out his executive office and a rooftop smoking deck at the library, the Daily News reported. Queens Library chief Thomas Galante could lose his job next week after running up bills of $40,000 on a corporate credit card . The blowouts, which are documented in records back to 2011, also included restaurant tabs to the tune of thousands of dollars and bills run up at casinos and liquor stores. According to the NYDN, Galante spent $2,740 at Morton’s Wacker Place Steakhouse in Chicago on June 30 this year; $5,620 at Vetro Restaurant and Lounge in Howard Beach, Queens; and $3,480 at Dazies in Sunnyside, Queens. In December 2011, $1,100 was spent on tickets to see Coldplay. Galante also reportedly hit the credit card for daily runs to Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks along with washing his car and auto repairs. Hundreds of dollars of cookies were ordered from a gourmet company on the card. John Hyslop, president of library workers Local 1321, told MailOnline on Thursday: 'The hubris and excess of Thomas Galante is disgraceful and is so detrimental to the Queens Library, its customers and staff - especially because we've been pleading for more funds to hire more people and serve the public.' Although it is assumed that many of the large purchases were made due to library business, the volume of charges, in particular for lavish dinners, attracted attention. Galante was placed on leave in September as the review took place but was still being paid $392,000. Sources told the NYDN that it is expected that Galante's dismissal will come recommended. The library is 85 per cent public-funded. The library boss spent $2,740 at Morton’s Wacker Place Steakhouse in Chicago (stock picture) in June, according to reports . Mr Hyslop claimed that while Galante was in charge, he contracted out the positions for custodians, claiming that the library could not afford them with its budget. Galante allegedly ordered thousands of dollars on gourmet cookies on his public-funded credit card . He also said that a public staff member had not been hired since 2008, meaning library opening hours were cut back. Mr Hyslop added that library workers - some of whom have salaries around $29,000 - were forced to pay out of pocket to attend conferences because their budget would not cover entire trips. However he added that the library trustees and interim director had moved on from the reported scandal. 'We are committed to transparency and integrity at the Queens Library,' Mr Hyslop said. 'We want the best for our customers.' MailOnline was awaiting a comment on Thursday from the officer of Queens Borough President, Melinda Katz. A comment from Mr Galante's lawyer, Thomas Martini, was also sought.","Director of Queens Library, Thomas Galante, was placed on leave in September as the review took place but kept his $392,000 annual salary .

"A foal suffered some of the most horrific wounds ever seen by vets after its owner left a tight head collar on for months. Star was just two months old when he was found by animal welfare officers with the head collar sunk into his head on farmland in Herefordshire.

Scroll down for video . Mistreated foal Star (pictured) was found with horrific wounds to his face and head after his owner left a head collar on for months . Star's owner, Pascale Musk, has now been banned from keeping horses for three years after she was found guilty of breaching the Animal Welfare Act 2006 at St Albans Magistrates' Court in August this year. The World Horse Welfare field officer, Nick White, who was first called to Star's aid alongside the RSPCA called the pony's suffering the 'worst kind of neglect.' 'No animal should have to suffer in this way,' he added. 'Star had to undergo intensive care from vets and the staff at World Horse Welfare - all this is funded by our supporters and without them, we couldn't manage, so it's thanks to them that we're able to do this work.'

Considering what he went through, it's amazing that he still has trust in humans. 'He didn't deserve to go through such pain. It makes me mad that someone could have allowed Star to go through so much trauma when he was so vulnerable. 'He's in his new little rug now and he thinks he's the business. He's so happy.

"Police in Colorado rammed the suspects in a triple murder off the highway during a high-speed pursuit. Officers in Jefferson County spotted a black Jeep Wrangler which was linked to the multiple homicide in near-by Adams County in north west Denver. The local sheriff attempted to pull over the vehicle which sped off at high speed. Following a chase the police car used a so-called PIT manoeuver to force the car to stop. Two men have been following a high speed chase in connection with a triple murder in Denver Colorado . Police in Denver were called to the scene of a triple murder, pictured,  following a frantic 911 call . Forensic officers carefully examined the crime scene in Westminster, Adams County in Denver . While searching the scene, sheriffs in neighbouring Jefferson County arrested two men following a car chase . The police car nudged the rear corner of the jeep forcing it to spin around and crash off the road. Two people in the car were arrested at the scene which was near the Bandimere Speedway. The chase followed the murder of three people in the Westminster area of Denver on Wednesday. Police attended the scene after a distraught woman called 911 reporting a disturbance at the home before hanging up. Officers discovered three bodies inside the $170,000 home after they investigated the emergency call. Commander Terrance O'Neill said the Adams County Sheriff's Office was investigating the murder and confirmed that multiple victims were found at the scene. Deputies were looking for a man described as a person of interest who was seen leaving the modest, single-level residence. Outside the home later on Wednesday, investigators had placed at least a dozen markers typically used to flag evidence, such as gunshots, in the driveway and street. Westminster is a northwest suburb of Denver with a population of around 100,000 people. The scene of the murder was cordoned off while investigators searched for vital evidence .

"The Blair Government was last night accused of operating a 'secret policy of complicity in torture' after 9/11 as demands grew for the UK to hold a full judicial inquiry. Amid the fallout from the US Senate's explosive report into the barbaric techniques used by the CIA, ex-shadow home secretary David Davis said the UK had 'turned a blind eye' to what America was doing. He said this included 'allowing people initially under our control to be taken and subjected to torture'. Amid the fallout from the US Senate's explosive report into the barbaric techniques used by the CIA, ex-shadow home secretary David Davis said the UK had 'turned a blind eye' to what America was doing . The Blair Government was last night accused of operating a 'secret policy of complicity in torture' after 9/11 as demands grew for the UK to hold a full judicial inquiry . Controversy raged on both sides of the Atlantic as politicians absorbed the enormity of the report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, which said the use of torture by the CIA was far worse than feared and a 'stain on the conscience' of the US. Some 119 detainees were subjected to beatings, waterboarding, rectal feeding, being hung on chains and being made to wear nappies at a network of secret jails. One detainee, chained half-naked to a floor, died of hypothermia. The British security services and Blair Government were being fed information by the CIA and worked closely with the Bush administration on the 'war on terror'. Yet the 499-page Senate report did not contain a single reference to MI5, MI6 or Diego Garcia, a British overseas base known to have been used for rendition – prompting claims it had been redacted to spare the UK's blushes. Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw  says he 'was never in any way complicit in the unlawful rendition or detention of individuals by the United States or any other state' Over two years, the British ambassador in Washington, Sir Peter Westmacott, met with members of the committee at least 11 times. His predecessor, Nigel Sheinwald, also held 11 meetings with members of the committee between 2009 and 2011. Ex-Foreign Secretary William Hague also made 'representations' to the US. Mr Davis said: 'There is now little doubt that the Government operated a secret policy of complicity in torture in the years after 9/11. Our moral standing in the world is utterly compromised.' The battle at Westminster is over the form an inquiry into the questions about British involvement in torture should take. Originally, David Cameron promised a judge-led inquiry under Sir Peter Gibson. However, it was scrapped in December last year before it had been completed. Ex-shadow home secretary David Davis (left) said the UK had 'turned a blind eye' to what America was doing, while Sir Malcolm Rifkind (right) said whether intelligence agencies benefited from information they knew had been obtained through improper mean was 'an important issue that needs to be addressed' The Prime Minister said the task would instead be completed by Parliament's intelligence and security committee (ISC) – prompting fears of a 'whitewash'. Yesterday, it emerged the ISC is to haul spy chiefs from MI5 and MI6 to give evidence. Campaign groups want Tony Blair and ex-New Labour ministers to be grilled, too. Chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: 'There is an important issue that needs to be addressed. It's not whether the British Government or British agencies were carrying out torture. It's whether the intelligence agencies benefited from information or accepted information that they either knew or ought to have known had been obtained through improper means.' Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg said there was a link between the torture report and the slaughter of British and US hostages in Syria . But human rights groups are adamant that a full judge-led inquiry must take place to get to the truth. They also want the full 6,000-page version of the Senate report to be released, not just the heavily-redacted summary. Clare Algar, of Reprieve, said: 'We already know the UK was up to its neck in the CIA's rendition and torture programme. Yet the British Government continues to fight against real accountability in the UK courts.' Amnesty International said it was clear 'the CIA did not act alone' and called for the full report to be published. Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said: 'I was never in any way complicit in the unlawful rendition or detention of individuals by the United States or any other state.' Former Home Secretary David Blunkett declined to comment. Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg – who was paid compensation by the UK for alleged complicity in his ill-treatment – said there was a link between the torture report and the slaughter of British and US hostages in Syria. He said terror group Islamic State was 'born out of the dungeons of Abu Ghraib, where these torture methods were being implemented'. Islamic extremists last night vowed to kill those responsible for the torture revealed in the CIA report. Nadim al-Muhajir wrote on Twitter: 'You thought things cannot get any worse for America. But it did. These #torturereports are going to radicalise a whole generation.' He added: 'Slaughter the bastards who are defending the CIA and justifying their actions.'","Ex-shadow home secretary says UK 'turned a blind eye' to US torture .

"A city in Ohio is battling a plague of crows with swarms estimated to be 60,000-strong - meaning there's almost one bird to every human inhabitant. Residents, business owners and police in Springfield have joined together in a bid to get rid of the 'dirty' birds, which leave droppings everywhere and create noise pollution. Volunteer armies have been brandishing lasers at the buildings from dusk until early night, while a biologist also recommended using sound machines. Scroll down for video . Night sky: A city in Ohio is battling a plague of crows with swarms estimated to be 60,000-strong . At war: That means there's almost one bird to every human inhabitant in the town of Springfield . However, the digital repellents which send out sounds to scare off the birds, have largely been unsuccessful. 'The crows adapted quickly and realized that’s just a fake,' Roger Sherrock, CEO of the Clark County Heritage Center and one of the leaders in the fight against the crows, told the Springfield News Sun. Ongoing problem: Roger Sherrock, CEO of the Clark County Heritage Center, is one of the Springfield residents leading the fight against the crows which leave their droppings all over buildings . Trouble-makers: The birds' overwhelming presence on trees and buildings is causing concern about damage and potential health hazards from their waste . Some have compared the crow-laden landscape to the Alfred Hitchcock movie The Birds, where the California town of Bodega Bay suddenly becomes the subject of unexplained and violent bird attacks. However, the murder of crows troubling Springfield isn't aggressive like the one in the 1963 thriller. But with tens of thousands of them at times, their overwhelming presence on trees and buildings is causing concern about damage and potential health hazards from the birds' waste. Sherrock noted that the stones swallowed by crows to help digest their food have clogged up gutters on buildings and business owners have been paying thousands to get droppings removed. Here to stay: Apparently the crow epidemic in Springfield has been an ongoing problem . Reminiscent: The Springfield scenes are reminiscent of the 1963 Hitchcock classic film, The Birds (pictured) Springfielders are now in the midst of a two-week drive to banish the crows for good. The city's service department is employing up to two workers per night during this time to fire flare guns. They hope this will convince the birds to choose a roosting place away from the downtown area. Apparently the crow epidemic has been an ongoing problem for more than a decade in the area. But Sherrock concluded: 'We’ll keep going as long as it takes.'","Around 60,000 crows descend on Springfield, Ohio, every night .

"More than 100 Vietnamese mail-order brides have vanished after marrying Chinese bachelors from the same poor rural area. Police are investigating the mass disappearance from Quzhou county, Handan, in the central province of Hebei, with reports saying that an 'organised ring' could be involved. Poor bachelors from the area, which is mainly a farming community, had paid tens of thousands to a Vietnamese matchmaker who vanished along with the brides. Runaway brides: Chinese police are seeking more than 100 Vietnamese mail-order brides who vanished after marrying bachelors from a poor rural area. It is thought a people smuggling ring may be involved . After decades of family planning policies and a traditional preference for boys, the male population now far outnumbers women in China, making it difficult to find a wife. The area's bachelors were introduced to the women by Wu Meiyu, a Vietnamese bride who had lived in the area for 20 years, China Daily reported. She received payments of more than 100,000 yuan ($16,000, £10,300) if the introductions were successful. She also disappeared with the women, it added. The state-run newspaper cited an unnamed local official saying an organised ring may have been involved in the mass disappearance. 'With the advanced communication techniques of today, it's easy for all the brides to leave at the same time,' he told the newspaper. The BBC, citing local media, reports that Ms Wu had earlier this year travelled around rural parts of Hebei drumming up customers for Vietnamese mail-order brides. Then on November 20, after she'd made more than 100 matches, the wives are said to have told their new husbands they were having a meal with other Vietnamese brides. They then disappeared. At least one bride has since returned, according to the BBC report citing Jinghua Daily. She said she had 'lost consciousness' after eating and woke up in a small house far from Quzhou. Someone in the house was said to have told her she would be going somewhere else to 'find another husband'. Instead she left and returned to Quzhou where she filed a police report. Buying wives from abroad has become increasingly common in some of China's poor rural areas, where a gender imbalance has developed due to a traditional preference for sons and the country's family planning policies. Across China, 118 males are born for every 100 females, according to government statistics. In some rural areas men can be expected to own a house, car and have considerable wealth before they can attract a Chinese bride, a cost the China Daily said could reach 400,000 yuan. But with many unable to do so the trade in overseas brides, which is often linked to human trafficking, has grown in China.","Matchmaker also disappears after taking money to arrange introductions .

"Regular doctors will be given the boot and instead Commonwealth appointed doctors will be used to rid the country of rorters falsely claiming millions in Disability Support Pensions. Part of a $16 billion crackdown on welfare, the Australian government plans to stamp out 'doctor shopping' - where cheats use GPs that are known to be less strict with their disability assessments. The government will install their own doctors to carry out the assessments, which it is expected will weed out up to 50,000 cheats each year, saving an estimated $70million, according to The Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Regular doctors will be given the boot and instead Commonwealth appointed doctors will be used to flush out rorters, falsely claiming millions in Disability Support Pensions . Figures show the number of Australians receiving the benefit had jumped to more than 800,000 . In July social services minister Kevin Andrews ordered a review of all applicants aged under 35, after figures showed the number of Australians receiving the benefit had jumped to more than 800,000. Since then, more than 8000 have been sent to employment ­services to find a job. Mr Andrews believes the new changes, that see government appointed doctors assessing applicants, will ensure more 'consistency and equity'. They are also there to protect the people who have a genuine disability, who cannot work any longer. 'This measure is not aimed at those who may never be able to work, but rather at ­people who can work with ­independent advice and the right support,' he told The Daily Telegraph. Social Services minister Kevin Andrews believes the new changes, that see government appointed doctors assessing applicants, will ensure more 'consistency and equity' In the last financial year, taxpayers were saved millions of dollars when more than 400 people were investigated for dishonest claims . 'By improving the workforce participation of people with disabilities we can grow a stronger economy with greater benefits for all Australians,' he said. In the last financial year, taxpayers were saved millions of dollars when more than 400 people were investigated for dishonest claims, although that's only a small piece of the takings, with taxpayers paying $16 million to those on disability pensions.

"The family of Shaker Aamer (pictured with two of his children) have begged the Government to have him returned to Britain to face charges before a court . The family of Shaker Aamer, the London father who has been held at Guantanamo Bay for almost 13 years, said last night that he desperately wants the chance to stand trial for his alleged crimes. They broke their silence to insist that if the 46-year-old came home he would have no hesitation in facing a British court to lay to rest grave allegations that he is a dangerous terrorist. The father-of-four is being detained without charge at the notorious US military detention centre and claims he has been tortured there. He is accused of being a close associate of Osama bin Laden, which he denies. He wants to ‘speak for his innocence’ in front of a jury, his loved ones said – adding that they were praying for his return to Britain. They spoke as Downing Street maintained that the UK was continuing to press the case at the ‘highest levels’ – a diplomatic euphemism for the White House. Amid the shockwaves from the Senate report laying bare the scale of barbarity inflicted on terror suspects, a spokesman for David Cameron said the Government was pushing for Mr Aamer’s release ‘as a matter of urgency’. She said: ‘We will keep pressing it. It is our objective to get him back to the UK. That decision is in the hands of the US government. ‘We are doing all we can to work with the US to encourage them to reach a decision.’ As outrage intensified over his captivity, Mr Aamer’s family spoke out to insist there was no justification for holding him at the controversial US naval facility in Cuba. His brother-in-law Tan Ahmad, 35, who works in his family’s business and lives in Wandsworth, south London, told the Daily Mail: ‘Shaker Aamer should be allowed to come back to the UK. ‘He can then speak for his innocence of terrorism in front of a British court. He hasn’t seen his wife and children for 13 years and just wants to come back to Britain to be with them. He would have been released long ago anyway if it wasn’t for the fact that he is a translator, so speaks up for all the prisoners to the authorities. They don’t like him for that. If he had kept himself to himself they might have let him go.’ Mr Ahmad added: ‘He is not a terrorist. ‘Religiously, we don’t believe in killing innocent people.’ Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and has a British wife with whom he lived in Battersea, south London. Saudi-born Mr Aamer has been accused of being a close associate of Osama bin Laden, which he denies. Pictured is a guard at Guantanamo Bay, where Mr Aamer is being held . He has been cleared for release twice by the US, first in 2007. But his detention has been extended persistently because officials insist he must go back to Saudi Arabia, rather than home to Britain. Mr Ahmad, brother of Mr Aamer’s wife Zinneera, 39, said: ‘The Americans want to send him to Saudi Arabia but he doesn’t want to go because his wife and children are here in Battersea. He has broken Saudi law by marrying a foreigner so would be in trouble there.’ Lawyers for Mr Aamer insist he is still being held because the security agencies fear he will reveal details of British complicity in CIA torture. Clive Stafford Smith, of human rights charity Reprieve, who represents Mr Aamer, claims he was in the room when another captive called Ibn Sheikh al-Libi was being mistreated in the presence of UK intelligence officers. Mr Stafford Smith said: ‘Shaker knows too much. National embarrassment isn’t a reason to keep a man who has been cleared for release locked away. Shaker must be returned to his family in London at once.’ The father-of-four is being detained without charge at the notorious US military detention centre (pictured) and claims he has been tortured there . He spoke out as a campaign to free Mr Aamer gathered momentum. Hundreds of people joined the ‘We Stand For Shaker’ movement, including acclaimed actors Mark Rylance and Vanessa Redgrave. Mr Aamer was detained in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2001 after, his representatives claim, travelling to the country to carry out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity. His supporters claim he was captured by bounty hunters and eventually handed to American forces, who allegedly tortured him at a secret ‘black site’ prison – effectively a dungeon – at Bagram air force base, near Kabul. He was then sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002, where he remains with about 100 prisoners.","London father Shaker Aamer has been held without charge since 2001 .

"Thousands of Christmas shoppers are facing delays to their online orders after a courier giant announced it cannot cope with the number of packages in its system. Yodel has been forced to stop accepting any new parcels for two days to give it time to clear the backlog sitting on the back of its lorries. The decision could mean hold-ups for customers expecting deliveries from the firm, which serves thousands of retailers including Amazon, Argos and Tesco. Courier firm Yodel has delayed parcel deliveries by up to two days because it is struggling to cope with the pre-Christmas sales boom . Further pressure was added on transport services by another £666million being spent on Manic Monday . Yodel, which describes itself as the UK’s leading parcel carrier after the Royal Mail, handles more than 135million items a year and claims to work with 80 per cent of top retailers. But it is regularly ranked worst for complaints and customer service. The firm stopped all new parcel collections from delivery hubs yesterday and today to give staff time to deliver items sitting in warehouses or on trailers. Industry experts said internet retailers and courier companies had failed to forecast the Black Friday and Cyber Monday spending binges a fortnight ago. Yodel hired 5,000 staff before Christmas, including thousands of self-employed drivers and couriers, and insisted it was well placed to cope with the festive rush. But yesterday its executive chairman, David Stead, sent out a letter to retailers saying it had been forced to stop accepting new parcels. In it, he said: ‘In the last two weeks we have seen the most frenetic sales activity on record.’ He added: ‘This is not a decision that we have taken lightly but one that we have had to take to protect service levels.’ Mr Stead stressed that Yodel’s couriers will continue to make deliveries today and through the weekend. It plans to start accepting new parcels again on Monday. But the delivery of some orders may be delayed by three days. Amazon whose Swansea, Wales, warehouse is pictured above, said: ‘As a result of the unprecedented number of orders we received during Black Friday Deals Week, the delivery date we promised to some customers was a little longer than would normally have been expected. Normal service has now resumed . Yodel has recently come under fire after it was claimed that one of its couriers was seen hurling a package containing a ceramic poppy from the Tower of London installation 25ft over a garden fence . The Twitter and Facebook pages of Yodel and its retailer clients have been deluged with complaints. Julia Qin wrote: ‘@YodelOnline can u please arrange a delivery for my parcel, which is late for almost 8 days, I need these in hurry!’ A user called Heather added: ‘@YodelOnline service is disgusting. Monkeys could do a better job. 3 times my parcel delivered to the wrong address. NEVER AGAIN!!!!’ Dan Wilson of Tamebay, a news website for small online traders, said: ‘It seems that everyone’s forecast on how big e-commerce was going to be this Christmas was too low and everyone is struggling.’ He added: ‘Consumers would be wise to accept the fact that it would be wise to add a couple of days to any expected delivery date. Leaving Christmas shopping online to the last minute will be something of a dangerous game.’ Amazon recorded 5.5million orders on Black Friday, an average of 64 items every second. As a result there were delays for people who expected next day deliveries under the Amazon Prime service. Other companies that use Yodel include Argos, River Island, Very and Littlewoods. Argos admitted it was forced to extend delivery times from four to seven days in order to rebuild stock levels after the Black Friday promotions. It says deliveries are back to normal, adding: 'We are very sorry'. The backlog is also affecting the Collect Plus service, where shoppers pick up their internet purchases from local stores. It warned shoppers that their orders could be delayed by up to three days. Tesco said its Direct Click and Collect service would suffer hold-ups, adding: ‘We apologise to any customers affected and are working with Yodel to resolve the problems as quickly as possible.’ Yodel has recently come under fire after it was claimed that one of its couriers was seen hurling a package containing a ceramic poppy from the Tower of London installation 25ft over a garden fence when he was unable to reach the customer's front door.

"Insurers are facing a multi-million pound compensation bill after a major report has revealed how they duped savers into taking poor value pension deals. The City watchdog yesterday laid bare how pensioners were missing out on income of up to £230million a year because of the tactics used by some major firms. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that companies had flouted their own fair play rules, sent out pages of jargon-filled documents, failed to encourage pensioners to shop around and used misleading telephone sales tactics. Insurers are facing a multi-million pound compensation bill after a report revealed they duped savers into taking poor pension deals - meaning pensioners are missing out on up to £230million a year (file picture) It is a stunning victory for Money Mail – which last year exposed the dirty tricks that insurers use to stop customers getting the best pension income possible. Yesterday, an expert said that hundreds of thousands of savers may be entitled to compensation if it is discovered that they were misled in signing up to a pension income known as an annuity. Government-appointed older workers’ champion Ros Altmann said: ‘It is vital that anyone who has suffered from the disgraceful mis-selling identified by the regulator should be compensated. ‘A clear message needs to be sent to insurers that such careless selling of potentially unsuitable and irreversible products is a serious failure that will result in money being paid out.’ In 2013, the FCA launched an investigation to probe why pensioners were failing to get the best deals. Yesterday, it described how they were misled. It found: . The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that companies had flouted their own fair play rules . The amount that retirees can receive from an annuity varies hugely between insurers, and the sick or smokers can get much bigger payouts. Insurers have their own codes of conduct, which lay out the responsibilities of firms to tell customers they should shop around for the best deal. However, around four in ten pensioners just take a payout offered by the insurer with which they have saved. The FCA found that 79 per cent of them could have got a much bigger income if they had shopped around. And 91 per cent of savers who are ill or who smoke could also have got a bigger income – in some cases as much as 40 per cent. In total, 150,000 people a year receive a worse income than they should have. And one in five never even realised that they could switch to a better deal. Neil Duncan Jordan of the National Pensioners Convention, said: ‘Annuities have often been a licence to print money for those selling them. Uninformed, vulnerable customers put faith in companies to give them help but they have been let down.’ The FCA has demanded the insurers’ code of practice be scrapped and has ordered firms who are believed to have sold unsuitable annuities to review sales dating back to 2008. An estimated 2.4million annuities are thought to have been taken out since this time. Pensions minister Steve Webb said: ‘The most striking thing is the FCA is suggesting if you try to buy an annuity, the company will have to do the shopping around on your behalf. If they can make that work, it is a game-changer. It could be revolutionary.’ The FCA added that firms need to overhaul their practices ahead of pension reforms coming in next April which will allow savers to cash in their pension pots rather than having to buy an annuity. Last September, Money Mail published an expose of the dirty tricks that insurers used to deprive savers of thousands of pounds worth of pension income. We accused these giant firms of flouting their own codes of conduct, using telephone sales teams to dupe customers into taking poor deals, sending out information designed to confuse, and failing to tell customers, particularly the sick, that shopping around could nab them a bigger income. The investigation was the culmination of weeks of work, part of which was a dossier of evidence put together by whistleblowers. When we published, it shook the insurance firms. A number immediately accused us of scare-mongering. The trade body the Association of British Insurers (ABI) launched an investigation, but it was a whitewash. Director-general Otto Thoresen told us: ‘We did not find the code was breached or that our members were trying to undermine the aims of the code.’ The ABI’s findings bore no relation to the experiences of ordinary savers, such as widows who lost a pension because their husbands were misled or workers who missed out on thousands because they didn’t know to shop around. With the publication of the damning report by City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority yesterday, the ABI’s findings seem incredible. It is vindication of Ruth Lythe’s excellent investigation and Money Mail’s long-running campaign. But now the multi-million pound annuity rip-off may finally be at an end, those who are suffering in retirement because they have been duped need justice. This fight has only just begun. Insurers have been told to go through their past sales. It could lead to a flood of mis-selling claims. We must avoid another whitewash. You can guarantee these firms which have cheated their customers all the way down the line are going to battle every step of the way to deny them a proper payout once more. Cancer patient Wayne Davies (pictured) missed out on the best pension deal because he took an annuity designed for healthy savers . Cancer patient Wayne Davies missed out on the best pension deal because he took an annuity designed for healthy savers. When he retired last year, the company he had saved with for 23 years, Royal London, passed him on to insurer Prudential. The 62-year-old from Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, was ill as a child and last year he underwent tests for suspected cancer. But he said neither firm asked him about his health.

"Soldiers told of the horrific torture meted out by terrorists in the Nairobi mall massacre yesterday with claims hostages were dismembered, had their eyes gouged out and were left hanging from hooks in the ceiling. Men were said to have been castrated and had fingers removed with pliers before being blinded and hanged. Children were found dead in the food court fridges with knives still embedded in their bodies, it was claimed. Scroll down for video . Men were said to have been castrated and had fingers removed with pliers before being blinded and hanged . Most of the defeated terrorists, meanwhile, were reportedly discovered ‘burnt to ashes’, set alight by the last extremist standing to try to protect their identities. The horrifying details came yesterday as the first pictures emerged from within the wreckage of the building, showing piles of bodies left strewn across the floor. A third of the mall was destroyed in the battle between terrorists and Kenyan troops. Lying in the rubble are feared to be the bodies of as many as 71 civilians who have been declared missing by the Kenyan Red Cross. With detectives, including the FBI and the Metropolitan Police, still unable to reach the wrecked part of the mall for fear of setting off explosives, it could take up to a week to determine exactly who is still inside. Men were said to have been castrated and had fingers removed with pliers before being blinded and hanged during the four day siege . Pictured is the aftermath at Westgate Shopping Mall where the roof of the car park collapsed crushing three floors . Yesterday, soldiers and doctors who were among the first people into the mall after it was reclaimed on Tuesday, spoke of the horrifying scenes inside. ‘You find people with hooks hanging from the roof,’ said one Kenyan doctor, who asked not to be named. ‘They removed eyes, ears, nose. They get your hand and sharpen it like a pencil then they tell you to write your name with the blood. They drive knives inside a child’s body. 'Actually if you look at all the bodies, unless those ones that were escaping, fingers are cut by pliers, the noses are ripped by pliers. Here it was pain.’ A soldier, who took pictures at a bread counter and at the ArtCaffe, said he was so traumatised by what he saw he has had to seek counselling. Bomb disposal experts with sniffer dogs were yesterday painstakingly combing the part of the building still standing for explosives before clearing forensic officers, police and troops to search for bodies.

Forensics teams, still sifting through the mountains of rubble, fear many more bodies are yet to be found. Shell-shocked Kenyan troops said the inside of the Israeli-run mall resembled a ‘scene from a horror movie’ with blood spattered everywhere and dead bodies strewn across the floor. Between 10 and 15 terrorists are thought to have stormed the mall on Saturday, according to Kenyan officials. The police said five insurgents were killed in the battle and at least 10 taken into custody . The main thrust of the operation began at 6am on Monday when troops and helicopters surrounded the building, but their efforts were hampered by an Al Shabaab sniper who managed to pin them back for nearly 24 hours. As tear gas was used to try to flush him out, another terrorist reportedly blew himself up. It is believed the resulting fire may have killed dozens of shoppers in a supermarket. The . following day, the soldiers were ordered to adopt a 'shoot to kill' policy and launched their final attack on the terror group on the roof . of the mall at 5pm. The mall was retaken about half an hour later. Between 10 and 15 terrorists are thought to have stormed the mall on Saturday, according to Kenyan officials.

"North Korea has sanctioned a video to recruit foreign runners for the 2015 Pyongyang marathon featuring a cover of A-ha's 1984 hit 'Take On Me' by an accordion band favoured by the rogue state's dictator. As well as the accordions, the chirpy, propaganda-influenced advert features footage from 2002 North Korean film, Marathon Runner. It was based on the true story of Jong Song Ok, who became a national hero aged 25 by taking gold in the marathon in 1999. The marathon, which begins and ends at the Kim Il Sung Stadium was opened up to foreigners for the first time last April - the 27th time it had taken place. Organisers said that 27 countries were represented. The 2014 half-marathon was won by a Brit, Will Marks, who lives in Shanghai and was 30 when he claimed his victory. He crossed the finish line one hour and 33 minutes after starting. He told MailOnline: 'It was as surreal as you'd imagine. After I finished we had to stand around in the heat for hours then parade around in the middle of the pitch with the anthems playing, then the North Korea minister for sports and some podium girls gave me the medal and a big daisy.' Scroll down for video . Honoured hero: The bizarre promotional video, produced by a British tour company, features clips from the film, Marathon runner - a story about Jong Song Ok, who won the race in 1999 . Take it on: North Korea hope to convince more foreign runners to take part in the 2015 Pyongyang Marathon . Open: The marathon was opened up to foreigners for the first time last April - around 500 can take part . Reinvented: A remixed version of A-Ha's hit single, Take On Me, is  performed by the Pyongyang Gold Stars . Participants were warned that they were not allowed to display large writing on their running gear or carry country flags. They were also barred from carrying cameras and communication devices during the race - although some runners flouted the rules. Foreign runners stayed in Pyongyang's Yanggakdo International Hotel and, like all tourists in the country, were forbidden to leave to roam freely. Mr Marks added: 'They had a microbrewery and virtual golf and a karaoke place the size of a nightclub with nobody in there. Really weird amenities.' He said that foreign competitors got on well with the locals despite the restrictions. Conversations about freedom or North Korea's apalling human rights record, though, were shut down quickly by officials hovering nearby. 'The officials were very professional and actually had a good sense of humour,' he said. 'Some guys in our group asked them some controversial questions about the state and freedom, then the officials reverted to a script and it was clear there was a default response they were required to give.' Champion: British runner, Will Marks, won the amateur half marathon in one hour, 23 minutes and 36 seconds . Closed off: British runner, Will Marks, says foreign runners weren't allowed to leave their designated hotel . Forbidden: International runners were also discouraged from discussing controversial issues such as the country's human rights record and were watched by officials at all times . National spirit: Thousands of North Korean citizens adorned their formal attire and danced in the streets . Proud moment: Around 40,000 North Koreans filled the stadium for the event last April . Staff members at the hotel were not so friendly. Marks described them as 'robotic' and said that any request resulted in a 'resentful stare', even if the request was simply for an extra bottle of water. He wrote on his return from Pyongyang last April: 'I asked for an additional bowl of rice and the waiter stared so ferociously at me that I got the impression I'd taken it directly out of his child's mouth.' Before the race, Marks had to bow to huge posters of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-Il, and stand to attention for the national anthem. Then, watched by legions of locals in Mao suits, he ran in a shroud of smog which he realised was the result of an enormous coal-powered power station situated in the city centre. Another Brit, Will Philipps, who was 27 when he competed in the amateur full marathon, said he came second to last of the runners who finished. His time was just over four hours. He told MailOnline: 'You start and finish in this packed-out stadium in front of about 40,000 people, with men dressed in workers overalls and women in traditional colourful dresses. It's like being in a movie. Supervised: Korean officials kept a close eye on the runners of the 2013 Pyongyang Marathon (pictured) Exhausted: British runner, Will Marks, says runners stood around in the heat for hours after finising the race . Change: North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un (pictured), has been given sports in the country a higher profile . 'The hotel was fascinating. Every fixture and surface had this kitsch Soviet '60s feel like you see in old Bond films. It was a 20-story building on an island. It was comfortable, although we weren't allowed out at night.' For next year's marathon, set to take place on April 12, up to 500 foreigners will be able to take part. Those seduced by the accordions on the recruitment video can sign up for a North Korea marathon trip at Koryo Tours' website for between £625 and £1,355, depending on length of stay. The tours enter North Korea from China, so entrants will have to get there first, plus pay a marathon entry fee of around £64, £45 or £32 to take part in a full, half or 10km race respectively. The Kim Jong-Un-approved version of the promotional video, with the A-ha cover recorded by The Pyongyang Gold Stars, was created by British-owned tour company Koryo Tours. Koryo Tour boss Nicholas Bonner told MailOnline that he'd be using his next trip to the country to congratulate The Pyongyang Gold Stars on their success so far with their A-ha cover. He said: 'The North Korean instrumentalists were amazed to hear how popular their recording had become online but, still being without the internet, they had no idea just how popular. Not so fast: Another British runner, Will Philipps (left), said finishing the race inside a packed stadium made him feel like he was 'in a movie' Ceremony:Kim Jung-Il wasn't there to present the medal to Mr Marks, but he was presented it by the Minister for Sports and a girl who gave him a giant daisy . 'We will be taking in the video and remix to show them when we visit early next year when the country re-opens for tourism.' Tourists are currently banned from entering North Korea because of a move by officials to minimise the risk of ebola bring brought in. Authorities have said that the ban will be lifted in time for the marathon. The opening of the race to recreational runners is in keeping with the North's ongoing effort to earn cash revenue by boosting tourism, usually with group tours to major arts performances or attractions the North wants to show off. Under the watch of young leader Kim Jong Un, the North has been giving sports in general a higher profile. Simple recreational sports facilities, such as outdoor basketball courts and roller skating rinks, have been popping up lately in Pyongyang and some other cities. Mingling: British runner, Will Marks, told MailOnline that foreign runners got on relatively well with the locals . Formal affair: Thousands of Korean men, women and children lined the streets to cheer on the runners . Guarded: Security officials kept a close eye on proceedings during the country's 27th annual marathon . All aboard: The secretive state opened up the marathon up to foreign runners for the first time this year . Mixing with the locals: Mr Marks said he was welcomed by most members of North Korea but hotel staff were not so friendly. He described them as 'robotic' and said that any request resulted in a 'resentful stare' Watchful gaze: Officials were watching the moves of the foreigners as they experienced the sights of one of the most secretive nations on earth . Bonner had some advice for foreigners hoping to emulate Jong's performance. 'Don't spend your time high-fiving the locals. I spent a lot of time stopping, as the locals all wanted to snap photos of us with them on their mobiles. It played hell with my time'.","Promotional video for 2015's race features remix of A-Ha hit, 'Take On Me'

"Supermodel Beverly Johnson said  that she has finally spoken out about her alleged drugging by Bill Cosby because he 'had taken her power and she was taking it back'. Johnson, 62, who made history as the first black woman to appear on the cover of American Vogue in 1974, on Thursday joined the ranks of two dozen women to accuse the comedian of attacking them, with some claiming to have been raped and sexually assaulted by the star. The former model and businesswoman recounted the terrifying moment that she realized she had been drugged in interviews, aired on Friday. In 1986, Johnson had visited Cosby's New York brownstone to read through lines for a small part on The Cosby Show. Scroll down for videos . Former supermodel Beverly Johnson (pictured on air on Friday) has joined the ranks of women who have accused Bill Cosby of attacking them . Following a light dinner, Johnson said that Cosby insisted she try a cappuccino from his expensive espresso-maker, adding  'it would be the best cup of coffee she would ever have'. Johnson told Today: 'I felt something from the first sip and it was like I didn't believe it, so I took another sip and I felt the effects of being drugged. The room began to spin and I got woozy, I was on the verge of passing out.' She described the effects of the drug 'like a train coming on', to CBS. In a separate interview she told GMA: 'I knew I had been drugged and drugged really good...I knew I was in danger.' The 62-year-old recalled how she went into 'survival mode' and began to swear and curse at Cosby 'because I wanted him to know that I knew he had drugged me'. Johnson claimed that she began to verbally abuse the star as he came towards her and placed his hands on her waist. She told him: 'You are a motherf***** aren’t you?', according to the detailed Vanity Fair account, published on Thursday. Johnson appeared on major networks on Friday (left) following her accusations that Bill Cosby drugged her in the 1980s. A lawyer for Bill Cosby (pictured right in 1992) has not responded to Johnson's allegations . Johnson does not think that Cosby sexually assaulted her. She said cursing at Cosby appeared to make him angry. She claimed he then grabbed her by the arm and dragged her down stairs with force, pulling her out into the street and dumping her in a taxi. Initially, Johnson said, she was worried about calling Bill Cosby a 'motherf*****'. She told People: 'I didn't know that he was raping women. That came out years after, and … it became more ugly and more sinister and more violent and dangerous. But at that point, I was an aspiring actress and I was scared.' 'I woke up the next day, totally disoriented,' she said. 'I remembered what had happened and I was devastated and disappointed.' Ms Johnson said that it took several days for the effects of the drug to wear off and that when they did, she called Cosby to confront him. Instead of the comedian, his wife Camille answered the phone and told her that it was too late for her husband to take the call and she should call back. She never did. 'At a certain moment it became clear that I would be fighting a losing battle with a powerful man so callous he not only drugged me, but he also gave me the number to the bedroom he shared with his wife,' Ms Johnson wrote in the magazine. 'In the end, just like the other women, I had too much to lose to go after Bill Cosby.' In interviews on Friday, the former model also addressed why she waited 30 years to reveal her story. She said at the time of the alleged drugging, she had just gone through an 'ugly divorce' with an ensuing bitter custody battle for her daughter. The model said that she felt she was risking her career to make the accusations public against such a revered entertainer. She said: 'At the time, I felt it would hurt my career. He was a very powerful, formidable man.' But now, Johnson said that having watched other women come forward, including her friend of 30 years and fellow model Janice Dickinson, gave her the courage to speak out. Johnson told People: 'I thought I'm the lucky one, because I didn't get raped.' 'I want to stand with these women who have come out,' she said on Friday. 'I want to have a platform for one out of every six women who are sexually assaulted during their lives.' Johnson referred specifically to Dickinson - whose story was called 'a fabricated lie' by Cosby's attorney. She said that Dickinson was 'unfiltered' and that 'you only get the truth from Janice'. The former model said that she does not plan to take legal action against Bill Cosby. She added: 'This is bigger than Bill Cosby, this is about women and violence on women. 'I feel Bill Cosby took my power and that I took my power back.' The supermodel's allegations bring the total number of women who have come forward to accuse Cosby to 24. Supermodel Beverly Johnson, (pictured in 1994), was the first black model to appear on American Vogue . Model Beverly Johnson poses for a portrait in September 1987 in Los Angeles (left) and at a party in Atlanta in October (right) Ms Johnson wrote in Vanity Fair that another part of her reason for staying silent on Cosby was that she didn't want to be an 'angry black woman' going after highly-regarded man in the African-American community. The businesswoman said that the current racial climate in the U.S. and the cases of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner remained in her mind, even as she saw others come forward to claim that they had been attacked by Bill Cosby. Something clicked. 'I couldn’t sit back and watch the other women be vilified and shamed for something I knew was true,' Ms Johnson told Vanity Fair. In the article, she also addressed why she had not included the Cosby allegations in her memoir published last year. Ms Johnson said she feared a 'he-said/she-said' scenario but now felt the time was right to come forward. She also said that she no longer feared damaging the African-American community by making her allegations against Cosby. She added: 'He brought this on himself when he decided he had the right to have his way with who knows how many women over the last four decades.'

"Google is to close its news-linking service in Spain next in response to a new law which will force it to pay publishers for using their content. The Internet advertising giant said the new law makes Google News unsustainable and that 'with real sadness' it would remove Spanish publishers from the service on December 16. 'The new law requires publishers to charge Google News for showing even the smallest snippets of their content - whether they want to charge or not,' the company said. Noticias of closure: Google is to shut down its Google News service in Spain after the country passed a law giving publishers an inalienable right to charge the Internet ads giant for using snippets of their content . Google News shows no advertising and makes no revenue from the service, it noted. Publishers in countries from Germany and France to Spain have pushed to pass new national copyright laws that force Google and other web aggregators to pay licensing fees when they publish snippets of news articles. These laws require publishers who want their content to continue to show up in Google search results to give the company explicit permission to do so. Google has responded by requiring publishers to release it from any liability for licensing fees under such laws. The Spanish law thwarts this move by Google by giving publishers an 'inalienable' right to levy such licensing fees. It is set to go into effect in January. Spain's AEDE group of news publishers lobbied for the law, nicknamed the 'Google Tax'. It did not specify how much publishers would have to be paid by Google. Google HQ in Mountain View, California: The Internet advertising giant said the new law makes Google News unsustainable and it would remove Spanish publishers from the service on December 16 . Newspaper publishers and other content providers contend Google News tramples on copyrights by creating a digital kiosk of headlines and story snippets gathered from other websites. Most venting has been limited to criticism likening Google to a freeloader, but there have been attempts to force the company to change its ways through courts. Google maintains it obeys all copyright laws while sending more people to websites highlighted in its News services. The company also allows publishers to prevent material from being displayed in Google News, an option few websites choose because the service is an important traffic source to sell ads. After Germany revised copyright laws last year in a way that could have required Google News to make royalty payments, Google required publishers to give consent for summarizing content and most did.","Google says the new law makes the Google News service unsustainable .

"A Queensland man and his father allegedly poured honey on a man's genitals to attract ants before killing him over a drug dispute, a court has heard. Matthew Leslie Armitage, 22, and his father Stephen John Armitage, 46, of Cooloola Cove, are accused of abducting Shaun Barker from a Broadbeach service station and torturing him for several days in December 2013. Grisly details of what the pair and a third man allegedly inflicted on Barker in the days before they allegedly killed him were detailed during Matthew Armitage's bail hearing in the Supreme Court in Brisbane on Thursday. All three are charged with murder, misconduct with a corpse, torture and deprivation of liberty. The Supreme Court in Brisbane heard shocking details of a murder where Shaun Barker was tortured and murdered over a drug dispute . The court was told Barker endured days of torture, including being zip-tied to a tree and having honey poured over his genitals to attract ants. He was also allegedly held prisoner inside an esky and denied water. 'It was also alleged (Mr Barker) was forced to consume the drug fantasy and he was subjected to other assaults before his body was found,' Justice David Boddice said. Mr Barker was allegedly involved in the production of illicit drugs with his accused killers. Justice Boddice denied Armitage bail, saying he considered him a flight risk because he faced mandatory life imprisonment if convicted. Barker's body was discovered in a state forest at Tin Can Bay (pictured), months after his disappearance . He also said he was concerned Armitage could pose a risk to witnesses given his father had allegedly threatened a witness. 'I'm satisfied that there's a risk that the applicant, if released on bail, could interfere with witnesses or endanger a person's safety,' he said. Barker was reported missing by his family on January 14. The 33-year-old's burnt skeletal remains were found in a state forest at Tin Can Bay, north of Brisbane, in April.","Grisly details of the alleged murder were heard at the Surpreme Court in Brisbane on Thursday .

"A schoolboy with Asperger's syndrome hanged himself in his bedroom after having a petty argument with his mother about the laundry, an inquest has heard. Cameron Brookes, 16, shouted: ‘I hate you - I don’t want to live here' before storming off upstairs in a rage. He was later found dead when his stepfather went to to check on him. Afterwards the teenager’s phone and iPad were inspected by police and officers which found he had sent his girlfriend a message an hour before he was discovered, which said: 'I’m sorry.' Cameron Brookes, who was found hanged in his bedroom after having a petty argument with his mother about laundry . The inquest into Cameron's death was told that he had just completed his GCSEs at All Saints Catholic College in Dukinfield, Greater Manchester but was prone to temper tantrums and had been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome in 2007. His mother Wendy told the hearing: 'He was very angry. If somebody told him to do something, he wasn't good at taking instructions. 'He would lash out, he would harm himself - he’d bang his head against a wall in frustration or run away.' 'Once he was listening to really sad music and was crying. He said: ""I just don’t get it, I just don’t understand this world."" 'I said ""you can’t think about that Cameron."" He said: ""I know, but I just don’t understand mum"" and asked, ""Why can’t I be normal, mum, like my other friends.""' His mother said she sought help from doctors but told the Stockport hearing: 'I feel like every phone call that I made saying, please can you help me, they said he was fine. 'But he was not fine, he needed help. He knew how much we loved him, his Asperger’s just took over that night. Cameron's mother Wendy Brookes, pictured in the purple coat, told the inquest that he wasn't good at taking instructions. The teenager's body was discovered by his stepfather Mark Brookes, pictured above in the green coat . 'He wouldn’t have left his girlfriend - he absolutely loved his girlfriend. He wouldn’t have done that. He was at that point of no return. He was like two people.' Cameron's death happened in August 2012 after he came home at 10pm from having tea with girlfriend Zoe Thompson, then also 16. Mrs Brookes added: 'Cameron’s mood was absolutely fine, he smiled at me, I gave him a kiss. He was playing his guitar. I was in the kitchen with a friend, he seemed fine and pleasant. Then he went and sat in the garden.' She then followed him outside and asked if Miss Thompson was coming camping but said it seemed to 'rile' Cameron and he began telling his mother: ‘I hate you and Zoe’s mum, she can’t stand you.' In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Brookes explained: 'I went to the garden to lock the sheds and I could hear Wendy having a discussion about washing. Wendy was talking about doing his washing and his girlfriend Zoe going on a camping trip. 'I could see he was more agitated so told him to stop being silly and he said he didn’t want to be here so I said he could move out. 'He said he wanted to do it in three weeks when he was 17. This type of conversation was normal. 'He went to his bedroom and I went to the garden and after five minutes I heard three loud bangs. 'I’m sure it was him hitting the bedroom door. The social worker gave us advice to ignore his behaviour and let him calm down. 'Ten minutes later I had a shower. When I went to check on him I opened the door but it only opened about one fifth so pushed it open using force and got in. I could see he was deceased.' Zoe Thompson, now 18, outside Stockport Coroner's Court today with her parents. Miss Thompson, Cameron's girlfriend told the hearing she received a message on the night of his death saying 'I'm sorry' Miss Thompson, now 18, also gave evidence at the inquest in Stockport. She said: 'When I was 13, Cameron and I became close friends and then girlfriend-boyfriend and I was in just about every class with him. 'We would meet up outside of school but it didn’t work out so split up in year 10. I’ve always been aware he had Asperger’s but when I was with him he was always fine and happy. 'My house was a place he could come to escape when he was having problems. This time when we split up he was depressed and upset. He took it badly and stopped talking to me.' In May 2012 the pair became close again after attending their school prom together and Miss Thompson added. 'In the summer holidays in 2012 he told me about arguments over washing and cleaning. 'On Saturday, August 18 he came round having had another fall-out, this time about his bike. He felt he was the only one in the family whose bike wasn't allowed in the garage. 'He said ""I don’t have a family who loves me"". He asked me to go camping with him and his family. He stayed for tea and checked with his mum if it was ok and we went to my room to go on the iPad. 'We went downstairs to get a drink before playing with a ball on the field. When we got back we sat out and got candles and had popcorn. The dog was barking and we were having a good time. 'I asked if he was OK but he said ""as long as I am talking to you I am happy"". He went back at 9.30pm and I walked him half way home.' Miss Thompson said she received the message from Cameron saying ""I'm sorry"", at 10.41 pm. 'I sent a message back asking what he was sorry for and didn't get any reply but carried on messaging him and rang him but got no reply,” she told the hearing. 'I was sending random messages to get his attention to wake him up. I said ""please answer I'm getting worried, I hope you are OK"". 'I must have fallen asleep and when I woke up my parents told me what he had done.' Dr Ahmed Huda, a consultant psychiatrist at Tameside Hospital, who treated Cameron also gave evidence at the inquest . She said: 'He needed somebody to make him feel good about himself, he didn’t feel worth anything and said he can’t do anything in the future and didn't have hope. 'Because of his Asperger's he said people saw him as a freak. When he split up from his girlfriend he seemed like he could be depressed until she came back to him. 'He said that although he felt he wanted to die the issue was more about expressing emotional distress. If you have emotional pain and change it to physical pain it’s more concrete.' While Aisling Bouketta, a family intervention worker who dealt with Cameron added: 'I was aware of problems with his behaviour in the family home. 'There were arguments that would often begin that would often be perceived as small, minor incidents, that could have the tendency to explode.' South Manchester assistant deputy coroner Joanne Kearsley recorded a verdict of misadventure.","Cameron Brookes from Tameside found hanged in his bedroom in 2012 .

"When you next visit your GP, or have to see a hospital consultant, you probably won’t mind whether he or she went to a private or a state school. What we want most of our doctors is that they should be competent and caring. But it is nonetheless a shocking fact that half the schools in this country do not produce a single pupil to study medicine. That means more than 2,000 institutions educating many tens of thousands of children cannot muster one prospective doctor between them. The devastating report by the Medical Schools Council also shows that about half of applicants to do medicine come from private schools (which educate only 7 per cent of children) and grammar schools (of which there remain a mere 164 in England). Half the schools in this country do not produce a single pupil to study medicine. That means more than 2,000 institutions educating many tens of thousands of children cannot muster one prospective doctor between them . There are only 8,000 places a year at medical school, and competition is incredibly stiff. Given the number of foreign doctors, some of whom speak bad English and are poorly trained, one wonders why there are not more places for home-grown students. In other words, your bright child hoping to be a doctor might as well forget it, unless he or she is fortunate enough to attend a private school, a grammar, or one of the best comprehensives. Of course, it’s very hard to be accepted to train to be a doctor. That’s the point. Half our schools have very few, if any, pupils achieving A* grades at A-level in subjects such as Maths, Chemistry, Biology and Physics. There are only 8,000 places a year at medical school, and competition is incredibly stiff. Given the number of foreign doctors, some of whom speak bad English and are poorly trained, one wonders why there are not more places for home-grown students. But even if there were, there’s no reason to suppose they would be filled by any of those 50 per cent of schools currently failing to supply any applicants. What’s true of medicine is also true of the law, investment banking and maybe even the media. Tens of thousands of gifted children are not getting a look-in because they are unlucky enough to be educated at what Alastair Campbell (Tony Blair’s spin doctor) once described as ‘bog-standard comprehensives’. There are still many hundreds of them. According to Ofsted’s annual report published yesterday, there are now 170,000 pupils in inadequate schools (up from 70,000 more than two years ago). Nearly a third of secondary schools are rated as requiring improvement. Isn’t Ofsted being wildly over-generous? The 50 per cent of state schools which are not producing any would-be doctors are surely all deficient, and stand urgently in need of a shake-up. Not that they are likely to get one. Think of the appalling waste and the injustice of it all — the thousands of able children, nearly all from poor backgrounds, who will never be doctors or lawyers because the education they have received does not even get them to first base. And whereas 30 years ago the acting profession was led by people from such a background, now it is brimming with those educated at private school, and quite often Eton. Hugh Laurie - pictured above in House - Dominic West, Damian Lewis, Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hiddleston all benefited from the wonderful theatrical resources at that school, while Benedict Cumberbatch went to Harrow . But it is not just the citadels of medicine and the law from which they are excluded. According to a survey in 2010, 60 per cent of pop singers are privately educated. That’s one line of business in which working-class people were once expected to predominate. And whereas 30 years ago the acting profession was led by people from such a background, now it is brimming with those educated at private school, and quite often Eton. Hugh Laurie, Dominic West, Damian Lewis, Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hiddleston all benefited from the wonderful theatrical resources at that school, while Benedict Cumberbatch went to Harrow. Half of Britain’s gold medallists at the 2012 London Olympics were privately educated — and thus enjoyed superior sporting facilities — though 93 per cent of children attend state schools. And, of course, we have a Prime Minister who went to Eton, a Deputy Prime Minister who attended Westminster School, and a Chancellor who, besides being the heir to a baronetcy, was lucky enough to go to St Paul’s School in London. Thirty or 40 years ago, this reassertion of privilege would have seemed incredible. Then, it seemed crystal clear that the hold which the privately educated had on the great prizes of politics and the professions was loosening, and that Britain was becoming an increasingly open and meritocratic society. Well, it hasn’t turned out like that. The clock has turned back. And the main reason it has done so is that the path by which clever children from poorer backgrounds were once able to advance has been narrowed by the virtual demise of grammar schools. It’s obvious that the Labour Party, which killed off most of the grammars, has no solution to the widening gulf between private schools and the state sector which is so injurious to our society. There was a time when the best grammar schools were academically equal, or even superior, to the best private schools, supplying as many, and sometimes more, students to Oxbridge. The few that remain generally do an excellent job, but are sadly limited to a small proportion of pupils. It’s obvious that the Labour Party, which killed off most of the grammars, has no solution to the widening gulf between private schools and the state sector which is so injurious to our society. All it does is wail covetously at the privileges and the facilities of private education, which it aims to undermine but dare not abolish. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party has fiddled at the edges. With the utmost respect to Michael Gove — who was a brave and enterprising Education Secretary until his recent sacking — his academies and his free schools, welcome though they are, will not fill the gap left by the abolition of the grammar schools. Ironically, I’m sure Mr Gove shares my analysis. He passionately believes that bright pupils from poorer backgrounds deserve a better chance in life. Yet he cannot bring himself to embrace grammar schools because David Cameron weakly regards them as too toxic an issue. Will there ever be change? Despite the obduracy of the Left and the feebleness of the Tory hierarchy, I’m not without hope because the weight of evidence is so irresistible, and the public increasingly realises that it is. The question politicians must address is how children from disadvantaged backgrounds are ever to be put on an equal footing with the children of the well-off without some sort of return of selective education for the brightest. No one has proposed a more plausible solution than the revival of grammars. The question politicians must address is how children from disadvantaged backgrounds are ever to be put on an equal footing with the children of the well-off without some sort of return of selective education for the brightest. No one has proposed a more plausible solution than the revival of grammars. Arguments about the evils of separating children at 11 are sterile. Selection could possibly be done later. And obviously no one is proposing a return to secondary moderns. Grammar schools would sit alongside, and compete with, comprehensives. Fortunately, there is some evidence of a shift in Tory sentiment. In recent weeks, Boris Johnson (another Old Etonian) has declared that scrapping grammar schools was a ‘real tragedy’ for Britain, while his rival as a future Tory leader, Theresa May, has supported the creation of a new grammar school in her constituency. Sixty Tory MPs, including ex-Defence Secretary Liam Fox and former shadow Home Secretary David Davis, are calling for an end to the ban on the creation of new selective state schools. If Labour should win the next election, the 164 grammar schools will be lucky to survive. But if the Tories were to emerge victorious, and David Cameron were at last to show some guts and conviction, there is a chance that the greatest single engine of social mobility could be restored. Look at the facts, and weep. Half of schools — half of schools — do not put forth a single candidate to become a doctor. What a shameful waste and dereliction this is. What a tragedy. Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, went to a fine grammar school that has become a less distinguished comprehensive. The same is true of Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards, the two pioneers of IVF. Would any of them even be admitted to medical school today? I doubt it. Like thousands of talented people abandoned by the state education system, they probably would not be given a chance.","Half the schools in the UK do not produce a single pupil to study medicine .

"Alan Rusbridger will step down as editor in chief of the Guardian after 20 years next summer, he said today. He said he would take over as chairman of the Scott Trust which owns Guardian Media Group. Writing on Twitter, he said it was a 'great honour to be asked to take this role'. In an email to staff, he said his 20 years in the top job had been 'quite an extraordinary period in the life of the Guardian'. Scroll down for video . Alan Rusbridger has announced that he will step down as editor in chief of the Guardian after 20 years . He announced he was stepping down after 20 years at the helm of the newspaper in a series of Tweets . Mr Rusbridger joined the paper, founded in 1821 as The Manchester Guardian, as a reporter in 1979 and became editor in 1995 succeeding Peter Preston. In his stint in the top job, he has guided it through a change in format - it went from broadsheet to Berliner when many of its rivals went tabloid - and a move of office from London's Farringdon to Kings Cross. Alan Rusbridger, pictured outside the Leveson Inquiry, said he would take over as chairman of the Scott Trust which owns Guardian Media Group . He has guided the paper through the online revolution which has seen it commit itself to the principle of open access and attempt to become an international brand with offices in Australia and the United States. Although the Guardian was one of the first newspaper to embrace the online format, it has since been overtaken by the MailOnline. While Mr Rusbridger has been at the helm of  the Guardian it has also successfully defended libel action from Jonathan Aitken, a former Chief Secretary to the Treasury, over claims about his dealings with leading Saudis. It has also allowed British spies into its London offices to oversee the destruction of  computers used to store top-secret documents leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. The paper and its editor received journalism awards for both stories. But it has not all been success. In March this year the Guardian Media Group announced they had completed the sale of its 50.1 per cent stake in Auto Trader. The move came as Guardian News Media reported a loss of £30.9m for the year to the end of April 2013. Latest circulation figures also show Guardian, down from 350,000 to 180,000,. In an email to staff Mr Rusbridger said today: 'It's been quite an extraordinary period in the life of the Guardian. In February 1995 newspaper websites were, if they existed at all, exotic things: we were still four years off launching Guardian Unlimited. Since 1999 we've grown to overtake all others to become the most-read serious English language digital newspaper in the world.' 'Each editor is told – this is literally the only instruction – to carry the Guardian on 'as heretofore'. That means understanding the spirit, culture and purpose of the paper and interpreting it for the present. All that is only possible because of the unique Scott Trust, set up in 1936 to ensure the Guardian survives in perpetuity. Alan Rusbridger pictured with former Guardian editor Peter Preston pictured outside the High Court, where the newspaper successfully defended libel action bought by Jonathan Aitken . In an email to staff Mr Rusbridger said his 20 years in the top job had been 'quite an extraordinary period in the life of the Guardian'. 'In global journalism, there are a handful of roles that have the capability to redefine our industry. I am privileged to have held one of those roles for 20 years, a period in which successful newspapers have become global content providers, reaching audiences in dramatically new and valuable ways. 'I am honoured to succeed the quite brilliant Liz Forgan as chair of the Scott Trust, preserving the independent editorial values and the long-term financial stability upon which our future depends. We have strong future leaders in place with unparalleled news and digital experience, and I know that our journalism will be in the best possible hands.' Dame Liz Forgan, whom he will replace at the trust, said he had been the paper's 'driving force ... for a generation'. The paper - along with the Washington Post - won the Pulitzer Prize for journalism this year for its work on secret surveillance work carried out by the American National Security Agency. His full tweet read: 'Announced tdy that I will succeed Liz Forgan as Scott Trust Chair in 2016. Great honour to be asked to take this role. 'Scott Trust founded to protect and safeguard Guardian. Important bastion of free speech & journalistic independence. 'Will step down as editor in chief of the Guardian after 20 years next summer.' Janine Gibson, a deputy editor of Guardian News & Media and editor-in-chief of theguardian.com, is the favourite to become Alan Rusbridger's successor . Paddy Power has started taking bets on who will become Alan Rusbridger's successor. So far Janine Gibson, the editor-in-chief of theguardian.com and a deputy editor of Guardian News & Media, is the favourite with odds of 2/1. Katharine Viner, deputy editor of Guardian worldwide and editor-in-chief of Guardian US, follows in second with odds of 3/1 while Paul Johnson, a deputy editor of Guardian News and Media, and head of news, business and sport, follows at 5/1. Gibson joined the Guardian in 1998 and went on to launch its New York-based  operation   in September 2011 as US editor-in-chief. Journalist and playwright Viner took over the role earlier this year when Gibson returned to the UK as editor-in-chief of theguardian.com and a deputy editor of Guardian News & Media.Viner had previously launched Guardian Australia in May 2013 as its editor-in-chief.

"This spectacular snowy route marks the border between Sweden and Norway - and is perfect challenge for adventure-loving snowmobilers. But this group are quite literally treading on a thin line - because to their right is Norway where riding a snowmobile for fun is illegal while to their left is Sweden where it is allowed. Strict laws in Norway mean unless it is work related, riding snowmobiles is against the law. But photographer Havard Dalgrav, 25, and his friends were undeterred by the risk of ending up on the wrong side of the law and travelled four hours to the border to capture these stunning shots.

The incredible snowy terrain, home to wolves and brown bears, is more than 1000 miles long and is the longest border along either country.

He said: 'It's a really breath-taking sight - the track seems to go on forever and as much as I'd love to get to the end of it I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to. 'It looks natural but I'm sure the trees must have been removed to mark the border, maybe left from WWII or something when this was much stricter.

A quick dip: Ducks make the most of a river that has remained unfrozen after more snowfall in the Belarusian capital Minsk . But while the pictures may make the route appear to be as smooth as motorway, Mr Dalgrav revealed it was actually a rather bumpy ride. He continued: 'It's about 10-15 metres wide and what you can't tell from the pictures is that it's really quite bumpy so you can't get the sort of speed you crave looking at the long straight line. 'The laws are quite unusual so a lot of us from university travel over to Sweden together. Just a few meters to the right and we would have been breaking the law. 'We discovered it in February this year and we decided to make it an annual trip. It was about -15c so when driving at 100kmh with the wind in your face it's pretty cold. 'Unfortunately due to the temperature my camera stopped working - thankfully it was after I got this shot of the route snaking along the border for miles into the distance.

"One of Tony Abbott's top ministers has begged him to save ABC television production in his home state of South Australia following government funding cuts to the national broadcaster. Education Minister Christopher Pyne, whose electorate of Sturt covers Adelaide, penned a letter to the Prime Minister urging him to overhaul the way the government funds the ABC so shows made in the state won't get cancelled, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. ABC managing director, Mark Scott, revealed last month the Adelaide studios would close after the government slashed $254 million from the broadcaster's budget over the next five years. Scroll down for video . Education Minister Christopher Pyne, whose electorate of Sturt covers Adelaide, penned a letter to the Prime Minister urging him to overhaul the way the government funds the ABC . In his letter, Mr Pyne lists the shows produced in Adelaide including the top-rating and awards winning Dream Build, which he says is listed in the top 12 Australian shows. Mr Pyne said that almost one million people tuned in to watch Adelaide-made Do Yourself A Favour just one day before the closure of the studio was announced. The Education Minister told Mr Abbott he had written to the ABC boss several times asking him to reconsider his plans to stop production.

Mr Pyne said that almost one million people tuned in to watch Adelaide-made Do Yourself A Favour just one day before the closure of the studio was announced . 'But it appears the board is using the savings announced by (Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull) as an excuse to make the ABC more Sydney and Melbourne focussed,' he wrote. He said popular ABC shows like Dream Build, Po's Kitchen and The Cook And The Chef have been produced from the  Adelaide studios and jobs would be lost.

"Mother: Diane Ash-Smith (pictured in October) gave her son Colin, 46, an alibi for the murder of 16-year-old Claire Tiltman in 1993, claiming he had been driving her home after dropping off leaflets . A  schoolgirl's killer has been jailed for life after he dodged justice for two decades because his Labour Councillor mother provided him with a false alibi. Former milkman Colin Ash-Smith, 46, was told he would serve a minimum of 21 years behind bars today after being convicted of murdering Claire Tiltman in a 'barbaric' attack in 1993. Ash-Smith chose not to attend Inner London Crown Court today to hear his fate. Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said Claire had an 'engaging and lively personality' and was 'extremely popular, with a wide circle of friends.' 'I have no doubt that this was a premeditated murder that you carried out because of the feeling of power that it gave you. 'In so doing, you not only ended Claire's young life which was so full of promise, but you also caused unbearable grief and upset to her family and friends. He added: 'This was a premeditated murder. Your intention was to kill. You took a knife to the scene for the purpose, and Claire was vulnerable by reason of her circumstances.' Today's sentence means Ash-Smith will be 67 before he is considered for release. Described in court as his mother's 'golden boy', the knife-obsessive had gone to his 16-year-old victim's funeral in the same clothes he wore when he stabbed her in an alleyway. His parents, Diane and Aubrey, were friends with Claire's through the local Royal British Legion club – but that didn't stop Mrs Ash-Smith, who later became her town's mayor, from providing her son with an alibi for the murder. At first she claimed he had been driving her home after dropping off leaflets, but Ash-Smith later changed his story to say he was at home instead. His mother then used her position as a councillor to obtain information about the murder inquiry, quizzing detectives about a car seen in the area that matched her son's. Mrs Ash-Smith later admitted on TV that she had ordered her husband, who was also a Labour councillor, to dispose of a knife when their son was first questioned by police. Mr Ash-Smith was jailed for six months in 1997 for perverting the course of justice, after cutting up and boiling a blade which he later dumped in a bush. His wife was acquitted of the same charge. Police believe that Ash-Smith, who was obsessed with Jack the Ripper, may have stalked more than 100 women, and planned 'hundreds' of attacks before he was caught. Detectives found a chilling diary of his 'assault plans', in which he described his first attempted murder at the age of 20 as a 'masterpiece'. He also described plans to kill at a care home and railway station. He was jailed for life, serving a minimum of 15 years, in 1996 for two terrifying knife attacks. At the time, Mr Justice Wright warned: 'You are far too dangerous to be at large.' Scroll down for video . Nevertheless, Ash-Smith was on the brink of being released when he was charged with Claire's murder this February, having served 18 years. He was initially imprisoned after kidnapping a school cleaner at gunpoint in 1988. He attempted to rape her and strangle her with his school tie, which tore in half, before stabbing her several times in the back. The 27-year-old survived after rolling down the banks of a quarry to get help. Guilty: Yesterday former milkman Colin Ash-Smith, 46, (left) was finally convicted of murdering 16-year-old Claire Tiltman (right) in 1993. Claire was on her way to a friend's house in Kent birthday when Ash-Smith, then 24, pounced, stabbing her nine times and leaving her to die in an alleyway . Brazen: Ash-Smith is pictured attending Claire's funeral, wearing the same jacket he had on when he stabbed the schoolgirl in an alleyway in Greenhithe, Kent . Motor: Colin Ash-Smith drove this car while on regular night patrols looking for his victims . Ash-Smith was also convicted of stabbing 21-year-old Charlotte Barnard 14 times in 1995, just 300 yards from where he had killed Claire two years earlier. This time his victim's life was saved by her puffa jacket, which stopped the knife from damaging vital organs. He later joked in prison that he could not join a darts team because he always missed his target. He was arrested hours after that attack, at the home he shared with his girlfriend Stella Murrell. The knife he used to stab Miss Barnard was recovered at the house – but although he also became the prime suspect for Claire's murder, police could not prove his guilt due to his alibi. Blade: Mrs Ash-Smith later admitted on TV that she had ordered her husband, who was also a Labour councillor, to dispose of a knife when their son was first questioned by police . Miss Murrell later told officers that Ash-Smith would practise 'play' attacks on her. She was forced to marry him in prison by his parents, who threatened to leave her homeless. Jurors shook their heads as Ash-Smith described how he regularly went on night patrols scouting for victims, saying: 'I was an animal.' He continued to deny Claire's murder, and was only caught after confessing to a prisoner that he had attacked a woman he saw on a zebra crossing – a reference to the schoolgirl. Yesterday the killer betrayed no emotion as he was convicted at Inner London Crown Court after a five-week trial. Around a dozen of Claire's school friends today packed into the public gallery to hear the sentence read out. The judge commended Claire's family and friends who sat through the trial, and the police for their work in bringing her killer to justice. He said: 'I would also like to commend the members of Claire's family and her friends who have attended this trial for the dignified way in which they have conducted themselves. 'And I express my sorrow for the burden they have had to carry for many years at Claire's untimely loss. 'The efforts of Claire's family and friends kept her murder in the public conscience, and thanks to the recent re-activation of the inquiry by Kent police, further evidence came to light and you have finally been brought to justice.' Claire was on her way to a friend's house in Kent four days after her 16th birthday when Ash-Smith, then 24, pounced. He stabbed her nine times and left her to die in an alleyway. Tragically, Claire's parents Cliff and Linda never lived to see her killer brought to justice. Mr Tiltman died of cancer in 2012, four years after his wife succumbed to the disease. Shortly before his death, he said: 'We know [Ash-Smith] did it, the police know he did it. I just wish he would've confessed to it all those years ago and saved us all this agony. Lin ... asked me on her death bed to get justice.' Friends who launched a 'Justice for Claire' group wept yesterday. One said: 'We will never get Claire back and we will never forget her. But now both she and her beloved parents can finally rest in peace, knowing her murderer has at last been brought to justice.' Ash-Smith was branded 'pure evil' by police, while prosecutors said he got a 'warped pleasure' out of attacking women. Mrs Ash-Smith, 66, had been set to testify at the trial as a character witness, but never appeared. Kent Police would not comment yesterday on whether she would face charges following her son's conviction. Emma Edwards (left) and Barbara Rumble (right) were among Claire's family and friends who attended the  sentencing hearing today.

"David Cameron lit a candle in memory of the millions of Holocaust victims as he made his first visit to the Auschwitz concentration camp. The Prime Minister said he wanted to come to the site to see for himself where the 'darkest chapter of human history' took place. And he said: 'We must never forget all those who were murdered here'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron stands under the entrance gates to Auschwitz, during a visit to the former Nazi death camp in Poland, where he has made his visit since becoming Prime Minister . Mr Camerno travelled to the notorious site in Poland on his return from a visit to Turkey yesterday . Mr Cameron honoured a pledge made last year to tour the camp in Poland, where more than a million died at the hands of the Nazi regime. The Prime Minister spent more than an hour in the two main camps which make up the site. Mr Cameron said: 'It is a reminder of why the UK must fight against prejudice, persecution, anti-semitism and tyranny wherever we find it and stand up for inclusiveness, tolerance and peace.' He visited a gas chamber, outside which he signed a book of condolence for the victims. Mr Cameron wrote: 'I wanted to come and see for myself this place where the darkest chapter of human history happened. 'Words cannot describe the horror that took place - making it even more important that we never forget.' The Prime Minister placed a candle and bowed his head at the memorial at the Birkenau extermination camp in Poland, during his personal visit . Mr Cameron called for a zero tolerance of anti-semitism as he described his 'overwhelming sense of grief' following his first visit to Auschwitz . Outside a gas chamber at the Auschwitz concentration camp, Mr Cameron signed the guest book in which he paid tribute to the survivors of the Holocaust . In his message, Mr Cameron wrote: 'Words cannot describe the horror that took place - making it even more important that we never forget.' In a message in the book of remembrance, the PM said: 'I wanted to come here to seefor myself where the darkest chapter in our history transpired. 'Words cannot describe the horror that took place - making it even more important that we never forget. 'As Elie Wiesel said, failing to remember those who were murdered would be akin to killing them all over again. 'The survivors have done so much to tell us about what took place. 'Today they are becoming fewer in number so I hope the Holocaust Commission we have established will teach future generations what took place - and that we must never forget all those who were murdered here and at other camps and at other places. 'We must always remember what happened.' He added: 'As Elie Wiesel said, failing to remember those who were murdered would be akin to failing them all over again. 'The survivors here have so much to tell us about what took place. Today they are becoming fewer in number so I hope the Holocaust Commission we have established will teach future generations what took place and that we must never forget all those who were murdered here and at other camps and in other places. 'We must always remember what happened.' Mr Cameron made the trip on the way back from a visit to Turkey, where he met political leaders to discuss the threat from Islamic State militants. Around one and a half million men, women and children were killed - 90 per cent of them Jewish - in Auschwitz when the area was occupied by the Nazis during the Second World War. The site, which was liberated by the Red Army in 1945, is a network of concentration camps and extermination camps. Prisoners were also used as slave labour, as cruelly depicted by the 'Arbeit Macht Frei' sign which Mr Cameron viewed at the main Auschwitz I site. On a bitterly cold day, the Prime Minister visited the neighbouring Birkenau camp where he saw the train line on which Jewish prisoners arrived before being incarcerated. And he paid his respects at a memorial to the victims - lighting a candle and pausing in silent reflection. Mick Davis, chairman of the Holocaust Commission, who accompanied Mr Cameron, said 'you only begin to understand the enormity of the Holocaust and the huge impact on humanity' by visiting the camp. 'I was just speaking to the Prime Minister just before he left for the airport, and he said to me that he's looked at all the films and read the books but you just can't understand the scale of what happened - the deprivation that took place, the collapse of humanity,' he said. 'Being here was important to the understanding of what took place.' Mr Davis said he was worried that as survivors of the Holocaust passed away, 'society has a habit of consigning history to books and sterility'. Mr Cameron promised last year to visit Auschwitz during 2014. He said at the time of the pledge that more must be done to preserve the memory of the Holocaust at a time when 'anti-Semitism is returning to some parts of Europe'. The Prime Minister announced an increase in government funding for the Holocaust Educational Trust, which takes children and teachers to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. Mr Cameron said it was important that 'we must never forget all those who were murdered here and at other camps and at other places' During the tour, Mr Cameron visted the crematorium area of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp . The Prime Minister said he wanted to come to the site to see for himself where the 'darkest chapter of human history' took place . Mr Cameron spoke to Director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum Piotr Cywinski during his visit . He also launched a new national Holocaust commission, which will set up a permanent Holocaust memorial in Britain. Mr Cameron told the Trust's appeal dinner: 'At a time when anti-Semitism is returning in some parts of mainland Europe, it is more important than ever that – as a whole country – we do everything possible to make sure that the memory of the Holocaust is preserved from generation to generation. 'The Holocaust Educational Trust are leading the way, and it is vital that they are supported.' Last night Karen Pollock, the trust's chief executive, said: 'Today the Prime Minister visited the site of the most heinous crime in our shared history. 'He saw train tracks that brought Jews from across Europe in droves, the crude stables in which they were kept and the gas chambers in which they were ruthlessly murdered.' She added: 'Over the last 15 years, with the support of Government funds, we have taken 25000 students and teachers to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. They come back describing it as life changing. 'With the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and the end of the Holocaust next year, this visit is fitting and timely.'","Prime Minister said he wanted to visit the site to see for himself 'where the darkest chapter in our history transpired'

"Ultimate tip: Cindi Grady, 51, has told of her joy after being gifted with a new car by a customer . A struggling waitress has told of her joy after being gifted with a new car by a customer, calling it the 'tip of a lifetime.' Cindi Grady, 51, who works at Cracker Barrel  in Branson, Missouri - where the average hourly wage is  $3, according to glassdoor.com - had been driving around in a damaged vehicle for months after multiple run-ins with deer. Gary Tackett, a regular at the country-themed diner, noticed the car in the parking lot and thought it was abandoned in such a shabby state. Two windows were covered with plastic and a strap held together the front end. But when he asked who the vehicle belonged to and discovered it was  Grady's, he was quick to take action. 'I talked to my wife and said ""you know, something needs to be done,""' the Arkansas resident told CNN. Tackett, who owns a hardware store, purchased a 2008 Ford Fusion for $2,500 in November and returned to surprise Grady a few weeks before Christmas. A video captured by Tackett's daughter, Chelsea Todd, shows the gifting session taking place. A bemused Grady is led outside by her manager where she is greeted by Tackett. 'We've been watching you drive that car all summer and we decided that you need something a bit better,' he says, leading Grady out to the parking lot. Scroll down for video .

Grady exclaims through tears as she's handed a set of keys to the silver Ford parked before her. 'Merry Christmas,' Tackett says, giving the server a big hug. Grady can hardly believe what's happening as she gets inside the car and starts the engine. The server, who also takes care of her disabled son around full-time work, said that the kind gesture has restored her 'faith in humanity'. 'I was in a spot where I was depressed. Just feeling like nobody cares, it's very different now.' Her 'guardian angel, Tackett concluded: 'It’s all about what’s in your heart I know Cindi said it was her best Christmas ever, and I can assure you it’s ours.' After seeing what deer were capable of doing to her old car, Grady has installed deer whistles on her new ride to alert the animals to stay away. 'I’m still shell shocked,' she added.

"Nick Clegg yesterday demanded publication of the long-delayed official report into the Iraq War before the general election as relatives of soldiers killed in the conflict complained of ‘the biggest cover-up of our time’. The Deputy Prime Minister said he would be ‘very disappointed’ if the Chilcot Inquiry does not conclude before voters go to the polls next May. ‘I very, very much want to see this Chilcot report published because it is not fair on the relatives,’ Mr Clegg told LBC radio. Scroll down for video . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (pictured) has demanded the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War is published before next year's general election . ‘It is absolutely not fair on those people who lost sons and daughters and loved ones in that conflict that they’re still having to wait to understand how that fateful and in my view utterly wrong decision [to go to war] was taken in the first place.’ Rose Gentle, from Glasgow, who lost her 19-year-old son Gordon in Iraq in 2004, said: ‘If they have nothing to hide, why won’t they publish the report? It’s the biggest cover up of our time.’ Sir John Chilcot was asked to investigate the Iraq War by Gordon Brown in 2009 and last took evidence from a witness three years ago. David Cameron said last year that he hoped the difficulties surrounding publication of his conclusions would be ‘concluded as soon as possible’. But the declassification of key documents, and the so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ process, the legal requirement to notify individuals who are criticised in a government-commissioned report, has dragged on. Despite growing anger over the wait for publication of Sir John’s findings, senior Whitehall figures now believe it is now unlikely to see the light of day until after the election. Unless it is published very early next year, it is thought that it will be judged too politically contentious so close to polling day. Labour strategists are said to be concerned at the prospect the spectre of Iraq being raised in the months before the election, since the conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters into the arms of the Liberal Democrats in 2005 and 2010. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair (pictured) has insisted he has nothing to do with the delay in publication of the report . Tony Blair, who is expected to be criticised, insisted he has nothing to do with the delay in publication. The inquiry has already been condemned as a whitewash over a deal to keep letters and notes of phone calls between Mr Blair and George W Bush private. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has vetoed the release of the correspondence in the run-up to the 2003 conflict, insisting that only their ‘gist’ is included in Sir John’s findings. In them, Mr Blair is said to have promised the US President: ‘You know, George, whatever you decide to do, I’m with you.’ The official reason for the censorship is that publication would deter prime ministers from speaking freely in private. But Whitehall sources claim security chiefs and officials in Washington have been firmly against their release. Sir John said the inquiry now hopes to publish ‘gists and quotes’ from some of the messages. He said this was crucial in order for people to understand his conclusions. But the letters will not be published in full and any quotes will be kept to the ‘minimum necessary’, and following the protests from the US, no details of Mr Bush’s messages will be published. Mr Clegg added: ‘I would like to see this report. I would have liked to have seen it published a long time ago. But when this report was set up, quite rightly it was set up entirely independent of politicians. ‘If this was run by politicians people would immediately suspect it to be a stitch-up. ‘Sir John Chilcot will have to explain himself but my understanding, but I very much stress from a distance, is that first the sheer volume of material, millions and millions and millions of documents… they’ve been sifting through that. ‘But then there’s this process which I guess common sense dictates is fair, that those individuals, so the politicians, particularly the politicians of the day in the Labour government of the day that decided on our behalf in my catastrophically and very wrongly to go to war in Iraq, that those individuals who are in any way criticised or commented upon have a right which is fair enough to reply. ‘[But] I very much hope that people who are running the Commission, punctilious though they clearly are being, also feel a heavy weight of responsibility towards the families that they really do need to try and bring this to a conclusion as rapidly as possible. ‘I mean, every prospective sort of timetable or deadline or publication date appears to have slipped.’","Nick Clegg demands publication of the Chilcot Inquiry prior to election .

"Manslaughter charges against two men accused of killing a chef during a gay clingfilm bondage session have been dropped but they remain on trial accused of negligence. Alun Williams, 47, died from a heart attack brought on by overheating and dehydration  after being wrapped up like a mummy in clingfilm and plastic sheeting in an extreme form of sadomasochism. The P&O Ferries head chef, who lived with his girlfriend in Shepherdswell, Kent, had an interest in bondage and mummification and would meet men online for sex, Canterbury Crown Court heard. Lesser charges: Richard Bowler, 35, (left) and David Connor, 23, (right) both of Canterbury, Kent, have had manslaughter charges against them in relation to the death of gay chef Alun Williams, but still face a lesser manslaughter by gross negligence charge . Richard Bowler, 35, and David Connor, 23, both of Canterbury, Kent, both denied manslaughter after he was found dead at the pair's flat in Dover, Kent, on August 20 last year. And after hearing legal arguments Judge Adele Williams ruled the pair should only face the lesser charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. The prosecution allege that having wrapped him in clingfilm they owed him 'a duty of care' but failed to take reasonable steps to ensure he was safe and well. The jury has heard how Mr Williams had been friends with Bowler, who has cerebral palsy which affects his co-ordination and movement, for five years and had met for sex after using various gay websites. In August, Mr Williams went upstairs to Bowler’s flat above a hairdressers salon where he was bound in clingfilm and PVC and a hood. Fatal: Alun Williams, 47, died from a heart attack brought on by overheating and dehydration after being wrapped up like a mummy in clingfilm and plastic sheeting in an extreme form of sadomasochism . Tests on Mr Williams, who had worked for P&O Ferries for 30 years, later revealed he had taken a cocktail of drugs including the horse tranquiliser ketamine. The court has previously heard that he had lay dead for several hours before the pair realised what had happened. Bowler, after making a phone call to his brother and texting his sister-in-law for help, phoned the police at 5.53am and told them he had been involved in a 'kinky sex session' with a friend who was wrapped up and had stopped breathing, the court heard. He was put through to the ambulance service and told them that Mr Williams had taken the drug ketamine. The jury was also played the 999 call made to the police by Bowler shortly before 6am. He is heard telling the call handler: 'It's a bit embarrassing. 'It's my friend, he's called Alun. I have known him for five years. 'I'm gay, he's gay. We had a bit of a kinky sex game and he's stopped breathing.' Discovery: Mr Williams was found dead at the pair's flat in Dover, Kent, on August 20 last year . Connor can be heard in the background as Bowler makes the call. Bowler tells the operator: 'He's on my bed, he's wrapped up in a PVC sheet with tape and that. 'He's got clingfilm wrapped around his body and I have got a text message on my phone stating that's what he likes.' The trial then heard Bowler's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR. When paramedics arrived they discovered the bed covered in black plastic and Bowler performing CPR on Mr Williams. The trial has heard Connor, who worked as a live-in carer for Bowler, allegedly told police Bowler planned to fly abroad after realising Mr Williams had died. He told police: 'I tried to calm Richard down. He was saying he wanted to kill himself, because of his self pity. 'Then he wanted to call up for tickets. I think he actually went onto his laptop to check out how much the tickets were as well. Investigation: Police found drugs including ketamine, cocaine, methamphetamine and amyl nitrate, otherwise known as poppers, in Mr Williams' rucksack, the court was told . 'I talked him out of not doing that as well. I think he said he wanted to fly to Malaga and also get some alcohol.' Connor claimed he had been playing football at Sandwich earlier in the day and had returned to the flat. He later admitted that he took part in wrapping Mr Williams in Clingfilm in the hope of earning some money. Police found drugs including ketamine, cocaine, methamphetamine and amyl nitrate, otherwise known as poppers, in Mr Williams' rucksack, the court was told. They also found a gas mask and ties in his bag, the court heard. Sex toys, masking tape, duct tape, black plastic sheeting and cling film were also found in the flat, the jury heard. A laptop found in Mr Williams' car showed he had an interest in bondage and mummification, the court heard. A post-mortem examination on Mr Williams' body confirmed that he had died suddenly following body wrapping while under the influence of ketamine and methamphetamine. The jury heard how despite having a female partner, Mr Williams enjoyed meetings 'for the purpose of gay sex'. Bowler and Connor both deny the remaining charge against them. The defence case is expected to be heard tomorrow and the trial is expected to end next week.

"More than 70 years after the Battle of Britain raged overhead, these incredible never-before-seen pictures have been released following the death of one of the final surviving airmen. Many of the images were the work of Wing Commander Roger Morewood and were snapped as he clocked up an incredible 5,000 flying hours in 32 different aircraft. During the Battle of Britain the experienced pilot, who joined the RAF at just 19, flew Bristol Blenheims, which were outmatched in speed by the German Luftwaffe, and undertook many dangerous long-range  missions over Holland and the French coast. He survived the war after experiencing a few 'skirmishes in the sky' that on one occasion saw him limp home, and he retired from the RAF in 1957. The photos of his wing-mates and their planes, often taken while flying in formation during combat missions, have been shared for the first time by his family  after he passed away aged 98 years, on of the last of Churchill's Few. Wing Commander Roger Morewood, pictured left as a young pilot, was one of the surviving Battle of Britain airman. He has died aged 98 years leaving behind an incredible collection of photos. Pictured right as a veteran. Mr Morewood was an enthusiastic photographer who had attended the Edinburgh College of Art before joining the forces on the advice of his uncle, aged 19, in 1935. His daughter Rowena Buck, 62, said: 'He was the archetypal RAF pilot. Blue eyes, blond hair which was too long, a handlebar moustache and his collar always up. Wing Commander Morewood is behind the controls of the third single-seater Hurricane from the right as the aircraft flew in formation in 1939. The airman believed the Hurricane's were superior to the more famous Spitfire. Heroic pilot Wing Commander Morewood snapped in his new Hawker Hurricane shortly after the start of World War Two. Before the Hurricane the airman had mainly flown Gloster Gladiator, the RAF's last biplane fighter. The brave airman is pictured here attacking an Axis Flak ship as he flew his Bristol Beaufighter  during a daring combat mission. His family said that he experienced a few 'skirmishes in the sky,' during the war. This image of a Hawker Hart, a two-seater biplane, was captured by the keen photographer in 1937 as he served with the Royal Air Force . The Wing Commander was at the controls of his own aircraft when he took this image of a colleague in the Hawker Hind, light bomber,  as they flew over countryside in 1937 . This  Hawker Fury bi-plane was captured by Wing Commander Morewood in 1937. They fought the most important battle this country ever faced and their victory saved Britain from the tyranny of Nazi Germany. The heroes of the Battle of Britain repelled Hitler’s Luftwaffe in the summer of 1940, although only a few of them are still alive. At the time were in their late teens or early 20s when they took to the skies in Spitfires and Hurricanes from July to October 1940. Others flew in Blenheims, Beaufighters and Defiants, becoming the ‘aces’ of the Battle, shooting down plane after plane. During the Battle, Sir Winston Churchill said: ‘The gratitude of every home in our island, in our empire, and indeed throughout the world, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the world war by their prowess and by their devotion. ‘Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.’ When it was over, 544 RAF pilots and aircrew were dead and had made the ultimate sacrifice to keep generations of Britons safe. 'He felt that he did a lot of bread and butter work that was less colourful to describe, but he put so much time into flying he clocked up more than 5,000 hours in the air. 'He took a lot of photographs during the war, most of which we have in an album and will be going through with the family next week.' Mr Morewood's training saw him first take to the sky in a Tiger Moth biplane before his posting to the elite 56 Squadron in 1937 which, at the time, flew open-cockpit Gauntlet fighters. He then moved on to flying the Gloster Gladiator, the RAF's last biplane fighter. By the outbreak of war he was already an experienced pilot and later acquired the new Hurricane fighter, which he believed were superior to the more famous Spitfire. The pilot transferred to the newly reformed 248 Squadron as flight commander, and for three years flew Bristol Blenheims in the Battle of Britain, described as 'bombers dressed up as fighters'. His daring endeavours saw him undertake dangerous long-range fighter sweeps over Holland and the French coast, before he was promoted to wing commander in 1944. The promotion saw him assigned to Castel Benito near Tripoli in Libya, a posting which he thoroughly enjoyed. Mr Morewood was sent on to Naples as station commander in 1945 where he saw out the war's end before he left the RAF in 1947. But he returned to service in 1951 and finally retired in 1957. Following his retirement, the airman and his wife, Rosemary, started a successful boarding kennel in Aberdeen. In 1981 they moved to Rockcliffe, Dumfries, where they pursued their interests until Rosemary sadly died in 2003. Mrs Buck said: 'He did come across skirmishes in the sky and on one occasion he did limp home and his Blenheim was described as looking like a cheese grater from the amount of bullets in it. 'Roger came down unscathed however, and the ground crew patched the plane up again and it was returned to service for a while until it was later lost.' Mrs Buck described her father's experience of flying the Bristol Blenheims, which were outmatched in speed and armour against the Luftwaffe's more modern fighters. She said: 'They were bombers which were dressed up as fighters as they had put on some extra guns, but they weren't fast so you could not give good chase to enemy planes. 'And if they chased after you, you couldn't outrun them, so they nicknamed it the Flying Coffin. 'A lot of men flew less hours and never made it through the war, so it's miraculous he survived.' In 2013, Mr Morewood was honoured with a special Battle of Britain fly-by from a Hurricane and a Spitfire at his home in Barlochan House in Palnackie. His funeral will take place at Colvend Parish Church in Rockcliffe at 11am on Friday December 19. This was the Gloster Gladiator aircraft flown by the Wing Commander Morewood during 1937. The Gladiator was the RAF's last biplane fighter . During his time with the RAF the Wing Commander Morewood sat at the controls of 32 different aircraft.

"A 92-year-old Florida man is lucky to be alive after he crashed his car into a canal and was rescued by a medical student who happened to be working nearby. Captured on video, the dramatic ordeal unfolded on Wednesday in Port St. Lucie when Salvatore Mancuso's car sped into the water alerting the attention of Alton Brieske, who was eating lunch. Seeing the car sinking quickly, Brieske and his friend, Michael Markisello, jumped into the water, grabbed a hammer and smashed the window, dragging Mr. Mancuso to the shore where they performed CPR. Scroll Down for Video . Rush to help: Alton Brieske saw Mr. Mancuso crash his car into the canal and then jumped into the water immediately to help (right) Without a second thought: Brieske said that when he saw the car drive into the water he just acted on instinct . 'I immediately just took my shirt off and took my shoes off and just dove into the water,' said Brieske to CBS 12. 'I started shouting, 'I need a hammer!'I need something to break this window so I can get in and pull him out.' Smashing the window three times before it shattered, Brieske then faced a race against time to get Mr. Mancuso out before the water filled the car. 'I broke that window, popped the lock, opened the door,' said Brieske to WPBF. 'That's when the water started rushing in, so I just acted fast, popped his seat belt off, put my arm under his shoulder and got him out of the car.' Drama: Brieske and Michael Markisello use a hammer to shatter the window and pull Mr. Mancuso to safety . CPR: Med-student Brieske then performed CPR on Mr. Mancuso, who police believe lost consciousness before the crash . Brieske, who is hoping to become an ER physician, rescucitated Mr. Mancuso after they got him out of the water. 'It was just instinct. I just got in there, got him out and started CPR,' said Brieske. 'I palpated for a pulse and couldn’t find one. I was listening for a breathing rhythm and couldn’t find one, so that’s when I started CPR.' Police said after the heroic rescue that it is likely Mr. Mancuso suffered a loss of consciousness before the accident. The police were quick to praise Brieske and said that without his quick thinking and actions, Mr. Mancuso would have died. 'Very heroic. We’re so thankful for people to come to the aid of others!' said Sgt. Frank Sabol to CBS 12. Brieske, who was called a guardian angel by his friend, was humble about his brave rescue. 'I was just in the right spot at the right time. I mean, yes, it was a heroic act if that's what you want to call it. But, I was just doing what anybody else would do,' said Brieske.","Alton Brieske saw Salvatore Mancuso, 92, crash his car into Florida canal .

"A nine month old baby, who had been fighting for his life for five days after he was hit by a forklift that his father was driving, tragically died on Thursday morning. The young child died at the Royal Children’s Hospital with his devastated parents by his bedside. The heartbreaking incident occurred at about 6.20pm on Saturday night at Blackley Automotive on the Bellarine Highway in Geelong - one hour south of Melbourne. Scroll down for video . The nine month old baby was hit by a forklift that his father was driving at Blackley Automotive in Geelong (pictured) on Saturday night . Police confirmed the baby was crawling on the floor of the factory at the time of the incident . The infant was rushed to Geelong Hospital before being airlifted to The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne in a critical condition. It is understood the parents had been temporarily living in the garage with their four young children when the horrific accident happened, the Geelong Advertiser reported. Geelong Sergeant Pete Chamberlain said the father was behind the wheel of the forklift in a warehouse and had not seen his son who was crawling on the floor at the time of the incident. 'Anyone would be beside themselves, wouldn’t you?' Sergeant Chamberlain told the Herald Sun. He added that it was still not known why the young boy was on the floor at the time as the family were by the baby's bedside in hospital. Sergeant Chamberlain said police will work with the Victorian WorkCover Authority during the investigation which is being treated as an industrial incident. Victoria Police spokeswoman Creina O’Grady told the Herald Sun that the child was not hit by the wheels or the forks, but possibly the front of the machine. The Royal Children's Hospital spokeswoman said Daily Mail Australia that the boy went into surgery on Saturday night for head and chest injuries and was expected to remain in a critical condition in intensive care for at least the rest of the day.

"A woman who wrote that she loved life just days after taking part in the horrific torture, rape and murder of a young couple has been refused parole just two years into a 35-year sentence. Taking 90 minutes to reach their decision, the parole board panel turned down Vanessa Coleman's request to be released two years after she was jailed for the killings of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom. Coleman, 26, will not be eligible for parole again until 2020, the longest amount of time possible, because of the severity of her crime. Vanessa Coleman was refused parole today, two years after she was jailed for her role in the murder, rape and torture of a young couple . Channon Christian, 21, and Christopher Newsom, 23, underwent horrific rape and torture before they were killed in 2007 . She was convicted in 2012 for her role in the torture slayings of Miss Christian, 21, and Mr Newsom, 23. The couple, from Knoxville, Tennessee, were carjacked and abducted as they left a friend's house party in 2007 by Coleman and four men - Letalvis Cobbins, Lemaricus Davidson, Eric Boyd, and George Thomas. Mr Newsom was tied up, raped and shot in the back of the head while his girlfriend watched in horror. He was then dragged to a railway track and set on fire. Miss Christian's death came only after hours of torture, during which time she was raped and savaged with a broken chair leg. She was beaten in the head and household bleach was poured down her throat and over her bleeding and battered body in an attempt by her attackers to cover any evidence of the brutality they had inflicted on her - all while she was still alive. Miss Christian was then hog-tied with curtains and a strip of bedding while a plastic bag was wrapped over her face. Mr Newsom was tied up, raped and shot in the back of the head while his girlfriend watched in horror. She was then beaten, raped and left for dead . Her body was stashed inside five larger rubbish liners and dumped in a bin, where, according to the autopsy report, she slowly suffocated to death. While all of the men except Boyd were found guilty of murder, Coleman was found guilty of lesser charges in 2010. She was re-tried in 2012 because the judge in her case, Richard Baumgartner, had been having sex during breaks from court, as well as buying drugs from convicts. This time Coleman was found guilty of facilitation of aggravated kidnapping, facilitation of rape, and the facilitation of the murder of Miss Christian, but not of Mr Newsom. She was originally due parole in 2019, but good behaviour behind bars meant she could go before the board this year. More than thirty people attended the hearing, but Coleman's parents were the only ones there to support her. Coleman answered questions about her history but refused to talk about the crime because she is going through the appeal process. Coleman (left) was jailed for 35 years for facilitating aggravated kidnap, facilitating rape and facilitating the murder of Miss Christian. Lemaricus Davidson (right) was sentenced to death . Letalvis Cobbins (left) was found guilty of the murders, while Eric Boyd (right) was convicted of lesser charges . Miss Christian's father Gary was at the hearing and told the parole board: 'I've got a heart that's full of pain, and anguish, and hate, and revenge and I didn't put it there.' An online petition with more than 322,000 signatures was also shown to the hearing. Several of the speakers referenced an entry from Coleman's diary, dated three days after the torture, rape and murders of the couple . In the entry, Coleman writes, 'I've had one hell of an adventure since I've been in the big TN. It's a crazy world these days! But I love the fun adventures and lessons that I've learned. Its going to be a long interesting year! Ha! Ha!' Mary Newsom, Mr Newsom's mother, said: 'This is not the thinking of a normal person.' After her application for parole was rejected, Coleman was given an opportunity to apologise for her actions. She said: 'I'd like to say I apologize for your losses. If I could have changed things, I would have changed things. But it wasn't in my control. If you grant me parole, I will greatly appreciate it. I have changed so much. I'm not the person I used to be.'","Vanessa Coleman refused parole two years after she was jailed for 35 years .

"In a scathing critique of Arizona's criminal justice system, a state appeals court on Thursday ordered the dismissal of murder charges against a woman who spent 22 years on death row in her son's killing. The Arizona Court of Appeals said the charges against Debra Jean Milke in the 1989 death of her son Christopher can't be refiled. A three-judge panel said it agrees with Milke's argument that a retrial would amount to double jeopardy. The court held that prosecutors' failure to turn over evidence that could have helped Milke's defense was egregious, calling the actions 'a severe stain on the Arizona justice system.' Dismissed:  The Arizona Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that the charges against Debra Jean Milke in the 1989 death of her son Christopher can't be refiled, and ordered that murder charges against Milke be dismissed . Milke has been free on bail since September 2013 as she awaited retrial (2013 file photo) 'Nondisclosure of this magnitude calls into question the integrity of the system and was highly prejudicial to Milke,' the court wrote. 'In these circumstances — which will hopefully remain unique in the history of Arizona law — the most potent constitutional remedy is required.' Authorities say Milke dressed her son in his favorite outfit and told him he was going to see Santa Claus at a mall in December 1989. He was then taken into the desert outside Phoenix by two men and shot in the back of the head. The court said it wasn't expressing an opinion on Milke's guilt or innocence, though it heavily criticized authorities for staking much of their case on a detective with credibility problems. A federal appeals court threw out Milke's first-degree murder conviction in March 2013, saying prosecutors knew about a history of misconduct by the detective but failed to disclose it. Maricopa County prosecutors were preparing for a retrial. Murder? Authorities say Milke dressed her son in his favorite outfit and told him he was going to see Santa Claus at a mall in December 1989. He was then taken into the desert outside Phoenix by two men and shot in the back of the head . Out: Milke is seen getting out of jail in this 2013 file photo . Milke's appellate attorney, Lori Voepel, was ecstatic at the victory, which prosecutors could appeal to the state Supreme Court. 'We're all thrilled,' Voepel said. 'We still have the gag order so we can't say much more than we're all thrilled with the opinion.' Milke has been free on bail since September 2013 as she awaited retrial. A spokesman for Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery had no immediate comment. 'This is really a sock in the gut — it's a cheap shot,' said Arizona Milke, Christopher's father and ex-husband of Debra Milke. 'She shouldn't walk free, because she's guilty.' Milke was convicted in 1990. The original case rested largely on her purported confession, which Phoenix police Detective Armando Saldate did not record. He has since retired, and The Associated Press has made repeated efforts to reach him for comment. That left jurors with Saldate's word alone that she told him about her involvement. Milke has maintained her innocence and denied she ever confessed. In its ruling overturning Milke's conviction, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited numerous instances in which Saldate committed misconduct in previous cases, including lying under oath and violating suspects' rights. The federal appeals court also asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Saldate had committed civil rights violations. Killers: Jim Styers, left, and Roger Scott, right, confessed to killing Milke's son . Recovery: Christopher Milke's body was found in the Arizona desert (file photo) Prosecutors insist Milke is guilty, but Saldate has claimed he fears potential federal charges if he testifies at a retrial, based on the appeals court accusations of misconduct. In December, Superior Court Judge Rosa Mroz granted Saldate's request to assert his Fifth Amendment right, allowing him to refuse to take the stand. The state Court of Appeals overturned that ruling in April and said Saldate would be forced to testify at the retrial. Both county and federal authorities said they don't intend to seek charges against the detective based on any of the accusations leveled by the federal appeals court. Saldate's attorney countered that authorities had offered no guarantees that he wouldn't face charges in the future based on his testimony, and an appeal to the state Supreme Court was expected. Judge Mroz had previously said that if Saldate didn't testify again, the purported confession likely couldn't be used at her retrial. Milke was convicted in 1990. The original case rested largely on her purported confession, which Phoenix police Detective Armando Saldate did not record . Milke's defense sought dismissal of the entire case against her, noting in a previous motion that 'the only direct evidence linking defendant to the crimes is the defendant's alleged confession to Saldate.' The two men convicted in Christopher's death did not testify against Milke and remain on death row. Milke, whose mother was a German who married a U.S. Air Force military policeman in Berlin in the 1960s, has drawn strong support from citizens of that nation and Switzerland, neither of which has the death penalty. Milke's mother died in Germany in August after a battle with cancer. A week earlier, a judge had denied Milke's request for permission to travel to Germany to visit her sick mother.","The Arizona Court of Appeals said the charges against Debra Jean Milke in the 1989 death of her son Christopher can't be refiled .

"International development minister Desmond Swayne said the government is to review the way the NHS uses staff from poorer countries . The National Health Service's reliance on foreign workers is to be probed amid fears poor countries are suffering from a lack of qualified medics. There were are almost 70,000 health workers from developing countries working in the NHS. International development minister Desmond Swayne today announced the government is to review the impact of health workers being hired in Britain, following calls for the NHS to train staff for the Third World. MPs warned earlier this year that the staffing of the UK health sector 'should not be at the expense of health systems in developing countries'. The international development committee called on the government to 'review its approach to the UK recruitment of health workers from overseas'. The MPs said ministers should consider paying poorer countries whose health workers come to the UK. It also suggested promoting training schemes involving a temporary UK stay and allowing more medical training to take place in the country of the participants. In a Commons debate today, Mr Swayne told MPs: 'Some countries in the world export health workers and draw the remittances from that as a positive balance in their balance of trade, or certainly their balance of payments.' He said he 'recognised this difficulty' and was going to 'surprise' MPs calling for a review. He added: 'We are commissioning a study, a review of NHS use of foreign workers in exactly the way you challenged me.' The work by DfID on how the NHS can help other countries was confirmed on November 21 in response to the committee's report. David Cameron has promised to crack down on immigration if he wins the next election. But there have been repeated warnings about the pressure on the NHS to recruit staff from overseas. Last year the NHS had 68,673 health workers from developing countries, which included 16,615 doctors and 27,032 nurses. Labour MP Hugh Bayley, a member of the committee, told the debate: 'We need to make sure our health policies in relation to developing countries do no harm and yet in one respect I believe our approach to the health services that we provide for citizens in this country do immense harm to developing countries. He added: 'If those health workers were working in developing countries they would hugely, hugely, hugely strengthen the health systems in those countries. 'So we need to consider whether the way we run the NHS is appropriate.' He said: 'If we really want to ensure our healthcare is not good at the expense of poor people in developing countries that's the least we should do. 'If we want to go further then perhaps train two nurses for every one that's in work in the NHS. Almost a third of doctors working in the NHS were trained outside the UK, according to latest figures . Stephen Nickell, a board member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, yesterday warned the NHS would be in 'dire straits' without the influx of migrant workers to take jobs. He told MPs on Treasury select committee: 'Some 35 per cent of health professional are migrants. 'It's quite plain that, if they weren't there, the health service would be in absolutely dire straits.' Last month Witold Sobków, the Polish ambassador to the UK, revealed plans were being drawn up to persuade hundreds of health staff trained in Poland to return home, declaring: 'We want them back.'","Almost 70,000 health workers from developing countries working in NHS .

"Three girls a day are at risk of having their genitals 'mutilated' in Australia. Their clitorises are hacked off in unsterilised conditions, condemning them to a life of pain and in many cases infertility and the inability to ever feel sexual pleasure as adults. Khadija Gbla was nine-years-old when her mother took her into the bush in The Gambia and pinned her down while an old lady cut away at her with a rusty knife. ‘She started hacking away. I remember the pain and trauma of it. The knife was so rusty it felt like it was going on forever,’ Khadija told Daily Mail Australia. Today the 26-year-old, who lives in Adelaide, still recalls every painful moment of the day she was ‘mutilated’ and the years of mental and physical torture she has endured since. Khadija Gbla was nine-years-old when her mother took her into the bush in The Gambia to have her circumcised . ‘I was minding my business as a child and then my mother got home and said we were going for a “holiday”…. We got into a car and ended up in the bush in a remote area. ‘An old lady came out and had a chat with my mum. She was very scary looking and had a rusty old looking knife in her hand… my mother took my clothes off and pinned me down on the floor,’ Khadija told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I thought they were going to slaughter me. She lay on my body above what I now know as a clitoris and cut off that piece of flesh. ‘My struggling didn’t help at all. Then she just threw it across the room almost like it was the most disgusting thing she’d seen in her life. ‘I was lying there in shock… It was so confusing and the pain down there was unbearable. Once it was done she put us back in our car took to us to a friend’s house.’ Khadija moved to Australia at the age of 10 after her family was granted refugee status . Khadija was born in Sierra Leone but when war broke out in 1991 her family moved to The Gambia for safety and then on to Australia when they were granted refugee status in 2001. As a child Khadija didn’t know what had happened to her or why and for years amnesia state stopped her recalling that terrifying day. ‘You don’t ask question to parents or adults in our culture,’ she explained. Khadija’s mother ‘circumcised’ her before she came to Australia at the age of 10 because of a lack of education; she thought it was the right thing to do. Once Khadija came to Australia she was sick ‘all of the time’ with insomnia and depression. She began volunteering for a charity in South Australia called Women's Health Statewide. She helped educate doctors, police officers and people in the community about Female Genital Mutilation, but all of the while not realising that it was what had happened to her. This photo was taken of Khadija (centre) shortly after the horrific procedure was carried out and she had arrived in Australia . It wasn’t until she saw a diagram of the three types of FGM performed on women and children that the memories came flooding back. She noticed the image of a whole clitoris and labia majora cut off and instantly identified with it. ‘I had amnesia but it all came back to me and from then on I realised I was mutilated in these people’s eyes and that was how the world looks at me. ‘This was what happened to me on that terrible day I realised. It was like I was back at that place.’ From that day on it was something she will never forget. ‘I won’t forget even when I’m 50, I’ll always be able to tell you even when I’m 80… It’s so traumatic, so shocking to the system. ‘Not knowing what was about to happen to me on that day made it worse… there was no pre warning or conversation or knowing what I was getting in to. The 26-year-old is now an award-winning human right's campaigner who has set up her own charity called NO FGM Australia to help women and girls here . ‘That was a shock itself for the body let alone the pain from the cutting and the betrayal from my mother doing it to me even though she thought she was doing it out of love. A girl is 'at risk' if: . ‘I can’t forget that. Even if I’m asleep and you wake me up. I will always remember,’ Khadija said. The 26-year-old describes her relationship with her mother as ‘complicated’ and the anger she felt towards her when she found out what she’d done to her is clear in every word Khadija speaks. ‘Once I knew what she took away I was very angry at what she did… as an African Australian I am damaged and I have been abused. There is nothing nice about that,’ Khadija explained. She confronted her mother and asked why she had circumcised her at the age of nine but her mother ‘saw nothing wrong with what she did’. ‘She thought it was a sign of love, self-control over sexuality and all that nonsense… but really I don’t see how I am empowered by having no clitoris.’ In Africa circumcising girls is seen as the norm in some communities. But Khadija has spent more than half of her life growing up in Australia, she identifies herself as African Australian and she feels very much part of the western country’s ‘clitorial-centric society’. ‘Australia celebrates the clitoris as a symbol of women’s sexuality and it’s an amazing thing,’ she said. Khadija and her team were finalists at the Human Rights Awards in Sydney on Thursday night . ‘I didn’t give her permission to take mine away. No way in hell was it a positive thing. It was so traumatic - even now I am angry. ‘I will be angry for the rest of my life… and her refusal to acknowledge the pain she caused me. ‘She took away something that made me feel powerless and invaded me in the most scared way but she didn’t get it, for her it was OK.’ At school Khadija felt ‘different’ to other children and questioned whether she could still define herself as a woman. She didn’t like her body and she didn’t ‘feel pretty down there’. ‘My private place is a place of trauma. When I take a shower I can feel the scar. I can’t forget it.’ She suffered period pains and such bad stomach cramps that she would crawl on the floor in pain and get strong painkillers from hospital to help her cope. She was told she probably wouldn’t be able to have children of her own. Khadija is now eight months pregnant. Her baby boy is due in February and she just hopes he will be a ‘healthy little boy’. She calls her pregnancy a ‘miracle’ but even now her FGM is impacting on what should be a happy time. She continues to fight to stop the violence 'against women and little girls' so that 'another human being doesn't go through this life sentence' She’s had to deal with health professionals with ‘a lack of knowledge and sensitivity’ and still doesn’t know if she will be able to have a vaginal birth in two months due to her scarring. ‘I’m scared it’s going to be like FGM all over again,’ she said. Khadija has been working to abolish FGM in Australia, setting up her own charity called NO FGM Australia to provide healthcare and educational support for women and girls. She also plays a vital role in preventing more children being mutilated in Australia and wants to change the perception that this is about culture. ‘It’s not about culture it’s about violence against women and little girls. They can’t speak up for themselves. ‘In Australia the law say this is illegal and this is child abuse and there is no cultural defence. 'Even back home laws are changing all across Africa… this is a universal concept… it’s wrong and we are being cowards finding any excuse not to take action,’ she said. Khadija explained for her this is not a political fight, she’s doing it because she has to live with it ‘every single day and there is nobody else that will know what it is.’ ‘I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. I know it is a life sentence and it never ends. The consequences never end, from mental health to sexual health. ‘Your vagina becomes a war zone or trauma zone – this is what I fight for, so another human being doesn’t go through this life sentence.’","Khadija Gbla was told she was going on 'holiday' when her mum drove her into the bush in The Gambia to be circumcised .

"A glossy video that features baby Jesus gurgling in his manger has been released today in an attempt to win back the festive season from some of the High Street's biggest names. The advert - which shows a modern family transform into Mary, Joseph and Jesus - is supported by leading Christian groups, who hope to remind the British public of the real meaning of Christmas.

Family: The 45-second clip, which was uploaded to YouTube this morning, starts with a man and woman sitting in their living room - their baby in a wicker basket on the carpet in front of them . True meaning: The roaring fire and twinkling decorations of the room are stripped away, and the man and woman go from wearing Christmas jumpers to robes - their infant child now lying in a manger . But organisers of new video say that it is not twinkling fairies, First World War chocolate bars or a penguin love story that lies at the heart of the season - it is the story of the birth of Jesus Christ. The hope is that the video, which is part of a wider campaign called Christmas starts with Christ, will go viral - much like the High Street offerings that have come before it. Francis Goodwin, head of the Christmas starts with Christ campaign, said: 'The supermarket ads, which were released last month, offered a feel good take on Christmas designed to influence consumers into spending money with them. 'But they all avoided any reference to the religious meaning of the season. We thought it was time to produce the Christmas ad which the supermarkets are unable to make – one which shows where the feel good factor comes from. 'We are asking people to watch it, judge for themselves and share it with friends.' The clip starts with a young couple sat in front of their Christmas tree - their infant child in a wicker basket on the floor in front of them. As a choral rendition of the Power Of Love plays, the roaring fire and twinkling decorations of the room are stripped away, and the man and woman go from wearing Christmas jumpers to robes. In a matter of seconds, the sumptuous living room is transformed into the stable in Bethlehem where Jesus was born - and the giggling baby is now lying in the manger in a bed of straw. It ends with the words Christmas starts with Christ and the hashtag #ChristmasStarts - inviting viewers to share the video, and their responses, on social media. While Christian groups have previously funded joint billboards, posters and radio adverts to invite people to attend church, it is the first time that they have paid for a video advertisement as part of a social media campaign. And, costing just £10,000 to make – one seven hundredth of John Lewis's Christmas campaign – the advert's budget is in keeping with its conservative message. The Church of England, the Evangelical Alliance and Bible Society, are among the churches and Christian charities that are supporting the video, which was uploaded to YouTube this morning. Steve Clifford, general director of the Evangelical Alliance, said: 'Despite the attempts of our leading supermarkets, the magic of Christmas does not lie in celebrities singing about turkeys, nostalgic chocolate bars or happy penguins. 'There really has to be more to Christmas than a battle between Sainsbury's, John Lewis and Marks & Spencer – or between X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing. 'The ""Christmas starts with Christ"" video ad takes viewers to the moment where Christmas began.'","Advertisement released to remind people of the true meaning of Christmas .

"When she rolled out her helpline for the elderly struggling to cope with loneliness, she set herself a target of reaching 100,000 people. But a year since it was launched nationally, Esther Rantzen said The Silver Line has dealt with almost 300,000 calls. The former That's Life! presenter said the demand for the service reveals the vast scale of hidden emptiness and isolation among the elderly, which is driving some to contemplate suicide. Esther Rantzen had hoped to reach 100,000 people when she launched The Silver Line for the elderly struggling to cope with loneliness . And this time of year is particularly painful for many elderly people who face 'solitary confinement'. She said: 'I think the combination of the long evenings, the cold nights, it's harder to get out and about. And the fact that Christmas and the New Year are associated in people's minds with happy memories of their own past. And if you're on your own, you're in, what I call solitary confinement.' Miss Rantzen said many older people often feel ashamed or humiliated by their feelings of loneliness but the telephone service has provided many with confidential support. She explained: 'I had a fantastic letter from someone called Beryl, who said that for the first year after her husband died she just wanted to give up. Life was not worth living. 'Then she rang The Silver Line and she was able to pour out feelings she'd been unable to talk about to anyone else. By pouring out her heart to our Silver Line team she said she had a good night's sleep for the first time. The former That's Life! presenter said the demand for the service reveals the vast scale of hidden emptiness and isolation among the elderly (stock picture) Miss Rantzen added that many older people often feel ashamed or humiliated by their feelings of loneliness but the telephone service has provided many with confidential support . Speaking ahead of BBC 1 programme Meet The Street, a series looking at loneliness which begins on Monday, Miss Rantzen said the helpline has now matched 1,100 callers with Silver Line friends and said more are being trained to provide similar support. Her ambition next year is to take up to one million calls. • 'Christmas gives you a great reason to make contact. That quaint old fashioned formal Christmas card gives you an excuse to bang on the door of the house next door or the house along the road or the flat along the corridor and say how do you do, I just wanted to wish you a happy Christmas.' • 'I think we need to bear in mind in these busy, hard pressed times, you can make the time to make that phone call and it can just make a difference. A phone call is very important.' • 'If you are lucky enough to have your health and strength and the time to do it, I think volunteering is probably the best fun.' The subject of loneliness is one Miss Rantzen has first-hand experience of. Her husband Desmond Wilcox died from heart disease in 2000. Their relationship began as an affair in 1968, when they both worked at the BBC. They married in 1977, had three children and spent 30 years together until his death, aged 69. Three years ago, after her youngest child Joshua moved out, she sold the family home and moved into a two-bedroom flat. At the age of 71 she found herself living alone. Miss Rantzen said: 'I was coming home to a dark flat with no one to make a cup of tea with and no one to ask about my day, it hit me quite profoundly. 'When I started to talk about it working in the elderly care sector, I realised how it resonated with so many hundreds of thousands of people. 'One of the things I discovered was the stigma attached to loneliness, people don't like admitting it, partly because they don't want to be a burden, and partly because they're ashamed, they feel humiliated by this feeling nobody wants them or cares about them. So there is a pride and an independence in the older generation. We want them to know that they're not alone and that we do care.' Although she is surrounded by friends and family, Miss Rantzen admitted she has still has moments when she is overcome with emotion at losing her husband. She said: 'I don't think I have dealt with it, (Desmond's death) I think it's still there and I think it still gets me at moments. I cope by recognising it. 'I recognise it's a feeling I'll probably have… loneliness is usually about loss. And for me it was the loss of Desmond, my late husband. 'I've got a fantastic grandson whom I absolutely adore, who calls me Etta, and I spend as much time with him as I can, my children are superb, I've got lovely friends. But none of that can really take away the loss of Dessy.'","Esther Rantzen aimed to reach 100,000 when she launched the helpline .

"Roger Baker, 66, ran his vet practice in Whitstable, Kent, for 40 years but injected himself with a legal drug after becoming 'overwhelmed' with debt . A vet killed himself with a lethal injection of a drug used to put animals down after becoming 'overwhelmed' by debts, an inquest heard. Roger Baker, 66, successfully ran his veterinary practice in Whitstable, Kent, for 40 years but became overwhelmed by VAT debts and Inland Revenue demands which threatened to close his business. The father-of-three was found dead in a shed close to his practice on April 19 by his wife and son after they went looking for him when he failed to return home, an inquest heard today. He had left several suicide notes on his desk, which were each contained neatly in envelopes and addressed to his family members, including his wife Georgina. A post-mortem examination revealed he died from a fatal overdose of a drug usually used to euthanise animals, and CCTV footage showed him unlocking the dangerous drugs cabinet and taking out several bottles and syringes prior to his death. Mr Baker's wife told the inquest at North East Kent Coroner's Court today that her husband had refused to disclose the scale of his financial difficulties to her. The 65-year-old said she was 'unaware' of the letters from Inland Revenue, but said that her husband would have not wanted to cease trading because he would be deemed 'a complete failure'. She told the hearing: 'He had no intention of retiring. If he couldn't do that anymore, to him, life would not be worth living.' Mrs Baker said she, along with her son Christopher, 30, found the suicide notes on her husband's desk having let themselves into his surgery when he failed to return home from work. She told the coroner said: 'As soon as I read the first line, I knew immediately what had happened.' Her son added: 'It was obvious to me it was a suicide note from a man who was depressed and didn't want to carry on.' The pair called 999 and a search of the building and outbuildings by police found Mr Baker lying on the floor in a shed, with a syringe next to him. Paramedics confirmed he was dead. The father-of-three was found dead in a shed close to his practice on April 19, having injected himself with a lethal drug used to put down animals. He had left suicide notes in marked envelopes on his desk for family . Following his death, Mr Baker's surgery in Whitstable, Kent, has been taken over by Lady Dane veterinary centre (pictured) after his family asked the company to take over the business and retain the staff members . Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Ian Goldup said: 'The deliberateness of his actions, the interpretation of the notes and the circumstances of his death leave me in no doubt that he took his own life.' An investigation by Kent Police concluded there had been no third party involvement or foul play. Mr Baker, who served as vice-chairman of Conservative Animal Welfare, started working at his surgery in 1973. Following his death, his family approached the Lady Dane veterinary centre in Faversham, Kent, which took over his practice and retained the staff.","Roger Baker committed suicide after becoming 'overwhelmed' with debts .

"Thousands of Palestinians gathered on Thursday to mourn a senior official who died in a confrontation with Israeli troops, as the army sent reinforcements to the West Bank and braced for unrest. The Palestinian leadership blamed Israel for the 'killing' of 55-year-old Ziad Abu Ein, as tensions threatened to boil over into another round of violence in the occupied territories. Officials and onlookers streamed into the Ramallah headquarters of president Mahmud Abbas for the funeral procession to a nearby cemetery, an AFP correspondent said. Scroll down for video . Palestinian security members drive with the coffin of senior Palestinian official Ziad Abu Ein during his funeral in the West Bank city of Ramallah . Heartache: Relatives of Abu Ein mourn over his body before the funeral . Violent encounter: Abu Ein lies on the ground after a scuffle with Israeli forces during a demonstration in the village of  Turmus Aya near Ramallah . Abu Ein (left) argues with Israeli soldiers during a demonstration in   Turmus Aya, shortly before he passed away . Uniformed Palestinians carried Abu Ein's coffin, draped in a Palestinian flag, into the courtyard, as nationalist songs blared and mourners chanted 'Revenge!' and 'Your blood will not be spilled in vain!' The coffin was lowered carefully into the ground at a cemetery in Al-Bireh, on the outskirts of Ramallah. Schools were closed in a day of mourning and posters of Abu Ein were plastered on walls throughout the West Bank city. A short distance away, additional Israeli troops and border guards were deployed in anticipation of clashes with mourners and protesters, an army spokeswoman said, especially given the cemetery's proximity to the Jewish settlement of Psagot. There were no immediate reports of violence. Anger: The Palestinian leadership blamed Israel for the 'killing' of 55-year-old Abu Ein . Schools were closed in a day of mourning and posters of Abu Ein were plastered on walls throughout the West Bank city. Here guards solemnly carry the coffin . Military formation: Honour guard prepare for the funeral of Abu Ein . Abu Ein died Wednesday after a confrontation with Israeli soldiers during a protest march against settlements by roughly 300 Palestinians who intended to plant olive trees as a symbolic act, an AFP photographer said. Troops fired tear gas, three soldiers grabbed Abu Ein and he was struck in the chest during the confrontation. Videos circulating online showed the soldiers pushing Abu Ein firmly in the chest and neck. He collapsed and was treated by an Israeli army doctor, but died later in hospital. 'After hearing the results of the post-mortem, the Palestinian government holds Israel fully responsible for the killing of Ziad Abu Ein,' government spokesman Ihab Bseiso told reporters in Ramallah on Thursday. In shock: Family members mourn and cry during the funeral . Guards surround the coffin during the funeral. The coffin was lowered carefully into the ground at a cemetery in Al-Bireh, on the outskirts of Ramallah . A Palestinian minister said the post-mortem, which was carried out by a Palestinian, an Israeli and Jordanian doctors, had shown that Abu Ein was killed by the actions of Israeli troops. 'The reason for the death of Abu Ein was his being hit by (Israeli) occupation troops and because of the heavy use of tear gas,' Palestinian civil affairs minister Hussein al-Sheikh told AFP. Sheikh said Israeli forces had prevented Abu Ein from getting to a hospital quickly enough to save his life. Israel's health ministry said the death was caused by a 'blockage of the coronary artery' which 'could have been caused by stress', adding that Abu Ein suffered from poor health including heart disease. The incident prompted Abbas to threaten measures in response, saying 'all options are open for discussion and implementation', but without specifying what those were. A Palestinian minister said the post-mortem, which was carried out by a Palestinian, an Israeli and Jordanian doctors, had shown that Abu Ein was killed by the actions of Israeli troops . Islamist movement Hamas, rivals of Abbas's West Bank administration and de facto rulers of the Gaza Strip, had urged the Palestinian Authority (PA) to cease security coordination with Israel. Israel urged calm, with Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon expressing regret for the death and saying a military inquiry had been launched. 'Security stability is important for both sides,' he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a message through one of his aides to Abbas in which he 'pointed to the need to calm the situation and act responsibly,' his office said. The death of Abu Ein, who was a former PA deputy minister and was responsible for dealing with the settlement issue, follows months of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians and a wave of unrest in the West Bank and Arab east Jerusalem. Grief-stricken: Family members pay their respects to the former deputy minister . Sorrow: Relatives of Abu Ein console each other . Israelis are on edge after 'hit-and-run' car attacks by Palestinians that killed five people, as well as an assault last month that saw two Palestinians burst into a Jerusalem synagogue, leaving four rabbis and a policeman dead. The tensions have been heightened by Israeli announcements of new settlement construction in east Jerusalem and the West Bank. The settlements issue scuppered peace talks in April after nine months of fruitless Israeli-Palestinian meetings that US Secretary of State John Kerry worked hard to revive. In the absence of talks, the Palestinians are pushing a UN Security Council resolution, which they hope will pass by the end of the year, giving Israel two years to withdraw from occupied territory. If the United States vetoes it as expected, the Palestinian leadership says it will then move to sue Israel through the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes. Kerry is to travel to Rome on Sunday to meet Netanyahu and discuss the situation in the region. Meanwhile, today a large number of members of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad gathered to practice military exercises undertake training drills. Gathering in Deir el-Balah, in the central Gaza strip, the hardline group engaged in marching and explosive exercises under the watchful eye of a group of commanders. The group, founded in 1981, is labelled a terrorist organisation by a large number of Western countries, and is believed to be responsible for attacks that include suicide bombings and the targeting of Israeli civilians.

"A 30-year-old Samoan woman charged with attempted murder after leaving her newborn son in a drain in western Sydney will spend Christmas in prison. The accused did not appear via an audio visual link from jail in Penrith Local Court during a very brief hearing before Magistrate Roger Clisdell. She is next due to appear on January 16. Friends of the woman have rallied around her, posting messages of support on her Facebook page, saying 'God will find an answer' and her situation will be resolved 'through prayer'. Scroll down for video . Tragic mother: This is the 30-year-old Samoan woman who has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly dumping her day old baby son in a drain in western Sydney, where he lay for five days . Increasingly clucky; As her secret pregnancy drew close to term the Sydney woman (pictured) became obsessed with babies and in one photo of herself with a relative's newborn she posted 'Awww, mine' Baby in a drain: The five day old baby boy (left) who miraculously survived after being dumped down this drain (right) by his mother on the day of his birth during hot Spring conditions in western Sydney . One friend posted ''It will be worth it after all - the lyrics of that song will giv u comfort n will make u strong ... Ur not alone ur church family around the world are praying for you ... just stay focus n look up on Jesus'. Several friends posted 'AIGA', which means 'always in God's arms'. The woman, who is the daughter of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor in Samoa, had been living with her aunt and uncle in the western Sydney suburb of Quakers Hill when she became pregnant and kept her condition secret for nine months, according to police. After giving birth to a healthy baby boy at Blacktown hospital at 1am on November 18, she discharged herself early that afternoon and, police allege, took her baby and placed him in a stormwater drain around 500 metres from her home. It's believed the baby was dropped through a small opening and fell around 2.5 metres to the bottom of the drain. The baby then lay for five days in hot, dry conditions until his discovery by Sydney man David Otte and his daughter Hayley on the morning of Sunday, November 23. The pair heard cries coming from the drain as they were cycling and stopped to investigate what they at first assumed would be a small animal. When they discovered the baby, they called emergency services. Secrets and lies: The Samoan woman (pictured) who allegedly attempted to kill her newborn son kept her pregnancy a secret, but could not contain her mounting obsession with babies as her came closer to giving birth herself. She will appear in court on December 10 by video link from a Sydney women's prison . Police from Quakers Hill Local Area Command retrieved the baby, which was wrapped in a pink striped blanket, from the drain. The baby had blood on his head and was taken to hospital where he was found to be severely dehydrated with bleeding on the brain. Now 24 days old, the baby has been released from hospital and is in care. Doctors said the baby was able to survive his experience in the drain because conditions were dry and due to his extreme youth. After police tracked down the mother, she was charged with attempted murder and has been held in a Sydney women's prison for the last three weeks. Magistrate Clisdell said that the woman was refused bail. Relatives told Daily Mail Australia they had been unaware of the woman's pregnancy and did not know who the father could be. Daily Mail Australia has learned the woman had a boyfriend of Samoan ancestry. She also has a five-year-old son from another relationship living in New Zealand. Distraught: The Auntie of the woman accused of attempting to kil her own child is comforted on Facebook (above) by relatives and friends who appear distraught and still bewildered at the events . While she has been accused of dumping her day-old baby down a drain and leaving him to die, the 30-year-old is also thought to be a loving aunt who adores children and appears entirely devoted to her family in Australia and Samoa, Daily Mail Australia can reveal. One of her social media accounts is filled with pictures of babies and young relatives. A family friend has told Daily Mail Australia that the young woman - who goes by an anglicised nickname and works in western Sydney - 'loves children and is very good with children'. Saved: The moment the baby boy is retrieved by Senior-Constable Mark McAlister from the stormwater drain and handed to paramedics in western Sydney last Sunday, five days after his 30-year-old mother allegedly left him for dead . The one day old baby boy was pushed through the tiny opening of this stormwater drain (pictured) in western Sydney. If recent rains had been about, the newborn might have drowned . The son of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor, who leads the church attended by the woman and her family, told Daily Mail Australia that his father had spoken to the woman in prison two weeks ago. He said she 'was trying to keep on top of things' while incarcerated in a Sydney jail, believed to be the Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre. He described her as a 'very happy person' who was 'very good around children and young people at the church'. He said that she is 'a quiet girl' but that 'she's an island girl, so she's got a bit of bite in her' and that might help her cope while in prison awaiting trial for attempted murder. Relatives of the accused woman (pictured leaving Blacktown Court last week) are distraught and confused about the events leading up to the 30-year-old allegedly dumping her newborn son in a drain . The accused woman's aunt (pictured, left) said she did not know who the father of her niece's baby could be . Court documents state the child was placed in the 2.4 metre deep drain less than 24 hours after he was born at Blacktown Hospital. 'The accused makes full admissions to putting the baby down the drain knowing it may kill the baby,' court documents claim. The young woman's social media postings reveal friends and family are distraught over the events, and are still unable to come to terms with the attempted murder charge. Her social media account also reveals that in the months leading up to the day the woman secretly gave birth,  the woman posts photo after photo of newborn relatives with loving messages. 'Happy  Eleven Weeks Princess', she has posted with double pictures of an infant dressed in pink. In another post from earlier this year, below a photograph of her with a relative's baby, she says, 'Awww, it's mine'. Another post with photos of the same baby dressed in a singlet and nappy has 'I love you' written with the accused's name next to it. In earlier posts, the young woman's life appears to revolve around her work friends, family and the church. Last year, she posted a birthday message to her aunt, with whom she was living in Quakers Hill until her arrest, saying 'Happy Birthday to the lady of our house an amazing, aunty, mom, chef ... hero!! Thank God for you [and] may our Good Lord continue to Bless you with many more years to come. Love you loads xox' She is pictured at a relative's wedding in a black dress and carrying a bouquet. The landlord of the house (pictured) where the young Samoan woman lived while hiding her secret pregnancy said he had seen her about three months ago and noticed she had 'put on weight' Chance find: If David Otte and his daughter Hayley (pictured) had not been cycling past the stormwater drain last Sunday morning and heard the baby's cries, the newborn boy may have died and never been found . She also posted pictures of herself attending a church concert and celebrating birthdays with work friends. In a posting in March last year of herself with a young boy she says 'happy 4th birthday to my son' and says 'cant wait to c u again' and 'miss u mate'. On Thursday, Samoan friends put up a poster which said 'Stay Strong and God will be with you' accompanied by the note, 'God be with you Sis'. The day after the woman made her first court appearance  accused of attempted murderer, a close relative posted on Facebook, 'HEARTBREAKING - feeling sad'. A flurry of responses from friends and relatives in Australia, New Zealand and Samoa included 'Pray Mama, just pray!!' and 'Shocking..... Shocking.... Omg, still can't believe it!!'. The woman, believed to be an aunt of the accued, responded, 'Thanks guys right now i feel so empty i can't eat or sleep ... I'm still crying, sorry I can't help it'. The friends responded: 'I know but be strong ok, we're here to give you our strength and love so you can do the same for her. Rest your mind, body and heart you're gonna need the strength tomorrow. Love you xx' 'Love u so much [name deleted] we will get through this we have a special family and now is the time when we need each other the most.' The landlord of the house where the woman had been living with her extended family for at least two years said he had noticed the young woman had put on weight two or three months ago. 'I was delivering the water bill and I saw she was bigger and wearing loose clothes, but I didn't say anything. 'They are a very good family, clean. I see them with their Bibles.'

"The star Ukip candidate accusing her party’s general secretary of being a sex pest was last night exposed as a fantasist. Natasha Bolter’s claim of a top degree in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford University unravelled when the institution took the rare step of denying she had ever attended. And the Mail has learnt she even misspelt her supposed Oxford alma mater Wadham College as ‘Wadam’ on her CV – and said she was aged 35, rather than 39. Natasha Bolter, middle, the star Ukip candidate accusing her party’s general secretary, Roger Bird, of being a sex pest was last night exposed as a fantasist. It casts doubt on her story that she was sexually harassed by Roger Bird, one of Nigel Farage’s key lieutenants. Mr Bird has said the pair were in a relationship. Mrs Bolter told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I didn’t sleep with Roger Bird, end of.’ But he insisted: ‘For the record, yes she did.’ Yesterday it emerged she sent him flirty text messages two days after the harassment claims were made. One said: ‘Love or infatuation made me lose my brain.’ She was a dream candidate for male-dominated Ukip because she is female, the daughter of immigrants and a former Labour supporter. But she exploded a grenade in the party by claiming in The Times that Mr Bird had propositioned her at his club. On Monday, Ukip said Mr Bird had been suspended while it looked at claims of ‘impropriety’. At Ukip’s September conference, Mr Bird introduced Mrs Bolter, saying: ‘She got five A grades at A-levels and went on to read PPE at Wadham College, Oxford.’ Roger Bird said he was in a relationship with Mrs Bolter, who denied she had slept with him. She repeated the Oxford claims in an unpublished interview with The Times, it is understood. But the university said it could find no evidence Mrs Bolter – then Natasha Ahmed – was a student. It said: ‘Oxford University has no record of a Natasha Ahmed with a birthday of 12 July 1975.’ Last night a friend said she did study in Oxford – on a teaching course at the now-defunct Westminster Institute of Education at Oxford Brookes University. The discrepancy echoes the case of Jeffrey Archer, who once claimed to be an Oxford graduate when in fact he attended an education college linked to the main university. On Newsnight, Mrs Bolter said she quit Ukip and walked away from a winnable seat to speak out about Mr Bird, adding that doing so ‘ruined my life’. In her first television interview since the row, the single mother of five said she never ‘felt scared’ of Mr Bird because ‘he was a gentleman’, but spoke out because he was ‘looking at me as a sex object’. She added: ‘I just felt pressured that if I did the right thing my career would go further and faster. If I had slept with him I would probably have had an easier time in Ukip.’ At a subsequent meeting, he asked her to go for dinner – and insisted on buying her a £169 Ted Baker dress because she was not dressed smartly, she said. Mrs Bolter, seen above leaving her home, misspelt her supposed Oxford alma mater Wadham College as ‘Wadam’ on her CV – and said she was aged 35, rather than 39 . Mr Bird responded by saying the pair were in a relationship for seven weeks. He revealed a string of text messages he claimed she sent him – including one which read: ‘I love you and miss you and think you are sort of perfect.’ He has told friends he wants to be reinstated in his £75,000-a-year job and as Ukip candidate for the Cities of London and Westminster. His supporters claim Mrs Bolter’s ‘rambling’ appearance on Newsnight on Tuesday has vindicated him. One said: ‘She didn’t do herself any favours . . . She claimed to have lodged a complaint about Roger on November 5, but some of the affectionate messages she sent him were sent after that – what does that say about her claims? ‘Roger just wants this dealt with so he can get on with his job. He recognises there is a process that has to be gone through, but it is important for everyone that it is dealt with quickly.’ Mr Bird is due to face a disciplinary hearing tomorrow, when he will be able to make his case. Senior party figures have been ordered to keep quiet about the row in public. But parliamentary candidate Helena Windsor broke cover yesterday to support Mr Bird. She tweeted: ‘I can’t imagine a more unlikely sex pest.’ Mrs Bolter was unavailable for comment yesterday. Ukip deputy chairman Neil Hamilton, who stepped in as candidate for Basildon South as Mrs Bolter quit, has withdrawn after a party committee queried his expenses claims for travel and accommodation in his wife’s flat. The shamed former Tory MP, who was involved in the cash for questions scandal, could not be reached last night.","Oxford University has denied that Natasha Bolter ever studied there .

"David Cameron today spoke of his fears about his own children using the internet, as he unveiled new laws to tackle web pornography. The Prime Minister said he did not want to 'seem like a fuddy-duddy' but technology meant there were new threats which children face today which did not exist when he was young. At a summit with internet firms and experts in Whitehall, he announced a new criminal offence of sexual communication with a child is to be created, closing a staggering loophole in the law. David Cameron said that a new law will allow police to pursue paedophiles who 'fish' for victims online . Paedophiles who currently solicit explicit pictures of children routinely escape punishment if it can't be proved they have received an illegal image. But the new law will allow police and prosecutors to pursue those who send text messages or 'fish' for victims online, irrespective of the outcome of their behaviour. Mr Cameron announced that a Serious Crime Bill currently going through Parliament will introduce a broad new offence, punishable by two years in jail. It will allow police and prosecutors to pursue those who 'fish' for child victims on social networks and chat rooms but cannot usually be punished unless they can be shown to have received an illegal image. Mr Cameron said he was approaching the troubling issue of online child abuse, not just as Prime Minister but as a 'dad'. 'I have a 10-year-old, an eight-year-old and a four-year-old and I want them to grow up on safe streets but also grow up with safe internet too,' he said. 'Children growing up in our world today, there are lots of threats they face. The threats are evolving. 'I'm 48, I don't want to seem like a fuddy-duddy, but when I grew up, it was 'Could you help Dad work the betamax video recorder?' 'Now we have tablets, iPads, iPhones, DSs in the house ... a whole set of new things we have to do make sure our children are safe.' Mr Cameron said he and his wife Samantha had applied filters to computers and other devices in their home to keep the internet safe for their children. The PM urged parents and children to talk to each other about the dangers of online child sexual exploitation but added: 'That's difficult for parents - we're still learning a lot about the internet ourselves.' Mr Cameron told the #WeProtect summit how he had taken steps to protect his three children from danger online . Mr Cameron (5th from right, front row) posed with international representatives at the summit at Lancaster House . It was announced that Britain's spy agencies are to try to break up the so-called 'dark web' used by paedophiles to share sick child abuse images online. GCHQ will also form a new specialist unit with the National Crime Agency to tackle the serial offenders who hide from justice by using encrypted internet networks . Other new measures include new technology being used to add a 'digital fingerprint' to child abuse images and videos identified by the authorities that will prevent them being copied and shared. Revenge porn - the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – will become a specific offence. It will also become illegal to possess any item that contains advice or guidance about abusing children sexually. 'We have seen an increasing and alarming phenomenon of adults grooming children online, encouraging them to send images of themselves over the internet or on mobile phones,' Mr Cameron said. 'There can be no grey areas here. If you ask a child to take their clothes off and send a picture, you are as guilty as if you did that in person. 'So we are changing the law. Just as it is illegal to produce and possess images of child abuse, now we are making it illegal to solicit these images too. 'This law will make it clear – this is a crime, and you will be prosecuted for it.' The new offence will include things like talking about sex to a child via a chat room or sending sexually explicit text messages to a child, as well as inviting a child to communicate sexually. It is a victory for the NSPCC, which has run a long campaign which it called 'Flaw in the Law'. Legislation covering this areas predates the widespread use of the internet and particularly social networking sites. It also fails to recognise the nature of grooming, where an abuser aims to flatter the child rather than sending indecent or offensive communications. Prosecutors have attempted to use other legislation, such as the Sexual Offences Act 2003, to pursue online paedophiles – but currently have to show they have incited some kind of sexual activity by a child, such as posing for naked pictures. The new offence criminalises anyone 18 years of age who communicates with a child under 16 if the communication is sexual or intended to elicit from the child any sexual response. Experts believe it will be valuable in targeting offenders at an early stage in offending against children, and could prevent such behaviour from escalating to more serious forms of criminality such as sexual grooming or actual child abuse. The NSPCC's research shows that there has been a 168 per cent increase in the number of children being counselled by ChildLine about online sexual abuse – averaging seven contacts a day to its helpline. Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, hailed the announcement as 'a victory for our Flaw in the Law campaign but more importantly a major step forward in preventing online child abuse'. He added: 'The rise of online communication means that children are increasingly being exposed to sexual messages from adults, but in many cases the police have been powerless to act. The full force of the law can now be immediately brought to bear on anyone who grooms children for abuse online.' The new offence will include things like talking about sex to a child via a chat room or sending sexually explicit text messages to a child, as well as inviting a child to communicate sexually . Today's summit is the latest in a string of initiatives announced by the government since the Mail launched its 'Say No to On-line Porn' campaign in 2013. JULY 2013: After a long-running Mail campaign, Government announces plan to block online pornography unless households 'opt in'. All 19million UK homes connected to the net are being contacted by service providers and told they must decide whether filters that block porn sites are switched on or off. The same month, pornography depicting rape is outlawed. NOVEMBER 2013: Google and other net giants announce measures to block searches for around 100,000 terms relating to child sexual abuse. Instead warnings appear from Google and charities at the top of search results, directing people to places they can get help. Also last November, a UK-US taskforce is established to target paedophiles who use the internet to hide from the law. DECEMBER 2014: Offence of sexual communication with a child is announced. Technology to stop child abuse images from being copied and shared to be introduced. At today's summit, Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft and Twitter will unveil new solutions to block and remove illegal child abuse material online. The digital fingerprints of thousands of known child sex abuse images identified by the Internet Watch Foundation will be used by tech companies to prevent them being shared on their services, so they can no longer be viewed. Microsoft, Google and Mozilla have also committed to investigate the feasibility of implementing browser level blocking restrictions designed to prevent people getting access to known child abuse material via Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox. Restrictions are currently only in place to prevent images and videos of child abuse material from appearing in search results. Google has seen a fivefold reduction in the number of searches for child abuse images since these changes were made earlier this year following a Daily Mail campaign. The Prime Minister also announced commitments from more than 30 countries to increase law enforcement ability to track more paedophiles and help more victims. They have agreed to set up their own national databases of child sex abuse material, enabling its removal from the internet, and to build better online reporting mechanisms like the Internet Watch Foundation. Mr Cameron said today: 'Every time someone chooses to view an online image or a video of a child being abused, they are choosing to participate in a horrific crime. Every single view represents that victim being abused again. They may as well be in the room with them. 'I want to build a better future for our children. The package I am announcing today is a watershed moment in reducing the volume of child abuse images online. It marks significant progress in delivering a truly world-leading response to a global problem. 'The so-called 'dark-net' is increasingly used by paedophiles to view sickening images. I want them to hear loud and clear, we are shining a light on the web's darkest corners; if you are thinking of offending there will be nowhere for you to hide.' It is estimated that the number of offences relating to indecent images of children reaching magistrates' courts will be over 22,500 this year – the highest ever. More than 1,000 alleged paedophiles have been arrested in Britain in the past 12 months, more than five times the 2012-13 figure of 192. Conservative MP for Romsey Caroline Nokes said it was right to make it 'always illegal for an adult to send a sexual message to a child'. 'Given the alarming rise in online child abuse, it is very concerning that the current law is unable to adequately protect children,' she said. Labour's Virendra Sharma also backed reform. 'Existing laws are fragmented and sex offenders are able to, and often do, exploit the loopholes,' he said.","Police currently have to prove suspects have received an illegal image .
But new law will allow police to pursue those who 'fish' for victims online .
Punishment will apply irrespective of outcome of paedophile's behaviour .
The Serious Crime Bill will make offence punishable by two years in jail .
Revenge porn will also become a specific offence, PM confirmed today ."
"A dime-sized endangered spider found at a Texas construction site has wound up tripling the cost of a planned new highway and delaying the project for years. A Bracken Cave meshweaver spider, only the second ever recorded by man, was discovered in a cave that San Antonio crews unearthed while building a highway in 2012. Years later, the project originally slated for completion in 2012 has yet to break ground and is projected to cost at least $45 million by the time it's done. Big headache: A Bracken Cave meshweaver spider, only the second ever recorded by man, was discovered in a cave that San Antonio crews unearthed while building a highway in 2012 . Stopped everything: The spider was only the second ever seen, but it had previously been placed on the endangered species list, so construction of the $15 million highway stopped abruptly . The original budget was $15 million. And ground won't even be broken until 2015. An underpass originally planned is being replaced with an overpass to accommodate the spider, known by its Latin name Cicurina Venii. So what's so special about this tiny, blind bug? 'The thing that was unique about this spider is that it had been seen only once before in recorded history,' Josh Donat, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Transportation, told the San Antonio Express-News. The last time a person had seen the spider was in 1980 in northwestern Bexar County. But that one time was enough to get the meshweaver placed on the federal endangered species list in 2000. Which means big headaches for contractors, crews and some locals. 'I think that kind of tripling of infrastructure cost is a complete budget buster. 'Patrick Natale, executive director of the American Society of Civil Engineers, told CBS News. Comptroller Susan Combs agreed. 'When they're told that there is a dime-sized spider, which nobody had ever heard of, and it's going to maybe cost lives because of ambulances or you can't get to work, they don't understand it. They don't see its value and they're shaking their heads,' she said. Costly: The project was slated to be finished in 2012 but now won't even break ground until 2015, and at a cost of at least three times the original $15 million cost .","A Bracken Cave meshweaver was found in a cave uncovered by construction in the middle of a San Antonio area highway in 2012 .
The dime-sized, translucent arachnid was only the second ever discovered .
Biologists ordered the cave sealed, work stopped and the construction contract was terminated .
Years and at least $30million later, the project will finally break ground in 2015, though it was originally slated for completion in 2012 ."
"The moment when a young boy with severe hearing difficulties heard his mother's voice for the very first time has been captured in a heartwarming video clip, which shows the youngster dissolving into a fit of giggles every time she speaks. Entrepreneur Jennifer Colson Aprea, from Huntington Beach, California, posted the clip of her two-year-old son Ryan on her company's Facebook page on Monday, revealing that her son had successfully been fitted with a cochlear implant which is enabling him to hear sounds for the first time in his life. 'We're heading home and it's all good news after the mapping and activation,' the mother-of-two, who founded cloth diaper brand Spray Pal, wrote. What a laugh! Ryan Aprea couldn't stop giggling when he heard his mother Jennifer's voice for the first time . Making a memory: The family captured the heartwarming moment on video and quickly shared the clip with their followers on Facebook . 'His brain is definitely receiving sound. The audiologist programmed the device at three different levels and we will gradually increase them throughout the week. 'These are VERY low levels of sound input because we don't want to overwhelm him and cause him to reject it. We filmed him each time we tested the new level, and he giggled like this when he heard my voice at every level which was the most amazing feeling because we couldn't have asked for a better response. 'As long as he is happy and loving it, we are happy! If this develops into hearing comprehension and oral language down the road, that will be icing on the cake!' And it seems as though life is full of laughs for Ryan these days. Just hours after posting the video of her son's infectious giggling fits, Jennifer shared some photos of the toddler playing with all of his toys at home, adding that the experience was totally new to him now that he is able to actually hear them. 'Every toy is new!' Hours after posting the video, Jennifer shared this image of her son enjoying the sounds of his toys at home . Feeling better: The youngster spent seven months in the neonatal intensive care unit after being born prematurely . 'Every toy is NEW!' she wrote. 'His face lighting up to the sounds is SO incredible! This is such a happy day!!' Ryan, who was born in October 2012 when he was just 25 weeks old, spent seven months in an intensive care unit before being allowed to return home with his family. Since then, Jennifer has continued to document every stage of his life, sharing every success and struggle with her followers on Facebook, from Ryan's first few weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit to his cochlear surgery in November. 'If you've been following our journey for a while, you probably already know that [Ryan] was born at 25 weeks,' she wrote on the page in October. 'Being a micropreemie isn't easy, especially when you end up staying in the NICU 7 months.'","Ryan Aprea, two, was born at just 25 weeks and suffers from impaired sight and hearing .

"Mark Skinner, 49, pictured leaving court earlier in the year, spied on four women, a court heard. A sex-obsessed Army Major who placed a hidden camera in an army barracks toilet escaped jail yesterday. Mark Skinner, 49,  had suffered a back problem that prevented him from sleeping with his wife – but his ‘addiction’ led him  spy on four women, a court heard. His sex addiction led to him setting up a camera in a toilet and also spying on victims as they undressed in their homes. Bulford Military Court in Wiltshire heard how Skinner filmed four victims between February and August last year, leaving them feeling ‘humiliated’, ‘confused’ and ‘disgusted’. The six-inch long and two-inch wide camera - similar to a GoPro personal video camera device - was placed on the floor inside the female toilet at the Westdown army barracks near Warminster. Taking advantage of both his rank and position, he also filmed victims undressing in their homes at the Beachley Barracks near Chepstow, Gloucestershire, the court heard. Yesterday Jeremy Barton, defending, described Skinner as a ‘sex addict’. In his mitigation he said: ‘He was suffering from a number of mental health issues at the time. ‘He was suffering from a sex addiction. He also had back problems and was suffering from not having an active role in the army. ‘He had a desk job rather than being on his feet. ‘His sex life had suffered because of his back and he was unable to have sex with his wife, who is in court today. ‘The way he dealt with it was by visiting adult porn websites and he masturbated more than what is considered the normal amount for a male adult. ‘In relation to the incident itself, it was out of character as he is of exemplary character and that should go towards his credit. He also filmed victims undressing in their homes at the Beachley Barracks near Chepstow (pictured) ‘This is unlikely to be repeated. The defendant is embarrassed and ashamed.’ The court heard how Skinner, a former member of the 1st Battalion of The Rifles, was awarded a Queen’s Jubilee Medal and an Accumulated Service Medal while completing more than 33 years of service. The married ex-major, from Gloucester, who has no children, joined the Army in 1980 and was discharged on medical grounds on February 2014. Lt Cl Will Peters, prosecuting, said: ‘Between August 19 and 29, 2013, a small training exercise took part in the army barracks near Warminster. ‘At about 22.00 hours on August 26, 2013, the victim was using the female toilet. ‘And on the floor next to the toilet she saw what she thought was a camera pointing up from the floor towards the toilet. ‘At the time of seeing it she could not believe her eyes and thought it was an air freshener and left the toilet. ‘She went back to her room and thought about what she had seen and after about ten minutes she went back but the device had gone.’ Judge Advocate Alan Large ordered Skinner to complete the sex offenders’ treatment programme . The court heard how the women went back to the toilet the following evening and the camera was back on the floor next to the toilet. He added: ‘She picked it up and kept it and reported it to a number of friends who were working on camp. ‘The video footage was on the camera itself and images were captured of the defendant putting the camera in place. ‘He was in the corridor when the camera was found but he did not accept responsibility. ‘The (memory) card was examined by police and the images of the defendant placing it in the toilet were discovered by officers. ‘He was quickly identified because of what was on the camera and was arrested on August 28.’ After he was arrested he told officers: ‘I did not do this.’ Lt Cl Peters added: ‘He was interviewed on August 29 and gave a pre-planned statement and admitted responsibility for placing the camera in the toilet.’ Another incident happened at the Beachley Barracks near Chepstow, Gloucestershire, where Skinner filmed victims in their homes. Lt Cl Peters added: ‘Video footage was found which shows the two girls in various states of dress and undress at various times of the day. ‘He was interviewed on March 19, 2014, and he said he could not recall making the videos.’ Victim impact statements were read out by Lt Cll Peters to Bulford Military Court in Wiltshire. He said: ‘The incident in Westdown barracks made her feel humiliated and exposed. ‘After it happened she found it hard to trust people and felt she was being watched and it changed her perception of people in the military.’ Reading another statement, he added: ‘The invasion of privacy left her feeling confused and disgusted.’ Brigadier Richard Toomey, who worked with Skinner, gave evidence at court and described him as being an ‘amusing’, ‘intelligent’ and someone with great ‘integrity’. Judge Advocate Alan Large, assisted by a board of three servicemen, ordered Skinner to complete the sex offenders’ treatment programme within three years. He also ordered him to sign on to the sex offenders’ register for five years. Bulford Military Court in Wiltshire (pictured) heard Skinner filmed four victims between February and August last year, leaving them feeling ‘humiliated’, ‘confused’ and ‘disgusted’ Judge Large said: ‘The incidents have impacted the lives of the victims because they feel humiliated, confused and disgusted. ‘Had you still been serving in the army, we would have included a dismissal to your sentence. ‘They (your actions) were recorded and there was a degree of planning and there was certainly an abuse of rank and position.’ Skinner admitted four counts of voyeurism at an earlier hearing on November 6 this year. Two of the charges refer to incidents which took place from February 2013 to August 2013. Charges three and four took place around August 27, 2013. But he avoided jail and was instead told to complete the sex offenders’ treatment programme within three years. He was also ordered to sign on to the sex offenders’ register for five years. His teary-eyed wife, who had stood by him throughout the hearings, gave him a hug as he was told he would not be going to jail.","Mark Skinner, 49, set up a camera at the female toilets at his place of work .

"A football coach who made an ignorant statement during a recent interview got the ultimate payback at a news conference this week. Cincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis was appearing on a local Cincinnati radio station earlier this week when he referred to Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel as a 'midget.' And while the rookie footballer, who claims to be 6'0"" said he had no problem with Lewis' comment, even calling the comment 'funny,' a Cleveland news station found the perfect way to make Lewis acknowledge his statement - by sending a little person to interview him. Scroll down for videos . Hot water: Cincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis (above) got in hot water over recent statements he made about Johnny Manziel . Not nice: In an interview with a Cincinnati radio station, Lewis called Manziel (above) a 'midget' Payback: One Cleveland news station decided to respond to the controversy by sending a little person, Lil' John Rinaldi (above) to interview Lewis on Wednesday . Lil’ John Rinaldi turned up to Wednesday's news conference armed with a number of questions for Fox 8 having to do with Manziel's height. Before he could start asking them though, Lewis did take a moment to apologize for his 'midget' comment. 'It was thoughtless on my part to use the word I did, and not excusable, and I greatly regret it,' he told the assembled reporters. Then Rinaldi got to his first question for Lewis; 'Based on the height difference of a play like Manziel how has your defensive approach changed for Sunday’s game?' This was a reference to the fact that Manziel is a few inches shorter than Brian Hoyer, the Browns normal starter, who he is replacing in Sunday's game. Lewis, undaunted, gave the question a long and thorough response. Not bothered: Rinaldi (above in blue in a photo posted by Mark Slaughter on Twitter) said he was not offended by Lewis' comment . Rinaldi then asked; 'Hoyer likes to stand tall in the pocket and Manziel likes to move around. What challenges does that present to your defense?' Lewis again had a nice long response. For his part, Rinaldi said he took no offense with Lewis' comment, and feels the coach has apologized enough. Manziel will have a shot at getting the last word however when his Browns take on Lewis' Bengals this Sunday in Cleveland.","Cincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis was grilled by a little person at a news conference on Wednesday .

"She was the photographer who showed the world an alternative view of World War One with pictures of soldiers in the trenches having their Christmas Day meal. Her impressive back catalogue of 40,000 photographs are testament to a woman who was among the first to venture onto the streets of London in the early 20th century to capture images of George V before he became King, protesting suffragettes and a Lyons tea seller in action. But despite the trail-blazing nature of her work, the achievements of Christina Broom - widely regarded as Britain's first female press photographer - have remained largely unrecognised for the last 100 years. An exhibition to celebrate her photography will now be held in a bid to readdress the balance of the talented  but largely 'under-appreciated' pioneer of the profession in the early 1900s, whose business sense saw her build a career spanning more than three decades. Scroll down for video . An exhibition of the works of Christina Broom, Britain's first female press photographer, will be held to show her extraordinary achievements where she took photos of soldiers such as this group of Grenadier Guards, posing for a photo at their camp in Wimbledon Common, in 1914 . Mrs Broom featured life in London from soldiers, to royalty to the works of suffragettes and Christabel Pankhurst, pictured in 1909 . Mrs Broom made her craft a family affair, involving her daughter Winifred who took this portrait (left) of her mother in 1910 and printed her photographs as postcards, which the talented photographer then sold from her stall in London (right in 1918) as postcards became popular . The exhibition will feature some of the sights she captured during her extraordinary working life, which saw her venture into the world of photography at the age of 40 after her husband suffered an accident which meant she had to become the main breadwinner for the family. Her images include soldiers in their barracks on Christmas Day as well as officers taking part in bayonet practice during World War One. It also features her photos of suffragettes protesting on the streets of London and members of the Royal Family, including Queen Victoria. The exhibition, which will be held at the Museum of London Docklands from early next year, will illustrate the life of Broom, while showing the keen business sense which led to her images being featured in national publications. Anna Sparham, Curator of Photographs at the museum, said: 'Christina Broom is a somewhat under-appreciated figure in photography, and we hope that this major exhibition will redress this. Mrs Broom aimed to capture images of London life, such as the iconic J Lyons tea stall serving customers at Victoria station, London in 1905 . Broom captured soldiers at their barracks on Christmas day, showing an alternative view as a Grenadier Guard stands beside a banner in 1915 . Images of the 4th Battalion Grenadiers enjoying lunch on Christmas Day from their barracks in Chelsea in 1915 were printed on postcards . The photographer's images aimed to capture alternative aspects of army life, such as children in an army pageant at Fulham Palace in 1910 . Mrs Broom's collection features a variety of photos, including those of an army pageant featuring St George and a young Knight in 1910 . 'It will not just show off her work, but portray Broom, who was a formidable, determined woman, and commercially-astute - taking advantage of a rapidly growing postcard market.' Broom was compelled to work after her husband, Albert Broom, was injured in a cricket accident and she was forced to become the main breadwinner for the household. She decided, at the age of 40, to pursue a career in photography. Mrs Broom initially printed her images, such as this one of Grenadier Guards raising a glass at Chelsea Barracks in 1915, on postcards . The enterprising businesswoman had a successful career spanning three decades and was able to sell her pictures to national publications . Mrs Broom's images were rooted in capturing life in London such as that of the 2nd Grenadier Guards at their Wellington Barracks in 1915 . She started her career at  40, capturing British soldiers in their barracks as well as the first American contingent at Wellington Barracks in 1917 . Broom's collection includes images of the 1st LIfe Guards saying goodbye to their wives at Waterloo station as they prepare to leave in 1915 . While she had female contemporaries they were largely confined to the studio but Broom decided to do something new, and relatively unheard of for a woman living in the early 1900s and venture onto the streets of Fulham in London to pursue her craft. Equipped with a keen business sense, Broom decided to take advantage of the burgeoning postcard market and began to sell her first news photographs as postcards in 1903. Her skill was quickly spotted and she continued to sell postcards from her stall at the gates of the Royal Mews in London. The catalogue of 40,000 images includes pictures of a State Coachman at the Royal Mews in 1920 (left)  and the Royal Family with King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, the future King George V and Queen Mary, and Princess Victoria at the Duke of York's School, Chelsea, in 1908 . Coachmen and visitors were captured in their finery visiting the Royal Mews, where Mrs Broom had a stall to sell her postcards, in 1920 . Broom was regarded as 'trail blazing' as she was one of the only women to venture from the studio to London streets to capture unique images . Mrs Broom's work included significant events such as the Oxford rowing team, seen taking part in the University boat race in Putney in 1911 . She also submitted images to Tatler, The Daily Sketch, Illustrated London News and Country Life for 36 years until her death in 1939. Her career was a family affair as her daughter Winifred Bloom helped her print photographs from the age of 14. The exhibition will include a cross section of her work, including many photographs that have previously been in private collections and never-before-seen on public display. Female police officers and Inspector Mary Mary Allen (centre), a former suffragette, were seen at the Women's War Work Exhibition in 1915 . Mrs Broom managed to capture suffragettes, soldiers and protests taking place in London such as nurses and midwives marching as part of the Pageant of Women's Trades and Professions which took place through the city and ended at the Royal Albert Hall in April 1909 . The exhibition next year will feature suffragettes taking part in the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies pageant on 13 June 1908 . Mrs Broom's images captured soldiers in a variety of situations, such as the Irish Guards on St Patrick's Day at Wellington Barracks in 1908 . An early photo, taken in 1911 of the 1st Irish Guards at bayonet practice at Chelsea Barracks would have been printed and sold as a postcard . These will be joined by original glass plate negatives, postcards, and objects which build a fuller picture of Broom's character and her career, including personal possessions, letters, event passes, autograph books, notebooks and cuttings books. The majority of the exhibition content will derive from the Museum of London's collection of her work, including a recent acquisition of 2,500 photographs, with a view to supplementing with a few key loans from other institutions. The exhibition will be held from June 19 next year until November 1 and entry will be free.","Christina Broom started her career at the age of 40 in 1900s and was seen as the first female press photographer .

"The standard of living in Britain has risen to become the fourth highest in the whole of Europe, a new study showed today. Average spending power per person is now only behind Luxembourg, Germany and Austria, according the Europe’s official statistics watchdog. Life in the UK is now ranked alongside popular Scandinavian countries like Denmark, Sweden and Finland. New figures from Eurostat show that the UK was ranked joint fourth for living standards in 2013, equal to Denmark, Finland and Sweden . Labour leader Ed Miliband today renewed his attack on the government, accusing the Tories of wanting to embark on deep spending cuts which would lead to a ‘permanent cost of living crisis’. But today’s figures show that compared to other EU countries, Britain is faring better than most. In the UK, living standards – expressed as Actual Individual Consumption per capita – was 15 per cent higher than the EU average. In Luxembourg, it was 36 per cent higher, Germany 22 per cent and Austria 20 per cent. Between 2012 and 2013, living standards fell in Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Cyprus, Portugal, Greece, Malta, Lithuania, Slovenia and Bulgaria. Overall Lithuania, Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia were between 20 per cent and 30 per cent below the average, while Estonia, Latvia, Hungary and Croatia were between 30 per cent and . Labour leader Ed Miliband today renewed his attack on the government for overseeing what he calls a 'cost of living crisis' 40 per cent below. Romania was just under 40 per cent below the average, while Bulgaria was around 50 per cent below the average. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Today’s news that the UK has risen to have the fourth highest standard of living in the EU provides further evidence that the government’s long-term economic plan is working. ‘But the job is not done and so the government will go on taking the difficult decisions needed to secure a responsible recovery and stay on course to prosperity.’ AIC per head is used as a measure of families’ standard of living as it covers spending on all goods and services that a household consumes, including benefits-in-kind, such as health and education services. The Office for National Statistics found that prices paid by UK families were sixth highest in the EU in 2013, in line with Belgium and the Netherlands. Denmark remained the most expensive place to live, with prices 42 per cent above the EU average, while prices in Bulgaria at 56 per cent below remained the lowest. In a major speech on the economy today, Mr Miliband pledged a Labour government would tackle the deficit ‘as soon as possible’ but admitted it could take until 2010. And he issued a warning about the risk to living standards of Tory plans to balance the books sooner: ‘I want the British people to know what this really means: it is a recipe for the disintegration of our public services. ‘And, also, for a permanent cost of living crisis because we won’t be investing in the skills, infrastructure and education we need for good quality jobs.’ He rejected criticism of Labour’s economic plan. ‘For some time, I have heard people claim that our economic argument around the cost of living crisis has been missing the main economic challenge, of tackling the deficit. ‘But the facts are now in: it turns out that tackling the cost of living crisis is in fact essential for tackling the deficit. ‘For the first three years of the Parliament, we saw little or no growth in the economy. ‘And as a result the government spectacularly failed in their deficit reduction strategy. ‘Now, finally, growth has resumed, but what became clear in the Autumn Statement is that the character of growth is such that they are still failing.’","Spending per person only behind Luxembourg, Germany and Austria .

"National Football League owners unanimously voted for a new personal conduct policy to be put in place in the wake of scandals involving players Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. The league has been heavily criticized over the last six months as it struggled with a policy widely seen as too lenient. Commissioner Roger Goodell came under fire over his handling of the high-profile domestic violence cases involving Rice and Peterson with the players' union demanding Mr Goodell be removed entirely from the disciplinary process. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, left, looks on as Dallas Cowboys Executive Vice President Charlotte Jones Anderson speaks at an NFL press conference during an owners meeting in Irving, Texas . But a new 'comprehensive' policy was unveiled at a regularly scheduled owners meeting in Irving, Texas, outside Dallas on Wednesday. Mr Goodell said: 'The policy is comprehensive. It is strong. It is tough. And it is better for everyone associated with the NFL.' Among the changes are a 'more extensive' list of prohibited conduct and NFL-funded counseling and services for victims, families, and violators, he said. He added: 'I have stated it many times: Being part of the NFL is a privilege. It is not a right. The measures adopted today uphold that principle.' He announced the league will hire a special counsel for investigations and conduct to oversee initial discipline, but Mr Goodell will retain authority to rule on appeals. Ray Rice, right, is free to play in the NFL after knocking out his then-fiancee Janay, centre, in a casino lift . The commissioner may also appoint a panel of independent experts to participate in appeals. A nine-member committee that includes owners and their wives (the addition of female voices on the committee is new) and former players will oversee the implementation of the policy. Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill will serve as chairman of the committee, which has been brought in after a series of incidents saw players accused of domestic violence or child abuse. Last month, an arbitrator threw out Rice's indefinite suspension by the NFL for hitting his then-fiancee Janay in a hotel elevator, freeing him to play again. Former U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones said Mr Goodell's decision in September to change Rice's original suspension from two games to indefinite was 'arbitrary' and an 'abuse of discretion.' Arizona Cardinals President and Chairman of the NFL's new Conduct Committee Michael Bidwill . After noting the two-game suspension given to Rice was insufficient, Mr Goodell had changed the minimum punishment under the personal conduct policy to six games. But after a video of the punch became public, Rice was released by the Ravens and Goodell suspended him indefinitely. Rice and the union contended he was essentially sentenced twice, and Jones agreed, saying Rice 'did not lie to or mislead the NFL.' Peterson's appeal of a league suspension lasting until next April 15 was heard by Harold Henderson last week. Henderson, a former NFL executive, was appointed by Goodell to rule on the appeal and is expected to do so soon. Peterson is seeking reinstatement, something Goodell said he would not consider before April 15. The 2012 NFL MVP hasn't played for the Minnesota Vikings since Week 1 after he was charged with child abuse in Texas. He was placed on paid leave while the legal process played out, and he pleaded no contest on November 4 to misdemeanor reckless assault for injuring his four-year-old son with a wooden switch. The league added the policy was developed after an extensive series of meetings and discussions over the past four months with a wide range of experts and others inside and outside the NFL. These include current and former players, the NFL Players Association, domestic violence and sexual assault experts and advocates, law enforcement officials, academic experts and business leaders. Asked whether he anticipated a challenge from the union, Mr Goodell deferred to NFL general counsel Jeff Pash, who said the owners' decision was 'entirely consistent with the collective bargaining agreement.' 'I don't know whether the union will challenge it or not, but we've given it a lot of thought,' Pash said. 'And I would hope they don't challenge. We'd be happy to sit down with them again tomorrow if they wanted to have some further conversations about it. I don't think there's any need for legal challenges.' Former Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson  is currently banned by the NFL after hitting his four-year-old son with a wooden switch .","League has been heavily criticized for a policy widely seen as too lenient .

"This is the incredible moment a baby buffalo managed to escape certain death after being taken down by two lions. Seen struggling for its life, the poor creature is pictured being pinned to the ground while the huge predators sink their teeth into its neck. But not willing to let their little one become lunch, the buffalo are seen regrouping, ready to fight back against the formidable felines. South African photographer Jay van Rensburg caught the moment that lions attacked a buffalo calf - but got more than they bargained for . Brave: An adult female lunges for the lion that pinned down her calf, forcing the big cat to leap out of the way . Caring: The buffalo herd help the dazed and wounded calf to its feet once the lions have been chased away . After one brave young female makes a charge for the lions, other buffalos begin to take notice, spurring them into action. Experienced South African photographer Jay van Rensburg, 53,  then managed to capture the moment a large bull attempted to gore one of the lions, forcing it to leap to safety. Spotted on the plains of the Kruger National Park, the young calf is seen wearily getting to its feet as the unlucky lions are chased away. Jay said: 'My heart started racing as I made my way along the road closer to where the action was but I managed to grab my camera and position the vehicle. Prowling: The two lions eye up their prey as nervous buffalo look on . Fearsome: One of the lions springs into action, scattering the buffalo herd, which kicks up a huge cloud of dust . Target: The buffalo calf is picked out as lunch by two male lions, which cause a stampede when they attack . Desperate: The lion looks to have the upper hand as the adult buffalo run past in a bid for safety . South African photographer Jay van Rensburg snapped the epic struggle on the plains of the Kruger National Park . Double trouble: The second lion joins in the fray, with the helpless buffalo brought to the ground . The odds aren't looking good: The young buffalo is pinned down . Counter-attack: Just when it looks like the young buffalo's fate is sealed, several adults turn around and confront the lions . Brave: This female buffalo makes her displeasure known to the lion, which desperately clings on to its prey . Victorious: The buffalo herd gather around the young animal and help it stand up . Sentry duty: A buffalo bull stares at the lion after their epic battle and keeps it at bay . Weary: The calf is comforted by one of the herd after being mauled by the lions . 'As the herd stampeded away from the fast approaching lion, the young buffalo fell behind and in one swift movement, the lion leapt onto the young buffalo. 'It could be that the two lions had made an earlier unsuccessful attack on the young buffalo as it looked as if the attacking lion knew exactly who his target was. 'The noise and dust caused by around 30 buffalo trying to escape a charging Lion was overwhelming. 'As the first lion struggled with the young buffalo on the ground, the second lion jumped on top and began wrestling with it, trying to deliver the final blow. 'All of a sudden, the herd stopped and a few female buffalos made their way toward where the young buffalo was fighting for its life. 'About four or five female buffalos faced the lion with heads low when from the side a larger bull appeared and charged the lion. 'A second bull then came in from the opposite side and it was as if they helped the young buffalo onto its feet. 'Buffalo have an amazingly strong group bond and when they are confronted with danger, they stand together to face the enemy . 'Apart from it being a major adrenaline rush, it was mixed emotions for me, I felt sorry for the young buffalo but this is nature in its truest sense.'","The moment a buffalo calf was rescued by its mother and other adults from two hungry lions has been captured .

"Shot in the face: Evie White was struck just below her lip with the 4in metal crossbow bolt as she was leaving Canterbury College in Kent . A 17-year-old beauty student was shot in the face with a crossbow as she walked out of college and was forced to wrench the 4in metal bolt from her lip as blood poured from the wound. Evie White was struck while leaving Canterbury College in Kent, and screamed for help in shock as horrified friends searched in vain for the person responsible. The student was rushed to hospital with her clothes covered in blood and has been left with a nasty gash just below her lip - which doctors say will leave minor scarring. Evie said: 'My friends were staring at me in disbelief, they didn't say a word. 'Then I touched my face and felt the blood and thought ""What the hell is that in my cheek"" - and pulled the dart out and chucked it on the floor. 'There was a lot of blood coming from my lip, but I think I must have been in shock because I wasn't really feeling the pain, but my friends were hysterically crying.' Her friend Georgia Brazil, 17, who is on the same hair and beauty course at Canterbury College, witnessed the disturbing incident. She said: 'This thing just hit her in the face. All we saw was Evie drop her things on the floor and her mouth just filled with blood. 'She just kept saying ""Can someone please help me? Please help me"". 'I had a look around where the dart seemed to have been fired but couldn't see anyone - I've got no idea where it came from. It was really, really scary.' Brave: The beauty student, who will escape with minor scarring, pulled the metal bolt from her face . Dangerous weapon: The person who fired the bolt (pictured) is yet to be identified by police . Witnesses trained in first aid and college security guards ran to assist Evie and called for an ambulance and the police. Evie's father John says he arrived at the college to find his daughter covered in blood after receiving an urgent call from a tutor. He said: 'I really panicked at first but thought it might have been the girls in her class playing about with a dart - definitely nothing this serious. 'When we arrived, Evie was in the ambulance and had been wrapped in bandages because there was a lot of blood - it was all over her clothes. Shocking: Evie was walking out of Canterbury College, Kent (above) when she was hit with the crossbow bolt . Shaken: The college's headmaster, Alison Clarke, has described the incident as 'very frightening' 'I was angry at first, but I just feel lucky that she wasn't more seriously hurt.' Evie was taken to hospital for treatment and doctors say she will escape with minor scarring. College headmaster Alison Clarke said: 'This is clearly a very frightening event and our thoughts are with the young lady and her family and friends. ' Police say two people have since given an account of what happened, with speculation that it could have been a freak accident. A spokesman said: 'Two people have since come forward and been spoken to by officers in relation to the incident. 'No arrests have been made and officers are considering what, if any, further action should be taken.' Evie, of Upstreet, near Canterbury, Kent, says firing a crossbow in public, even without intent to injure someone, should be a criminal offence. She added: 'I think it has probably scared me more than it's hurt me.'","Evie White struck just below her lip while leaving Canterbury College, Kent .

Paramedics on the scene of the shooting of the mother of a notorious crime gang boss. Lola Hamzy is believed to have been targeted by a rival gang. Her son is convicted murderer Bassam Hamzy, who is serving a life sentence and is accused of running gang proceedings from his prison cell . Two men were shot at Prestons, just over an hour after the attack in Auburn which has the mother of convicted murderer Bassam Hamzy in hospital with serious stomach wounds. Police are investigating the links between three separate incidents in less than 24 hours across Sydney's west and south-west which led to one man's death and three others in hospital in serious condition . In a separate incident at Prestons in Sydney's south-west, two men were also shot, one of them stumbling into the foyer of a local Catholic club to seek help. Police are looking into whether the shootings are all linked. However, police now fear that a war between rival crime syndicates is imminent after the brutal killing of Youssef Assoum, 29, whom they believe to be a member of a rival gang. An off-duty officer found him lying in a pool of blood in the early hours of Thursday on Claribel Street at Bankstown. He had been shot in the head and stabbed several times in the chest. A photo from social media of Youssef Assoum, killed in a brutal attack on the streets of Bankstown in the early hours of Thursday. Police say he was shot in the head and stabbed several times. Authorities, fearing an all-out war between crime syndicates, are investigating if there are any links between his slaying and the attacks on three others, including the mother of crime boss Bassam Hamzy, which has them in hospital in serious condition . NSW Police said: 'At 8.40pm, police and emergency services attended a property on Albert Road in Auburn after reports of a shooting'. 'Upon arriving at the scene, emergency services personnel attended to a woman who was suffering from a gunshot wound to the stomach. 'The woman, aged in her fifties, was treated at the scene before being transported to Westmead Hospital. 'Officers from the Flemington Local Area Command have established a crime scene at the woman’s property on Albert Road and an investigation into the shooting is now under way. 'Initial inquiries suggest that the woman was injured after a number of bullets were fired through her front door. She was home alone at the time of the shooting.' It has been alleged recently that Bassam Hamzy, who was sentenced to life in jail for a 2002 murder, ran the 'Brothers 4 Life' chapter from within maximum security with a mobile phone smuggled in six years ago. He reportedly made more than 19,000 calls in less than 2 months ordering murders, kidnappings and drug deliveries. His cousin Mohammed was also recently found to have access to a mobile phone while in Silverwater Jail. NSW Homicide Squad detectives have been investigating several incidents involving the Hamzy family including the fatal shooting of Mamhoud Hamzy last year. The mother of gang founder and convicted murdered Bassam Hamzy was shot in the stomach on Thursday night in what's believed to be a retaliatory attack . Bassam Hamzy's mother Lola is the latest to apparently be caught up in gang crossfire after his aunt Maha Hamze suffered eight gunshot wounds in a drive-by shooting last year. Among the allegations heard in court earlier this year against Hamzy was an order, from inside his prison cell, for his gunmen to attack a Melbourne home because of an unpaid drug deal worth $45,000. NSW Police are looking at the possibility that a drug deal gone wrong between rival gangs led to the confrontation in the third incident. They stated that, at 10.30pm on Thursday, officers were called to Hoxton Park Road in Prestons 'after a man, suffering a gunshot wound to one of his arms, stumbled into the rear foyer of a licensed club'. 'Emergency services attended the location and the man, aged in his twenties, was transported to Liverpool Hospital for treatment,' police stated. 'A short time later, another man presented at Liverpool Hospital, having sustained a gunshot wound to his shoulder.

"Shoppers face an anxious wait over whether Christmas gifts bought on the web will arrive after delivery networks buckled under the weight of orders. The spending binge around Black Friday and this week’s Manic Monday overwhelmed some of the country’s biggest internet retailers, forcing them to tear up their delivery promises. The problem has been made worse by the fact the transport industry faces a drastic shortage of drivers. An estimated £810million was spent online on Black Friday which was 50 per cent higher than expected and effectively broke the delivery systems . It emerged earlier this week that Marks & Spencer was unable to cope with the scale of orders with the result that some shoppers have faced delivery delays of ten days and even longer. However, it is now clear there were problem at other household names such as Amazon, Tesco, Asos, Argos, Ao.com, Currys PC World, River Island, Very, Littlewoods and Debenhams. An estimated £810million was spent online on Black Friday which was 50per cent higher than expected and effectively broke the delivery systems. Added to this was another £666million on Manic Monday, which meant many thousands of new orders poured into the system. Many of the companies suffering delays use the Yodel courier firm, which has been unable to cope with the weight of orders. The firm set a target of hiring 2,830 self-employed couriers, 470 self-employed van drivers and 760 employed drivers to cover Christmas. The company claims to have met this target, however it is still frantically recruiting across the UK, promising to pay around £140 a day to people who use their own cars. The Yodel website carries the warning: ‘We are continuing to receive extremely high numbers of parcels as a result of the seasonal sales. We’re working hard to get your orders to you asap, but some may experience a slight delay in arriving.’ Jonathan Smith, chairman of InPost UK, which offers click and collect lockers for web purchases, said: ‘The trend towards seasonal discounting and last-minute sales is making the Christmas peak even peakier. Further pressure was added on transport services by another £666million being spent on Manic Monday . ‘The increase in online sales and orders as a result of the surge in demand over ‘Black Friday’ Christmas offers has clearly put a large amount of pressure on the ability for retailers to deliver and has presented a series of logistical challenges, shown by the large number of retailers currently experiencing severe delivery delays.’ Amazon recorded 5.5million orders on Black Friday, an average of 64 items every second. As a result there were delays for people who expected next day deliveries under the Amazon Prime service. Some of the company’s deliveries are handled by Yodel, which has been the target of complaints on the web giant’s Facebook page. Yesterday, customer Roland Keates complained: ‘You have some great deals at Amazon, just change carrier. Yodel are rubbish, post a ‘while you were out card’ through the door, without ringing the doorbell or knocking on the door. They really let your side down.’ Pebbles Bayliss added: ‘Yodel are atrocious. One of them threw my delivery onto my car port roof thinking it was just a gate not a door, it’s 7ft high. They also give you a delivery window of 08:00 to 21:00 as if I don’t have a life.’ Andy Shaw wrote: ‘Amazon have debited my bank account then said they can’t deliver item and won’t refund my account for up to 10 days!!’ Another customer, Nicola Milton, complained of Amazon delivery ‘dirty tricks’. She wrote: ‘I’d like to warn people about what Amazon are up to this year. Bought tons of Xmas presents which hadn’t been delivered and when I checked my Amazon account turns out they had mysteriously been returned. ‘Suddenly my stuff which I wanted is returned and now if I want to buy again the prices have mysteriously gone up.’ Amazon whose Swansea, Wales, warehouse is pictured above, said: ‘As a result of the unprecedented number of orders we received during Black Friday Deals Week, the delivery date we promised to some customers was a little longer than would normally have been expected. Normal service has now resumed . Other companies that use Yodel include Argos, River Island, Very and Littlewoods. Argos admitted it was forced to extend delivery times from four to seven days in order to rebuild stock levels after the Black Friday promotions. It says deliveries are back to normal. However, Ray Hamill wrote on its Facebook page: ‘How about you just deliver your paid for orders on time? As opposed to making me use two days of leave for nothing.’ Another customer, Paul Fleming, wrote: ‘What’s the point of ordering anything from Argos when you clearly can’t fulfil your delivery obligations. There are websites packed full of disappointed Argos customers due to non-delivery and poor customer service.’ Amazon said: ‘As a result of the unprecedented number of orders we received during Black Friday Deals Week, the delivery date we promised to some customers was a little longer than would normally have been expected. Normal service has now resumed. Argos said: ‘Home delivery service is now running at normal levels and customers placing orders today will receive deliveries within our usual timeframe. ‘We apologise to any customer whose recent home delivery order was affected by a temporary delay caused by very high demand for a limited number of home delivery items on Black Friday.’ Yodel describes itself as the UK’s leading parcel carrier. It handles over 135 million parcels every year and claims to work with 80per cent of the UK’s top retailers. The firm said it has hired all the staff it thought were needed. ‘We worked closely with our clients to set our resource targets. Recruitment began in September and the targets successfully met,’ said a spokesman. Shop Direct’s Very and Littlewoods brands apologised to customers on Twitter for delays to deliveries as a result of Black Friday. It changed the delivery promise on the Thursday before Black Friday from 24 hours to 48 hours, and extended it to 72 hours. It reduced the delivery window back to 48 hours and is hoping to get back to 24 hours. River Island was so worried by the backlog that it told customers on Twitter that ‘couriers have had massive delays as a result of Black Friday’. Sources at the firm say these have been resolved. Currys PC World postponed its next-day delivery promise on small-box items for a period, but this was restored yesterday(wed). Debenhams admitted its delivery services had suffered temporary delays, but it said they are back to normal. The specialist household appliances website, Ao.com, said its same-day delivery service and free next-day delivery was out of action for a period because of the ‘increased demand over the Black Friday weekend’. Tesco suffered delays in its click and collect service for a time and the online fashion brand ASOS suspended a large part of its next day delivery system. However, both appear to be back to normal.","About £810m was spent online on Black Friday - 50% more than expected .

"Touring the Scottish Highlands in winter in a motorhome might not have the same cachet as a swanky Alpine holiday, but we had an absolute blast. Yes, I hit my head on the low-set cupboards at least three times a day, and yes, it was all rather hugger-mugger for a family of four. But in the evening, with the gas fire on, and the rain thrumming on the roof, and my sons Dexter and Geordie snuffling in their den above the driver's seat, our cosy motorhome had a rare charm. There's just about this much room to move: Bill with son Dexter en route to the ski resorts of Aviemore . Even if it was tricky to drive - at nearly 23ft, you really do need the rear-view camera and somebody on pointing duty while you reverse. There was no room for suitcases, so we decanted all our clobber into cupboards. Though the Swift 696 technically sleeps six, it's a tight fit - particularly when you're lugging ski gear. We were hitting the slopes of Aviemore and staying at High Range, one of the resort's many campsites. Hiring skis was the usual caper and pricey — starting at around £80 for a day's ski-hire, plus £90 for ski-passes for a family of four. The slopes were like Alton Towers on snow. Forty-five minutes to get up to the top car-park; hour-long queues for the funicular railway to the top of the mountain, and queue after dispiriting queue for the button-lifts and T-bars. Close-to-home snow: The ski resorts of the Cairngorms offer a less expensive alternative to the high Alps . The skiing was good but limited - two days was more than enough. But when the sun came out, the Cairngorms were every bit as breathtaking as the Alps. And on the second day, our motorhome came into its own. As my family snoozed, I drove us to the top car-park by 8.30am. We now had a decent base for lunch, cooked in our little oven and washed down with a glass of chilled Sancerre from the fridge, plus time for a nap afterwards. An upside-down sort of situation: Dexter and Geordie manage to fit themselves into the motorhome . The sight of me climbing into my tight top bunk was - apparently - the funniest thing of the holiday. Life in a motorhome is like being on a tight-knit submarine. But it also engenders a wonderful camaraderie as well as a lot of laughs — and that, really, is what family holidays are all about.

"This is the incredible moment a daredevil wingsuit flyer performed a high-five mid air while free-falling from the side of a mountain. Thrill-seeker Nathan Jones pulled of the death-defying stunt as he plummeted from a mountain top in the Alps with friend Sam Hardy. The amazing footage, which was shot by Mr Hardy, shows the extreme sports fans flying down the side of the mountain, just dodging large rocks and boulders. This is the amazing moment when a pair of daredevils completed the world's first wingsuit high five .

Nathan Jones, left, and his friend Sam Hardy, right, completed the stunt to raise funds for an Ethiopian well . At the bottom of the mountain, Mr Jones can be seen hitting a large cardboard hand at the bottom of the mountain. The stunt is believed to be the world's first ever wingsuit high five. The video, which lasts 3 minutes and 16 seconds was shot by an organisation called Project:BASE in Chamonix, France. The video was shot to raise funds to build a water well in Ethiopia. It has already been viewed more than 76,000 times on YouTube and shared thousands of times on Facebook.

"Misconduct: Dr Steven Forde, 45, was cleared of criminal charges but sanctioned by a medical panel . A doctor who secretly filmed a miniskirt-wearing woman as a ‘reward’ after a hard day’s work has been found guilty of misconduct. Dr Steven Forde, 45, used a camera hidden in an adapted satchel to take five minutes of covert footage as the woman walked through York city centre in May last year. He was acquitted of criminal charges after prosecutors offered no evidence - but today a Fitness to Practise panel ruled his actions amounted to misconduct after hearing they were 'sexually motivated'. The father-of-three, a former RAF medic who served in Bosnia and Kosovo in the late 1990s, confessed to a ten-year ‘compulsion’ that led him to film women as a ‘reward’ in times of stress. During the police investigation Forde admitted he had filmed women before and said he had other images at home, the panel in Manchester heard. But the married doctor, from Haxby, near York, was acquitted of outraging public decency after the CPS offered no evidence against him. Police found other clandestine video recordings on his home computer, but no charges were brought, the panel heard. During a trust investigation Forde admitted that this type of behaviour happened the ‘majority of the time once or twice a week’ and ‘more in the summer months.’ He was handed a formal warning and returned to work in March this year, though he is not allowed to examine female patients without a chaperone ‘except in life-threatening situations’. He was also prohibited from attending formal meetings with female trainee doctors unaccompanied in his role as Training Programme Director with York Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. But Forde could now be suspended or struck off completely after the panel's ruling today. The consultant anaesthetist, a keen photographer, said he took his camera equipment to the woods to take ‘spring photos’ after finishing his on-call shift at 8am on 9 May last year. He then went into York city centre carrying a satchel-type bag over his shoulder, which he had modified to hold a camera with its lens poking out of the front of the bag. The lens was concealed by a filter and he could switch the camera’s video function on and off on a digital viewfinder in the side pouch of the bag. Forde told the panel he had made the bag around three or four years ago, but admitted he had used a similar one before. He was arrested after a security guard spotted him acting suspiciously near a young lady who was wearing a short skirt. Magistrates acquitted the consultant of outraging public decency in October 2013 when the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence. 'Reward': The consultant anaesthetist had finished a 'stressful' period of work at York District Hospital . But he admitted his actions were ‘sexually motivated’ at this week's Fitness to Practise hearing. He said he is undergoing treatment for the ‘underlying issues’ that cause his behaviour and insists he has not indulged in the unusual hobby since his arrest. Earlier this week he claimed the incident followed three 'stressful events' in his professional life, including a a formal complaint made against him by a patient who said he was 'rude and aggressive'. He said he had to give evidence at the GMC after a medical student he was in charge of continued onto third year even though he hadn't been signed off. In a third incident, he said he had to help transfer a three-week-old baby to Leeds hospital but the baby died. He said: 'I felt like my whole world had collapsed and this was the end and that's it. Ruling: Forde, who still works at York Hospital, is expected to have his professional fate decided tomorrow . 'I found the experience one of the most stressful things I've ever done. Those legal practises - most of us are not used to this sort of environment. It doesn't justify what I did, but in my mind the stresses inhibited me from dealing with the behaviour that was causing this.' Eileen Carr, chairman of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service panel, told him today: ‘The panel has found your fitness to practise is impaired by reason of your misconduct.' However, she added: 'The determination has got many aspects that will relate to the doctor’s health, so that determination will not be made available to the public.’ Matters relating to the doctor’s health condition, which was not elaborated upon, have been heard behind closed doors. A redacted version of the panel’s findings is expected after his fate is decided tomorrow.","Dr Stephen Forde, 45, followed woman through York after on-call shift .

"Mohammed Kosar, 28, was jailed for 16 years after he 'callously' poured petrol over a woman and set her alight in an alley after she turned him down . A Somalian man who doused a woman in petrol after she rejected his advances and left her to burn in a  fireball has been jailed for 16 years. Mohammed Kosar, 28, led Lithuanian Dovile Krivickaite down an alley in Forest Gate, East London, saying he want to speak to her before he threw petrol over her and set her alight. Kosar then walked away leaving the then 23-year-old to turn into a human fireball and burn, the Old Bailey heard. She was helped by rescuers who heard her screams and took a nearby house where they poured water over her before calling an ambulance. Rebecca Poulet QC jailed Kosar for 32 years and said he had shown no remorse. She said:  'This appalling attack was premeditated and in my opinion you intended to kill.' Ms Krivickaite suffered burns to 24 per cent of her body in the attack and said her injuries had 'changed her life forever.' The Old Bailey previously heard Ms Krivickaite came to the UK in September 2012 and knew Kosar as 'Rocky.' She saw him regularly but turned him down when he asked her for sex, it was suggested. On October 19 last year she was picked up by Kosar and a friend on Rosedale Road, Forest Gate and taken to an alley off the road. But once she got there without warning Kosar doused her in petrol with a five-litre can and set her on fire. She was so badly burnt the skin was falling off her body and she has had to undergo several graft operations. She spent six weeks in hospital and had to be intubated because her burns affected her ability to breathe. Ms Krivickaite suffered severe burns to the face, neck and left side of her body, and is still badly scarred after the attack. The Lithuanian said she constantly receives sympathy because of her appalling injuries. Kosar was arrested in February 2014 in connection with attempted murder and was convicted earlier this year. Judge Poulet QC said: 'You had very regular contact with Ms Krivickaite, seeing her almost daily and sometimes several times a day. 'Ms Krivickaite has said she has no idea why you attacked her - she suggested it was maybe because she rejected your sexual advances. 'I have reason to believe you certainly had some attachment to her, asking her repeatedly before she got into the car why she had not telephoned you all day. The woman was taken to an alleyway down off Rosedale Road in Forest Gate where Kosar set her on fire . 'In my view it was not just chance that the car you were in had stopped in front of the alley - this was your chosen spot for the attack. 'You showed no regrets or change of heart when faced with the horrific consequences of your actions.' 'This appalling attack was premeditated and in my opinion you intended to kill. 'You have shown no remorse, although on the day of your sentencing before me you have said this should not have happened to her. Indeed it should not.' Speaking after the case a Met Police spokeswoman said that Kosar was a drug dealer and the woman had been a customer of his. The pair are believed to have argued before the vicious attack. Kosar was arrested as he left his home address in West Ham in east London and police found heroin and crack cocaine at his house. On arrival at the police station Kosar admitted he had a cocked 9mm PAK blank pistol stuffed down his pants. He has a series previous convictions - including armed robbery - since he was 15. Kosar was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the attempted murder. He was also convicted of one count of possession of a firearm and sentenced to five years, one of intent to endanger life and sentenced to a further 10 years in prison. He was given three years in prison for four charges of possessing ammunition, and seven years for three charges of possession of class A drugs. The judge said all the sentences were to run concurrently with each other and the life sentence. Detective Inspector John Reynolds of Newham Police who led the investigation said: 'Kosar is a dangerous individual who callously poured petrol over the female and set her on fire. 'She has suffered terribly as a result and I must pay tribute to her bravery in giving evidence against her attacker. I hope that his conviction will give her some closure.'","Mohammed Kosar set fire to Dovile Krivickaite after she 'rejected advances'

"A husband who smothered his sick wife to end her suffering has been spared prison by a judge who described the case as 'desperately sad'. John Crout, 63, killed his wife Sheila, 65, with a pillow as she slept on the sofa, before trying to commit suicide. When he was pulled from the edge of a bridge, he told police officers: 'I have put my wife to sleep. She's not in pain any more.' Home: Sheila Crout's body was found at the couple's terraced three-bedroom house on this road in Newcastle . The couple, who met as teenagers and had been married for 44 years, had been looking forward to their retirement, but Mrs Crout's health deteriorated rapidly, leaving her barely able to move. Her husband was handed a 12-month sentence suspended for two years after admitting manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. Judge Paul Sloan told him: 'This is a desperately sad case. You were devoted to your wife and regarded her as your soul mate.' Mrs Crout had become housebound after developing severe arthritis and suffering from migraines. The extent of his wife's suffering became apparent to Crout as he spent a prolonged period of time at their home in Brenwell, Newcastle, following a hip operation. Mark Guiliani, prosecuting, told Newcastle Crown Court: 'She was in so much pain she could barely walk and she was more or less immobile.' Crout was also suffering from a depressive illness and anxiety at the time he killed his wife, which was confirmed by psychiatrists. The judge added: 'The reason you acted as you did was because of mental illness.' Crout was stopped by police on Newcastle's Tyne Bridge, where he had travelled immediately after the killing, on June 25. Officers later arrested the distraught husband after finding Mrs Crout's body during a search of the house. Describing the case as 'tragic', Crout's barrister Nicholas Lumley QC said: 'He met Sheila when he was 15. They had children and grandchildren together. Walked free: John Crout was spared jail at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) but given a supervision order . 'They were looking forward to a well-earned retirement. But Sheila deteriorated physically and did not improve. Things were bad and it was against that background why he did what he did. 'Life was not worth living and he fully intended to end his life after ending his wife's.' Mr Lumley added: 'His mental health has improved and his relationship with his family is as good as it can be under the circumstances. No one here is baying for heavy retribution.' The barrister said credit should be given to Crout for his honesty from beginning to end, as he immediately admitted what he had done and did not try to sugar-coat his actions. In a victim impact statement, the Crouts' daughter Nicola said: 'We fully understand that my father was suffering from a depressive illness. He was thinking he was doing the best for his wife by putting her out of her misery and pain. 'If my dad had not been as unwell as he was, he would not have harmed a hair on my mother's head. We all still love my father dearly and will continue to support him throughout. 'We all miss my mother Sheila terribly. We wish she was still with us.' In a statement read out to the court, Crout said: 'I am very sorry for what I have done. I had no control over what happened. 'It's like a dream when I look back. All I have ever done in my life has been for Sheila.'","John Crout admitted suffocating wife Sheila at their three-bedroom home .

"A man who exposed his genitals to his de facto partners nine-year-old daughter and bought her sex toys has been handed an 18 month suspended prison sentence. The 54-year-old Canberra man was sentenced on Wednesday in the ACT Supreme Court, after previously pleading not guilty to an act of indecency in the presence of a child in September. Justice Richard Refshauge acquitted the man of 13 other charges, including sexual assault and other indecent acts, reports Canberra Times. The 54-year-old Canberra man exposed himself to his de facto partners nine-year-old daughter and bought her sex toys . According to the hearing, the man showed his genitals to the girl in 2011 when they were watching a film and she asked him about the meaning of a scene referring to sexual climaxing. The man reportedly exposed himself as a sexual education lesson to answer how a man reaches an orgasm. He was also punished for buying a golden vibrator and giving it to the girl as a present in 2012. The court heard the girl told the man she did not need it, so he left it in his bedside draw in case she changed her mind. He was also punished for showing pornography to the girl on his laptop while she was at his home in 2012. In the hearing the man said he never forced the girl to watch it, but admitted he did posses pornographic material. The man was sentenced by Justice Richard Refshaugeon on Wednesday in the ACT Supreme Court . Mr Refshauge claimed the man did not recognise the gravity of his behaviour, and in turn that he needed to be punished . The girl also secretly recorded a conversation with the man on her mobile phone, in which he claimed he was worried the girl was upset he was sleeping with her mother. The man had claimed the conversation was part of an ongoing joke between the pair. Mr Refshauge claimed the man did not recognise the gravity of his behaviour, and in turn that he needed to be punished. Along with the sentence, the man was given a three year good behaviour bond and directed to complete 100 hours of community service, as well as being required to complete the ACT Corrective Services sex offender program.","The 54-year-old Canberra man was sentenced on Wednesday .

"Smiling into the camera, four-year-old Katerina looks like any proud child with her pet. But the little Russian girl, dubbed 'Mowgli' girl in fact owes her life to the Alsatian puppy after they got lost together in the Siberian wilderness - where she then survived for 12 days and nights. Karina Chikitova became lost with her pet after following her father into a snowy Siberian forest full of wolves and bears in October last year. Naida had been keeping Karina warm at night but after nine days returned home to summon help. Rescuers found her footprint three days later next to a paw print near a river, where they had drunk water. So the emergency workers knew they were in the right area of the Sakha Republic, Russia's largest region and only slightly smaller than India. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Four-year-old Karina back together with her dog, Naida, who kept her warm in the Siberian woods . Survivors: The pair followed Karina's father into the wolf and bear-infested forest where they became lost . Hero:  Naida the puppy (pictured) kept Karina warm for nine nights before returning to their village for help . Home and happy: Karina is now preparing for Christmas back in her home village of Kyachchi . Celebration: Her mother Talina (pictured) says they've been invited to a party organised by the head of the Sakha government . Christmas wish: Karina hopes Santa Claus, known in Russia as  Ded Moroz, will bring her a barbie doll . Picture of health: Karina, who's now preparing for Christmas in her village of Kyachchi (right), was severely malnourished when she was rescued from Siberian wilderness (left) Karina is now preparing for Christmas in her home in the far flung village of Kyachchi - hoping that Russian Santa, called Ded Moroz, will bring her a Barbie doll. It was here that Karina's grandmother Emma revealed the child's first words to the dog after she returned from five weeks of hospital treatment after her ordeal. 'Why did you leave me?' she asked Naida. 'In fact, seeing the dog back in the village helped save her life,' according to The Siberian Times, who visited Karina in her remote home for the first picture of them together since their ordeal. 'Naida's appearance after nine days gave rescuers hope that Karina was still alive, even though the dog was not able to retrace her steps back to the child.' The dog had also kept her warm at night in chilly temperatures. She was eventually found hungry, exhausted and covered in mosquito bites lying in a grassy hole. This week Karina has a winter cold which stopped her playing outside in temperatures of minus 29 degrees - rather mild for the time of year in the Sakha Republic, the largest and coldest region in Russia. 'Soon they will bring a Christmas tree in from the forest,' said Karina, excited about the coming festivities which will be celebrated, Russian-style, at New Year. She added: 'They'll put it inside the house and warm it up. And then I will decorate it with beautiful toys and candy wrappings. 'Then Ded Moroz will bring me a Barbie and a kitchen set, so I'll be playing with my friends.' Trail: After keeping her warm for nine days, Naida (pictured) returned to their village to summon help . Sign: Naida's return to their village of Kyachchi gave her family hope that Karina too may still be alive . Immediate response: A massive search operation ensued after Naida the puppy returned to their village . Rescued: The moment Karina (pictured) was discovered after surviving  12 days and nights in the wilderness . Search: Rescuers found Karina's footprint three days after Naida returned to the village - next to a paw print near a river where they had drunk water . Expanse: Emergency workers trawled through Russia's largest region, the Sakha Republic, which is only slightly smaller than India . Drained: The young girl, who had survived for nearly two weeks on wild berries and river water, looked emaciated when rescuers found her among the scrubland . Freezing: Karina went missing in the woods near her village of Kyachchi which lies in the Sakha region - one of the coldest areas in Siberia . Courageous: Karina's doctor at the Children's Hospital in Yakutsk said she's a 'very strong girl' who's 'strong-willed character' helped her survive . Recovering: Karina will travel to a rehabilitation centre in her region's capital of Yakutsk, which is 770km away from her village . Before that, Karina has been invited to a festive party with the Head of Sakha Republic, Yegor Borisov, before undergoing more checks at a rehabilitation centre in regional capital Yakutsk - some 770km north-east of her remote village. Karina's grandmother said her granddaughter survived because 'from an early age she got used to the harsh conditions of life in the taiga and is not scared of the forest'. Adding that 'Naida helped too'. The 40-year-old thanked people from all over the world, as far afield as New Zealand, who sent gifts to Karina after reading about her ordeal. She said: 'We never thought we would find ourselves at the centre of the media attention. It was quite stressful. 'But it is incredibly heartwarming to realise that so many people know about us, talk about Karina, and even send presents. A huge thank you to everyone.' Karina's mother, Talina, said: 'We are soon to leave to Yakutsk where Karina will stay for a bit at the rehabilitation centre.' Honoured: Karina (pictured) has been invited to a festive party with the head of the Republic where she lives . On the mend: Karina drew this picture of an elephant during the five weeks she spent recovering in hospital after her ordeal . Support: Karina's grandmother Emma says she's overwhelmed by the gifts and support Karina receives from people all over the world . Born survivor: Karina's grandmother says she survived in the forest for so long because she got used to the harsh conditions of her region from a young age . Then the girl will go to a party organised by the head of the Sakha government. The 21-year-old added: 'After that, we'll come back and we'll celebrate the New Year at home. 'We will be making a traditional Olivier salad, and we will also cook traditional Yakut dishes - fried carp and a dish called Khart, which is boiled innards of foal. 'There will also be a dessert called Kuorchekh, which is whipped cream with cranberries.' Karina's ordeal began after she followed her father Rodion into the forest as he left for a hunting trip. He was unaware that his daughter and her dog had tailed him. Both Karina and Naida, who stayed with the little girl, became hopelessly lost in the forest. Talina had been in the fields gathering hay when her daughter went missing and it took her several days to reach Rodion and discover that she was lost. A massive search began for the girl. 'Karina drank water from rivers and ate berries, but when she was found, she was badly undernourished,' reported The Siberian Times. Freezing: The temperatures in Sakha Republic, where Karina lives and became lost in, can drop to lower than minus 30 degrees Celsius . Saving grace: Luckily for Karina, the night-time temperature when she became stranded in the woods was round six degrees Celsius . Her doctor at the City Children's Hospital, in Yakutsk, Fedora Gogoleva, said: 'The family live far away in a remote village, not in the city, and it makes its mark,' she said. 'She was raised close to nature. 'Certainly she went with grandmother and parents to the forest, to gather berries. Perhaps this is why she was not afraid of the forest. 'Karina herself is a very strong girl, has a strong-willed character. This probably helped her to survive.' 'The forest around Olom is full of bears,' said rescuer Albert Semyonov, who revealed his men needed armed guards in looking for Karina. 'Close to the gunners we felt somehow calmer. However, the thought of bears immediately switched to another concern: somewhere in the forest was this helpless child.' The breakthrough came when rescuers found Karina's footprint on the bank of a river when she had gone to drink water. Next to her print, was the paw mark of a dog. This gave rescuers hope they were in the right area, and next day found Karina.","Karina Chitkova was three when she became lost in the Siberian woods .

"Allan Ellis shot himself dead just hours after being told he was to be sued over his debts, an inquest was told . A game hunter shot himself dead just hours after being told he was to be sued over debts of up to £40,000, an inquest heard. Allan Ellis, of Bacup, Lancashire, forwarded an email to his wife Heather which had warned him of pending legal proceedings - and accompanied the online message with the remark: 'That's it then.' Later, after the former Scots guard had returned home, he took a licensed rifle from his gun cabinet and held it to his head in front of Mrs Ellis, an inquest was told. Police negotiators were called to the scene, but the 50-year-old shot himself following a four-hour stand-off at his rural terraced cottage during which officers made repeated attempts to talk him out of it. An inquest in Burnley, Lancashire, was told Mr Ellis, a former corporal who served in the army between 1980 and 1993, was a 'very proud' man who was determined to be the main breadwinner in his family - despite suffering a military injury which left questions over whether he would ever walk again. He had 'a real passion for the countryside' and had thrown himself into the gaming business firstly in Durham and then Waterfoot, Rossendale. Mr Ellis dealt in venison, rabbit and wild game, shooting produce and then selling it at markets and farmer's markets. He also organised deer hunts, shooting events and ran a catering stand at food festivals. He was a registered firearms holder for several years and despite temporarily losing his licence in 2011, he legally kept a number of guns in his cellar and gun cabinet, needing a variety of weapons for 'corporate customers to shoot with'. But business became tough for Mr Ellis and he had to hold down two jobs after the first game business in Durham went under in 2007/08. As his first business debts mounted, he was 'increasingly affected' and rather than declare himself bankrupt, entered into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement in 2009 before a repayment programme was set up. A friend then helped him to secure a job in Leeds and he was financed by a friend to open a game shop in Lancashire in 2012. In a statement, Mrs Ellis said former comrades of her husband believed he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder following his stint in the army - but he refused to discuss it because he felt treatment might affect his gaming career. Mr Ellis would spend 'every spare minute' at the second business and was 'burning the candle at both ends' but he failed to keep up with the administration work of the business and slid into debt. After Mr Ellis (pictured) had returned home, he took a licensed rifle from his gun cabinet and held it under his chin as his wife looked on in horror, an inquest was told . In early 2014 it became apparent that his business was having an adverse effect on him and he began to lose weight, the inquest was told. Mrs Ellis said: 'He was a very proud man. He felt as if he should be the main breadwinner and felt he should be earning more money. 'I knew he desperately wanted to avoid failing again in his business but I never thought this would happen. 'He spent all his time and energy trying to make it work but to no avail. He had a problem with the website. 'He was pouring a lot of money into that, the difficulty was it never went live but was paying the designer as he was designing. He was constantly paying out money, shop rent, utilities. It seemed a lot of things were going against him at the time. 'I was quite happy that he was working so hard. He was so determined he wanted it to work, but he spent long hours in the shop.' On the evening of his death he returned home from his daily commute to Leeds and on to his own shop but 'was in a funny mood' according to his wife. Mr Ellis (pictured) dealt in venison, rabbit and wild game, shooting produce and then selling it at markets and farmer's markets. But business had proved tough in the years before his death . She said he had received an email that day from the web company notifying him that they were to issue proceedings against him for money they claimed against him. He forwarded the email onto his wife adding, 'that's it then'. Upon his return home that night at around 10.30pm he went to bed but had got up quickly and gone downstairs. Mrs Ellis said she had heard the sound of the gun cabinet open and, concerned, she called her sister Denise McGowan. As she spoke with her sister, Mr Ellis returned upstairs with a Bolt Action rifle and placed the barrel under his chin before saying to her, 'I want you to see this'. She said she tried to get him to speak to Mrs McGowan but that he threw the phone on the bed. Mrs McGowan told her sister to leave the house and she alerted the police. Police negotiator Sgt Nick Hills of the Intelligence Unit said that on speaking with Mr Ellis just before midnight he had appeared 'very polite' and 'didn't express any anger'. A hearing at Burnley Coroner's Court (pictured) heard how police negotiators were called to the scene, but the 50-year-old shot himself following a four-hour stand-off . He said: 'He was very calm and deliberate in what he was saying. It made me feel that he had a settled intention.' Sgt Hills said that Mr Ellis also said, 'I don't want to burden you'. 'He accepted that if he were to walk out of the incident he would lose his firearms which would massively affect his business. He quite clearly had it (gun) and wouldn't put it away.' He was said to have told officers that if anyone was to go in to the house he would shoot himself and dismissed available options. At 1.45am he ended the call and attempts to reach him proved unsuccessful. At 2.30am on the morning of August 14 a gun shot was heard in the house and officers found Mr Ellis dead in a bedroom. Toxicology reports concluded there had been no drugs or alcohol. Coroner Richard Taylor in concluding a verdict of suicide said: 'You have told me a story about a proud, private controlled man, desperate and determined to provide for his family and to succeed in his business. 'He was adamant in his conversations with Sgt Hills and once he made that decision it was clear there was no going back. His guns were his life and career, if he lost them again it would be forever and he couldn't bear the thought of that.'","Allan Ellis killed himself hours after being told he was to be sued over debt .

"A mother-of-three who lost all of her toes and most of her fingers is suing a hospital - claiming their mistakes led to the amputations. Janet Garner, 49, from Signal Hill, California, claims that her  treatment at Duarte City of Hope Hospital following a bone marrow transplant in 2004 was negligent and led to the horrifying complications. As a result, her attorneys say, she has had several parts of her body amputated and her legal team believe she may need several more because parts of her body, including her feet, will never be able to heal. Scroll down for video . Legal action: Janet Garner, 49, from Signal Hill, California, claims that negligent treatment following a bone marrow transplant in 2004 led to some of her fingers and all of her toes being amputated . Allegations: Horrifying images released by her attorney show her condition following the procedure at Duarte City of Hope Hospital. Lawyers claim she suffered the infection - pneumococcal sepsis - because the correct vaccines were not administered to prevent the spread . Her legal team believes that if she had been given the correct vaccines after the procedure 10 years ago, it may have prevented her from developing the life-altering disease - pneumococcal sepsis. It is caused by a bacteria that then leads to an infection. The vaccines, her lawyer claims, made Mrs Garner's blood pool into her organs but away from her fingers and toes - meaning they 'died'. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday covered by KTLA, fighting back tears she said: 'Everyday I wake up I still can't believe this has happened to me because I was so active and took care of my kids… went to work. 'This hospital gave me a bone marrow transplant and I really trusted the doctors.' Devasted: Holding back tears at a press conference, she said she wakes up every morning in disbelief because she used to be 'so active' and took care of her children . Future: Mrs Garner's legal team say what is left of her feet may also have to be amputated because they will not heal properly . Attorney Moseley Collins said: 'The hospital and medical staff chose to ignore their own written procedures and did not give her the required pneumococcal vaccinations following the transplant.' 'As a result, Janet developed pneumococcal sepsis which caused all of Janet's toes, many of her fingers, and parts of both feet to be amputated.' The hospital released a statement saying: 'Providing the best possible treatment for all patients is City of Hope's highest priority. In observance of federal and state privacy regulations, we will not comment upon any individual patient.'","WARNING; GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"This is the terrifying moment a teenage gunman aimed his weapon at armed police officers, sparking a major firearms incident on a Scottish island. Samuel Barlow was moments away from being shot by specially-trained firearms officers as he roamed around Shetland Mainland, brandishing his rifle in front of frightened residents. Armed police almost opened fire at the 16-year-old as he repeatedly pointed his rifle at officers during the stand-off in September. This is the terrifying moment a teenage gunman aimed his weapon at police officers, sparking a major firearms incident on a Scottish island . After strolling around Shetland Mainland with his rifle, Samuel Barlow (pictured) repeatedly pointed his weapon at armed police . The 16-year-old was moments away from being shot by specially-trained firearms officers during the stand-off in September . But a court heard how it was only the professionalism and courage of officers - who initially had no idea what type of gun Barlow was wielding - which prevented the stand-off ending in Barlow's death. Procurator fiscal Duncan Mackenzie told the Lerwick Sheriff Court: ‘I am not sure if the accused appreciates how close he became to being shot by police.’ The court heard how the incident - which lasted for several hours - had a ‘major impact on the community’. At the height of the incident, every available officer in Shetland was called out and specially-trained officers from Inverness were flown in to provide back-up. Residents were also urged to stay indoors as police dealt with the 'extremely serious' situation. The shocking scenes emerged after Barlow, who was dressed in camouflage trousers and a beige top, was first seen walking with a rifle near Scord quarry, at the outskirts of Scalloway, shortly after midday. His threats sparked a major incident during which every available officer in Shetland was called out and residents were urged to stay indoors . In court, Barlow was told it was only the professionalism and courage of officers which prevented the stand-off ending with a fatality . He said the incident in September - which lasted several hours - had a ‘major impact on the community’, as residents were urged to stay inside . Two police officers, alerted by concerned islanders, were unable to approach Barlow and had to take refuge behind a fire station building as he took aim at them. After taking to the hills, Barlow appeared in the Westerloch area of Lerwick, the main town, later the same afternoon. He walked through several people’s gardens, threatened locals and aimed his rifle at police officers who were trying to negotiate a peaceful solution to the stand-off. Mr Mackenzie added: ‘999 calls were now coming in thick and fast, and a major police incident was declared. It is difficult to convey the concern that there was.’ At that stage, police did not know who they were dealing with and with what type of weapon Barlow was carrying, the court heard. Dressed in camouflage trousers and a beige top, Barlow was first seen walking with a rifle near a quarry, before he wandered through several people's gardens . Police did not know who they were dealing with and with what type of weapon Barlow was carrying, the court was told . Mr Mackenzie said there had been a number of occasions where officers had to decide whether to fire, he added. Unhappy with the police negotiators, Barlow then moved out of view again. Officers decided to ‘move beyond containment’ and make ‘an aggressive approach towards him’. Mr Mackenzie said: ‘This was a very dangerous situation police officers were in. At the very end, only as the accused was restrained, it was confirmed he had only an air rifle. ‘The accused owes the officers a debt of gratitude for their professionalism and indeed their courage. It was very close to a fatal outcome.’ At the hearing Barlow – who was described as an inmate of Polmont Young Offenders’ Institution, near Falkirk, Stirlingshire – admitted four charges of assault and one of abusive and threatening behaviour. Barlow's sentencing was deferred until January 7 for psychological and psychiatric reports. Defence solicitor Tommy Allan said he would wait for the psychological report before addressing the court in mitigation. His application for his client to be released on bail was refused. Sheriff Philip Mann said he had no other option than to keep Barlow in custody and warned him that a custodial sentence was very much a possibility.","Samuel Barlow, 16, roamed around Shetland Mainland brandishing rifle at residents during incident in September .

"Ever wanted to dine like a dictator? We can't say we have but now you can thanks to a recipe book which reveals the favourite dishes of some of the world's most notorious leaders. Dictators' Dinners, a bad taste guide to entertaining tyrants is a cookbook like no other as it reveals the favourite foods of murderous men including Hitler and Stalin - and how you can recreate their best-loved dishes at home. Authors Victoria Clark and Melissa Scott describe the book as a 'blend of history, photo album and recipe book' as they reveal the foods that could sustain a tyrant. Scroll down for video . Hitler pictured dining with Eva Braun: He used to wait 45 minutes after his food had been taste-tested before eating in case it was poisoned . They write in their foreword: 'We very much hope this book will amuse and inform readers, but also acquaint them with some exotic cuisine and, by the by, remind them just how thin the line between man and monster can be.' The book offers a fascinating insight into the lives of the leaders via the food they ate, as we reveal below... JOSEPH STALIN . Dinners times in the Russian communist dictator's company sound like a British students' night out. Drinking games, food fights and singing and dancing were all commonplace. But while students are all about having fun, Stalin's parties provided another opportunity for him to exert his control, humiliate people and expose their weaknesses. Enforced merriment: Stalin used to host raucous dinner parties and one of his starters was satsivi, a type of chicken soup, right . Singing and dancing was not an expression of joy but a compulsory act enforced by the fearsome leader. Meanwhile, he would relish drinking his guests under the table to again prove his superiority. Clark and Scott write: ''Guess the Temperature' was one of Stalin's favourite drinking games and reduced many guests to staggering, incontinent wrecks.' Stalin's dinner parties could often last for six hours with the cuisine influenced by his Georgina roots including food such as walnuts, garlic, plums and pomegranates. Given his penchant for excess eating and drinking, the authors conclude he's just as likely to have died from a stroke than poisoning at the age of 75. ADOLF HITLER . Clark and Scott reveal that while Hitler had more compassion for animals than he did for people, he was not a devoted vegetarian. It was documented on more than one occasion that he ate dishes such as pigeon and liver. Hitler was renowned as a vegetarian but it has been documented that he regularly ate bird meat so the cookbook includes a recipe for squabs, right . A British chef called Dione Lucas who worked at a Hamburg hotel in the early 1930s confirmed the Nazi leader's love of bird meat. She told readers of her Gourmet Cooking School Cookbook in 1964: 'I do not mean to spoil your appetite for stuffed squab, but you might be interested to know that it was a great favourite with Mr Hitler who dined at the hotel often.' Such was his fear of being poisoned, Hitler had 15 food-tasters to ensure his meals were safe for him to eat. Clark and Scott write: 'Only after a period of 45 minutes had elapsed without any taster dropping dead was a dish deemed safe for transportation to Hitler's table.' And while people starved during the Second World War or lived on rations, he carried on feasting like a king. The book quotes one of his food tasters, Margit Wolf, who was struck by the 'superior quality' of the fuhrer's meals. She said: 'There was asparagus in season, with Hollandaise sauce, vegetable broths with little semolina dumplings, roasted red peppers, rice, salads and vegetable stews'. BENITO MUSSOLINI . Had dictator Benito Mussolini been given the chance to rule the world he would have made all his subjects eat an Italian diet. According to the book, he once said that 'French cooking was worthless and Italian the best in the world.' Mussolini thought Italian food was the best in the world and his family favourite dessert, Ciambellone, right, does look tasty . But that doesn't mean he feasted on pasta and pizza. One of his favourite dishes was a less appetising salad of roughly chopped raw garlic, dressed with oil and lemon. The authors reveal that Mussolini's tyranny may have ended earlier than 1945 if he hadn't made changes to his diet. They explained how he was diagnosed with an enlarged liver, heightened blood sugar and a deformed colon but 'a revised diet that included rabbit and chicken brought about a startling improvement.' SADDAM HUSSEIN . Fish was a favourite dish of the notorious leader of Iraq who ruled with a iron fist from 1937 to 2006. The books reveals he could eat it at any time of the day and loved it as fresh as possible. Saddam Hussein loved his fish cooked fresh so he would often make his staff grill it for him as early as 5am. The recipe book reveals how to cook one of his favourites, carp, right . They state: 'On occasion, he would rouse his kitchen staff at five or six in the morning to grill some fish he'd just caught.' His callous, murderous attitude was even revealed when he ate as the book reveals how 'once, as he chewed olives he told his former chief of intelligence he was spitting out the stones in ""the way I will one day spit out the Israelis from their land"".' MUAMMAR GADDAFI . Vain as well as powerful, Libyan ruler Gaddafi had a secret weapon to ensure he always had a pearly white smile - camel milk. But Clark and Scott observe that the beauty treatment came with unfortunate side effects. Vain: Gaddafi used to drink camel milk to enhance the whiteness of his teeth . 'The camel milk Gaddafi liked to drink may have enhanced the brilliant whiteness of his smile but it seems to have played havoc with his digestion. Whether he suffered from uncontrollable flatulence or whether, on the other hand, he was able to exploit this affliction to emphasize whatever point he was engaged in making, as demonstrated in an interview with John Simpson, is debatable. 'Certainly, on a visit to his tent in 2004, Tony Blair was advised not to accept a glass of camel milk, lest he be similarly afflicted,' they write. One of his favourite meals was a dish from his home country - camel meat with couscous - but he also had a penchant for Italian food - despite banishing Italians from Libya. KIM JONG-IL . The recipe book reveals how the former leader of North Korea was as fastidious as he was cruel. They write: 'Hundreds of his luckless people were recruited to the project of preserving his health and vigour by way of his diet. A small army of women was employed to see that every grain of rice destined for his plate was uniform in size, shape and colour. Kim Jong-Il would often feast while his people starved. Shark's fin soup was one of his favourite dishes but as they are now a protected species, the cookery cook recommends using soy or chicken breast instead . 'It then had to be cooked over a fire using only trees cut from a mountain peak near the Chinese border.' He loved sushi and it was once reported he 'enjoyed raw fish so fresh that he could start eating it when its ""mouth was still gasping and its tail still thrashing.""' More evidence of his cruelty is shown by the way he had 'live lobsters airlifted to his train as it crossed Siberia on its way to Moscow... and he had food grown for him alone, while North Koreans starved.'

"The thought of entering the dating scene as a woman in her 50s was a daunting idea for Liz Sherriff. She only had two long-term partners - first her ex-husband then a toyboy who was 21 years her junior. Neither of them worked out and she was forced to seek other options. But what Ms Sherriff quickly and painfully learned was that in the world of online dating, a 'rotten profile photo' will attract all the wrong people. This was the motivation behind the launch of 'The Look of Love' last month - a Sydney-based makeover studio dedicated purely to producing profile pictures for online dating. Scroll down for video . A profile photo created for online daters like Sam (pictured) at Sydney-based makeover studio The Look of Love . Before and after profile shots of Sam. The Look of Love was inspired by Liz Sherriff's experiences of posting good and bad photos online . The Look of Love offers styling, hair and make up for internet daters of all ages . Ms Sherriff, who has been a single mum for 16 years, never thought she would find love online. And having met both her ex-husband of 16 years and previous partner of six years at work, internet dating was a foreign concept. 'Now I've been online dating for about 18 months,' Ms Sherriff told Daily Mail Australia. 'When I first started I had no idea and thought I'd put up any old rotten profile photo. I found that many of the men who were contacting me weren't serious and were just looking for a fling. 'Then I changed my photo to a better one only to find that I was having more success with men who were genuinely interested and were on the same level of intelligence.' Kiera (pictured) also had some photos taken by The Look of Love to help jazz up her profile . That one photo made a world of difference for Ms Sherriff and she wanted to share this with fellow love-seekers. 'It was a real eye opener for me and I've come to realise that a picture of yourself when it comes to online dating is very important,' she said. 'A profile photo gives insight into the person. It says a lot about them, their style and their lifestyle. 'For example, if I came across Harry Highpants then I just wouldn't be interested. I have a check list and I totally agree that a picture is worth a thousand words.' Photos taken by the studio aims to  produce 'natural and real photos of people looking their best' The Look of Love is suitably inspired by Dusty Springfield's pop song . As the co-founder of The Look of Love, suitably inspired by Dusty Springfield's pop song, Ms Sherriff is now using her experience to help others show their 'inner beauty'. 'It's not about photo-shopping pictures but more about producing natural and real photos of people looking their best,' she said. 'We want to bring out their personality and character in the image, not something that's glamorous.' Ms Sherriff believes the Christmas period will not only be a busy time for shopper but also for those who are searching for 'the one'. The thought of entering the dating scene as a woman in her 50s was initially a daunting idea for Liz Sherriff (pictured) The 55-year-old has been online dating for 18 months now and says it's been a success . Ms Sherriff is taking a break from the dating scene as she's found herself a man . 'People have a lot more time because they're on holidays,' she said. 'It's also a poignant time of year which highlights the fact that they're alone. 'I know this because I've been there before - I remember times that I sat on the couch and cried on Christmas Day when my kids were with my ex. 'This is why this idea for a makeover studio is close to my heart.' While Ms Sherriff is taking a break from the dating scene as she's found herself a man, the 55-year-old says the whole experience has been 'a great learning curve'. The Look of Love gave Richard a make over and he looks much younger from his photos below .

The Look of Love offers styling, hair and make up for internet daters of all ages. Set up a 'date phone' with an alternative mobile number, Liz Sherriff said. 'Just get an old handset and get a new SIM card. Do pay as you go. 'Don't give out the real one until you trust the person. 'Same goes for your email address. Set up an account with your dating name.' PROFILE WARNINGS . 1) If they don't have a photo it generally means they are either married or ugly. Always ask to see a photo before you start communicating; . 2) Beware of black and white photos - probably retouched or taken years earlier; . 3) For fuzzy, out of focus and distant photos - assume reason one; . 4) Head only shot or a profile description which says 'a bit overweight or large-ish' means they're probably gargantuan; . 5) High school education only - sorry this is a bit sweeping but I need a conversation with my partner; . 6) People who put a picture up of them when they were 17-years-old is  because of reasons one, four or five; . 7) 'Undecided' about having kids means they want kids so beware if you don't or can't; . 8) Never been married, if older, means a real lack of commitment - I learned the hard way; . 9) The word 'milf' in their wish list unless of course you're up for it; . 10) Anywhere the word 'lonely' comes up.","Liz Sherriff, 55, has been online dating for 18 months .

"Greenpeace activists have been forced to apologise after damaging an ancient Peruvian monument during a publicity stunt. Activists from Greenpeace placed a banner next to a figure of a hummingbird, carved more than 1,500 years ago, in a bid to highlight the case for action at the UN climate summit in Lima. The Peruvian government said it would press criminal charges against Greenpeace activists who left footprints close to the carvings. Scroll down for video .

Greenpeace said in a statement that they are deeply concerned about any ‘moral offence’ ‘It’s a true slap in the face at everything Peruvians consider sacred,’ said Luis Jaime Castillo, the country’s deputy culture minister. Mr Castillo added: ‘They are absolutely fragile. They are black rocks on a white background. You walk there and the footprint is going to last hundreds or thousands of years. ‘And the line that they have destroyed is the most visible and most recognised of all.’ The government is asking for the identities of those involved and threatening prosecution and six years in prison for the offenders.

"A four-year-old who died from massive head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike allegedly lived on fast food and was surrounded by sex toys and drugs at her home, a court has heard. During an inquest into Chloe Valentine's death, the Coroners Court was yesterday told by three people the girl sang 'I want a horny daddy' while they also heard her mother calling the child a 'c***', The Advertiser reports. State Coroner Mark Johns is looking into the Families SA's management of more than 20 child abuse notifications about Chloe before she died in January 2012. She had suffered fatal injuries after repeatedly crashing a motorbike over a three day period in the backyard of her Adelaide home. On day 19 into the inquest today, a social worker gave evidence that she had struggled with her workload which had more severe cases than Chloe's in 2011. Scroll down for video . Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012 . Social worker Tara Liston gave evidence on Thursday and said Chloe's case wasn't as important compared to the others she was handling, the ABC reports. Ms Liston told the court Chloe and her mother 'engaged really well'. 'In comparison to other cases, when you read it, there were some things that Ashlee did well and there were other times that she didn't... it would be a case that was not as significant as other cases,' she said. 'It wasn't what we'd look at in middle class society and say 'it was okay' but in child protection... it appeared to myself to be okay.' Other claims were previously made in court by three people - including Jay Rann who was the child's respite carer - who said Polkinghorne left sex toys and drugs around the house, called her daughter a 'c***' and also fed Chloe Hungry Jack's and spent her welfare money on herself. The court also heard allegations that the bathrooms walls at Chloe's home was covered with 'dried faeces', according to The Advertiser. They also claimed Chloe sang 'I want a horny daddy'. Chloe's mother Ashlee Polkinghorne and Benjamin McPartland, who was her boyfriend at the time, are both serving jail sentences for the girl's manslaughter. Mother Ashlee Polkinghorne (pictured left and right) at court at an earlier date. The inquest has heard she and her boyfriend Benjamin Robert McPartland, 28, forced Chloe to ride a motorbike over three days which repeatedly crashed and caused massive head injuries . On December 1, social worker Katrina Heading told the inquest she considered removing Chloe when she was 16-months-old in November 2008 after her 'paralytic' mother Ashlee Polkinghorne left her with a 15-year-old friend while she drank at the beach. Chloe's grandmother  agreed to take her but when an angry and abusive Polkinghorne finally surfaced, a supervisor decided Chloe should be returned to her mother. Ms Heading said Chloe was sent home unsupervised with a private chauffeur because there were only two crisis care staff working that night. She said the chauffeur company conducted police checks on its workers but Families SA did not have access to those checks. Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, questioned whether it was appropriate for a 16-month-old child to be left unsupervised with a private driver. She asked why Ms Heading had not pushed harder to have Chloe removed, given Families SA had received multiple abuse notifications. 'You knew that this woman had left her child with a 15-year-old so that she could consume alcohol ... that's concern enough, isn't it?' she asked. Ms Heading said she had backed her supervisor's judgement, despite having reservations about Polkinghorne. 'It took me by surprise but I had faith in my supervisor ... (to make) tough calls in tough situations,' she said. 'When you're caught up in the moment, you can get over-emotional.' The inquest into the girl's death has heard her short life was marred by horrific squalor and chronic neglect. Chloe died from massive head injuries after she was forced to ride a motorbike over a three-day period that repeatedly crashed at her Adelaide home . Government agency Families SA considered her to be at risk even before she was born and had received multiple calls about the girl by the time she was six weeks old. After 20 notifications were made to the child protection agency about Chloe's care, she was never removed from her drug-using mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne. Polkinghorne, 22, and her boyfriend Benjamin Robert McPartland, 28, forced her to ride the motorbike over three days, which lead to the four year old's death who had massive head injuries. Earlier in the inquest, evidence revealed how Polkinghorne, described by one concerned friend as a very convincing liar, was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house. One of the squalid residences she and Chloe occupied was reportedly infested with rats, while another was littered with soiled nappies and rotting food. It was alleged Chloe was also left for days on end with Polkinghorne's teenage friends. In October, social worker Nicholas Ratsch told the inquest he helped Polkinghorne draft a safety plan in late 2007 to make sure infant Chloe received proper care when her mother was affected by drugs. Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months . Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 . Polkinghorne, who was 16 at the time, agreed that whenever she and her then-partner were out of it there would be a sober person at home. The strategy replaced a previous agreement, brokered by case workers, in which Polkinghorne pledged to cease all drug-taking. Another social worker, Leanne Stewart, also told the inquest in October Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' who found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her rubbish-strewn house. Ms Stewart said she believed 18-month-old Chloe was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009, despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications, when her mother was 17. Family members, including Polkinghorne's father, raised alarms about infant Chloe's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother. But Ms Stewart believed some of the allegations may have been malicious or exaggerated because there was 'frequent conflict' in Polkinghorne's family relationships. Ms Polkinghorne and Mr McPartland, were jailed this year over Chloe's death after pleading guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect. The inquest continues.","The Coroners Court heard claims from three people they heard Chloe Valentine being called a 'c***'

"A Sydney councillor is pushing for the drug 'ice' to be legalised, claiming it will be safer for those that use it. Manly councillor Hugh Burns would like to see local GPs prescribe the potent drug, which is a type of meth-amphetamine, to 'confirmed drug addicts' because he believes it would be much safer than getting it off the streets.

"Taxi app Uber offered a woman £20 credit after she was allegedly sexually harassed by a driver who asked to perform a sex act on her, it was claimed last night. The passenger said she had initially got in the back of the cab in London before the driver asked if she wanted to sit in the front - which she did, because she was feeling car sick. But the driver then asked about her relationship status before inquiring if she enjoyed sex acts being performed on her - suggesting he could pull over into a side road to carry out one. Scroll down for video . Claims: Taxi hailing company Uber (file picture) has offered a woman £20 credit who alleged she had been sexually harassed by a driver who asked to perform a sex act on her . The woman complained to Uber, who apologised for the ‘intrusive experience’ and said the incident was already being investigated. However, she was unimpressed by this response and wrote back. In another email to Uber - the firm behind an app letting customers book and track vehicles - she said the incident in March left her feeling uncomfortable, according to Newsweek’s Lucy Draper. The woman said in the message: ‘I am pretty relaxed and outgoing and I feel that I can take care of myself, and if I felt so uncomfortable I dread to think how a more timid girl would have felt. ‘I won't be taking this any further but I do implore you to take this quite seriously as I worry for other women who could find themselves in a similar situation.’ Another Uber employee then responded to say her trip had been refunded and £20 was credited to her account. This response was signed off with: ‘Sorry again for such an un-Uber experience.’ The woman - who has heard nothing more from the firm - said she was told by Uber that it was refunding the money 'in hope that you will give us a second chance', reported Newsweek. But an Uber spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘Uber does not give credit as compensation for issues of a serious nature. App: In an email to Uber the woman said the incident in March left her feeling uncomfortable (file picture) ‘In this incident, which dates back to the beginning of this year, Uber added £20 to the rider’s account when the original trip was refunded. ‘We take all allegations incredibly seriously - any driver who is accused of acting inappropriately is suspended from the platform while an investigation is undertaken. ‘The driver involved in this incident was permanently deactivated from the Uber platform.’ Founded in 2009 in California, Uber is best known for its smartphone app that connects passengers with local drivers, and the company then charges a commission for each ride. When a journey is complete, customers are invited to 'rate' the driver on a five-star system, and the driver can do the same with the customer. The company said last week it was valued at £25.5billion, a double in market value in six months. Uber is now present in more than 200 cities across 45 countries. Protests: Separately today, Uber said it would review its India operations and improve driver screening as it tried to reach an agreement with politicians to restart services, after being banned in New Delhi . Uber has been banned from operating in Spain while a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association is probed . But today, Uber said it would review its India operations and improve driver screening as it tried to reach an agreement with politicians to restart services, after being banned in New Delhi. The federal government asked states to ban Uber amid concerns about passenger safety after one of the company's drivers was arrested for allegedly raping a young female passenger in New Delhi. The case caused uproar in India after it was revealed the suspect had been previously charged with sexual offences including rape. Uber failed to uncover the charges because it does not carry out background checks on drivers in India. And on Tuesday, MailOnline reported how a judge had banned Uber from operating in Spain while the court examines a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association. The court ruled that Uber drivers in Madrid carry out activities that 'constitutes unfair competition', the capital's court services said in a statement. They also accused drivers hired through the app of 'lacking the administrative authorisation to carry out the job’. But a company spokesman hit back, saying: ‘Uber is confident that when once we have had the opportunity to present our case in court, these precautionary measures will be lifted.’","Woman makes claim after driver asked her about relationship status on journey in London .

"Congressional staffers and Capitol employees walked out of the office and stood on the steps of the House to protest the killing of unarmed black men by police. About 200 workers and a few members of Congress gathered on Thursday and silently raised their arms in the 'don't shoot' gesture used to protest the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. They stood, heads bowed, as Senate Chaplain Barry C. Black prayed, 'Forgive us when we have failed to lift our voices for those who couldn't speak or breathe for themselves.' 'Hands up': Congressional staff members gather on Capitol Hill in Washington to raise awareness of the recent killings of black men by police officers, both of which did not result in grand jury indictments . Walkout: Around 200 employees and some members of the House gathered for the demonstration . Demonstration: The walkout came as both houses of Congress attempt to pass a spending measure and avert government shutdown . He emphasized 'breathe' in a reference to Eric Garner of New York, who died after a police chokehold. Afterward, Black said the workers were exercising their free speech rights to seek a larger conversation about the issue, which has sparked demonstrations across the country. Representative Elijah Cummings, a Democrat for Maryland said in a statement: 'Democrats and Republicans across the country are incredibly frustrated by what happened in Ferguson, Staten Island, and elsewhere, and this protest reflects the mistrust they have in the integrity of the criminal justice system. 'These congressional staffers put in incredibly long hours, nights, and weekends working to pass legislation to help people live better lives, so I fully support them taking a few moments today to pray with the Senate chaplain for Congress to take action to ensure that all Americans are treated equally before the law.' Cummings is one of several members of Congress who requested hearings on the issues raised by Garner's and Brown's deaths. One staffer who planned the event told CNN: 'We're proud to have this moment of solidarity with the families of Michael Brown and Eric Garner and the thousands of peaceful protesters around the country who are telling this country that black lives matter. 'I believe it's important, because what affects one community really affects the entire country. Standing together: One staffer who organized the event said: 'We're proud ton have this moment of solidarity with the families of Michael Brown and Eric Garner' 'Mistrust': Elijah Cummings, Democratic Congressman for Maryland joined those during the walkout on the Hill saying that politicians from both parties are 'incredibly frustrated' with what has happened . 'Don't shoot': They walked out following the death of a number of victims at the hands of police including Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and  Eric Garner in New York . Unity: Senate Chaplain Barry C. Black, who led a prayer for those involved, said the employees were exercising their free speech . In interviews conducted by Associated Press reporters across the nation, which were released on Thursday retired and active black officers expressed concern about how black men are treated by the largely white police forces in the United States, an issue that has led to protests alleging police brutality. The officers say they want change just as much as anyone else, and advocate for it where they can because they, too, have something to lose. 'A lot of us have sons, and we want to make sure our colleagues are treating our young boys with dignity and respect,' said Oakland Police Lt. LeRonne Armstrong, a 16-year veteran. Since the summertime deaths of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, 43, who gasped 'I can't breathe' while being arrested for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes in New York, thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest their deaths, the grand juries' decisions — and the nation's police forces.","Around 200 employees bowed their heads as Senate Chaplain Barry C.

"For householders who still get their milk delivered in glass bottles, waking up to find the foil lids have been pecked open may seem little more than a rather annoying piece of avian thievery. Yet these cream-skimming birds are actually the last surviving practitioners of one of the first widely recognised examples of culture in animals, other than humans. And now scientists studying how this behaviour  first emerged and spread among populations of great tits during the 20th century have made an even more startling discovery - the birds not only pass on cultural traditions, but will change them to conform to those practiced in the local area. Scroll down for video . Great tits pass on traditions through the generations and adapt to fit in with the local culture when they move. It is the first time such cultural conformity, which is thought to be a key factor in the evolution of complex culture among humans, has been seen in any wild animals apart from primates . It is the first time such cultural conformity, which is thought to be a key factor in the evolution of complex culture among humans, has been seen in any wild animals apart from primates. Dr Lucy Aplin, a zoologist at the University of Oxford, said: 'In humans, new traditions arise when novel behaviours spread through social network ties via a process of observational learning. If stereotypes are to be believed, then men are better at women when it comes to directions. But it seems among great tits, this is not the case. Researchers from Lund University in Sweden found that female great tits have better memories for finding stashes of food. The study, published in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, is one of the few examples in nature where female birds have better spacial and learning abilities than the males, according to scientists. While clearly intelligent and quick learners, unlike other members of the tit family, great tits are not known to be food hoarders. However, Anders Brodin and Utku Urhan of Lund University in Sweden have shown that great tits are instead able to remember where other birds store food and retrieve it up to 24 hours later. When they tested whether there is a gender difference in this ability, they found that male great tits were only able to remember where other birds stored food in 15 per cent of cases. In contrast, females remembered the location of stashed food in 40 per cent of cases. The researchers argue that female great tits are more skilled cache pilferers because they find themselves in a male-dominated society in which they are often pushed away from available food sources. 'Whereas the males therefore have a more even and reliable food supply, lower-ranking females have to supplement their food by pilfering the stock piles of others,' said Dr  Brodin. 'Therefore a good memory of where caches are to be found could go a long way to still their hunger.' 'We found that great tits can actually learn from observing one another in the wild and they do so extremely efficiently. 'We saw these new behaviours spread from one or two individuals to hundreds of individuals in a few weeks. 'We have measured it over two generations of birds and it seems possible it can persist for longer than that. 'The rare individuals who move between our different sub-populations tend to change their behaviour once  to match the population they move into. 'We are still trying to understand why they might do this, but the consequence is that each population maintains its own unique tradition even though there is movement between them. 'This is important for our understanding of how culture evolved, and suggests that some animals might be more “cultural” then previously thought.' Dr Aplin and her colleagues, whose work is published in the journal Nature, studied eight populations of great tits, containing around 100 bird each, in Wytham Wood in Oxford. The great tits, or Parus major, in Wytham woods have been studied by researchers at University of Oxford since the 1940s and most carry unique identifying chips that allow scientists to keep track of them. From five of the populations, Dr Aplin captured two male birds from each and trained them to open a simple puzzle box by sliding a door either to the left or right to reach a mealworm inside. These 'innovator' birds were taught one of the methods by allowing them to watch another bird that had already learned to solve the puzzle in a specific way. Two males from the three remaining populations were captured, but not trained. The captured birds were then released back into the wild in their original populations and puzzle boxes were scattered around the woodland inside cages that could track the birds that entered and the method they used to open each box. The researchers found that each population of great tits began to favour using the puzzle solving solution that had been taught to the captured innovator birds from their area. Within just 20 days, more than three quarters of the great tits in the wood had opened one of the puzzle boxes using the technique introduced to their area by the captured males. The researchers watched how great tits in Wytham Wood, in Oxford, learned how to solve a puzzle box, contained within a cage (left), that had a blue and red door that could be opened to the left or right (right) Among the populations whose males had not been trained to open the box, far fewer managed to open the box even once, with less than one in ten managing it in one of the populations. Essentially the great tits in each population learned how to open the boxes from the captured males. The researchers then put more puzzles in the wood a year later and found that although nearly two thirds of the original birds had died and been replaced by a new generation, each population favoured the method they had adopted the year before. This suggests that the birds passed on the behaviour like a tradition. When the researchers looked at the birds that had moved between the populations during the year, they found something more surprising - those birds had conformed to the local tradition rather than using the technique they had originally learned. Dr Aplin added: 'It is as if its own personal experience is being overwritten by the majority behaviour. 'Conformist behaviour - prioritising social learning over personal experience - has often been thought to be restricted to primates, and to be cognitively complex, so these results in birds are an exciting challenge to previously held ideas.' The puzzle boxes were scattered around Wytham Wood in Oxford among populations of birds that learned to open the door of the box to the left (blue dot), to the right (red dot) or where they learned no preference (green) The birds were filmed as they opened the boxes, while electronic tags on their legs helped researchers to identify each bird. The findings may help to explain why great tits capable of raiding milk bottles by pecking through the foil tops spread so quickly around Britai, and persisted for so long . The findings may help to explain why great tits capable of raiding milk bottles by pecking through the foil tops spread so quickly around Britain, and persisted for so long. The behaviour was first noticed in 1921 by residents of Swaythling, Hampshire, who would wake to find their milk bottles vandalised on their doorsteps before spreading. Homeowners were forced to protect their milk bottles by leaving plastic caps on top of the glass bottles when they were delivered. Even today, householders in some areas can still find their milk bottles are being raided by birds even today in the few remaining areas where doorstep deliveries are made. Around two million glass milk bottles are delivered to people's doorsteps every day around the UK compared to close to 40 million in the early 1990s. It is likely to decline further as the remaining few milk producers that use glass bottles turn towards using plastic bottles or cartons. Great tits first began pecking through the foil tops of milk bottle tops (stock image) to reach the cream in the 1920s. Around two million glass milk bottles are delivered to people's doorsteps every day around the UK compared to close to 40 million in the early 1990s . However, the latest findings present a tantalising prospect - those few birds lucky enough to find a glass milk bottle to raid may be continuing a tradition that began among great ticks nearly a century ago. Even humans can struggle to keep some traditions going for that long. Professor Ben Sheldon, director of the Edward Grey Institute at Oxford University, said: 'Our experiments suggest that birds can learn through observation, and that this may help create arbitrary local 'cultural traditions'. 'Because the particular form of these traditions has no bearing on survival it might be expected that they would be eroded over time as older birds die and are replaced by newcomers. 'However, our work shows that once a majority in a group adopt one way of doing things these cultural traditions are passed on to the next generation and may persist over years.' Dr Lucy Aplin, first author of the report, added: 'Even when a great tit already has experience of using one method, if it moves to a new area which favours the alternative solution this bird is likely to adopt the method preferred by its new group.","Discovery is the first example of cultural conformity in non-primate animals .

"A full judicial inquiry may be needed to get to the bottom of claims British spies were complicit in the torture of terror suspects in CIA jails, Nick Clegg said today. The Deputy Prime Minister said torture ‘cannot, will not and is not being used under any circumstances by British agencies' today. But the publication of a damning report into CIA interrogation techniques yesterday has sparked accusations that the Blair Government was was operating a 'secret policy of complicity' after 9/11. Scroll down for video . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said a full judicial inquiry may be needed to get to the bottom of claims British spies were complicit in the torture . Former-shadow home secretary David Davis said the UK had 'turned a blind eye' to what America was doing. He said this included 'allowing people initially under our control to be taken and subjected to torture'. Controversy raged on both sides of the Atlantic as politicians absorbed the enormity of the report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, which said the use of torture by the CIA was far worse than feared and a 'stain on the conscience' of the US. Some 119 detainees were subjected to beatings, waterboarding, rectal feeding, being hung on chains and being made to wear nappies at a network of secret jails. One detainee, chained half-naked to a floor, died of hypothermia. The British security services and Blair Government were being fed information by the CIA and worked closely with the Bush administration on the 'war on terror'. Yet the 499-page Senate report did not contain a single reference to MI5, MI6 or Diego Garcia, a British overseas base known to have been used for rendition – prompting claims it had been redacted to spare the UK's blushes. Amid the fallout from the US Senate's explosive report into the barbaric techniques used by the CIA, ex-shadow home secretary David Davis said the UK had 'turned a blind eye' to what America was doing . The British security services and Blair Government were being fed information by the CIA and worked closely with the Bush administration on the 'war on terror'. Yet the 499-page Senate report did not contain a single reference to MI5, MI6 or Diego Garcia, a British overseas base known to have been used for rendition – prompting claims it had been redacted to spare the UK's blushes. Over two years, the British ambassador in Washington, Sir Peter Westmacott, met with members of the committee at least 11 times. His predecessor, Nigel Sheinwald, also held 11 meetings with members of the committee between 2009 and 2011. Ex-Foreign Secretary William Hague also made 'representations' to the US. An inquiry by judge Sir Peter Gibson was halted pending police inquiries but raised 27 areas requiring further investigation, ranging from interrogation techniques to so-called ‘rendition flights’, the training of agents and ministerial oversight of the agencies. They are now being examined by the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) - a move which campaigners argue is insufficiently independent. Mr Clegg said during his weekly LBC radio phone-in: ‘Once the police investigations are done, once the report from the Intelligence and Security Committee is done, we should keep an open mind if we need to about moving to a full judicial inquiry if there are any outstanding questions. ‘I'm like anybody else: I want the truth out there.’ He went on: ‘However shocking the Senate committee report is, it's worth remembering that I doubt very much any state run by Isil or al Qaida would ever have the maturity to lift the lid on its own mistakes in the way a mature democracy like America has done.’ Mr Clegg said the Senate committee report included the ‘devastating assertion that it (torture) didn't actually keep us safe’ and may in fact have led to resources being wasted on false trails. Prime Minister David Cameron has declared himself ‘satisfied that our system is dealing with all these issues’. Campaign groups want Tony Blair and ex-New Labour ministers to be grilled, too. Chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: 'There is an important issue that needs to be addressed. It's not whether the British Government or British agencies were carrying out torture. 'It's whether the intelligence agencies benefited from information or accepted information that they either knew or ought to have known had been obtained through improper means.' But human rights groups are adamant that a full judge-led inquiry must take place to get to the truth. They also want the full 6,000-page version of the Senate report to be released, not just the heavily-redacted summary. Ex-shadow home secretary David Davis (left) said the UK had 'turned a blind eye' to what America was doing, while Sir Malcolm Rifkind (right) said whether intelligence agencies benefited from information they knew had been obtained through improper mean was 'an important issue that needs to be addressed' Ed Miliband defended his brother David's record as Foreign Secretary . Ed Miliband today defended his brother's record as Foreign Secretary amid growing questions over what the last Labour government knew about American torture techniques. The Labour leader was asked whether David had questions to answer about what he knew when he served in the Cabinet under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Mr Miliband said: 'He has talked about these things in the past. 'I know how seriously he took these issues when he was in government. 'He answered questions about this in the House of Commons while he was in government.' The Labour leader added: 'He is never somebody who would ever countenance the British state getting engaged in this kind of activity. 'The government itself here in Britain previously announced an inquiry into these issues but then held off that inquiry because there are court cases ongoing. I think it’s right to let those court cases and those issues take their course.' David Miliband is now head of the International Rescue Committee aid organisation in New York. Clare Algar, of Reprieve, said: 'We already know the UK was up to its neck in the CIA's rendition and torture programme. Yet the British Government continues to fight against real accountability in the UK courts.' Amnesty International said it was clear 'the CIA did not act alone' and called for the full report to be published. Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said: 'I was never in any way complicit in the unlawful rendition or detention of individuals by the United States or any other state.' Former Home Secretary David Blunkett declined to comment. Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg – who was paid compensation by the UK for alleged complicity in his ill-treatment – said there was a link between the torture report and the slaughter of British and US hostages in Syria. He said terror group Islamic State was 'born out of the dungeons of Abu Ghraib, where these torture methods were being implemented'. Islamic extremists last night vowed to kill those responsible for the torture revealed in the CIA report. Nadim al-Muhajir wrote on Twitter: 'You thought things cannot get any worse for America. But it did. These #torturereports are going to radicalise a whole generation.' He added: 'Slaughter the bastards who are defending the CIA and justifying their actions.'","Clegg said torture 'cannot, will not and is not being used' by UK agencies .

"Ukraine's leaders fear an imminent Russian invasion of their eastern industrial heartland after the last airbase in Crimea was taken over. The concern follows the violent storming of the military compound in Belbek, the biggest show of Russian force in the three weeks Kremlin troops have been stationed in the peninsula. Since the annexation of the region was confirmed on Friday, Russian troops have began to gather at the eastern border and Ukraine's military leaders believe they are ready to attack 'at any moment'. Ukrainian troops at the Belbek airbase in Sevastopol after it was taken over by Russian soldiers on Saturday . Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council chief Andriy Parubiy told a rally in Kiev: 'The aim of Putin is not Crimea but all of Ukraine... His troops massed at the border are ready to attack at any moment,' The interim leaders in Kiev fear that . Russian President Vladimir Putin is developing a sense he could get away . with further actions after the EU and US only handed him limited . sanctions. Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsya added: 'We do not know what Putin has in his mind and what would be his decision. 'That's why this situation is becoming even more explosive than it used to be a week ago.' NATO's top . military commander added to the fears, suggesting Russia had built up a 'very sizeable' force and even . speculated Moscow could have other former Soviet states in its . sights. Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove said Moldova, could be next if Putin decides to put his expansionist policies in place. Breedlove was one of several Western . officials and politicians to warn that Russia may not stop there in a . crisis that has damaged East-West relations. 'The . (Russian) force that is at the Ukrainian border now to the east is . very, very sizeable and very, very ready,' the NATO commander told an . event held by the German Marshall Fund think-tank.'

United States senator John McCain compared Putin's actions to those of Adolf Hitler during the 1930's. The foreign policy specialist said: 'I think he (Putin) is calculating how . much he can get away with, just as Adolf Hitler calculated how much he . could get away with in the 1930s. Denial: Putin, pictured at the moment he signed the law making Crimea a part of Russia, has refuted claims he wants to widen his military operations . U.S. President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said the build-up might just be aimed at intimidating Ukraine's new pro-Western leaders but that Russia could invade the country's mainly Russian-speaking east. 'It's possible that they are preparing to move in,' he told CNN. A meeting of the G7 group has been arranged for Monday in the Netherlands to allow leaders to discuss a response to Russia's actions. Obama is also set to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for bilateral talks. Resources: Russian military ships moored in the bay at Sevastapol after Crimea's rebel leader urged Russians across Ukraine to rise up against Kiev's rule .

It follows a launch of a new military exercise in the area, involving 8,500 artillery men, near Ukraine's eastern border 10 days ago. 'There is absolutely sufficient (Russian) force postured on the eastern border of Ukraine to run to Transdniestria if the decision was made to do that, and that is very worrisome,' Breedlove said. The speaker of Transdniestria's parliament has urged Russia to incorporate the region, which lies to the west of Ukraine. Tribute: A military band plays at Simferopol railway station, welcoming back Ukrainian troops . The new leaders in Kiev have said Moscow could seek to link up pro-Russian regions in Moldova, and Georgia to Ukraine's east.

"A former TV pitchman in Utah known for his over-the-top personality turned his initial court appearance into a sideshow Thursday by being disruptive and combative with a federal judge. Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from accusations he chased and kicked a barn owl in flight while on a motorized paraglider. He was held in custody for several hours before being released on conditions that included getting rid of all his weapons. Earlier in the day, Schanze was placed in handcuffs in a Salt Lake City courtroom after he stood up and interrupted a judge at another man's hearing. U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Brooke Wells had told that man he would have to surrender any weapons as part of his release. Disruptive: n this May 10, 2006 photo, Dell Schanze watches the proceedings during his trial in West Jordan, Utah. The TV pitchman accused of chasing a barn owl in flight on his motorized paraglider . Speaking loudly from the front row, Schanze declared it was unconstitutional to take the man's guns. Wells ordered U.S. marshals to handcuff Schanze and escort him out. He was brought back minutes later for his own hearing on charges of knowingly using an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird. The Utah U.S. attorney's office said the incident happened in 2011. The charges, filed in October, came after a federal investigation into a video that surfaced online last year and appeared to show a paraglider near Utah Lake kicking a soaring owl and boasting about it. Schanze, 45, faces a maximum of 1 1/2 years in jail and more than $100,000 in fines. He sat beside his court-appointed attorney with his hands cuffed behind his back. When the judge asked if he intended to hire his own attorney, Schanze ignored the question and declared the charges against him lacked merit. 'It's all based on a fake YouTube video,' Schanze said. He remained argumentative as Wells tried to determine if he qualified for a court-appointed lawyer. Eventually Schanze confirmed that he and his wife each make $2,000 a month by working for a brother's business. He said local media ruined his own businesses. At a later hearing on whether Schanze would remain in custody, Wells said she would let him go despite her reservations. She ordered him to get a job, undergo a mental evaluation and get approval before travelling outside Utah. She also barred him from having weapons. As the judge explained the conditions, she asked Schanze several times if he understood. 'Yes ma'am,' he answered each time in a boisterous voice. Schanze is known in Utah for his shrill, hyperactive TV commercials for his Totally Awesome Computers retail chain. He shut down the stores in 2006 amid sinking sales and legal troubles. He has since run for political office, including a Libertarian bid for governor. Charges against Schanze came after a federal investigation into a video that surfaced online last year and appeared to show a paraglider near Utah Lake kicking a soaring owl and boasting about it . Local celebrity: Schanze is known in Utah for his shrill, hyperactive TV commercials for his Totally Awesome Computers retail chain . Schanze's paragliding has run afoul of the law before. In 2006, he was charged with disorderly conduct after flying low near Interstate 15 at rush hour. He kissed the feet of a fan who paid his $300 fine in the case. Five years later, Schanze was arrested in Oregon after allegedly jumping off the 125-foot-tall Astoria Column. He said outside the jail the government was stifling his creativity. His other legal troubles include a 2005 conviction for lying to officers after prosecutors said he brandished a gun at Draper residents angry that he'd sped through their neighborhood. Four years later, Schanze was sentenced to 10 days in jail after police stopped him for weaving in and out of traffic. Prosecutors say his children weren't wearing seatbelts, and Schanze was carrying a loaded gun in his fanny pack without a permit.

"The family home of the millionaire businessman cleared of plotting to murder his wife on their honeymoon has been vandalised and a Monopoly-style 'get out of jail free' card left outside. Detectives have launched an investigation after white paint was thrown over the driveway and gate of Shrien Dewani's home. The vandalism comes just a day after the 34-year-old jetted back into the UK after being cleared of  murdering his wife Anni in South African four years ago. Mr Dewani left Gatwick Airport through a side entrance yesterday before being driven away behind  in black people carrier. Scroll down for video .

He was not believed that he returned to his home is on a busy road connecting Bristol to the M5 and is accessed through electronic gates. A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said the force had not been contacted by Mr Dewani or any members of his family. 'Officers are looking into this after being made aware by the media,' he said. Dewani walked free on Monday after being  cleared of any part in the killing despite the judge ruling that many 'unanswered questions' still surrounded the case. Dewani walked free on Monday after being cleared of any part in the killing in South Africa of his wife Anni . The ruling prompted an angry response from Anni's family, who are now considering whether to launch a civil action against her husband in the UK . Mr Dewani pictured in the dock in the High Court, Cape Town, where the case against him was dismissed . The ruling in South Africa, prompted an angry response from Anni's family, who are considering whether to launch a civil action against her husband in the UK. They said the decision left many questions unanswered as it meant Dewani, who led a double life, would not have to give evidence or face cross-examination. The family waited four years for the case to be brought against the businessman, who had been accused of staging the car-jacking in which she was gunned down. Speaking on the steps of Western Cape High Court after Dewani was acquitted, Anni's sister Ami Denborg said the family felt 'failed' by the justice system. Ms Denborg said the family would be 'haunted' by the decision. Holding back tears, she said: 'We came here looking for answers and we came here looking for the truth and all we got was more questions. 'We waited patiently for four years to hear what really happened to Anni and to hear the full story of what happened to our dearest little sister. 'All we wanted was to hear all the events and the hope of actually finding that out has kept us, as a family, going. Unfortunately we believe that this right has now been taken away from us.' Ami Denborg holding back the tears as she speaks on the steps of the South African court after Mr Dewani was cleared . Drawing on evidence that Dewani had secret relationships with gay men in the months before they married, Ms Denborg said: 'We heard that Shrien has led a double life and that Anni knew nothing about it.  And we just wish that Shrien had been honest with us and especially with Anni.' Dewani heaved a sigh of relief as the judge dismissed the case against him. He left court a short time later through a side entrance, declining to comment. Three men - Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and gunman Xolile Mngeni - have already been convicted for their parts in Anni's murder, which happened when the Dewanis' chauffeur-driven late-night tour of a township was hijacked. Monde Mbolombo, a self-confessed 'middle man' who set up the murder, may now also face justice, having previously been granted immunity by the state. Prosecutors said Dewani had long planned to get out of the relationship to Swedish-raised engineer Anni, 28, and arranged a car-jacking on their honeymoon in Cape Town in November 2010 in which he would escape unharmed and Anni would be killed. But Judge Traverso said the claims of the chief prosecution witness, cab driver Tongo, were 'riddled with contradictions' and 'highly debatable'. Dewani, who was  extradited this year to face trial, listened intently as key evidence against him was criticised by the judge. The ruling ended a four-year wait for Dewani and his family to clear his name - a period which included lengthy spells in mental health units, lurid allegations about his private life and fighting extradition from the UK.","Shrien Dewani cleared of  murdering of his wife Anni on their honeymoon .

"An elderly husband strangled his 79-year-old wife to death before taking his own life, police believe. The body of pensioner Edith Gravener, who suffered from dementia, was found inside her home in St Helens, Merseyside, by her daughter-in-law last Tuesday. After officers were called, a search for her missing husband Ronald resulted in the 78-year-old's body being found in Carr Mill Dam, less than a mile from the couple's property, just hours later. Post mortem examinations showed that Mrs Gravener, a retired seamstress, died as a result of asphyxiation and Mr Gravener, a retired coal miner, of drowning. Edith Gravener, 79, was found dead at her home in Mallory Grove in the St Helens area of Merseyside (pictured), and her husband Ronald, 78, was found dead just a few hours later at a dam less than a mile away . Police confirmed that they believe Mr Gravener strangled his wife before committing suicide. A criminal investigation is now underway, with a file set to be prepared for the coroner. Stunned neighbours living in the sleepy cul-de-sac told of their shock after the bodies of the elderly couple were discovered just hours apart. One said: 'They had lived here for 20-plus years and were a really lovely couple. 'She suffered from dementia but he was totally devoted to her and cared for her around the clock. 'We used to see him going up the road to get his paper every morning. 'It's terrible what's happened. We've lived here for 30 years and nothing like this has ever happened around here before.' Another told how the first he knew of the tragedy was when police knocked on his door and told him that Mrs Gravener had been found dead and that Mr Gravener and his car had disappeared. He added: 'Whichever way you look at it, it's a tragedy.' Inquests into both deaths were opened on Monday afternoon. In the opening statements, it was revealed that Mrs Gravener's daughter-in-law, Amanda, had arrived at the house shortly after 9am on December 2 to take Mrs Gravener to see her GP, but had found the couple's property unlocked. Inside, she discovered Mrs Gravener's body and a note, penned by Mr Gravener, in which he allegedly apologised for his actions. A subsequent police search resulted in officers finding Mr Gravener's body in Carr Mill Dam shortly before 1pm. Police said an investigation into both deaths was 'ongoing' but detectives confirmed that they were not seeking anyone else in relation to either death.","Edith Gravener, 79, was found dead at her home by her daughter-in-law .

"An engineer who was told by colleagues that he was 'wasting his time' designing the world's first video games console in 1972 has died aged 92. Ralph Baer, who died this week at his home in Manchester, New Hampshire, first considered the possibility of a video games console while working as a television engineer in the 1950s. Over the next ten years, as chief designer for Sanders Associates - which is now part of defence contractor BAE Systems - he started working on his idea. He had his break-through in 1966 while waiting at a bus stop in New York, after which he wrote down a four-page proposal, which he developed into the world's first video games console. Ralph Baer, pictured, invented the world's first video games console in 1972, called the Magnavox Odyssey . His initial design was a simple Brown Box, pictured, with controlled a Table Tennis game on the screen . One eBay seller has offered their Magnavox Odyssey for sale including original box for $20,000 . His Brown Box, which was licensed by Magnavox in the 1970s, was the forerunner for the Magnavox Odyssey, which is acknowledged as the world's first video games console. His invention predated the Atari, and he had a developed a table-tennis game, before the rival system launched their world famous Pong. Mr Baer was born in Germany to a Jewish family and was fortunate enough to leave the country in 1938 to the United States, avoiding the Holocaust. The Magnavox Odyssey was launched in 1972 and was able to play around two dozen games. The games system plugged into the back of the television set featured hand-held controllers which allowed players to direct action on the screen. The company failed to develop a major video games division, but made substantial money from suing companies such as Atari and Nintendo for infringing upon Mr Baer's patents. The Magnavox Odyssey sold 330,000 units between 1972 and 1974. His son, Mark Baer, recalled playing early versions of video games on a small black and white TV perched on a shoe stand. Mr Baer received the National Medal of Technology from President George W. Bush in 2006 and was inducted into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2010. Mr Baer, pictured, was told by his colleagues that he was 'wasting his time' working on a video game machine . Before inventing the system that became known as the Magnavox Odyssey, Baer said he often was asked by co-workers how the group would make any money from the project. He said in an interview in 2010: 'People thought I was wasting my time and the company's money for that matter. A 1972 Magnavox Odyssey, with all the various attachments, stickers and controllers has been offered for sale on eBay. According to the Califonian seller, the console comes in 'as new' condition. The box has been opened, although there are no signs of ageing or damage. 'There's no way anybody could have predicted how fast this industry would take off.' A version of The Brown Box is now at the American History Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian plans to open a gallery next year with a focus on innovation and is including Mr Baer's workshop. Mr Baer later formed his own consulting business, through which he created or assisted in developing numerous electronic toys and games. In Simon, still in production today, the player has to duplicate an increasingly complicated pattern of lights and sounds. Mark Baer said his father had patients for more than 150 inventions, including a light gun an dtalking cards. He said; 'He had all kinds of ideas. We stepped on the doormat that would talk back to you. He had a great sense of humor. He'd program it, like you can say anything you want, ""Welcome to my home,"" or ""Hey, go away!""' Mark Baer said his father was working on new ideas up until recently. Ralph Baer: 'If you have it in your genes, it's almost like breathing,' he said.","Ralph Baer 'invented' the games console while waiting for a bus in 1966 .

"Paul Dunham, 59, and Sandra Dunham, 58,  were taken to hospital in May after they took a drug overdose the night before they were due to hand themselves in to police and in turn to U.S. marshals . A retired British couple who lost their fight against extradition have pleaded guilty in the United States to fraud. Paul Dunham, 59, and Sandra Dunham, 58, were flown to the U.S. from Heathrow Airport in May, having lost a High Court battle in the UK against extradition the previous month. They were taken to Northampton General Hospital in May after they took a drug overdose the night before they were due to hand themselves in to police and in turn to U.S. marshals. Senior District Judge Howard Riddle at Westminster Magistrates' Court concluded that they had deliberately taken an overdose to avoid or delay extradition. Later the couple, from Northampton, were handed over to U.S. marshals at Heathrow by officers from the Metropolitan Police's extradition unit. A statement on the website of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland said the couple yesterday pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud in connection with a scheme in which they requested reimbursement from their employer for mortgage payments on time shares in Barbados, luxury bedding for their home, a dog sofa and other personal expenses. Mr Dunham also pleaded guilty to money laundering. According to their pleas, the defendants worked for Pace Worldwide which was located at various times in Maryland and North Carolina, and had a subsidiary in the United Kingdom named Pace Europe Ltd. Pace produced parts for the repair and reworking of electronics for the military and others. Mr Dunham held a number of executive positions, including president and chief operating officer. Mrs Dunham was initially hired to work for the European subsidiary in the accounts department, and eventually became the director of sales and marketing for Pace Worldwide. The Dunhams moved from the UK to Maryland then North Carolina, and were provided with corporate credit cards. Between 2002 and 2009, they fraudulently charged personal expenses to their corporate credit cards and submitted vouchers to Pace for reimbursement that falsely described the expenditures as business expenses, the statement said. For example, Mr Dunham represented that $3,007 (£1,900) had been spent on meals during business meetings, when in fact the money was spent on luxury bedding for his North Carolina residence. House: The Dunhams were found by police officers at their detached home in Northampton in May . Between 2002 and 2009, they fraudulently charged personal expenses to their corporate credit cards and submitted vouchers to Pace for reimbursement, it was said . Mrs Dunham sought reimbursement for $8,397 (£5,330) which she represented as expenses incurred to cancel a holiday due to a business meeting, when these expenses were actually mortgage payments the couple made on two separate time share units they had bought in Barbados. Other personal expenses which were falsely described as business expenditures included personal legal fees, expensive furniture, a domed pet residence and a dog sofa. The couple also fraudulently billed Pace Europe Ltd for business expenses already paid by Pace Worldwide, obtaining duplicate reimbursements, the statement said. The couple, from Northampton, were handed over to U.S. marshals at Heathrow by officers from the Metropolitan Police's extradition unit. File picture . In addition, a substantial portion of the scheme involved Mr Dunham abusing a private position of trust to manage and direct others, including his secretary, in the execution of the scheme. Moreover, he repeatedly forged receipts and invoices to create the false appearance that they were for business, rather than personal expenses. As a result of the lengthy scheme, one million dollars (£635,500) in actual losses were incurred. The couple have agreed to forfeit and pay restitution of that amount, the statement said. Mr Dunham faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy and money laundering. Mrs Dunham and the U.S. government have agreed that if the court accepts the plea agreement, she will be sentenced to 60 days in jail. U.S. District Judge Paul Grimm has scheduled sentencing for both defendants for January 29.","Paul and Sandra Dunham were wanted in Maryland for offences .

"Labour MP Frank Doran has come under fire after suggesting that the post of fisheries minister would be an unsuitable job for a woman . A Labour MP has caused outrage for suggesting that the post of fisheries minister would be an unsuitable job for a woman. When Frank Doran’s comment was greeted with gasps in the Commons, he insisted it was not sexist, saying: ‘I know the fishing industry.’ Mr Doran, the member for Aberdeen North, made the statement during a debate on the fishing industry. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said his comments were 'outrageous and deeply offensive' and demanded an apology, while Defence Minister Anna Soubry said he was 'talking nonsense and insulting women'. Scottish Cabinet minister Richard Lochhead said he had seen many female ministers from other European countries who were 'tougher' than the men from Westminster's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Aberdeen North MP Mr Doran made the comments during a debate on the fishing industry in the Commons. He recalled previous fishing debates in the Commons and the 'biting' questions a minister previously faced, largely due to the higher number of fishing communities in the country. He went on: 'And he or, I'm trying to remember if we've ever had a female fisheries minister, I don't think we have.' Conservative Sheryll Murray for South East Cornwall intervened to tell him: 'We haven't but we have had former female secretaries of state.' Mr Doran replied: 'You're absolutely right but no dedicated fisheries ministers. 'I'm not sure it is a job for a woman although the honourable lady might reach that.' After gasps could be heard from fellow MPs, Mr Doran said: 'That was not a sexist remark. I know the fishing industry very well.' Mrs Murray's fisherman husband died in an accident on board his trawler after a toggle on the hood of his jacket got tangled in the net as he was hauling it in. Neil Murray, 57, died in March 2011 from multiple injuries suffered in the accident on the vessel Our Boy Andrew. Outside the Commons, Ms Morgan - who is also the Women and Equalities Minister - said: 'Frank Doran's comments are outrageous and deeply offensive and seriously undermine our work to raise aspiration among young women and girls. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (pictured left) said his comments were 'outrageous and deeply offensive', while Defence Minister Anna Soubry (right) said he was 'talking nonsense and insulting women' 'He should apologise immediately. Labour are very good at throwing stones but they are too quick to ignore blatant sexism within their own ranks - Ed Miliband and Harriet Harman cannot ignore this.' Ms Soubry, the first female MP to be a defence minister, added: 'Frank Doran is talking nonsense and insulting women. 'Ed Miliband should make it absolutely clear he doesn't agree with Doran's ridiculous remarks.'

"One person has died and around 20 others have been injured after a teenage suicide bomber attacked a play condemning such violence at a French-run school in Afghanistan. According to witnesses the boy walked into the amphitheater of the French Cultural Centre, inside the grounds of Estiqlal High School in the capital Kabul, before detonating the device. The audience had been watching a drama condemning suicide attacks. Scroll down for video . At least one person has been killed and another 20 wounded after a teenage suicide bomber detonated inside a French school in the Afghan capital of Kabul . A government minister has said the bomber was around 16 years old and is reported to have walked into the school's amphitheatre during a music performance before setting off his device . Doctors tend to one of the victims of a teenager who detonated a bomb inside a music concert in Kabul today as a government minister warned the death toll will likely rise . General Ayoub Salangi, acting head of the Interior Ministry, said the suspected theatre bomber appeared to have been about 17 years old and detonated his explosives  during an early evening performance. The incident came just hours after a suicide bomber targeted a bus carrying Afghan army personnel, killing six soldiers and wounding 11. 'I heard a deafening explosion...There were Afghans, foreigners, young girls and young boys watching the show,' Sher Ahmad, an Afghan rights activist who was at the performance, told Reuters. He said the blast came during a performance of a new play called 'Heartbeat: Silence After the Explosion', a condemnation of suicide attacks. He said: 'Pieces of flesh were plastered on the wall. There were children and women crying for help. 'Some were running out, some were just screaming.' General Abdul Rahman Rahimi, Kabul's police chief said: 'There was one person killed and between 15 to 20 wounded. 'Because of the smoke, it was impossible to identify the exact number of the casualties.' The explosion is believed to have happened towards the back of the room, near a group of journalists and photographers covering the event. The man who died is believed to have been a German national, but he has not yet been identified. The Afghan Journalists' Association said at least two reporters were wounded in the attack. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the bomber targeted the event because it was staged 'to insult Islamic values and spread propaganda about our jihad operations, especially on suicide attacks'. The attack came as U.S. and other foreign troops wind down their combat role in Afghanistan, leading to a resurgence in Taliban attacks . Heavily armed police and soldiers assemble outside of the school following a suicide bomb attack . A soldiers with a heavy machine gun watches the scene outside the French school in Kabul after reports that a teenage suicide bomber detonated inside . Sources say that Taliban attackers have been targeting foreign buildings in order to get more attention . The venue was heavily guarded during the event, said Kabul police chief Abdul Rahman Rahimi, who added that the bomber may have hidden explosives in his underwear to pass through security. He said the bomber detonated the explosives at the top of the auditorium stairs, which may have prevented more casualties. He added that although the body of the bomber was badly damaged, police were able to identify him as a teenager because his head was found 'intact'. The school, which is run under contract by the French government, is close to the Presidential Palace and was established in 1922. It taught exclusively in French until 1985, but is now administered by Afghanistan's Education Ministry which enforces a broader curriculum. French Embassy official Yves Manville said the French government funds the school and provides some of the teachers. 'Our main activities at the school are cultural,' he said. No French citizens were among the casualties, he added. The Taliban are stepping up their attacks across Afghanistan as foreign troops withdraw and Afghan forces fail to make up the numbers . U.S. troop numbers were supposed to drop to 9,800 by the end of the month but the drawdown has now been halted amid concerns that not enough fighters will remain . Earlier today the head of NATO's international security assistance force warned that Afghan forces are still 'inept' at basic tasks and are struggling to recruit amid killings and desertions . The bombing was the latest in a string of insurgent attacks on foreign targets in Kabul, amid a stepped-up Taliban insurgency as U.S. troops step down their role in the country. There are still around 10,500 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, a number that was supposed to drop to 9,800 by the end of the month, though that has now been postponed due to a shortage. Earlier today Lieutenant-General Joseph Anderson, head of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, also warned that Afghan troops are 'inept' as NATO forces prepare to leave at the end of the year. He also warned that there is a shortage of personnel as recruitment fails to keep pace with injuries, deaths and desertions. Sources said the suicide bombers are deliberately targeting foreign targets in order to get more coverage. The school run under contract by the French authorities . Afghan soldiers and police officers are seen near the school in central Kabul today as government officials warn that the death toll is likely to rise . It is unusual for the Taliban to use female suicide bombers, especially one as young as 16-years-old . He added: 'You've got a mix of uniform police, civil obedience police and the army, all in the same footprint, debating over who has got primacy for responsibility. That's a fundamental issue here.' In the past month attacks have killed a British embassy security guard and a South African charity worker and his two teenage children. Analysts say the Taliban are choosing foreign targets to ensure maximum publicity. Hashmat Stanikzai, spokesman for the Kabul provincial police chief, said the attacker was on foot and that civilians were among the wounded.

"ISIS sympathisers took to Twitter today to share a photograph of a balaclava-clad, left-handed militant they claimed to be a new image of the terror group's executioner in chief, Jihadi John. Brandishing the same style of combat knife used by the British militant during the sickening filmed murders of three American nationals, two British aid workers and 22 Syrian soldiers, the alleged terrorist bears a striking resemblance to Jihadi John. This is despite the fact his face is largely covered by a similar style of black balaclava worn by the famously left-handed killer in the five chilling ISIS murder videos in which  has appeared. The image was widely shared by Islamic State sympathisers today after apparently being uploaded to picture messaging app SnapChat by a French militant, who captioned it with the words 'Do you recognise him?' and suggested he had spent 'a day with Jihadi John'. But despite capturing the attention of the world's media, it can now be revealed that the image was first uploaded to Twitter on November 29 by a man claiming to be a Dutch fighter who has since come forward to say the masked militant in the photograph is in fact him. Questions: The image was widely shared by ISIS sympathisers today after apparently being tweeted by a French jihadi who claimed to have spent the day with Jihadi John. However the same photograph was uploaded to Twitter last month by a man claiming to be a Dutch ISIS fighter . Real deal: The famously left-handed killer known as Jihadi John has now appeared in five ISIS murder videos . The image that apparently showed Jihadi John was shared on Twitter by a radical calling himself Abu Anas Mujahid, who appeared to suggest he had spent time with the ISIS executioner. The photograph was captioned: 'A day with Jihadi John - may the eyes of cowards never sleep #IslamicState.' Other ISIS sympathisers claimed the photograph first emerged on the SnapChat account of a French militant who captioned it with the words 'Do you recognise him?'. But despite the buzz of excitement among warped fans of the cold-blooded killer, it subsequently emerged that the same picture was first shared online late last month by a man claiming to be a Dutch ISIS militant who suggested he had been simply pretending to be Jihadi John. This afternoon he returned to Twitter and, using the account @FightingJMedia, began pointing out that the person in the photograph is in fact him. Denial: Despite the buzz of excitement among warped fans of the cold-blooded killer, the same picture was first shared online by a Dutch militant last month (below). Today the Dutchman said it is him in the photo . Killer: The real Jihadi John was reportedly seriously wounded in an US-led air strike in November after meeting with ISIS chiefs, including the group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Iraq . Return: The real Jihadi John was reportedly seriously wounded in an US-led air strike in November, but just days later appeared in a sickening filmed beheading video of 22 Syrian soldiers (pictured) Adding to the confusion, another set of ISIS sympathisers claimed the photograph shows an unknown British militant calling himself Abu Sumayyah who they said recently carried out a suicide bombing somewhere in Iraq. This claim is likely to be a mistaken reference to Kabir Ahmed - a 32-year-old father of three from Derby who used the same nom de guerre and who became the 29th Briton to die fighting for ISIS when he carried out a suicide bomb attack in the strategic Iraqi town of Baiji last month. The real Jihadi John was reportedly seriously wounded in an US-led air strike in November after meeting with ISIS chiefs, including the group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Iraq. The masked ‘executioner’ was said to have narrowly escaped death when the leadership summit  in a town close to the Syrian border was targeted by American and Iraqi warplanes. Just days after the alleged strike, however, the militant appeared in a sickening filmed beheading video of 22 Syrian soldiers, which also showed the severed head of American Peter Kassig.","Warped ISIS sympathisers claim new image shows their hero Jihadi John .

"A father has been charged with capital murder in the death of his son who died after being inside their washing machine. Authorities will not comment on whether Joseph Blocker, 28, put his son, Koda Blocker, inside the washing machine or if the boy had climbed inside himself, but they did say it is a front loading machine that must be closed and switched on from the outside before starting a cycle. Around 3.30pm on Tuesday, Blocker called 911 to report that the boy was unconscious at their home in Garland, Texas. Only he, Koda and his 22-month-old daughter were home at the time. Scroll down for video . Locked up: Joseph Blocker, 28, has been charged with capital murder after his four-year-old son died after being in their washing machine. It is not yet clear if the father put the boy in or if he climbed inside . Authorities arrived and found the boy already dead. Detectives said that a medical examiner found the boy's injuries consistent with him being inside a washing machine. 'What we feel is at some point the child was inside the washing machine in the home,' Garland police Officer Joe Harn said. 'According to investigators it is a front-loading type. For the child to be in the machine, the door had to be shut and it had to be started from the outside. It does not start by automatically shutting the door.' He would not comment on what role the father is believed to have played in the boy's injuries, but pointed out only he, the four-year-old boy and his 22-month-old daughter were home at the time. The boy's exact cause of death is under investigation. Police detectives are working with the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office to determine the cause of death, Harn said. Tragic: The little boy Koda, pictured left with his father and right, was dead when police officers arrived at their home on Tuesday afternoon. He was alone in the house with his father and toddler sister . Scene: The father called 911 on Tuesday and was taken into custody at their Garland, Texas home (pictured) Blocker, who lives with his children and a woman at the address, was arrested at the scene. Neighbor Yesenia Varela told CBS he was there when Blocker was taken into custody on Tuesday. 'He had no expression on his face,' she said. 'I don't know what to tell you. He had no expression.' Another neighbor, Luz Juarez, said Blocker's hands appeared to be streaked with blood. Blocker was taken to the Garland Detention Center on the murder charge. His bond has been set at $500,000. According to public records, Blocker pleaded guilty to marijuana possession in 2005 and was convicted on a DWI charge in 2013. The boy's mother was out of state at the time, WFAA reported.

Leroy Moore, Jr., 73, was arrested on Wednesday for viewing child pornography. He is in jail on a $10,000 bond and could serve 10 years if he's convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor . ‘It was chilling and disturbing,’ said York police Lt. Rich Caddell. He said Moore didn't try to hide anything. ‘He told us what he was doing. When we asked him he said he was watching little boys,’ said Caddell. The officer was wearing a body camera, which captured both Moore's confession and the pornographic pictures visible on his laptop. Caddell had to view the pornographic images in order to make the case against Moore. ‘What I watched still affects me today, and will probably affect me for a while,’ said Caddell. Moore is in jail on a $10,000 bond and could serve 10 years if he's convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor.

Following Moore's arrest, police have begun trying to link him to several complaints they'd received going back to the summer. In those complaints, callers told officers they'd seen a man in a white Pontiac like Moore's, sitting in public parks, and in store parking lots looking suspicious. They now believe that man may have been Moore. According to WSOC9, Moore's neighbor Jerry McCurry - who fixes computers as his hobby - found a folder containing graphic, underage pornography titled 'My Girls' while working on Moore's computer four years ago. McCurry reported the crime, but Moore was never charged. Officer Edwards was one of the cops involved in Moore's arrest.

An official public lighting ceremony is set for 5:30pm Thursday, December 18. The keg tree was the brainchild of Kris Sirchio, the CEO of Genesee's parent company, North American Breweries. After pitching the idea to staff, they clubbed together and bought the design to life. 'It was a fun project, we had a ball. Everyone thinks it's cool and the whole company rallied around it,' Mike Gaesser, a Genesee Brewery employee told the Democrat and Chronicle. The finished construct is certainly an impressive sight and locals have been flocking to catch a glimpse of the two-story-high tree. Alas, beer lovers, the kegs - tied together with a cable system - are empty. But when the tree is dismantled, the company says the kegs will return to the production line and be refilled once again.

"Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said sex attackers were 'getting away with it' The conviction rate for sex crimes plummeted by 10 per cent last year as an increasing number of attackers 'got away with it', new figures have revealed. Despite more than 5,000 extra prosecutions in the year to June  only 77 more sex offenders were convicted. It means that just six out of 10 prosecutions for sex offences resulted in a prosecution - down from 70 per cent the year before. Labour claimed more offenders were getting away with their crimes and blamed Government cuts to police officers and specialist prosecutors for a failure to deal with complex sex crimes. The figures show there were 34,161 sex offence prosecutions in the year ending June 2014, with 19,685 resulting in a conviction. But a similar number of sex offenders - 19,608 - were convicted in the year ending June 2013, despite only 28,809 prosecutions, more than 5,000 fewer. In contrast the conviction rate for every other serious crime apart from robbery increased or remained the same over the same period. The release of the figures in the MoJ's quarterly criminal justice statistics comes as the prosecution and conviction of sexual offenders remains high on the political agenda after a string of high profile cases. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Government should establish national standards on the prosecution of sex crimes. She said: ‘These figures show the Government is failing to get justice for victims of sexual attacks and abuse. ‘More sex offenders are getting away with it, and fewer victims are getting the justice and protection they need. The scale of cuts to police officers and specialist prosecutors under Theresa May means they are struggling to cope with complex crimes.' Labour accused Theresa May of overseeing plummeting conviction rates for sex offences. Despite more than 5,000 extra prosecutions last year there were only 77 more sex offenders convicted . Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive of the charity Victim Support, said: ‘We know from supporting many thousands of victims of sexual offences that after getting up the courage to come forward to testify, they can feel devastated if their case ends without a guilty verdict. ‘Successful convictions are often dependent on victims and witnesses being able to give their best possible evidence to the court. ‘Victim Support is on hand to provide them with the help and support they need. ‘Agencies across the criminal justice system must address this drop in conviction rates, not least as sexual offences have some of the lowest conviction rates compared to other crimes.’","Some 5,000 extra prosecutions in year to June but just 77 more convictions .

"They get a 3-0 win away to Aston Villa and all of a sudden Mesut Ozil is world class and everything is brilliant again. One Gooner even said to me: 'It was a great weekend because all our rivals dropped points!' Rivals for what? Top four? I think you’ll find Southampton won. Minimal expectation means Arsenal fans are satisfied way too easily, and so Arsene Wenger manages the club under no pressure whatsoever. Let’s put some perspective on this result for Arsenal at the weekend. Mesut Ozil (centre) celebrates with Danny Welbeck (left) after scoring for Arsenal against Aston Villa . Ozil charges forward with the ball during Arsenal's victory over Aston Villa in Birmingham on Saturday . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger shakes hands with Bella the Lion, the Aston Villa mascot, before the match . Ozil looked good against a side with Philippe Senderos at the heart of their defence. A centre half who spent years at Arsenal gradually getting worse and worse. A Villa team that cost a fraction of Ozil’s left foot were well beaten in the end. But they started the better side before the blitz of goals that killed the game well before half time. The virus that hit the Villa camp robbed them of their man of the match at Liverpool the previous week, centre half Nathan Baker. And crucially, midfielder Ashley Westwood missed out – more on him later. Andi Weimann had to come off because he was feeling so ill, and Fabian Delph was also struggling. Paul Lambert confirmed afterwards that some of the staff had also been affected by the illness. Aston Villa should be beaten by Arsenal, if you factor in quality and price of players and relative experience of the managers. Lambert was spot on when he said that to beat a side like Arsenal you can’t afford to have a virus spreading through the camp. No virus at Anfield helped Villa secure victory. And this thing Gooners keep banging on about with Ozil – they tell me he’s brilliant in his best position, behind the striker. Yet they still defend a manager who’s taken more than a season to work that out? Welbeck (third left) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring Arsenal's second goal . Welbeck makes no mistake as he puts the ball past Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan into the net . Arsenal have spent the last decade beating opponents they should beat and getting too much praise for it. And in those years, the Gunners have wondered why so many questions are asked when they get absolutely battered by Dortmund, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea. And here we are again. Arsenal beat a Villa side that cost a pittance and was ravaged with illness, and the Dortmund debacle is forgotten by the fans. And people wonder why Wenger keeps making the same mistakes over and over and over again in the big games? The Villa virus is so bad the training ground was due to be temporarily shut down this week. Midfielder Westwood was throwing up in the warm up and despite being named in the original XI he couldn’t start the game he was so ill. With him patrolling in front of the back four there is no way Ozil would have had such an easy day. If Wenger is as shrewd as his supporters believe he is, he will have realised Westwood’s absence was the key to Arsenal’s victory. Ozil evades the challenge of Aston Villa's Philippe Senderos to score the opening goal on Saturday . Aston Villa's Ashley Westwood (right) leaves the field after falling ill during the pre-match warm-up . Wenger might also work out for himself that Westwood is exactly the holding midfielder Arsenal need. Gilberto Silva left the Emirates in 2008 and Arsenal haven’t had a decent anchorman since. Ron Burgundy would have been better than some of the players Wenger has tried to slot in that role. At the end of it all, it’s a win, a goal an assist and a good performance from Ozil. So, 'When will I give Wenger credit?' I hear Gooners ask. When he deserves it, is my reply. Like our Arsenal Facebook page here.

"The Home Office was embroiled in a fresh row over Press freedom last night after sneaking out proposals that would still allow police to sign off their own snooping into journalists’ phone records. Ministers had promised safeguards to prevent police misusing anti-terror powers to unmask potentially embarrassing confidential sources who blow the whistle to reporters. Campaigners, including MPs and barristers, wanted laws forcing the police to apply to judges before using the snooping legislation against journalists, rather than merely an officer of superintendent rank or above. Revealed: Theresa May's newly-unveiled guidelines show police can continue to snoop on journalists . But proposals unveiled by Home Secretary Theresa May made clear forces could continue to authorise their own applications for journalists’ telecoms data under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa). The new Acquisition and Disclosure of Communications Data Code of Practice also stated that the phone records of journalists, lawyers and even MPs are not privileged. The Home Office was also attacked for sneaking the guidelines out late on Tuesday at the same time as a US report exposing torture by the CIA. Tory MP David Davis said: ‘The new proposed codes of practice fall far short of what is required. Without judicial oversight of the process, with a full judicial consideration for any request to handle any confidential or privileged information, we are likely to see more of the sort of abuses that have become so unfortunately commonplace. Tory MP David Davis said the rules were 'improper' ‘This is an inappropriate and improper ruling; it could, for example, put whistleblowers at risk. 'As they stand, the proposed changes will bring little accountability or transparency to the use of communications data. The Government should ban either interception or collection of metadata without explicit approval by a judge for journalists and lawyers.’ The 55-page code of conduct was published follows a storm over two high-profile investigations in which detectives secretly accessed data to discover who had been passing information about senior politicians accused of wrongdoing. Metropolitan Police detectives used the secretly obtained call records of The Sun’s political editor Tom Newton Dunn to find and sack three officers found to have lawfully leaked information about the Plebgate incident. And Kent Police investigating the Chris Huhne speeding points scandal used Ripa to secretly obtain the phone records of a journalist on The Mail on Sunday and one of his sources, even though a judge had ruled the source should remain confidential. Police are normally required by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act to go to court to access a journalist’s sources. But RIPA powers require only that a request to access information such as who contacted whom, when, from where and for how long is approved by a police officer of superintendent rank or above – effectively giving forces the right to sign off their own warrants. Under the new guidance, a senior police officer will still be allowed to sign off a snooping request, but must give ‘special consideration to necessity and proportionality’ if the application is made for the phone data of a medical doctor, lawyer, journalist, MP or religious minister. The code also requires police for the first time to make a note of the fact they have accessed a journalist’s phone records. It appears to break promises made by the current Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne who said last month: ‘Inappropriate use of (RIPA) ... is a tool used to fight against serious crime, and yet it has been used to investigate journalists and sources that journalists have. ‘That was not what Parliament wanted that Act for. If it’s not something the prosecuting authorities and the criminal justice system can address, then it’s something I think the government will have to address.’ Launching a six-week consultation of the guidelines, Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said the Government is ‘clear that a free Press is fundamental to a free society and we are determined to ensure that nothing is done which puts that at risk’.","Ministers promised safeguards for secret sources and whistleblowers .

People here still believe that Ebola was disseminated by white people seeking the deaths of blacks, including through a measles vaccination campaign; by a laboratory testing bats to create a vaccination against the virus; by politicians from a rival tribe bent . It is a question scientists have yet to answer conclusively, although they have come to Meliandou to test great apes and bats as possible sources. When 2-year-old Emile Ouamouno caught a fever, started vomiting, passed blood in his stool and died two days later, nobody knew why. Now Emile is widely recognized by researchers as Patient Zero, the first person to have died in the latest Ebola outbreak back on December 28 last year. Etienne Ouamouno's son, Emile is widely recognized by researchers as Patient Zero, the first person to have died of Ebola back on December 28 last year . Children carry sanitization kits supplied by UNICEF  in the Guinean village of Meliandou . A group of young girls return to the village  of Meliandou, home of Ebola's Patient Zero . Women gather  in  Meliandou to prepare grains as life goes on beyond Ebola in the little village . In the meantime, Ebola has left Emile's grandfather, 85-year-old Kissy Dembadouno, without hope. Dembadouno has locked the room in his house where the child died. 'Eight people died in that room. It must remain closed,' he said. 'All that is left for me is to wonder why God gives me any more days on this Earth.' Meliandou is a village of about 400 people — down from 600 last year, after dozens of young men abandoned it in the belief that the Ouamouno family or the entire village was cursed, according to the village chief. The village doctor, Augustin Mamadouno, was among the first to flee, and the clinic is shuttered and shunned as a place of death, not healing. Those left here are gaunt, skin stretched tightly over their bones, with the only false signs of fat being the cruelly bloated stomachs of malnourished children. Families crowd into two-roomed houses built from home-made mud bricks. Their 'kitchens' are open fires outside marked by three blackened stones. Etienne Ouamouno, Emile's father, hugs his arms to his chest, as if for comfort, when he talks about the many deaths in his family, especially that of his only son. 'I was so traumatized by the deaths,' said Ouamouno. 'I think we still are.' Like most of the villagers, he's also broke. When Ouamouno took his son to the village doctor, he had to pay 20,000 Guinea francs ($2.75) for medication. It did no good. More expensive and useless trips to the clinic followed as Ouamouno's 4-year-old daughter died, then her mother, eight months' pregnant, followed quickly by the grandmother, an aunt and the midwife who delivered his wife of a stillborn baby. Ouamouno had no money to pay for the burials and feed the many mourners who came from other villages to perform a mass funeral rite. So he borrowed 1 ½ bags of rice and 250,000 francs (about $35) — more cash than he sees in a year — and killed his last goat. He says it will take him a year to pay back his debt. A child grabs food from a woman in a poor village that has become even poorer in the wake of Ebola . Village treasurer Facine Ouamouno said everyone contributed to the village coffers, but that borrowing to pay for all the burials in Meliandou has emptied the communal chest . Bernard Kamano, the village's health assistant, is the only health worker left from the epidemic that killed the village's three midwives, known here as 'wise women' Even the little he had was lost, when everything was burned to avoid contamination. As he complains of the chilly nights, he puts his arm around one of his surviving children, 6-year-old Marie, who snuffled from a cold as snot ran down her nose. 'I don't own a blanket to cover myself at night,' he said bitterly. 'I don't own a goat ... What I carry is a weight of sorrow.' Before the Ebola outbreak, village treasurer Facine Ouamouno said, everyone contributed to the village coffers to give them a cushion in case of an emergency. But borrowing to pay for all the burials in Meliandou has emptied the communal chest that once held 8 million francs ($1,100). 'This was a catastrophe,' he said. 'Now we have nothing.' Worse than nothing — some of those indebted to the village fund have themselves died of Ebola. In a tragic irony, the burials that bankrupted the village only helped to spread the disease. When people died, their bodies were washed by relatives, in line with tradition. They found out too late that this is one way to pass on Ebola, which can be caught only by direct contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person. Meliandou — whose name in the local Kissi language means 'This is as far as we go' — has also been left isolated, as neighbors in other villages turned on it. 'People are very, very angry with us, saying the disease started with us,' said village chief Amadou Kamano. Kissi Dembadouno sits in his home in the Guinean village of Meliandou, some 400 miles south-east of Conakry, Guinea. Demnadouno lost his wife, daughter and two grandchildren to the deadly disease. He is Etienne Ouamouno's father in law . Isaac Ouamouno sits in Meliandou, where as in many other villages across Ebola country, the disease is shrouded in mystery, surrounded by suspicion and rumors . Villagers wait for a distribution of sanitization supplies from UNICEF in the school  Meliandou . People here still believe that Ebola was disseminated by white people seeking the deaths of blacks, including through a measles vaccination campaign; by a laboratory testing bats to create a vaccination against the virus; by politicians from a rival tribe bent on killing off the forest people; by white miners looking to exploit a nearby mountain of iron ore . Mourners who came to Meliandou refused to eat any of the food or drink the water. Eventually they stopped attending village funerals altogether, a slight that cuts deep in African culture. At one point, they isolated Meliandou for days, Kamano said. They smashed the bridge that leads to town, cutting off access to the only working well and the main road. People in Meliandou have even lost one of their few sources of protein to Ebola. After the virus was officially recognized in Guinea at the end of March, villagers were warned to stop eating 'bush meat' — the fruit bats, cane rats and monkeys that provide protein but that scientists suspect are a reservoir for viruses like Ebola. Without protein, the villagers are less healthy, said the village's health assistant Bernard Kamano, in a country where UNICEF estimates 50 percent of child deaths are related to malnutrition. Kamano is the only health worker left from the epidemic that killed the village's three midwives, known here as 'wise women.' 'They were the ones called to care for people when they became ill,' said Suzanne Leno, who speaks for the women of Meliandou. 'Who will care for us now?' on killing off the forest people; by white miners looking to exploit a nearby mountain of iron ore. Meliandou does have one hard-won victory to be proud of — Ebola is gone, at least for now, and the village is still standing. Kamano is thankful, and credits some of the doctors who came. '(Otherwise) this whole village would be dead,' he said. 'It would have disappeared from the maps.'","The recent Ebola outbreak believed to have started in Meliandou, Guinea .

"A farmer who raised his three children on raw milk despite it being outlawed in Australia has spoken out in defence of the controversial product after a child's death was blamed on unpasteurised milk. Mark Tyler, who has drunk raw milk from his family's dairy farm all his life, called the decision made by Victoria's Department of Health to issue a public health warning against raw milk after the death of a three-year-old  and serious illness of four others was blamed on the product, a 'beat up'. 'So far there is no proof of the bacteria being found in the milk… one child dies and four are sick but the headlines say it's from different brands, so it's not even a case of food poisoning… it's one child out of thousands getting sick,' Mr Tyler told Daily Mail Australia. Unpasteurised cow's milk has been banned in Australia for more than 70 years but manufacturers can still sell it as a cosmetic product rather than food. Scroll down for video . South Australian dairy farmer Mark Tyler has drunk raw milk all his life and raised his three children on it too . It can be found labelled under 'bath milk' in health food stores around the country. Mr Tyler said the Department of Health's warning was part of a 'big push to try and get rid of bath milk'. Across Australia people are legally obtaining raw milk for drinking via herd shares which allow people to buy a share in a cow and then pay a farmer to board and milk the animal. They then receive the milk from 'their own cow', thus it is not being illegally sold. Mr Tyler runs a herd share programme at his Moo View Dairy farm in Willunga Hill, SA and said he has people from all walks of life investing in his cows so they can get unpasteurised milk. 'There are professional sportsmen, university professors, doctors - you name it, every profession from tradespeople to other farmers,' he said. Former AFL player Jason Porplyzia openly supports the production of raw cow's milk. The Adelaide Crows star, who retired in October, part owns a cow at Moo View Diary which means he can drink his own unpasteurised milk direct from the farm. The Australia Alliance for Raw Milk is just one action group that helps people who want to drink raw milk . A child died after allegedly drinking Mountain View Organic bath milk, which is clearly labelled not for human consumption (right) Mr Tyler won a landmark District Court Ruling in February – after his farm was raided in May 2013 - that means he can continue to supply unpasteurised milk to people who have a share in his herd. People pay $30 for a share in the cows and for $4 a week they are entitled to about 1.5 litres of milk. Porplyzia spoke about his decision to drink raw milk instead of protein powders post workout last year. 'I use it after weights sessions, I know a lot of the other boys get stuck into their protein powders ... but I decided that sort of thing wasn't for me,' he said. 'I don't mean to boast but I do pretty well in the gym and I think part of that is due to consuming raw milk. 'I also like the fact that I know where the milk is coming from.' Mr Tyler, who started his cowshare programme in 2008, believes the government banned unpasteurised milk as a way to control the dairy market and to support 'big business'. When this picture of a bath milk product was posted on Facebook and described as nutritious one women said: 'Love this stuff. Great in the bath,' followed by a winking emoji . Some of the comments on the Facebook group that supports raw milk show how passionate people are about the illegal product . 'The more you look into it the more you realise how little facts there are about raw milk and there are problems with pasteurised milk. 'I think most of this is big business wanting to control what consumers have access to… it's good for supermarkets and long shelf-lives but the more you look the more you see people having health issues with pasteurised milk.' Mr Tyler is confident that raw milk is safe if produced in the right way. 'I've drunk raw milk all my life, I always lived on this farm. I drunk it here and certainly our children have grown up on it . 'Our parents used to sell it and the locals used to come but then the government banned that,' Mr Tyler explained. In recent years the dairy farmer has noticed a surge in demand for raw milk as part of the raw food movement. Advocates claim it is more nutritious, easier to digest and contains probiotics - and that it's better for cows and farms. 'There's a much greater interest in food and where it comes from… I think that's anti-processed food in general but probably leading that is raw milk.' Ruth Miller, who appeared on the ABC's 7.30 Report, gives her nine-year-old daughter Hail Miller (pictured) who was once lactose intolerance raw milk. Hail says: 'My eczema went away... and I felt a lot more light' AFL player Jason Porplyzi, who played for the Adelaide Crows star but retired in October, part owns a cow at Moo View Diary which means he can drink his own unpasteurised milk direct from the 30 cows on the farm . Many people who drink unpasteurised milk believe that pasteurised milk is unhealthy . Mr Tyler called mass dairy farming practises into question. This photo shows an unrelated dairy farm in Queensland . Mr Tyler says he limits the risk of harmful bacteria – such as E.coli - associated with unpasteurised milk and that pasteurising laws put in place 70-years-ago are now outdated. 'We've got a very modern milking machine – the dangers that were there when pasteurising came in is a world apart from modern dairy equipment,' he said. Milk isn't squeezed into buckets surrounded by flies with 'cows flicking manure everywhere' anymore, he said, so 'the situation is so different.' He also believes the pasteurisation process has some issues. 'There are modern factors in commercial dairy farms that need to be avoided, like the massive 700 cow diaries where there is lots more mud, so many cows bogging up around the troughs and a lot more bacteria. 'The feeds that are potential carriers of bacteria… a lot of big farms will have feed chopped up and a dead rat will get in it… where as if they just eat grass and hay and grain without anything foreign that limits the sources of bacteria.' Mr Tyler's views are directly at odds to those of the Department of Health. Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Rosemary Lester (left) has warned Australian's not to drink raw milk. While Joan (right) appeared on the ABC earlier this year to show her support of Mr Tyler's raw milk . Mr Tyler won a landmark District Court Ruling in February – after his farm was raided in May 2013 - that means he can continue to supply unpasteurised milk to people who have a share in his herd . Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Rosemary Lester said that raw milk can affect the kidneys and the bloodstream and cause watery diarrhoea. 'Only a small number of these pathogens are needed to cause illness,' she said. Dr Lester noted that bath milk packaging is very similar to that of drinking milk, and the products could be easily confused. She explained the pathogens in raw milk can make anyone sick but risks are greatest for young children, elderly, pregnant or otherwise unhealthy people. 'Since the 1940s it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia,' Dr Lester said. Food Safety Information Council spokesperson Lydia Buchtmann told Daily Mail Australia that in pasteurised milk 'the heat treatment kills any bacteria in the milk making it a very safe product that is very unusual to have any food poisoning from.' She explained it is illegal to sell raw milk for human consumption. 'There are a few raw cheeses that have been approved but they have to go through rigorous testing'. She argued: 'However cleanly you are milking your cow, bacteria will get in because cows are animals… it will be contaminated from the faeces which can cause E.coli - a major cause of 4.1 million cases of food poisoning each year.' Ms Buchtmann said children are at a particular risk from raw milk because their immune system hasn't fully developed yet. 'A child can be healthy and food poisoning can still be very serious… our advice is don't consume it is a health risk.' Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young has also urged Queenslanders not to drink raw milk 'as it is unfit for human consumption'. Dr Young said the raw milk was sold in Australia as a cosmetic product, usually as ‘bath milk’. 'As bath milk is not for human consumption it is not a food and therefore not bound by the labelling requirements of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code,' Dr Young said. 'I have previously issued warnings about consuming this product, and it has been proven that the risks are substantial,' Dr Young said. The child's death will appear in front of the State Coroner.","Victoria's Department of Health have issued a public health warning against raw milk after the death of a three-year-old in Melbourne .

"The kingfisher is one of our shyest and most elusive birds, despite its eye-catching plumage. And it appears art has imitated life in this John Constable painting. Experts were astonished to find one of the birds depicted in the centre of The Mill Stream after it was cleaned for the first time in over 100 years. Decades of accumulated grime and discoloured varnish had hidden the small but obviously important feature, portrayed in a splash of blue and red as it darts through the air in the shadow of some trees. John Constable's painting of The Mill Stream had accumulated decades of grime and the varnish discoloured . After a spruce up on its 200th anniversary it was revealed that a kingfisher had been hidden for years and can now be seen, circled . A close-up of the image reveals how the kingfisher was painted with splashes of red and blue paint . The 1814 painting shows a view of Willy Lott’s cottage at Flatford near East Bergholt, Suffolk – the same spot used seven years later in Constable’s best-known masterpiece, The Hay Wain. The find emerged during an operation to spruce up the oil painting on its 200th anniversary. It has now been rehung at the Wolsey Gallery in Christchurch Mansion, Ipswich, which has the largest collection of Constables outside London. Robert Entwhistle, conservation officer with Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service, said the kingfisher was the most significant find during the conservation process. ‘The kingfisher was one of the elements that became more visible once the cleaning began,’ he added. John Constable's most famous painting, The Hay Wain, was painted in the same spot in Suffolk . ‘It is only a very small element of the painting but one we had no idea was there before we began the cleaning process. ‘It is only a blur of red and blue in the middle of the painting but one that Constable obviously thought was important.’ Other discoveries included the ghostly image of two other birds near the middle of the painting that the artist decided to paint over. A chimney on the house was also moved. The kingfisher was first spotted by conservator Rosalind Whitehouse, who spent a month restoring the painting by painstakingly removing layer by layer the dirt and coatings of varnish that had been applied over the years. She noticed the unexpected addition while comparing the original to an enhanced digital photograph. ‘The painting had not been cleaned for probably over 100 years and the old varnish had become so yellow and dark that the painting’s colours were hidden,’ she said. ‘In the light of all the great Constable paintings that have been cleaned in recent years in public collections, this one was suffering by comparison. ‘The cool sky colours and clear definition of the beautifully painted trees are now visible, as is the sense of depth in the picture space which had been flattened out by the varnish.’ Constable, who was born in 1776, is known mainly for his paintings of Dedham Vale, the area around his home now known as Constable Country. Despite being one of Britain’s best-loved artists he struggled financially throughout his career and was not elected to the Royal Academy until he was 52. He died in 1837. A kingfisher's vivid colour is due to iridescence caused by different wavelengths of light . The common kingfisher’s vivid colour is due to iridescence, caused by different wavelengths of light reflected from different layers of feathers. It’s natural pigment is dark brown. The bird is highly territorial about its stretch of river as it has to eat close to its own body weight of fish and insects every day. It doesn’t have a song to match its spectacular plumage. Instead, it generally emits short, sharp whistles. Less than a third of the British population has seen a kingfisher. Only half of fledglings survive the first fortnight on their own. Many become waterlogged and drown during their first dives into water for food. The Dusun tribe in Borneo considered the Oriental dwarf kingfisher to be a bad omen. Warriors who spotted one on the way to battle return home.","The 1814 painting by John Constable had been gathering decades of grime .

"A millionaire oil executive who was forced to hand over his £2million London townhouse to his ex-wife 'deserved everything he got', an appeal judge has ruled. Dr Hussain Rabia, 60, tried to hide his true wealth in a bitter divorce battle by claiming he had no interest in an offshore consultancy business, which was said to be raking in huge profits. But a family judge ruling on his divorce to ex-wife Azhar, 40, said Dr Rabia's denials about his wealth were 'manifestly untrue' and designed to conceal the real extent of his fortune. Dr Hussain Rabia, left, who has been forced to hand over his £2million London townhouse to his ex-wife Azhar, right, in a divorce battle after he tried to hide his true wealth . It led to the couple's former matrimonial home, a £2million five-bed house in affluent Ealing, west London being handed to his ex-wife. Dr Rabia appealed claiming the result was that his ex-wife had received more than her fair share of the family’s £3million-plus fortune. But his case was thrown out by Appeal Court judge Lord Justice McFarlane, who said Dr Rabia had taken the risk of concealing his financial affairs and lost. He said: ‘There has been a wholesale failure by the husband to provide any meaningful disclosure in the proceedings. ‘A husband who chooses to approach the litigation in the way this husband did has to run the risk of inferences being drawn against him.’ Dr Rabia separated from his wife in 2012 after a 14-year marriage, during which they had three children, all now of school age. Battle: The fight was over this £2m house in Ealing, west London, which was awarded to Dr Rabia's ex-wife . He had worked as an engineer for British Gas, but took early retirement in 1998 and set up a consultancy, and later the business, Entrac Petroleum Ltd. But when the divorce reached court last year, he refused to reveal full details of the company’s dealings outside of the UK. His barrister, Valentine Le Grice QC, admitted at the Court of Appeal that although Dr Rabia had disclosed the business in the UK, he ‘did not disclose’ its more profitable work in the Middle East. Criticising Dr Rabia as a witness in October last year, the family judge, Judge Isobel Plumstead, said she was ‘fully sceptical about his reliability’. She said the business was ‘substantial’ and held sizeable assets in offshore accounts. But appealing today, Mr Le Grice argued that there was insufficient evidence on which Judge Plumstead could find that there was more money which Dr Rabia could lay his hands on. Mr Le Grice said: ‘The judge’s order did not produce an equal, or even broadly equal, division of the family resources.' But rejecting his case, Lord Justice McFarlane said Dr Rabia’s ‘stoic non-disclosure’ had left his ex-wife’s lawyers ‘painstakingly putting together a jigsaw puzzle’ to get to the bottom of what his true assets were. The case was thrown out at the Court of Appeal by judge Lord Justice McFarlane, who said Dr Rabia had taken the risk of concealing his financial affairs and lost . He said: ‘It is entirely proper for a court facing stoic non-disclosure such as this to consider drawing adverse inferences against the party failing to come clean.’ He rejected Dr Rabia’s appeal bid and refused him permission to challenge the order that he pay £140,000 towards his ex-wife’s legal costs of the case. Speaking afterwards, Mrs Rabia said: ‘The decision by the Court of Appeal to uphold the judgment reinforces the faith that I have always had that there is real justice for everyone in this country. ‘I feel that I have been treated fairly by the court, given everything that I have been through over recent years.’ Her solicitor Julian Ribet, of family law firm Levison Meltzer Pigott, said: ‘Pivotal to this case was the husband’s actions in trying to conceal the extent of his wealth from the court and his wife. ‘In doing so, Dr Rabia has not only wasted a significant amount of judicial and court time – a valuable resource; in addition he has shown himself to be contemptuous of the very process which is designed to deliver a fair decision in such proceedings. ‘In dismissing his appeal and upholding the heavy costs penalty, the court has given a strong message that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated.’","Dr Hussain Rabia tried to hide his true wealth in divorce from wife Azhar .

"The Adelaide parents of a four-year-old boy who was found just days from death after being locked in his filthy room and fed under the door have been jailed for at least six years. Judge Paul Cuthbertson said what they did to their own flesh and blood was a 'disgrace', noting a doctor described the boy as looking like a concentration camp victim. The 28-year-old father and 24-year-old mother pleaded guilty in the South Australian District Court to an aggravated charge of endangering the life of their son, who weighed just 8.3 kilograms when found by police. Scroll down for video . The father and mother of a four-year-old boy have been sentenced to a maximum of eight years' prison for the severe neglect of their son . They only happened to find the malnourished, dehydrated and shivering child when his mother called police to the Adelaide home complaining she had been assaulted by the boy's father. The boy, who had been locked in his filthy room, was naked and crouched on the floor when he was found in October last year. Judge Cuthbertson said most of the animal kingdom did a better job looking after their offspring than the couple did with their son. The medical officer who examined the boy described him as having sunken eyes, brown and decayed teeth, and protruding ribs. He gave 'the most distressing squeal I have ever heard in my life'. 'His hips were like someone from the Dachau concentration camp,' the officer said. The judge set a maximum term of eight years. Images of roast lamb and a chocolate dessert posted by the starving boy's mother as he was locked in his bedroom and fed under the door . Police were called to the Adelaide house because the mother reported she was being attacked by her spouse. The Adelaide house was covered in rotten food and litter. Here, the toilet is surrounded by used toilet paper . Police had to wade through the rubbish and found the malnourished boy who weighed just 8.3 kilograms . Earlier this year, the court heard the mother of the boy was 'too busy having sex' to properly care for her son. The 24-year-old woman told police she was preoccupied with her partner and put him before her toddler. 'I've messed up, I've done the wrong thing. I know I shouldn't have thought about my man before my son,"" she said, Channel 9 reported. 'I didn't associate with my child like I should have, instead I was too busy having sex with [her partner].' The court also heard during the pair's sentencing hearing in October, the mother posted pictures to social media of her meals and dishes she had just cooked as her son starved in his bedroom. He was fed under his locked door and lived in a small room full of soiled nappies, pictures were posted on Facebook of her first attempt at cooking a roast lamb and a melted chocolate dessert, according to Channel 9. Doctors said the boy’s dehydration level was at 10 per cent and was two days away from reaching a critical level of 15 per cent. As for the young victim, who is now in foster care, the court heard he still hides food in his pockets, hates doors being closed and is not yet toilet trained. Cans of energy drink and food wrappers fill the room as investigators wade through the squalor . Since being removed from his parents a year ago, the boy has had a significant number of decayed teeth removed and has limited language skills. He cannot tolerate doors being closed and cannot control his emotions, sometimes punching himself in the head or running into walls. A victim impact statement, compiled by authorities and the boy's foster parents, was read out during the October hearing. The victim impact statement said normal family outings were obviously new to the boy, who would not come out of his room for the first six months after his removal. When he woke up, he would lie in his bed waiting for someone to come into his room. In an earlier police interview, the father said the boy was kept in his bedroom for 12 days and never complained about being fed under the door. 'We actually fed him pretty much every day, in that room, by sliding the plates under there, so far as we could hear, he was happy,' the boy's father said.

"Poland's former democracy leader Lech Walesa has broken his leg - and landed in a hospital where a fellow patient is a communist-era official involved in directing the 1981 crackdown that put him in prison. Walesa, 71, the founder of the Solidarity trade union and a former president of Poland, broke his right leg on Tuesday while leaving a church in his hometown of Gdansk. A photo he posted on his blog shows Walesa in his hospital bed with his broken leg raised and in a cast. Lech Walesa, a former president of Poland and democracy campaigner during the 1980s, pictured in hospital with a broken leg . Walesa pictured with British Prime Minister Sir John Major (left) in 1992, and with Pope John Paul II in 1989 . Polish media on Wednesday highlighted the irony of him being in the same Gdansk hospital as General Czeslaw Kiszczak, who as interior minister in 1981 played a key role in imposing martial law. The hospital's doctors are examining Kiszczak, 89, to determine whether he is strong enough to stand trial for his role in communist-era repressions. Kiszczak has said that he is too sick to appear in court, but tabloids have shown photos of him this year vacationing and apparently in decent form. Walesa was a key figure in Poland's transformation from a member of the Soviet bloc to an independent post-communist nation. An engineer and electrician by trade, shortly after beginning work at the shipyard in Gdansk, Poland (then known as Lenin Shipyard), he came a vocal dissident and worker rights campaigner, and established the Soviet bloc's first trade union, Solidarity. Lech Walesa (pictured in 2005) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 for his campaigning in Poland . Lech Walesa was a fierce workers' rights campaigner. Here he is pictured in 2006 (left) on the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Solidarity movement, and right, addressing a crowd during the heyday of his activism in 1989 . During this time he operated in fierce opposition to the Polish communist leadership, which included Kiszczak, who is currently being treated in the same hospital as Walesa. Kiszczak was instrumental in overseeing martial law throughout Poland from 1981 - 1983. Walesa's staunch advocacy of worker rights led to him being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and he was later President from 1990 to 1995, where he helped oversee the country's transition through privatization and to a free-market economy.","Poland's Nobel Peace Prize winner bedridden in hospital with broken leg .

Soaked: After trying to take the picture on the Blackpool promenade yesterday, she was left utterly soaked . Splash: The woman is among the thrill seekers risking their lives on the coast to take 'weather bomb selfies' The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has issued guidance urging people to stay away from huge waves which ‘could be carrying rocks or other debris that has been churned up along the way’. Weather warnings were in place for much of the UK today but the mainland has so far survived relatively unscathed by the Atlantic ‘weather bomb’ - formally known as an ‘explosive cyclogenesis’. The Met Office has severe weather warnings out for wind in the North and Scotland today, and in the South tomorrow. Tomorrow, there is an ice and snow warning for the North and Scotland. An MCA spokesman told MailOnline today: 'In some parts of the country, conditions on the sea and along the coast are extremely treacherous with gale-force winds, large waves and heavy rain.

'Don't take risks': The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has issued guidance urging people to stay away from huge waves which ‘could be carrying rocks or other debris that has been churned up along the way’. 'The Coastguard's advice is simple: don't take risks. The crashing waves may be spectacular to watch but they are also extremely dangerous. 'They could quite easily sweep you off your feet, and they could be carrying rocks or other debris that has been churned up along the way. If you are taking photos of the sea, take care, a great photo is not worth risking your life for. 'If you do get into difficulty, or spot someone who might be in trouble, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard.' Selfies also came under fire earlier this year when Team Sky rider Geraint Thomas warned British crowds taking the photographs were endangering the safety of riders at the Tour de France.","People pictured taking weather selfies in Blackpool and Northern Ireland .

"Pamela Winterburn, 44, hanged herself in a field close to her home in Soham, Cambridgeshire, after her employer treated her with a 'lack of compassion' A stable girl who was left 'devastated' when she was laid off by one of Sheikh Mohammed's yards killed herself after being 'bullied' and 'belittled' by her new employers, an inquest heard. Pamela Winterburn, 44, hanged herself in a field close to her home in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in July after staff treated her with 'a lack of compassion'. An inquest heard how she walked out of trainer Hugo Palmer's yard in Newmarket, Suffolk, in April, after a colleague had called her lazy. She had previously been  forced to take redundancy from Darley Stud, in Newmarket, a thoroughbred breeding operation founded by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Miss Winterburn, who once looked after Sir Henry Cecil's Classic-winning filly Ramruma, was 'bullied and frightened' and 'constantly belittled, sworn at and made to feel small', the inquest heard. The day after her death, her mother Lyn Marshall confronted Mr Palmer and the inquest heard he allegedly told her: 'What the bloody hell do you want me to do about it?' Miss Winterburn, who had taken a small overdose after losing her job at Darley Stud, left behind a note detailing the care of her horses. Concluding a verdict of suicide at the inquest in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, Coroner William Morris said Miss Winterburn's various employers 'lacked compassion'. He said: 'This was a very distressing matter. I have heard evidence that Miss Winterburn was bullied and that certainly sounds credible evidence. 'She felt she had no option but to walk out of her job. I think she was dealt with by her various employers with a lack of compassion.' The coroner heard how Miss Winterburn was devastated when she was forced to take redundancy from Darley Stud and was out of work for more than a year. She tried to fight the redundancy and took the case to the Houses of Parliament, arguing that long-term staff were being replaced by migrant workers. She took a small overdose when her attempts for justice fell on deaf ears, the coroner was told. A Darley spokesman confirmed Miss Winterburn worked for the stables' pre-training operation and left in May 2012. He said he would not comment on former employees except to say they were 'very saddened by the events that unfolded earlier this year.' He added: '97 per cent of Darley employees are EU nationals and no migrant workers were taken on after she left.' Miss Winterburn went on to get a job with Hugo Palmer but walked off the yard on April 22 after the head stable girl accused her of being lazy, an inquest heard. Miss Winterburn, pictured, walked out of trainer Hugo Palmer's yard in Newmarket, in April, after a colleague had called her lazy, an inquest heard. The coroner said that she had been treated with a 'lack of compassion' Miss Winterburn, who worked at the yard for 14 months, burst into tears and said she was having a nervous breakdown before leaving. The next day she contacted Mr Palmer to ask about going back and was told her job had been given to a boy because she had left. But Mrs Marshall, 63, said her daughter had not intended to leave her job, she had just had enough. Miss Winterburn sought help through the National Association of Stable Staff and the inquest heard an opinion expressed that she was wrongly advised to get another job. She was then offered a job the same day 'out of the blue' by another trainer Ed Walker - but three weeks later was told she was no longer needed. Feeling as though there was 'something wrong with her' she became 'actively suicidal' and hanged herself in the field near her home in Soham, Cambridgeshire, on July 21. Miss Winterburn once looked after Sir Henry Cecil's Classic-winning filly Ramruma (right). She was also laid off by Darley Stud, a breeding stable founded by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (left), in 2012 . Neighbour Julie Tenney, 57, told the hearing she was 'constantly belittled, sworn at and made to feel small' and someone should have helped her. She said: 'She was thrilled to bits when she got the job with Hugo Palmer, she was thrilled to be working with horses again and she loved the job, but she was always very anxious going in because there was an issue of bullying. 'She told me she was constantly belittled, sworn at and made to feel small. 'I think Pam's fight or flight kicked in on the day she walked out, she just had to get away from the situation, she went around the corner and sobbed her heart out, but nobody went to her. Former employer: Trainer Hugo Palmer declined to comment on the evidence the inquest heard . 'I saw her that night, she was trembling, she was shaking and she was crying, she was worried about her job, I pretty much told her to leave as no job was worth it. 'If Hugo Palmer had done his job as an employer, if someone had listened to Pam, put their arm round her and said we can help you with this, she would still be here today.' Miss Winterburn also sought help from the British Horseracing Association but Simone Seyer of Racing Welfare explained they could not get involved in employment issues. On the day she died, Miss Winterburn had been packing her home ready to move in with her mum in Yorkshire, and had already organised transport for her horses. George McGrath, chief executive of the National Association of Stable Staff (NASS), said he believes there is an element of bullying in horse racing. He said: 'There is an element of bullying in horseracing because it generally attracts a younger generation of people fresh out of school who are a bit more susceptible to it. 'But I would not call it an epidemic and we do our best to stamp it out.' Speaking about Miss Winterburn's case, he added: 'We did not give bad advice, we gave advice which was truthful. 'We just give employment law advice so we forwarded her onto Racing Welfare. 'We spent a lot of time speaking to her and helping her resolve her employment law issues and we explored every avenue we could. 'But it was clear Pam needed specialist help so we put her in contact with Racing Welfare. 'We do not advise people to leave their jobs and we did not advise Pam to leave hers.' A spokesman for Racing Welfare said: 'We were very sad to hear of Pamela's death. She was seen by members of our Welfare Team on a number of occasions, as outlined during the inquest. 'We helped and supported her as much as possible and, when her needs fell outside of our remit, we advised her with regard to seeking help elsewhere or approaching other agencies. 'Our sympathy at this time is very much with Pam's family and her friends. Miss Winterburn was left 'devastated' after she was forced to take redundancy from Darley Stud (above) 'Racing Welfare support is available to all members of racing's workforce, and their families, both through our regional Welfare Offices and our 24-hour Helpline.' A British Horseracing Authority (BHA) spokesman said: 'We are aware of the sad circumstances involving Pamela Winterburn. She contacted several organisations, including BHA, earlier this year. 'We spoke to her at length and listened to her concerns, and tried to help her by ensuring she was receiving the correct support from the relevant bodies. 'Reports of bullying in stables are very rare indeed. No specific allegations of bullying were made to BHA in this case. 'If there are legitimate concerns raised about practices in a yard BHA will always look into them.' Trainer Hugo Palmer today declined to comment on the evidence the inquest heard. Fellow trainer Ed Walker said he was unavailable to comment on the case.","Pamela Winterburn, 44, hanged herself in field in Soham, Cambridgeshire .

"Two British Olympic sailing silver medallists  were violently mugged at knife-point in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday - where they have been practising ahead of the city's 2016 games. Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark were targeted as they walked from the sailing club back to their hotel in what they described as a 'bad area' of Rio. The athletes, who took silver in the Women's 470 class at London 2012, spoke of the terrifying incident on Facebook, saying they were pushed around by two men both wielding 7in knives - with the muggers even stealing the lycra they train in. 'Shaken up': British Olympic sailing silver medallists Hannah Mills (right) and Saskia Clark were robbed at knife point in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday . They wrote on Facebook: 'Our delightful walk back from the sailing club to the hotel turned fairly nasty when two guys wielding 7inch knives ran at us, pushed us around and grabbed everything we had. 'Along with the things that were actually worth something, the most annoying thing right now is our lycra we were sailing in got taken....unbelievable!! 'Anyway, we made it back to the hotel slightly shaken but all okay.' Jo Aleh, who won gold in the Women's 470 sailing class at London 2012, replied to the post saying: 'Glad you are okay! We've all been warned so much about it, but a little freaky when the warnings are true!' Rio will be the first South American city to host the Olympics but there are concerns over safety and the quality of the sailing conditions - with many athletes calling the water filthy.

Training: The talented pair were photographed in action in Rio de Janeiro in August this year . Winning bronze in this year's World Championships in Santander in September meant Team GB qualify for the 470 women's category in Rio in 2016. Ms Mills later referred to Wednesday's experience as horrible and added that the area is known for being dangerous. Speaking to WalesOnline, she said: 'We are pretty shaken up. It takes time to get over something like this. The British sailing team broke news of their terrifying ordeal to friends on Facebook .

'We are staying positive and looking forward to continue training out here. It's quite a big wake-up call to the reality of being in Rio and what it's like in certain places.' But she added that their experience of the city had so far been overwhelmingly positive.","Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark targeted on way from sailing club to hotel .

"An audio recording allegedly detailing the final hours accused killer Gable Tostee spent with Warriena Wright before she plunged off his balcony to her death has been leaked online. The 199-minute file was uploaded onto a Canadian website before it is due to be tendered in court in Tostee's murder trial, the Brisbane Times reported. This comes after a post on a bodybuilder forum written by a person claiming to be Tostee has been taken down. Scroll down for video . Under the user name of 'GT', a person on a bodybuilding forum has defended accused murderer Gable Tostee . In the post, user 'GT' defended the 28-year-old over the death of Ms Wright. Tostee was charged with the murder of New Zealand bank clerk Warriena Wright who fell 14 storeys from his Gold Coast apartment balcony in August after meeting him on online dating app Tinder. In the forum post GT denied that he tried to delete an audio recording made on the night Ms Wright died, adding that he often recorded his 'drunk' nights. 'That night, the police seized my phone and my parents' phones, where they found the recording,' he wrote. 'While I did not expect them to seize it, it is completely untrue that I tried to delete it, as it proved what happened. 'I regularly made audio recordings of my drunk nights on the town in case something happened. I kept them for myself but didn't need to listen to them 99% of the time. It's so easy to do using a smartphone and comes at such a small cost, and sometimes the recordings have been invaluable.' GT also addressed 'fabricated stories about me having cameras to film ""homemade porn"", explaining he had two cameras in his apartment for security purposes only. '[The cameras] came in handy for example when I was able to retrieve my wallet from a girl who stole it,' he said. Tostee was remanded in custody but was released last month on strict bail conditions which require him to live with his parents in Carrara, keep off Tinder, stay off Facebook, not drink alcohol and adhere to a nightly curfew. Tostee is accused of throwing Warriena Wright off his apartment balcony on the Gold Coast in August . Ms Wright was a bank clerk and had travelled to Australia for a friend's wedding when she died . In the lengthy post online GT also defended Tostee, saying there have been many 'misconceptions and untruths' that have been circulating in the media and the public about his involvement. They also posted several pictures claiming to be from inside Tostee's apartment. One of the photographs show a tanning machine he owns on the Avalon Apartments balcony on Orchid Avenue, which has spectacular views over Surfers Paradise. GT added he had been left distraught after Ms Wright's death and believed his silence on the topic had done more harm than good. 'Knowing I was the last person to be with her, it has left me permanently scarred and not a day passes that I don't wish I could go back in time and prevent it,' GT wrote. 'For at least a week after it happened I was so overwhelmed I was unable to laugh or even crack a smile. 'I broke down in tears several times a day, or whenever I saw her picture in the news. 'Even though I had only known her for a night I was horrified that this had happened to her. I would never wish for it to happen to anybody.' GT said he sympathised with Ms Wright's family and it pained him to think of them. 'While I have not had the chance to meet or speak to Warriena's family, it pains me to think of the loss and suffering they must be experiencing,' he wrote. Along with the posts, GT posted photos of what is believed to be Tostee's balcony overlooking Surfers Paradise . Tostee's case is set to be mentioned in January after he was released on strict bail conditions in November . The Avalon Apartments is where Ms Wright fell to her death in August from the 14th floor . GT also slammed news outlets for the coverage of the case, describing it as 'disgraceful'. 'They have no respect for the dignity of the people involved,' he said. 'A young woman had died and they needed a villain. My silence only fuelled peoples' imagination, and the media did everything they could to exploit that, including lying and misleading. 'They did everything they could to establish me as an evil monster, a portrayal which could not be further from the truth.' Tostee has always maintained his innocence in Ms Wright's death and was released from custody last month . Queensland police have confirmed they know of the post's existence and were looking to confirm if it was Tostee . Queensland police have told news.com.au they knew of the post's existence and were looking to confirm if it was in fact Tostee. But Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said: 'It does not appear to be a breach of any bail condition.' If GT is in fact Tostee, this would not be the first time he has reached out on social media. During his time in custody, the 28-year-old posted a message to family and friends on Facebook - including an address for them to post letters to him. 'To all my friends and those who have been supporting me, I want to thank you and say that I miss you all,' he wrote from jail. 'I have been in custody for almost a month now for a crime I did not commit and have lost contact with almost everyone. 'I maintain my absolute innocence and hope that this nightmare will be over soon.' Queensland police say this post would not breach his bail conditions imposed by the court . If GT is in fact Tostee, it is not the first time he has used social media to maintain his innocence . Tostee's case will be mentioned in January. Until he faces trial, which is expected to be next year, Tostee cannot drive, is banned from carousing on the Surfers Paradise nightclub strip and it not allowed after dark. After he walked free from jail, Daily Mail Australia obtained a letter that was part of his desperate bid to be released . In the handwritten note scrawled on a lined A4 piece of paper, Gable Tostee apologised for drink driving and admits to 'drowning myself with alcohol'. The letter was penned at Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in a scrappy style with occasional spelling errors and includes an admission by Tostee that 'I have a problem with binge drinking' and that he has put people's lives at risk. Tostee specifically apologises for drinking in the early hours of July 27 when he was caught drink driving by police, saying it was the 'wake-up call I needed'.

"A Washington mother has given birth to a baby boy weighing a whopping 14 pounds and 11 ounces. Francisco Leon Ortiz, who was delivered by c-section at Grays Harbor Community Hospital in Aberdeen on December 2, was so large that his dad had to run out and buy new clothes for him because he didn't fit into any newborn clothes they had at the ready. Large babies are often the result of gestational diabetes, but his mother, Yessica Ortiz Delgado, had no such issues through her pregnancy, said David Quigg, the hospital's director of public relations. He added that her two other children were about 12 pounds each at birth so she expected another large baby - but doctors had thought Francisco would be 13 pounds at the most. Shock: Yessica Ortiz Delgado looks at her son, Francisco Leon Diaz, who was born weighing a whopping 14 pounds and 11 ounces at Grays Harbor Community Hospital in Washington last week . After seeing his son, the baby's father, Francisco Leon Diaz, had to go and buy new clothes for the boy because they did not have any big enough. The hospital has spare clothing to give newborn babies, but none of that fitted Francisco either, Quigg said. Some of the nurses kindly went out and bought him a few items too. Francisco was initially in the ICU but headed home on Tuesday. Both mother and son are doing well, but the newborn will have to visit another, less rural hospital for further check ups. The Birth Center at Grays Harbor Community Hospital delivers around 550 babies a year, but the experience was new to them. 'We deliver babies of all sizes, but it is not every day that we deliver and care for a baby as large as Francisco,' hospital director Barbara Connett told the Grays Harbor Talk. His birth came a day after Colorado resident Alisha Hernandez gave birth to daughter Mia Yasmin Garcia, who weighed 13 pounds, 13 ounces. Early Christmas present: Baby Francisco, who was photographed at the hospital in Aberdeen, Washington when he was four days old, has now returned home with his mother and is doing well, staff said . On seeing the news reports, Quigg said that staff at Grays Harbor joked: 'We've got a baby bigger than that here!' Newborns weight 7.5 pounds on average at birth - but baby Francisco is not the largest ever born. The largest baby ever recorded was born in Canada to mother Anna Bates in 1879, a boy weighing 23 pounds 12 ounces, but he died 11 hours later. In 2005, a Brazilian woman gave birth to a 17lb baby boy named Admilton dos Santos. He was mother Francisca's fifth child and it is thought that his size was caused by gestational diabetes. Francisco Leon Diaz was born just one day after Colorado resident Alisha Hernandez welcomed another big bundle, her daughter Mia Yasmin Garcia, who weighed 13 pounds, 13 ounces. Mia, who was born by caesarean section at the San Luis Valley Hospital on December 1, shocked nurses, who thought she would weigh around seven pounds. Her father Francisco Garcia told 9News: 'They're all shocked that they're seeing a baby like that. They opened their eyes like they've never seen a baby like that. 'The nurse, she was shocked. She's like ""Come here! Come here! Come here!"" I went and I'm like, what happened? She's like, well check out this! I checked it, and it was 13 pounds and 13 ounces.' Mr Garcia explained that all of the couple's other children were all born at normal weights and even the combined weight of their twins at birth was lower than Mia. After her birth, Mia was flown to a Denver-area hospital after suffering from low glucose levels, but doctors said they hoped she would be at home with her four older sisters Britney, Ximena, Yulissa and Yuliana at home within the next week. Oh baby! Mia Yasmin Garcia was born weighing 13 pounds, 13 ounces in Colorado on December 1 .","Francisco Leon Ortiz stunned doctors when he was born weighing a whopping 14 pounds and 11 ounces on December 2 .

"Angelina Romero-Alvarez, 50, was shot dead in a parking lot outside her home in Houston, on December 5 . A grandmother who was gunned down for her purse by two men in a random attack did not even have any money to steal. Angelina Romero-Alvarez, 50, was found dead in a parking lot outside her home in Houston, on December 5, by a neighbor. Now, investigators believe the men responsible for her murder may also be involved in nine other robberies on the city's south side in the past month. Mrs Romero-Alvarez had been about to enter her car outside the Wilcox apartment complex in the 2400 block of South Loop West near Kirby at around 7am when her purse was taken and her attackers then shot her dead. But her family that she was murdered for no reason - as she had no money on her when she was killed. Her son Jose Gonzalez said the death has not only damaged his family, but also the community, Click2Houston reported. He said: 'My mom was a great woman, a hard-working person.' Sergeant Warren Meeler, of Houston Police Department, added: 'This senseless act by this cowardly individual is horrible, and we want justice for her family. Scroll down for video . Mrs Romero-Alvarez's son Jose, pictured, said her murder has affected the whole community . 'Even after the suspects got a purse or got money or got something, they still shot the victims.' Police have revealed that two other women were robbed and shot the same morning as Mrs Romero-Alvarez over a two-hour period. At around 5.50am, a woman was in an apartment complex parking lot at 10201 Telephone Road when she was shot by a black man driving a white, four-door vehicle, possibly a Chevrolet Impala. Police released CCTV footage showing another attack at around 7.20 am, where a 70-year-old woman was robbed and shot by a black man, driving a white SUV in an apartment complex parking lot at 6922 South Loop East. In another incident in the same parking lot at 6922 South Loop East on November 29, a 49-year-old woman  was robbed and shot. Mrs Romero-Alvarez had been about to enter her car outside the Wilcox apartment complex in the 2400 block of South Loop West near Kirby, pictured at around 7am on December 5 when she was shot . Police said a black gunman was seen in a white, four-door vehicle with a partial Texas license plate number of BZ. Six of the nine robbery and shooting victims have been women and authorities believe at least three men are targeting Hispanic women in the early morning hours as they are head to their vehicles. The suspects are described as African-American men in their 30s, driving a white SUV or white Mercury Grand Marquis. Anyone with information in these cases is urged to contact the HPD Homicide Division at 713-308-3600 or Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS.","Angelina Romero-Alvarez, 50, was shot dead outside her home in Houston .

"Children as young as ten created the greatest treasures of the Bronze Age found near Stonehenge, historians believe. They said the ornate jewellery and ceremonial daggers are so intricate that they could only have been made by a child. The artefacts were crafted nearly 4,000 years ago, 1,000 years before the invention of the magnifying glass. Scroll down for video . Artefacts: The Bush Barrow treasures, including this gold body lozenge, were crafted during the Bronze Age . Making them took many hours of peering at tiny pieces of metal, and would have effectively blinded the young artisans, said experts. One of the finest pieces, the Bush Barrow Dagger, has a wooden handle decorated with 140,000 tiny gold studs just 1mm long and 0.2mm wide. Making it would have taken at least 2,500 hours. Ronald Rabbetts, a leading optometrist, has assessed several pieces found near Stonehenge. He said: ‘Only children and teenagers, and adults who had become myopic naturally would have been able to create such tiny objects.’ By the age of 20, jewellery workers would have seen anything more than 3ft away as just a blur, he added. The Bush Barrow Dagger dating from 1900BC was excavated 200 years ago from a burial mound filled with noblemen’s treasures 1,000 yards from Stonehenge. Secrets: The artefacts were excavated 200 years ago near the ancient stone circle in Wiltshire, pictured . But it is only now that such artefacts have been re-examined as part of a major project which is featured at 8pm tonight on BBC2 in Operation Stonehenge: What Lies Beneath. Archaeologists have unveiled 17 previously undiscovered monuments and shrines around the site in Wiltshire, meaning they now realise Stonehenge was not isolated but at the centre of a bustling complex. David Dawson is director of the Wiltshire Museum in Devizes, where the Bush Barrow treasures are on display. He said: ‘The very finest gold work involved the making and positioning of tens of thousands of tiny individually made components, each around 1mm long and 0.2mm wide.’","Ornate jewellery and daggers  crafted  4,000 years ago found in Bush Barrow .

"He flies around the world, designs all the presents, looks after the elves and checks the entire list - twice. But what would Santa Claus earn for his dutiful work if he were paid a US salary? According to a study, this year the big man would take home $139,924. Though it falls short of the $1.8 billion that a third of people believe he should earn, it is in fact a 1.5% increase on he would have got last year, up from $137,795. Scroll down for video . Busy man: Santa Claus juggles 15 jobs all year in order to make Christmas and he should earn $139,924 . In his most lucrative role as an industrial engineer - running the toy workshop - the big man would take home $116,742. Taking care of the reindeer, technically farm work, should technically merit $4,347 a year. And checking the list twice demands $537 annually, under a standard bookkeeping salary. They are three of just 15 lucrative jobs St Nick dutifully carries out year by year, according to insure.com's Santa Index 2014. The study compiles a list of each job and values each one. It includes labor negotiator (with the elves), sleigh pilot, and cookie taster - which falls under the category agricultural inspector. Finding out if you've been bad or good - and knowing exactly when you're asleep or awake - merits a private detective salary of $777 a year, if he delivers a result in 30 days. Tasks at hand: Tending to the elves and running the workshop are his most lucrative jobs, a study says . The insurance firm offered the data to 895 adults to see if they felt the salary is justified. While 29% thought it was a pittance for the king of Christmas, another 29% felt he should get paid nothing for the charity. The estimated wage is almost five times the basic salary for imitation Santas who work in malls and at kids parties. With an average wage of $20 an hour - though some get up to $300 an hour - most Santas take home $5,000 to $15,000 a season. The study notes that Santa's wage is a touch more than his trusty deputy - the stay at home mom - would earn, and almost twice that earned by a stay at home dad.","A study calculated the value of each task into a wage of $139,924 .

"Target has been heavily criticized by customers after listing a black Barbie doll on its website for two times the price of the near-identical white alternative. According to Buzzfeed, the glaring error was first brought to the attention of the retailer - and the public - by Cincinnati resident Warren Johnson, who noticed the bizarre price discrepancy when he logged onto the Target website to buy a Christmas present for his daughter. After noticing the difference in cost between the Barbie Fashion Design Maker Doll, which was until recently priced at $23.49, and the Barbie Fashion Design Maker  African-American Doll, which was priced at $49.99, the outraged 30-year-old contacted the store to ask why there was such a difference in price between the two toys. Spot the difference: Target had listed these two near-identical dolls for two very different prices, with the black version costing more than double the price of the white one . 'It rubbed me the wrong way': Cincinnati resident Warren Johnson was furious when he saw the difference in price between the two dolls . The 30-year-old spoke to three different stores and while two told him the price difference was an error, a third admitted that the white doll was cheaper because it was more popular with customers. An official spokesperson from Target's corporate office was quick to reject this theory however, but admitted that she could not give any real reason as to what could possibly make one doll so much more expensive than the other. '[The Target saleswoman] was speechless and said she really didn’t have an explanation and she was apologetic, and she told us that a change would be made,' Mr Johnson told Buzzfeed. 'Then she gave us the doll for the price that the white doll was.' He added to local Cincinnati news station WPCO: 'When my daughter asked the question ""Why is the black doll more expensive than the white doll?"" I really didn't have an answer. 'It kind of rubbed me the wrong way.' Target later released a statement blaming the shocking price discrepancy on a 'system error'. 'It is never our intention to offend our guests with our product assortment,' the spokesperson said. 'Both dolls should have reflected the same pricing, however, due to a systems issue this change did not occur. Repeat offender: Amazon currently list the black version of the doll for $49.99, more than double the price of its white counterpart . Discriminatory pricing: Online retail giant Amazon has priced this white Barbie at $17.88, which is almost a third of the price of the black alternative . 'We appreciate the guest bringing this discrepancy to our attention and have since adjusted the pricing and product detail listing. If you have any further questions about these items, please let us know.' The retailer's explanation did little to placate its outraged customers, many of whom took to Twitter to voice their anger at the error. Hundreds of people responded to Mr Johnson's original tweet, which featured a picture of the two dolls and their different price tags accompanied by the comment 'Whats wrong with this picture?' with many saying that Target should be made to undergo an official investigation. 'Target should be fined twice as much,' one user wrote, while another added: 'What is wrong with you, Target??' Shockingly, Target is not the only retailer to have made the error; Amazon is currently listing the two dolls for two completely different prices, with the white toy listed for the bargain price of $17.88, while the black option is still on sale for the full price of $49.99.","The retailer has now increased the price of the cheaper, white doll to match its black counterpart .

"A bitter Coalition row over spending cuts escalated today, as David Cameron claimed the Lib Dems are 'all over the place' on how to tackle the deficit. The Prime Minister joined the war of words as Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander said the Tories want to 'inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain' and are no longer 'economically credible'. Together with George Osborne and Nick Clegg clashing yesterday, it means the four most senior figures in the Coalition are now at odds about how to repair the nation's finances. Prime Minister David Cameron claimed the Lib Dems were 'all over the place' while Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander accused the Tories of wanting to 'inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain' Chancellor George Osborne and his Lib Dem deputy Danny Alexander, pictured leaving the Treasury last week, have clashed over how to tackle the deficit . Tensions in the coalition have mounted in the wake of Mr Osborne's mini-Budget, in which he overhauled stamp duty and targeted non-doms and foreign firms for tax rises, but also admitted dramatic spending cuts were still needed to balance the books. The Lib Dems sought to insist scrapping the 'slab' system of stamp duty had been their policy since 2007, while also claiming credit for increasing the income tax personal allowance to £10,600. Both parties signed up to billions of pounds in spending on roads, housing and flood defences. But the prospect of huge spending cuts to eradicate a deficit of £91billion has caused bitter divisions. The Tories say the money can be found entirely through spending cuts, with welfare bearing the brunt. But the Lib Dems argue a fifth of the money can be raise through extra taxes, including a mansion tax on £2million homes. Mr Alexander during the growing row with a claim that the Tories are gripped by 'pre-election panic', resorting to 'pandering to Ukip' and pursuing a policy of 'austerity for ever'. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury was last week the only senior Lib Dem to publicly back the Chancellor's spending measures in the Autumn Statement. The Tories are  furious that Vince Cable hailed the Autumn Statement as 'excellent' in a meeting for the Cabinet before criticising it in public. But writing in the Telegraph, Mr Alexander added to the criticism of the Conservatives. He said: 'The Liberal Democrat approach is to stay the course we've set in this Parliament until the job is complete in 2017-18. 'It is sad to see the Conservatives move away from the sensible, balanced approach of the Coalition, to a more doctrinaire policy that would inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain. 'A mix of unfunded tax promises, harsh spending plans and pandering to Ukip may be born of pre-election panic, but it is not economically credible.' Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the Tories had to 'come clean' about the impact of trying to eradicate the deficit from spending cuts alone . David Cameron: 'The Liberal Democrats are all over the place, unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it.' George Osborne: 'The battle lines for the general election have been drawn this week. There's a clear choice: a competent plan to stay on course to prosperity with us or a return to economic chaos with all the alternatives. It's hard to work out exactly what they (the Lib Dems) think. While they sign up to deficit reduction, they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts. 'But they shouldn't pretend to people that the sums required can be achieved by their homes tax alone. If you want higher taxes to do the heavy lifting, you'd also need to increase taxes like income tax or national insurance.' Nick Clegg: 'The Conservatives are kidding themselves and seeking to kid British voters if they are claiming that it is possible to balance the books, deliver unfunded tax cuts, shrink the state and support public services in the way that everybody wants – it just doesn't add up. The Conservatives now need to come clean.' Danny Alexander: 'It is sad to see the Conservatives move away from the sensible, balanced approach of the Coalition, to a more doctrinaire policy that would inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain. 'A mix of unfunded tax promises, harsh spending plans and pandering to Ukip may be born of pre-election panic, but it is not economically credible.' The PM waded into the row, using a letter to all Tory MPs to launch a sustained attack on the Lib Dems. Mr Cameron said their coalition partners were 'unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it'. Mr Cameron dubbed last week's Autumn Statement as 'distinctly Conservative' because it overhauled stamp duty and supported business and said voters face a clear choice 'between competence and chaos'. He wrote: 'All Labour offer is more of the same: more spending, more borrowing, more taxes, more debt … the Liberal Democrats are all over the place, unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it.' Chancellor Mr Osborne also defended his blueprint today. He told the BBC: 'We are going to have to make savings... we are going to have to cut certain welfare bills like benefits that go to working-age people. 'But the prize is economic stability, growth, jobs in the future, brighter future, I think that's a price that works for our country.' It was the Lib Dems that were 'offering ... a chaotic alternative of higher taxes, higher borrowing and a return to economic chaos' that would take Britain 'back to square one', he suggested. Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts . Yesterday Mr Osborne insisted the measure would do little to balance the books and the Lib Dems would have to use other hikes to make up the shortfall. 'It's hard to work out exactly what they (the Lib Dems) think,' Mr Osborne wrote in The Sunday Times. 'While they sign up to deficit reduction, they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts. 'But they shouldn't pretend to people that the sums required can be achieved by their homes tax alone. 'If you want higher taxes to do the heavy lifting, you'd also need to increase taxes like income tax or national insurance.' Mr Clegg responded by saying the Tories were 'kidding themselves' and voters over the 'huge' scale of cuts they would impose if they won the election. The Deputy Prime Minister also hit back at claims by Chancellor George Osborne that the Lib Dems would wreak 'economic chaos', and said the Tories would have to 'hack back' education and other services if they were to eliminate the deficit without putting up taxes. On BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Clegg said: 'I think the Conservatives are kidding themselves and seeking to kid British voters if they are claiming that it is possible to balance the books, deliver unfunded tax cuts, shrink the state and support public services in the way that everybody wants.' Mr Osborne said a Tory government would save billions on welfare, with initiatives such as restricting child benefit to the first two children in a family. He told the Sunday Times: 'While [the Lib Dems] sign up to deficit reduction, they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts.'","Lib Dem Danny Alexander said Tories were gripped by 'pre-election panic'

"Boost: Former Conservative party deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, pictured, is stepping in to offer financial support to protect dozens of burial plots of soldiers awarded the Victoria Cross . A campaign to repair and preserve hundreds of neglected graves belonging to Britain’s greatest war heroes today receives a major boost. Former Conservative party deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft is stepping in to offer financial support to protect dozens of burial plots of soldiers awarded the Victoria Cross – the most distinguished military honour – and he is urging others to follow suit. The peer, who has built up a collection of 177 VCs which is on display in London’s Imperial War Museum, said he had been distressed by a report in last week’s Daily Mail revealing how hundreds of graves have become neglected, with crumbling headstones and overgrown plots. In an article on this page, he says he will provide up to £1,000 per plot to restore the graves of any recipients of the VC whose medals are part of his collection. Lord Ashcroft’s pledge is a significant step forward for a charity which is campaigning for proper respect and honour to be given to the final resting places of war heroes. The Victoria Cross Trust has backed calls for VC graves to be given the same status as listed buildings. And, in the week of Remembrance Sunday, when the nation honours the sacrifice of those who fought for our freedom, an influential think-tank has called for new laws to protect the burial plots. A policy document by the Bow Group said the Government must act to register heroes’ burial sites and, if families agree, ensure they are looked after and given  fitting memorials. Ministers should also scrap the 75-year limit after which local authorities can dig up the graves if they choose, it says. The proposed cost would be £1.2million a year. There are 1,357 VC winners. Troops who were killed on the battlefield during the First and Second World Wars – including 377 VC winners – have their resting places tended by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The organisation also looks after the graves of nine other soldiers given the ultimate accolade – including Lieutenant Colonel Herbert ‘H’ Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay, both killed in the Falklands, and Corporal Bryan Budd, who lost his life in Afghanistan. But relatives are responsible for the upkeep of graves of VC winners who died in other conflicts or of old age. Many burial plots have fallen into neglect because family lines dwindle or descendants are unaware they exist or cannot afford to maintain them. Looked after: The Commonwealth War Graves Commission looks after this grave of  Lieutenant Colonel Herbert 'H' Jones  killed in the Falklands. But relatives are responsible for the upkeep of graves of VC winners who died in other conflicts or of old age . Lord Ashcroft says he felt ‘great disappointment and distress’ to learn that many of the graves of our war heroes have fallen into disrepair. Richard Mabey, research secretary of the Bow Group, said: ‘The UK affords no protection for those that did not fall in active service. With a lack of substantive funding, many VC graves may soon crumble or be destroyed. ‘Just as monuments to Karl Marx, Horatio Nelson and Princess Diana are protected by the state, so should those of our military heroes.’ Gary Stapleton, 45, a businessman from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, who started the Victoria Cross Trust after discovering that Lance Corporal Thomas Bryan, who won a VC for attacking a German machine-gun nest during WW1, was buried in a neglected grave in a local cemetery, said he was delighted by Lord Ashcroft’s pledge. He said his research had uncovered hundreds of examples of graves falling into disrepair. Another 78 are unmarked. Mr Stapleton said: ‘The Victoria Cross Trust has plenty of heroes – it looks like we now have a new champion. Without a shadow of a doubt, Lord Ashcroft’s offer will make a real difference. ‘Just about every single one of these graves needs some work. All  should be cleaned annually, so we’re building up a network of volunteers. We need more support and hope people will be inspired to help by what Lord Ashcroft is doing.’ Conservative MP Patrick Mercer said: ‘The Victoria Cross is our most prestigious decoration for gallantry and our fallen heroes need to have their memories preserved.’ The Victoria Cross is the highest award for gallantry that a British and Commonwealth Serviceman can achieve. It was created in 1856 during the Crimean War. Courage that defies belief... and why we owe them all a debt of gratitude . By Lord Ashcroft . Help needed: The grave of Israel Harding, pictured, is in need of renovation . Bravery, in general, and the Victoria Cross, in particular, have been two of my greatest passions for more than half a century. Some of the supreme acts of courage carried out by our servicemen in order to have been awarded the VC – Britain and the Commonwealth’s most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy – simply defy belief. It was therefore with great disappointment and distress that I read in the Daily Mail at the weekend that many of the graves of our war heroes have fallen into disrepair. The Highland Road Cemetery in Southsea, Hampshire – the cemetery containing the largest number of graves belonging to our VC heroes – is a case in point, with some headstones unsteady, covered in grime and with their inscriptions barely readable. The plight of these graves has been highlighted by the Victoria Cross Trust, a charity founded with the honourable aims to maintain memorials and graves commemorating the lives of holders of the VC. Nearly 1,000 recipients of the VC are buried in churchyards in the UK and it is many of these graves that have fallen into a pitiable state (whereas the Commonwealth War Graves Commission looks after the graves of 386 VC recipients who fell in action abroad). The concerns of the Victoria Cross Trust have now been reinforced by the findings of the Bow Group, an influential think-tank which has called on the Government to help provide an estimated £1.2million required to survey and restore the graves that have fallen into a state of disrepair. Over the past three decades, I have championed bravery, building up the largest collection of VCs in the world – now on display to the public at a gallery in the Imperial War Museum in London. I have also written four books on gallantry: the first, Victoria Cross Heroes, was published to mark the 150th anniversary of the VC being instituted by Queen Victoria in 1856. I feel protective towards the graves of those 177 men whose VCs are now in my collection. It is for this reason that I am today pledging up to £1,000 per plot to restore any of these specific graves if, for whatever reason, they have fallen into major disrepair. I hope that my pledge, so soon after Remembrance Sunday, will encourage others, including the Government and concerned groups or individuals, to find the funds to restore every derelict grave of a VC recipient to its former glory. Crumbling: Israel Harding was buried at Highland Road Cemetery, close to his birthplace, after his death in May 1917, aged 83 . Many families of fallen VC heroes have tended the graves of their loved ones for several decades. However, it is often the medal recipients from the 19th century and the First World War whose graves are now in the greatest need of restoration. Today’s descendants of these recipients may not even be aware of the bravery of yesteryear or the whereabouts of their forebears’ graves. Until the Daily Mail highlighted the case at the weekend, I was unaware that the grave of one of the VC recipients whose medals I own is apparently in need of renovation. Israel Harding was a gunner in the Royal Navy when he was awarded the VC in  September 1882 for bravery in Egypt. He was serving on HMS Alexandra during  the Anglo-Egyptian War when the city of  Alexandria was under bombardment from British warships. During the engagement, a ten-inch shell passed through the ship’s side and lodged on the main deck. Harding, who had been below deck, raced to the scene of the  danger as soon as he heard a shout that there was a live shell on board. Without thinking of his own safety, he picked up the shell and threw it into a tub of water. This prevented the shell from exploding and claiming many lives. The brave actions of Harding, then 48, were feted by his comrades and he was awarded the VC just two months after the incident. He was buried at Highland Road Cemetery, close to his birthplace, after his death in May 1917, aged 83. If my inquiries now reveal that Mr Harding’s descendants are no longer able to care for his grave then, with the blessing of the family or relevant authority, I will make the necessary funding available to carry out restoration work. And I will do the same for other graves belonging to the recipients of medals in my collection if it is shown they have fallen into a state of disrepair. Graves, like gallantry medals, should be seen as a tangible relic of someone’s courage. They should be considered as a tribute to someone who has risked, and in some cases given his life for his comrades, his sovereign or his country. As a nation, we owe every VC recipient a debt of gratitude – and also a responsibility to care for that individual’s final resting place for ever more.Lord Ashcroft KCMG PC is a Tory peer, businessmen and philanthropist.

"Aldi's Ballycastle Classic Irish Cream scooped top honours at Spirits Business Liqueur Masters 2014 . A budget £4.29 Irish Cream Liqueur from Aldi has scooped the top award at an internationally renowned drinks competition, alongside products more than triple its price . Ballycastle Irish Cream was described by judges as 'everything you'd expect from a cream liqueur – thick, creamy and luscious'. Crowned a 'Master' spirit, the budget brand's Irish Cream Liqueur went head to head with premium drinks brands at the prestigious Spirits Business Liqueur Masters 2014 awards. 'The classic Irish cream had a good balance of flavour and richness with no cloying mouthfeel, which can often be very typical of this category,' judge Pritesh Mody said. It placed alongside £17.95 bottle of Mozart Distillerie White Chocolate Cream - which was also given the coveted Master medal. Made from a blend of fresh Ballyrashane dairy cream and the triple distilled Irish whiskey, the drink was just one of Aldi's spirits to clean up. The awards are organised by The Spirits Business Magazine. Blind tastings were conducted by a panel of four: Becky Paskin of The Spirits Business Magazine; Matt Armitage, co-founder of Craft Cocktail Co; Harry Bellenberg, head bartender at The Cadogan Arms; and Pritesh Mody, founder of food and drink emporium World of Zing. In the traditional liqueurs category, the judges were impressed by Giffard's Menthe-Pastille, a mint liqueur that, with a nose of crushed Polos and a palate of After Eight centres, scored the only Master of the round. The standout fruit liqueurs were Joseph Cartron's Cherry Brandy, which according to judges, delivered a mouthful of ripe fruit macerated along with its stones, skins and branches. Distillerie Bepi Tosolini's Fragola Spezieria (wild strawberry) also received a Master medal for its 'complex flavours.' Three medals were awarded to the Amarettos – a Master, Silver and Gold, with the top accolade going to Fruko Shulz. Sambuca standouts were both from Antica, winning golds for their 'rounded palate' and 'simplicity', which judges agreed was key in this category to allow the spirits' inherent anise notes to shine. Products from Distillerie Bepi Tosolini and Nonino Distillatori both won Masters in the Herbal Liqueurs and Bitters category and were described as 'stand out products' by the panel.

"It has taken decades for factory bosses in China to wake up to the idea that allowing their workers to sleep on the job is good for productivity. So for half an hour every day, these employees at a plant in Guangdong are allowed to settle back in their spring-back chairs and grab some precious shut-eye. Sitting in a chair might not be the most relaxed way of dropping off to sleep, as shown in this photo, but this is a vast improvement from years gone by when slumbering at the work desk was treated as a cardinal sin and often meant instant dismissal. Hard at rest: Chinese electronics factory workers still wearing their protective clothing take their officially-sanctioned post-lunch naps . Granting official permission for workers to enjoy an apres-lunch nap at their benches is all part of reforms that have been implemented in recent years - and factories are reaping the benefits in increased productivity. The ‘sleeping on the job’ rule has benefited workers so much that the Chinese government now happily reveals that there has been a 30 per cent increase in work flow since it came about, combined with the introduction of a 40-hour working week, a drop in eight hours. This picture was taken by photographer Zhan Youbing who is well qualified to understand why even grabbing a nap in a chair is a matter of great comfort - for he is a former employee from a number of factories producing toys and electronic products. Later learning photographic skills, he embarked on a project to observe what he says is the evolution of the manufacturing world, taking more than 40,000 photos revealing the various conditions his comrades were working under. He recalls how, in 1995 at the age of 22, he arrived in the city of Guangdong along with many young Chinese from the villages seeking work in the burgeoning export-oriented industry. The factories chose workers aged between 18 and 25 because the conditions were demanding - 15 hour shifts six or seven days a week with only short breaks for as little as 34p an hour. The workers receiving the on-the-clock naps are based in Dongguan (pictured), in China's Guangdong Province . But since 2005 there have been vast improvements in working conditions, with salary increases, dormitories being provided for workers who prefer to grab a nap lying down, renovated dining halls and leisure areas where workers can play table tennis or simply relax. Some factories have even helped to provide the children of their workers with education and make clean drinking water available to them. But in an increasing number of factories these days, the greatest torture - sleep deprivation - is becoming a thing of the past. Well-rested workers are happy workers, bosses are now agreeing.","Chinese factory employees allowed a 30 minute nap every day after lunch .

"Disney's Frozen Castle and Ice Palace Playset - the must-have toy of 2014 - is for sale on eBay at nearly seven times its retail price as touts cash in on parents’ desperation. With Christmas approaching, the $119 toy - made by Mattel Inc - is sold out, although on eBay for $700. There are still plenty of other Frozen-themed toys available - but only for now. If you still have Disney's Frozen Castle and Ice Palace Playset on your holiday gift list this year, you may already be out of luck. With Christmas approaching, the $119 toy - made by Mattel Inc - is sold out, although it is on eBay for $700 . Industry analysts, poring over results from the Thanksgiving holiday week, say the hottest 25 toys have already hit their price lows and will only get more expensive as Christmas nears and the remaining inventory flies off stores' shelves. The silver lining? Retailers made a huge bet on toy inventory this holiday season - ordering twice as many shipments of Legos as last year, for instance, according to research firm Panjiva. Expect fierce price competition at major retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp, which carry thousands of toys, notes Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of Time to Play Magazine (ttpm.com). 'There will be huge promotions going on,' he predicts. The sales will not be nationwide shopping events like Black Friday, but will pop up sporadically, culminating in major sales on Dec. 20, the Saturday before Christmas which experts expect to be an extremely heavy shopping day. 'One by one, either loudly or quietly, they will be rolling out some amazing deals,' says Panjiva CEO Josh Green. The Frozen film has taken the world by storm since its release in November last year . Consumers love sales, but Silver notes they may be very disappointed if they can't find the hottest toys. Besides the sold-out Frozen Castle, there are 12 to 15 items which are currently hard to find, including the Max Tow Truck. It is listed currently around $128 on Amazon.com, depending on color - well above its list price of $59.99. Another hot item is the Imaginext Supernova Battle Rover - currently available for $109.99 at Toys R Us [TOYS.UL], slightly below the list price of $119. There are also about 25 to 30 toys that will sell out in the next two weeks, Silver says, especially the most popular new toys in the Lego, Barbie, My Little Pony, FurReal Friend and Nerf lines. Toys with a movie or popular culture tie-in drive demand, while interactive pets tend to be short-lived fads (think Zhu Zhu Pets or Furby). 1: LEGO 14.2 . 2: Cars & Trucks 8.1% . 3: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 7.7% . 4: Video Games 7.5% . 5: Hot Wheels 4.6% . 6: Xbox One 4.4% . 7: PlayStation 4 4.2% . 8: Transformers 3.5% . 9: Remote Controlled Vehicle 2.7% . 10: Marvel Action Figures 2.3% . 1: Disney Frozen 20.0% . 2: Barbie 16.8% . 3: Dolls 10.7% . 4: Monster High 5.2% . 5: American Girl 3.8% . 6: LEGO 3.1% . 7: Tablet/Apple iPad 3.0% . 8: My Little Pony 2.1% . 9: Disney Doc McStuffins 1.9% . 10: Apparel 1.8% . 'There are clear bets by retailers - orders for Frozen toys and My Little Pony toys are up massively versus 2013,' said Green. Most hot toys hit their price lows on Cyber Monday, according to data firm MarketTrack. This year, for example, the FurReal Friend Get Up & GoGo dog, which has a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $59.99, was being offered for $49.99 at most stores in early November. It went down to $39 just before Thanksgiving and hit $27 on Amazon on Cyber Monday. The very next day, the dog, which responds to commands from a remote-control leash, was back up to $39. The price is now fluctuating at most stores because of limited supply. Similarly, the My Little Pony Friendship Rainbow Kingdom Playset, which lists at $39.99, was on sale for $35 at Target on Black Friday and bottomed out at $19.99 on Cyber Monday on Amazon for a half-price sale. It is now back up to $34 at Wal-Mart and Toys R Us. What should shoppers do if they want the hottest toys? 'Grab the hot items early and then get bargain toys when you can,' Silver says. But you may have to wait until next year to employ this strategy.","With Christmas approaching, the $119 toy - made by Mattel Inc - is sold out .

"Four silver coins dating back more than 200 years are the first items to emerge from a newly-discovered time capsule in Boston. A team of experts worked carefully Thursday to remove the container from a granite cornerstone of the Massachusetts State House. Historians believe the stash of treasures were placed there in 1795 by Revolutionary War luminaries Samuel Adams and Paul Revere among others. Treasure trove: This silver coin dating back more than 200 years, was retrieved from a newly-discovered time capsule in Boston today . The capsule is believed to contain items such as old coins and newspapers, but the condition of the contents is not yet known. Secretary of State William Galvin speculates that some could have deteriorated over time. Originally made of cowhide, the time capsule was believed to have been embedded in the granite cornerstone of the building when construction on the state Capitol began. Unearthed: The container was discovered in a granite cornerstone of the Massachusetts State House . Slice of history: Historians believe the stash of treasures were placed there in 1795 by Revolutionary War luminaries Samuel Adams and Paul Revere among others . Adams was governor of Massachusetts at the time. The time capsule was  last unearthed during emergency repairs to the State House in 1855 and its contents transferred to a copper box, Galvin said. It is being removed now because of an ongoing water filtration project at the building. The time capsule will not be immediately opened but instead taken to Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, where it will be X-rayed to determine its contents.

Pamela Hatchfield, a conservator at the museum, slowly chiseled away at the cornerstone on Thursday to reach the box, a process that was expected to take several hours to complete. Galvin said the plan is to return it to the site sometime next year. The excavation comes just months after another time capsule was uncovered from the Old State House, which served as the state's first seat of government. That long-forgotten time capsule, dating to 1901, turned up in a lion statue atop the building and when opened, was found to contain a potpourri of well-preserved items including newspaper clippings, a book on foreign policy and a letter from journalists of the period.

"A teaching intern allegedly stole a six-year-old's iPad and sold it online for Christmas shopping money. University of North Georgia student Kelsey Rose Salie, 21, of Flowery Branch, Georgia, was working as an unpaid intern at Chestatee Elementary School in Gainesville, when she reportedly took the device. According to a report by the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office, the $200 she received after selling the iPad through her boyfriend's Facebook account was returned. College student Kelsey Rose Salie was working as an unpaid intern when she reportedly took the device from a six-year-old's backpack . She was arrested after the child's parents reported the theft to authorities and the child identified her in Facebook photos. The parents had been contacted by a woman from Hall County who had bought the device. The buyer noted their contact information when she switched the iPad on - but it had been her father who met Salie in person. The report explained that it was Salie's boyfriend who returned the money after he discovered the the iPad had been stolen. Salie was arrested for misdemeanor theft and released from Forsyth County Detention Center on December 4 after posting a $1,150 bond. She allegedly told authorities that she took the iPad from the child's backpack last month after students went to another class. The 21-year-old reportedly stole the device while working at Chestatee Elementary School, pictured, in Gainesville, Georgia . She explained she needed money to buy Christmas presents for her family and she used her boyfriend's account because he had more friends than she did. Jennifer Caracciolo, a spokeswoman for Forsyth County Schools, told Forsyth News the situation was 'unfortunate' and the first problem they have had with interns from the college. Kate Maine, director of university relations for the University of North Georgia, said the incident would be referred to a student conduct process, which will be carried our alongside a police investigation. She explained possible punishments range from a verbal warning to expulsion. She added Salie, who is a junior, will not be suspended as UNG does not issue them unless there is a threat to safety - but classes and the internship have ended for the semester. 'This is what we believe to be a truly isolated incident,' Ms Maine said. 'We have a very good relationship with our local school systems, and we hope to continue that relationship. We are disappointed in this particular situation.'","College student told authorities she took the device from child's backpack .

"Denise Shepherd, 19, who died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs aged 11 . A teenage girl died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs when she was aged just 11, an inquest has heard. Denise Shepherd started smoking cannabis before starting secondary school and then progressed to harder drugs such as heroin. In June last year, aged 19, she was found dead in the flat she shared with her boyfriend Jamie Hayne in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when he woke in the early hours of the morning and found she had stopped breathing. At an inquest into her death at Eastbourne Magistrate's Court, her mother Joann Bell told the coroner how her daughter had moved into her flat in a bid to get her to stop taking drugs but was later joined by Mr Hayne. The pair were said to be drinking heavily and were suspected of taking drugs. However, two days before Miss Shepherd, who was unemployed, was found dead, Ms Bell moved out of the flat. She said her daughter and Mr Hayne had a volatile relationship and didn't clean up after themselves. She said: 'They became increasingly difficult to live with. 'I struggled financially because they came to me for food.' She also told the hearing how her daughter had smoked cannabis from a very early age after she had 'fallen in with the wrong crowd'. Coronor Alan Craze was also told how a neighbour had tried to administer CPR to Miss Shepherd when she was discovered unconscious. When paramedics arrived they too were unable to revive her and it is feared she may have been dead for some time. Mr Craze then recorded a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs. The inquest at Eastbourne Magistrates Court, pictured, saw Coroner Alan Craze record a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs . Speaking after the inquest, Ms Bell said she has tried to warn her daughter about the dangers of drugs. She said: 'It is so difficult. People won’t talk to their parents about drugs. 'I tried to sit down and talk to her calmly but I never was aware exactly what was going on. 'I wouldn’t have moved out if I had known. 'She was gullible, naive and easily-led. 'She would be an aunty now. Her brother is now a father. She would have loved being an aunty.'","Denise Shepherd died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills .

"Suella Fernandes came third in a hustings to replace Greg Barker as MP for Bexhill and Battle in rural Sussex . A high-flying Tory candidate was not selected partly because of the ‘double whammy of being brown and a woman’, a Conservative councillor has claimed. Suella Fernandes came third in a hustings to replace Greg Barker as MP for Bexhill and Battle in rural Sussex. John Barnes, a 77-year-old local councillor and president of the local association, said Ms Fernandes had put in a ‘wowzer performance on the night’. But he added that her gender and race had been a ‘handicap’ in such a strong field. Mr Barnes said: ‘The double whammy of being brown and a woman probably handicaps her still. ‘I think if Suella was up against less strong opposition, it wouldn’t have been held against her but when you are battling three good men. Party members in the constituency selected Huw Merriman, a local lawyer and councillor instead. A Tory party spokesman said Mr Barnes’ comments were ‘unacceptable’. He added: ‘They neither reflect the views of the Conservative party nor the reality, which is that people from all backgrounds are being selected to be candidates for the party.’ The remarks, to the Financial Times, expose the Tory party’s struggle to elect more ethnic minority and female candidates. The party had just 11 black or Asian MPs — up from two in 2005 — and 48 women out of 303 Tory MPs. Labour has 16 MPs from ethnic backgrounds and 86 women out if its 257 MPs. David Cameron introduced a panel of controversial A-list candidates ahead of the 2010 election in a bid to push through more ethnic minority and female candidates. But the party has dropped the scheme after an outcry from local associations. Mr Barnes said Mr Cameron’s bid to change attitudes to women had been successful. David Cameron, pictured at an awards ceremony last night, has attempted to increase the number of women and ethnic minority Tory MPs . He said: ‘It really is unthinkable if a woman is the best on the night, you wouldn’t pick her. That is coming with ethnicity but it is more likely to come in urban seats than rural seats. ‘And it is partly not about ethnicity, it is almost by definition [the case that] they know very little about countryside issues.’ The Tory party said that in the 28 constituencies where a sitting Conservative MP is retiring — typically the safest seats — nearly a third of the candidates selected are women and 18 per cent are from an ethnic minority.","Suella Fernandes came third in a hustings to replace Greg Barker as MP .
