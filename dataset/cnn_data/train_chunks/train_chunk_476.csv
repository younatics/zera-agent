Spurned by the Denver Broncos after its high-profile signing of Peyton Manning this week, Tim Tebow is heading to New York. The deal to bring the quarterback to the New York Jets was confirmed on Wednesday evening despite contractual issues which placed the move in threat at the last minute. Hours after the Jets announced they had agreed in principle to take Tebow off the Broncos' hands for fourth- and sixth-round draft picks, the deal reportedly hit a snag. ESPN football insider Adam Schefter reported that provisions in Tebow's contract caused complications in the completion of the trade, saying that the document has $5million worth of 'recapture language,' which meant the Jets would have to pay back some money to the Broncos. Sent packing: The New York Jets announced today that they struck a deal with the Denver Broncos to bring Tim Tebow to the Empire State . Hot property: Tim Tebow, pictured doing his famous move before a game against the Oakland Raiders in November, is on his way to the New York Jets . The move to bring Tebow to New York had many fans and gridiron . pundits shaking their heads, especially since the team gave its starting . quarterback Mark Sanchez a three-year, $40.5million contract extension . earlier this month. With the NFL's salary cap, Tebow's base salaries for the next few seasons were attractive: $1.942 million in 2012, $2.266 million in 2013 and $2.590 million in 2014. The question of Sanchez taking a back seat are yet to be answered, but Tebow would be facing the hounding New York media and the volatile Jets locker room, led by its vocally-impulsive coach Rex Ryan. Several teams, including his hometown Jacksonville Jaguars, were among the possible suitors for Tebow. While some have made the argument that the Jets and Tebow are a good fit, not everyone is putting the welcome mat outside MetLife Stadium. During speculation last night that the Jets were going to make a run on the quarterback, the team’s outspoken cornerback Antonio Cromartie let out a groan on one of the world’s largest soapboxes - Twitter. Public display of rejection: As the Jets pursued Tebow last night, the team's outspoken cornerback Antonio Cromartie bashed the move on Twitter . Last night, one of several anti-Tebow tweets said:  ‘We don't need Tebow. We sell out every home game let him go to Jacksonville Tampa or Miami. Our wildcat offense can b ran by J. Kerley or Joe McKnight we straight . He later added: ‘I don't know y (sic). We have @Mark_Sanchez and jus (sic) signed Drew [Stanton]. Mark has taken us to 2 AFC championship game. We need to build on the team we have now’. Today, after the deal was done, he continued his critique of the Jets front office for making the trade. 'Y (sic) bring Tebow in when we need to bring in more Weapons for @Mark_Sanchez let's build the team around him. We already signed to 3 year ext'. Defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson also took to the social networking site to weigh in, telling his Tebow-minded followers: ‘We had a bad yr but we ain't that bad'. Others welcomed the faith-minded quarterback, including New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and the office of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Tebow, who led the Broncos to the first round of the playoffs last season (including a win over the Jets), became expendable when the Broncos signed Manning to a five-year, $96million deal this week. The Jets were briefly a part of the cavalcade of NFL teams that pursued Manning. New QB: Tebow was spurned by the Denver Broncos after Peyton Manning, pictured here with Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, left, and John Elway, vice president of football operations, decided to join the team . Tebow is expected to add a versatile dimension to the Jets' offense, including running the team's wildcat formation - something new offensive coordinator Tony Sparano enjoys using. He also provides a solid presence in a locker room that was strife with infighting last season - particularly a very public squabbled between Sanchez and wide receiver Santonio Holmes. Now, fans may wonder: Can the Big Apple survive Tebowmania AND Linsanity in the same sports market?","Tim Tebow has left the Denver Broncos for the New York Jets .

Head injuries: Anthony Owen died a week after being found unconscious just 20 yards from his home . A teenager charged with manslaughter over the death of a surgeon found lying injured in the road has been released on bail after appearing before magistrates today. Anthony Owen, 68, was discovered with severe head injuries next to his Honda Civic car, its engine still running, near his home in a ‘millionaires’ row’ village on March 11 and died six days later. Police appealed for information about three teenagers seen riding away from Mr Owen’s £750,000 thatched house on BMX bikes. There is understood to have been a confrontation between Mr Owen and a group of youths, although detectives do not believe they were attempting to steal his car or any other property. Today a 16-year-old teenager, also from Hale Village, appeared before Halton Youth Court, at Runcorn, charged with the manslaughter of Mr Owen. He cannot be named for legal reason. During the hearing, wearing a white Nike t-shirt, the skinny brown-haired teenager sat for most of the hearing before standing to confirm his name, address and date of birth. The case has been adjourned to 30th May at Runcorn Magistrates Court at 9.45am. Well to do: Mr Owen's home in Hale Village, Widnes, Cheshire, where he lived alone. A witness reported seeing three youths on BMX bikes tearing away from the area minutes before his body was found . Two other teenagers, aged 14 and 17, have been released on bail pending  further inquiries. Mr Owen’s death shocked residents in the prosperous Cheshire enclave of Hale village, between Widnes and Liverpool. Yesterday some told how they had been worried about antisocial behaviour blamed on teenagers from nearby estates. Mr . Owen himself had reported the theft of a trailer from another property . in the village earlier this year, although the incident is not being . linked with his death. Friends and relatives described him as a man with ‘high moral values’ who was unafraid to stand up for himself. In a statement yesterday, his relatives . said: ‘We remember him as a man deeply committed to his family and his . profession. He was one with high moral values and exacting standards.’ Mal Sutton, a friend of Mr Owen, said he would have stood up to wrong-doing of any kind. Laurie Northern, who regularly attended church with devout Catholic Mr Owen, described him as ‘the type of man who would stand up for himself'. Mr Owen, a devout Catholic, had lived in the quiet village of Hale for more than 30 years and was well-liked by his neighbours . Barbara Myers, 70, a neighbour of Mr Owen, said youths from outside Hale village had been causing disruption recently. ‘There have been some kids riding up and down the street on BMXs and riding all over the pavement,’ she said. Last night a spokesman for Cheshire Police said: ‘A teenager has been charged with the manslaughter of Anthony Owen in Widnes. ‘Two other teenagers − aged 14 and 17 − who were also arrested in connection with the incident have been bailed pending further inquiries.’","Witnesses .

A Spanish court has dropped a rape probe against a Saudi . prince who is one of the world's richest people, saying his accuser's . allegations are inconsistent. The ruling clearing Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, 57, was . released today by a court in Palma, Majorca. The drugging and sexual assault of a young Spanish model was . alleged to have occurred aboard a yacht moored at the island of Ibiza in the . early hours of August 12, 2008. A judge on the popular resort island quietly closed the . probe in 2010, citing a lack of evidence. However, a higher provincial court in the Balearic Islands, . which include Ibiza, accepted an appeal by the plaintiff and issued an order in . September 2011 instructing the same magistrate to resume the probe and question . the prince as a suspect. The prince was listed 29th on the latest Forbes list of the . world's richest people, with a net worth of $18billion dollars (£11.3billion). He is a leading investor in both Citigroup and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp media . empire. The prince said the court's final decision dismissing the . allegations vindicates his argument that he was not even in Ibiza that day but . rather in France with his wife, children, grandchildren and other witnesses. The court in Palma said the accuser's version of events was . riddled with inconsistencies in her several appearances to give testimony. It said the woman did not initially accuse the prince by . name as being her rapist. Rather, her lawyer did so much later. The court . called this is a 'procedural anomaly that since then has tainted the . entire investigation'. The ruling also said she presented a photo of a group of . people purporting to identify the prince as the man who allegedly raped her. There is an arrow pointing to a man in the background, and the word 'rapist' written there. But the prince is standing in the foreground, . in front of that man. The ruling says when asked about this, the accuser said it . was her mother who drew the arrow on that and several other photos. Wealth: The prince owns London's posh Savoy Hotel . The court said it also found it noteworthy that the woman . took 48 hours to report the alleged rape to the Spanish authorities. Given her inconsistencies 'we cannot establish with any . solidity whatsoever, even circumstantially, what happened' on the night of . the alleged incident, the court declared. The prince, in a statement, reiterated he had not even heard . of the case against him until it was resurrected last September. 'No one's character should be subject to such dishonest . attacks,' the statement said. It said the prince is pursuing criminal actions against the . accuser, her mother and their lawyer, and professional sanctions against the . lawyer for unethical behaviour.","World's 29th-richest man owns London's Savoy Hotel .

MPs yesterday called for an urgent investigation into the Bank of England’s role in the financial meltdown of 2007 and 2008. The institution’s governor, Sir Mervyn King, admitted this week that he should have done more ‘to prevent the disaster’ – the worst since the 1930s. David Ruffley, a senior Tory MP who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said a probe could not ‘come soon enough’. Sir Mervyn King said he was not 'scared' of an inquiry into the Bank of England taking place, telling the BBC he would be 'very happy' if it did . He added: ‘Hard-working families and the wider British economy will suffer for some years yet from the catastrophically poor judgment and buck-passing that preceded the banking crash. ‘Yet individuals who are suspected of being asleep on the job are to be given draconian and unprecedented powers this year.’ The Tory chairman of the committee, Andrew Tyrie, said: ‘The Bank is taking on considerable new powers in the Financial Services Bill, currently before Parliament. ‘Yet we still do not have firm and agreed conclusions about the mistakes that were made and which the legislation is, presumably, seeking to address.’ John Mann, a Labour member of the committee, called on Sir Mervyn to apologise for the Bank’s handling of the credit crunch. Demand: Tory MP David Ruffley said a major investigation 'cannot come soon enough' ‘There certainly should be an inquiry into the Bank’s mistakes and it is a shame that Sir Mervyn has rebuffed the proposal in the past,’ he added. ‘We need to know where the Bank failed, and why. We also need to look at his role, because he was a big part of the problem.’ In a BBC interview yesterday, Sir Mervyn was accused of being ‘scared’ of a large-scale inquiry into the Bank’s conduct before, during and after the crisis. He brushed off the suggestion and insisted he would be ‘very happy’ if a probe took place. Sir Mervyn insisted however that the first and only inquiry by the Bank, in 2008, was sufficient. ‘The important thing is whether you learn the lessons. And we have done that,’ he added. Treasury sources said George Osborne was ‘relaxed’ about the prospects of an inquiry but that it was a ‘matter for the Bank’. Both the Treasury Select Committee and the FSA have conducted major inquiries without apportioning blame. The FSA’s inquiry into the cataclysmic collapse of Royal Bank of Scotland sparked outrage because its former boss, Fred Goodwin, escaped any sanction. Despite his pivotal role in its collapse, Mr Goodwin has been rewarded with a £342,500-a-year pension. Sir Mervyn caused controversy yesterday by saying the Coalition had given a ‘textbook response’ to the economic crisis. Other MPs have said people should know 'where the Bank failed and why' He said the balance struck between spending cuts and deficit reduction was ‘perfectly sensible’ and only soaring inflation had prevented a return to growth. His comments enraged Labour because the governor is supposed to be politically neutral, especially on a polling day. Andy Love, a Labour member of the Commons Treasury committee, said: ‘This is a very unwise intervention by the governor. He has been less than forthcoming about the Bank of England’s mistakes.’ Sir Mervyn also claimed banks were able to get away with awarding excessive bonuses because taxpayers’ cash guarantees they cannot go under.","Bank governor Sir Mervyn King insists he is 'not scared' at prospect of inquiry .

In court: Terry Potter had taken 20 diazepam tablets and was 'extremely high' when he got behind the wheel of the single-decker bus . A drugged-up bus depot worker got behind the wheel of one of the buses and went on a two-hour joyride, a court heard. Terry Potter had taken 20 diazepam tablets and was 'extremely high' when he got behind the wheel of the single-decker Arriva bus and started driving around Bolton. He was even caught on CCTV getting out of the driver’s seat to adjust the mirror at the nearside of the bus - while it was still moving. Potter, of Halliwell, . Bolton, pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving . and driving with no insurance yesterday. Chairman of the bench at Bolton . magistrates’ court, Sandra Whittle, said: 'The facts of the case bring a . whole new meaning to taking the bus home.' The 28-year-old, who appeared in court wearing a t-shirt with the words 'I was amazing last night', was only caught when he was spotted by a former colleague at the Arriva depot in Bolton. Arriva employee Simon Schofield raised . the alarm when he saw the bus being driven along Green Lane and followed . it as he was returning to the depot. Potter realised he was being followed, stopped the bus and ran away down a narrow path. No damage was caused to the bus during the two-hour long joy-ride. Potter hung his head and did not watch the footage of his driving while it was played to the court. Claire Ludlam, prosecuting, said Potter had taken 20 diazepam tablets and was 'extremely high' and had no recollection of taking the bus at 8pm on April 12. Potter, who is unemployed, had worked previously at Arriva for six months where he was responsible for checking the buses were insured and kept in a good condition. To steal the bus he pressed a sequence of buttons to start the engine, which he learned during his employment at Arriva. The court heard Potter was driving at a 'normal speed'. James Towey, defending, said: 'It was a meaningless offence. There was no rhyme or reason behind it.' Bailed: Terry Potter got behind the wheel of a single-decker Arriva bus (similar to this one) parked at the Bolton bus depot (pictured) and went on a two hour joyride but was only caught when he was spotted by a colleague . Potter, who has previous unrelated convictions, was not charged with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs because he was arrested several days after the incident. Colleagues identified Potter to police. Mrs Whittle said: 'It was absolutely appalling that you took a public service vehicle on open roads in the evening. It was evident from CCTV how much light you had. It was just awful.' The case was adjourned for probation reports to be drafted as magistrates could not rule out a custodial sentence. Potter was granted bail until he is sentenced on Friday but was disqualified from driving but a term of disqualification has not yet been set.","Terry Potter had taken 20 diazepam pills and was 'extremely high' when he got behind the wheel .

Footage of Syria's brutal dictator and his wife packing up food parcels has been broadcast on state TV - after they were derided for ordering luxury goods on the internet while their country burns. Pictures were broadcast last night showing Bashar and Asma Assad receiving a rapturous welcome at al-Fahya stadium in Damascus. They joined hundreds of volunteers boxing cartons full of flour, sugar, cooking oil and pasta for victims of fighting in Homs, where the president's forces are crushing an uprising. Scroll down for video... All smiles: Bashar and Asma Assad were shown packing up food boxes in a Damascus stadium . Ridiculous: The pair shook hands and grinned as they 'helped' in the footage broadcast on state TV . Helping out: They have been slammed for ordering luxury goods on the internet while their country burns . The Assads have long worked to manage their image, but it backfired a year ago when a glamorous photo shoot and gushing profile of Asma, 36, appeared in Vogue magazine just as her husband launched a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests. Those images are now part of a YouTube campaign led by the wives of United Nations ambassadors from Britain and Germany, which alternates stylish shots of Asma with gruesome pictures of dead and injured Syrian children. For her latest TV appearance Asma avoided any hint of glamour, dressing down in a sheer pink sweater over a simple dress with her dark blonde hair soberly braided and pinned up. Her tall, gangly husband looked relaxed, towering above his admirers in a polo shirt with an identity pass on a ribbon around his neck like other volunteers.

Workers: The two packed boxes, sealed them with Scotch tape and carried them over to stacks of aid awaiting distribution . The two packed boxes, sealed them with Scotch tape and carried them over to stacks of aid awaiting distribution. Emergence of the footage came as Syria was slammed by the United Nations for failing to keep to the terms of a peace plan and continuing to station troops and heavy weapons in towns. In a letter to the Security Council UN chief Ban Ki-moon said Syria was failing to send a 'clear signal' about its commitment to peace, underlining Western fears for the week-old truce. Despite these fears, the UN today signed an agreement on the terms of a future ceasefire monitoring mission, the Syrian Foreign Ministry said. It could see up to 300 observers entering the country. UN-Arab League mediator Kofi Annan said the Syrian government and the UN had agreed a basis for a 'protocol' on the deployment of more monitors. Chaos: Gunfire and protests broke out near a team of UN observers yesterday, in a town close to Damascus . Fear: Shooting erupted close to an advance party of military personnel from the UN who had been swarmed by protesters denouncing Assad in the town of Erbin . 'This agreement outlines the functions of the observers as they fulfil their mandate in Syria and the tasks and responsibilities of the Syrian government,' Ahmad Fawzi, Annan's spokesman, said in a statement. Fawzi said Annan's team was holding 'similar discussions with representatives of the opposition on the tasks and responsibilities of the armed opposition groups.' A survey by the United Nations has found that the number of civilians uprooted inside Syria has jumped by . some 230,000 since the start of the uprising last year. A . report by the Norwegian Refugees Council and the Geneva-based Internal . Displacement Monitoring Centre says more than 600,000 people are now . internally displaced inside Syria, including some 400,000 from the . country's 1967 war with Israel. Tens . of thousands more have fled to neighbouring countries, making them . officially refugees. The increase makes Syria the country with the . eighth highest number of internally displaced people in the world. Colombia . has the highest number of these refugees, with up to 5.2 million . displaced, followed by Iraq, Sudan, Congo and Somalia. The 15-member U.N. Security Council will meet at 1pm GMT today for a briefing by Annan's deputy, Jean-Marie Guehenno. It is seen as crucial in determining whether the conditions are right for deploying a larger monitoring mission to Syria. U.S. and European diplomats on the council have suggested that Syria's lack of full compliance with its obligations to end the violence may make it difficult for them to support a new resolution that would be needed to deploy an expanded observer mission. In the first progress report since the Security Council passed a resolution on Saturday authorising the deployment of observers. Secretary-General Ban proposed an expanded mission of 300 personnel to monitor a shaky ceasefire between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters. Ban said this week that 250 observers were too few in a country of 23million where the United Nations says at least 9,000 people have been killed in the past 13 months. He sought European help in supplying planes and helicopters. But Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said 250 was a 'reasonable number'. But he added that they should be from countries such as China, Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa - all more sympathetic to Damascus than are the West or the Arab League. He also dismissed any need for UN aircraft. Violation: Smoke and fire billows from a building as shells rain down in the flashpoint city of Homs . Chaos: Syrian soldier manning a checkpoing . The monitors' mission, however, will be a perilous one. Yesterday gunfire and protests broke out near a team of UN observers. Shooting erupted close to an advance party of military personnel from the UN who had been swarmed by protesters denouncing Assad in the town of Erbin, on the northeastern outskirts of the capital Damascus. There were no reports of casualties. But scenes of monitors' vehicles stuck in a crowd and men running away while gunfire rattled in the air were an ominous echo of an earlier monitoring mission, by the Arab League, which collapsed in January. The U.S. said the incident - and sustained shelling by the Syrian army of the city of Homs - raised questions about whether observers could actually monitor any truce.","UN slams Syria for failing remove troops and heavy weapons from towns .

But Tracie Andrews refuses to apologise for the brutal stabbing of her fiancé Lee Harvey. Andrews, 41, insists it is now her ‘human right’ to get on with her life. She will go by the name Tia Carter and has had £5,000 surgery to alter her distinctive jaw and dyed her blonde hair brown. The former barmaid was jailed for life for killing Mr Harvey, 25, in 1996 during a row as they drove in a country road. She cut his throat and stabbed him 37 times with a penknife in the back, face, neck and chest. After leaving him to bleed to death, she concocted a story about a road-rage incident and blamed the other driver for the attack. Two days after the murder, Andrews went on television holding the hand of Mr Harvey’s mother Maureen to appeal for information to catch the killer. As her release grows closer, her family has urged her to repent publicly but she continues to insist she owes no one anything and wants to pick up her life where she left off. ‘She categorically refuses to take the blame,’ said a family friend. ‘Her attitude is she has done her time and the slate is now clean. She sees no reason to say sorry to anyone. 'Her family wanted her to make a public statement on her release, for the first time fully admitting what happened and expressing her regret and sorrow over Lee’s death. Left to die: Lee Harvey was stabbed by his fiancée who then claimed they had been the victim of a road rage attack on a country lane . ‘They take the view that unless she . shows public remorse, she will be a target for hate. But she has refused . to listen and has said repeatedly, point-blank, that she will not say . anything to anyone. She says that, having paid her debt to society, it . is her human right to be left alone.’ Andrews is expected to be released on Thursday from Askham Grange open prison, near York, where she has spent the last part of her 14-year term. At her trial in 1997, she stuck to her story about a ‘wide-eyed maniac’ who had attacked Mr Harvey, but she was convicted. New look: The changes to Andrews' appearance came after she was refused lifelong anonymity . Andrews, who lived with her fiancé in . Alvechurch, Worcestershire, later confessed to her crime in a letter . from prison but refused to apologise or accept full responsibility. The changes to her appearance follow the refusal by the Ministry of Justice to grant her lifetime anonymity. This was given to Maxine Carr, who became her friend in jail. Carr gave a false alibi to her boyfriend Ian Huntley, the killer of Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002. Instead, Andrews will be kept under observation until early  next year. It is believed that she will stay in a secure ‘approved residence’ in the North of England with CCTV and a night curfew for her safety. Under a ruling won by Mrs  Harvey and her husband Raymond, Andrews will not be able to stay within 50 miles of their Birmingham home without informing them and the police. This means she cannot stay with her mother Irene in Warwickshire or at her 20-year-old daughter Karla’s home in Walsall. Yesterday Mrs Harvey declined to comment. But in the past, she has said: ‘All we have left are memories and a grave while she’s ready to carry on as if nothing happened. She is evil.’ Lyn Costello, who runs the support group Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, said: ‘In terms of the law, she is right about her human rights. But in terms of morals and decency, she’s wrong. This must be terrible for the family.’","She will go by the name Tia Carter .

Hospitals are running out of vital drugs to treat high blood pressure, asthma and Parkinson's disease because they are being sold abroad . Hospitals are running out of vital drugs to treat high blood pressure, asthma and Parkinson’s disease because they are being sold abroad. At least 19 NHS trusts across England have written to the Department of Health since September to warn of shortages, according to figures obtained by Labour  MP Keith Vaz. There are concerns that drugs manufactured in Britain, meant for NHS patients, are being sold to EU countries by wholesalers and pharmacists. Fluctuations in exchange rates mean manufacturers can make more profit selling overseas. Although the practice is not illegal, the Government has condemned it as unethical and there are concerns that patients are being put at risk. Mr Vaz said: ‘The Government must not wait until a patient loses their life due to the shortages to take action. ‘I am worried that we are manufacturing medicines for this country and they are being sold abroad. It’s shameful.’ Mr Vaz said eight pharmacies in his constituency had contacted him about the problem in the past week alone. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: 'The health of some of the most vulnerable patients is being put at risk because the medicines they need just aren't available. At least 19 NHS trusts have written to the Department of Health since September to warn of shortages, according to figures obtained by Labour MP Keith Vaz (above) 'Having access to the medicines prescribed by your doctor when you need them is a basic right that all patients should be able to expect.' The drugs currently in short supply include those to treat high blood pressure, cholesterol, asthma, diabetes, Parkinson's Disease, osteoporosis, diabetes and depression. The Department of Health said: ‘We continue to work with representatives of the medicines supply chain – including industry and wholesalers – to minimise the impact of shortages.’ Earlier this year, a survey of 300 pharmacies by Chemist and Druggist magazine found that one in five people spent more than an hour on the phone every day trying to find drugs. And more than half said it took at least three days for an emergency supply for the drugs they had run out of to arrive. Another 85 per cent said they were 'very concerned' that patients were being adversely affected as a result.","Medicine for high blood pressure, asthma and Parkinson's running short .

'Naive': The shamed former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn claims he did not know the girls at orgies were being pimped in an organised vice gang . Dominique Strauss-Kahn is a ‘simple swinger’ who had no idea the girls at orgies he attended were being paid to have sex with him, his lawyer said yesterday. The shamed former IMF chief has committed nothing more than a ‘crime of lust’, Paris barrister Richard Malka claimed. He was speaking after the 62-year-old economist was charged in France with ‘complicity in pimping in an organised vice gang’, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. Strauss-Kahn is acccused of knowingly using prostitutes paid for by two businessmen who were illegally using company funds to organise sex parties in Europe and America. The charges come as a judge in New York will decide today whether the man once tipped to be the next French president should face civil action from a hotel chambermaid over attempted rape allegations, or whether he can claim diplomatic immunity from the charges. In the French case, at least five prostitutes told police they had sex with Strauss-Kahn. One told detectives she attended 11 orgies with him, adding: ‘I got the feeling he liked rough sex.’ But Mr Malka said he and his client would now do everything in their power to have the charges brought by two judges in Lille on Monday night dismissed. Scroll down for video . The vice ring at the centre of these allegations reportedly operated out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille . He said: 'It is quite implausible and . contrary to common sense to use terms like ""organised gang"" and ""vice . network"" to describe a simple swinging activity. 'Mr Strauss-Kahn is finding himself, in large part because of his fame, thrown to the wolves. 'Colossal . police and judicial means were deployed to crack and dissect his . private life to an infinite degree, with the only goal being to invent . and then castigate what can be considered a crime of lust. 'And what a strange co-incidence that all this should happen a month from a major national election.' The vice ring under investigation operated out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille.

But . his political ambitions were wrecked when he was arrested for allegedly . trying to rape New York hotel chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo last May.

Sofitel hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo, is launching a civil case this week in New York against Strauss-Kahn, who she alleges sexually assaulted her . When . those allegations were also dropped, he was then confronted with more . claims he used prostitutes supplied by the Lille vice network. Strauss-Kahn . has confessed to attending orgies in France and Belgium, but claims he . never knew the girls were hookers because ‘they were all naked at the . time’. His lawyer Henri . Leclerc said earlier this year: 'At these parties, people were not . dressed, and I defy you to tell the difference between a naked . prostitute and any other naked woman.' During . the vice network investigation, it emerged that Lille police chief . Jean-Christophe Lagarde had organised an eight-person orgy for . Strauss-Kahn at a luxury Paris hotel in 2010. Lille . businessman David Roquet and three other men are also accused of . providing hookers for Strauss-Kahn in a bid to curry favour with the man . then tipped to be the next French president.

"By . James White . UPDATED: . 11:09 EST, 26 September 2011 . Quantitative easing ahead: Bank of England policymaker Ben Broadbent said he was close to voting for the printing of more money and that the pound would remain weak . A weak pound will be necessary for some time to rebalance the economy towards exports, a top Bank of England policymaker said today. Ben Broadbent, who joined the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee in June, added he was 'reasonably close' to voting for increasing the Bank's quantitative easing programme, a move which in itself would lower the value of the pound. Sterling has lost around 30 per cent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the financial crisis as the impact of recession, low interest rates and quantitative easing all depreciated the currency. A weak pound can hit households as the cost of imports are relatively higher and travelling abroad becomes more expensive, however UK exporters will benefit as the value of their products becomes more attractive to overseas buyers. The pound dropped against the U.S. dollar and euro following Mr Broadbent's speech at Canary Wharf in London before recovering to stand at 1.55 and 1.14 respectively. Mr Broadbent, a former economist at investment bank Goldman Sachs, said export growth and overall productivity will remain sluggish for as long as the banking system is in 'poor health' so the pound's exchange rate will have to 'remain weak for some time to come'. In comments which support an argument in favour of further QE, Mr Broadbent said the international environment was 'clearly disinflationary' which would offset the impact a weak pound has on inflation. Falling trend: How the pound has fallen away against the dollar in the past six months . He said the rate of inflation would be held back by 'slow growth in the United States, the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone and its knock-on effects on the cost of finance for UK and European banks'. A dismal economic outlook and moderating price pressures have seen the monetary policy debate shift away in recent months from interest rates and back to increasing QE - injecting cash into the economy to stimulate growth - from its current level of £200 billion. Bank of England: The financial institution wants a weak pound to improve trade and boost the economy . Global growth fears are being fuelled by the ongoing euro-zone debt crisis, cracks emerging in the U.S. economy and soft manufacturing, services and trade figures in the UK. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said Mr Broadbent's speech supported mounting expectations that the Bank will fire up the money-printing presses in the near future. Mr Archer said the Bank could boost its QE stock as early as October but a November move is more likely. He said: 'While we currently favour a move in November, it is very possible that the Bank could act at the conclusion of the October MPC meeting if UK data over the next couple of weeks show further weakness and the global economic environment fails to show any signs of improvement.'","Move a bid to improve affordability of UK exports .

Salmonella, E coli and other types of food poisoning may have lifelong consequences. Studies have shown that people caught up in food poisoning outbreaks are more likely to develop a host of lengthy illnesses, including diabetes, arthritis, kidney failure, high blood pressure and even heart attacks and strokes. Some, such as kidney damage thought to be caused by powerful poisons released by the bugs and arthritis triggered by a faulty immune response, occur within weeks. Others, such as high blood pressure, take years to appear. Long-term: Salmonella, E coli and other types of food poisoning may have lifelong consequences . Experts say the chance that the link is coincidental is remote - and are calling for more to be done to identify victims of food poisoning and monitor their long-term health. Others say that prevention is key - and better hand and food hygiene would cut the number of cases of food poisoning and so the number of people left with lifelong complications. Almost 90,000 cases of food poisoning are recorded each year in England and Wales. However, the true number is likely to be closer to one million, as only a minority of victims will visit their doctor and give a sample that will be logged in the official statistics. Common bugs are E coli, usually caught from eating undercooked beef including mince and burgers; campylobacter, found in raw and undercooked meat, especially chicken; and salmonella, which is found in eggs, meat and milk. Studies have linked E coli (pictured) to kidney failure and diabetes . While they can be fatal, most people recover after a few days. But this month’s issue of Scientific American warns that even a short bout of sickness or diarrhoea could have long-term consequences. Studies have linked E coli to kidney . failure and diabetes and campylobacter to bowel problems and . Guillain-Barre syndrome, a potentially fatal condition in which the . immune system attacks the nerves, causing muscle weakness and paralysis. Salmonella has been blamed for a form of arthritis. Scientific . American says: ‘It is a scary idea that food poisoning - which we think . of as lasting just a few days - could instead have lifelong . after-effects. ‘The . incidence of such “sequelae”, in medical parlance, has been thought to . be low, but not many researchers studied the problem until recently. ‘New findings by several scientific teams suggest the phenomenon is more common than anyone thought.’ Figures are still relatively scarce. But one of the most ‘stunning and persuasive’ studies was carried out on Canada after thousands of men and women became ill from drinking water contaminated with manure. A government-funded study found that, eight years later, those who suffered severe diarrhoea due to the dirty water were more than twice as likely to have had a heart attack or stroke than those who were unaffected or only mildly ill. Their risk of kidney problems was more than three times as high. They also had greater than normal odds of high blood pressure. Even those with milder symptoms had circulatory problems that may have been triggered by the stomach bug. University of Western Ontario researcher Dr Bill Clark recommends that survivors of severe food poisoning, such as that caused by the E coli O157 strain, undergo regular blood pressure and kidney checks. Common bugs are E coli, usually caught from eating undercooked beef including mince and burgers . Barbara Kowalcyk, of the Centre for Foodborne Illness Research and Prevention in the US, said: ‘We want to establish the true burden of disease because that is what policy makers use to decide what is a public health priority. ‘As long as we focus only on the acute form of foodborne illness and not the long-term health consequences, we’ll under-estimate how significant a problem this is.’ Professor Julian Ketley, of the University of Leicester, said it is important that people are aware of the complications, some of which develop within weeks of the sickness and diarrhoea. He said: ‘If it does come up, they can go and see their physician about it.’ Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of microbiology at Aberdeen University, stressed that prevention is key. He said: ‘Once you get infected with one of these bugs, it is in the luck of the gods whether you get the complications or not. ‘There is nothing you can do to stop the complications but you can stop the infections happening in the first place. ‘The vast majority of people who get food poisoning will not suffer any long-term consequences but the minority will. ‘That’s why it is absolutely vital we get the number as low as we can.’ Professor Pennington advocates hand washing, thorough cooking of food and taking care not to contaminate other foods with uncooked meat and poultry.","Victims could develop diabetes, arthritis, kidney failure and high blood pressure .

Venables, who was just 10 when he killed two-year-old James, was said to have been given two more courses than other inmates at the jail. Special treatment: Jon Venables, pictured here after his arrest for the murder of Jamie Bulger in 1993, was given extra food in jail . As well as the extra food, staff also apparently gave the killer paedophile three new board games and a phone card with extra credit, the Daily Star reported. Jamie's mother, Denise Fergus, 42, from Liverpool, told the Star: 'The problem with Venables is he thinks he's some kind of special case.' She added: 'He should not get any special treatment in prison because by doing that they are giving him the impression he is the victim, which is all wrong.'

It was also claimed today that Venables will even get double pay in his prison job of cleaning the five-room secure unit in which he is held.

A Glaswegian grandmother has started speaking with an Italian accent after suffering a stroke, despite never having visited the country. Debbie McCann, 48, had a strong Glaswegian accent before the minor stroke in November last year. But in the weeks following her illness she lost the ability to speak at all only to regain a voice she didn't recognise as her own. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Diagnosed: Debbie McCann is thought to have Foreign Accent Syndrome, which left her speaking with a Chinese and then an Italian accent . ‘For the first two weeks, I couldn't speak and it was very frustrating,' said Ms McCann. 'When my voice came back, I sounded Chinese. I couldn't believe it. ‘Now, people say I sound more like I'm from Italy, yet, I've never been to either of those countries.’ She was diagnosed with Foreign Accent Syndrome in June after friends said they thought she had the condition after seeing a clip of a sufferer online. Foreign Accent Syndrome is an extremely rare medical condition that affects just 60 . people worldwide and leaves a person speaking in a different . accent due to a brain injury, stroke or migraine. The condition has left her embarrassed about speaking and is having a terrible impact on her life. Suffering: The condition has become a nightmare for Debbie McCann, who is now embarrassed to speak to people . ‘I'm having speech therapy and every day I wake up hoping my old voice will be back’, she said. ‘We laughed about it in the beginning but it's become a nightmare for me.’ She said it's only now she feels brave enough to go out on her own. The grandmother-of-two added: ‘It's made me very embarrassed to speak to people. I only go shopping where I used to work because everyone knows me there. ‘Otherwise I'm constantly having to explain myself. ‘I don't like speaking on the phone. When I called the Job Centre to apply for disability allowance, the lady asked me where I was from. ‘I said Glasgow and she said: 'No, where are you from originally?' I had to explain to her I had Foreign Accent Syndrome. 'As time has gone on though, I feel more comfortable.’ The former shop assistant was at home with her only daughter, Julieanne, when her hands started shaking and her speech became slurred. The 24-year-old sat her mother down in a chair but she slumped to one side and when she was taken to hospital a doctor said he believed she may have suffered a minor stroke. Tests, however, including an MRI scan, came back clear. Ms McCann has an appointment with a neurologist in November and she hopes they will confirm that she had a stroke. Since her illness she has been left with weakness on the right side of her body and she has been unable to drive. The condition also affects her facial movements and she not only talks in a foreign accent but writes in broken English - meaning she often misses out words like 'to' and 'a' from sentences. When she wrote to a friend that she had been referred for treatment to a stroke clinic, she actually wrote: ‘I been referred to stroke clinic.’ Her daughter, a residential children's worker said: ‘This time last year, she was a completely different person. She was so outgoing and would talk to anyone. ‘Now it's me that has to do a lot of the speaking when we go out. ‘It's been totally life changing. Her thick Glaswegian accent was part of her identity.’ The condition was first identified in the 1940s when a Norwegian woman was hit by shrapnel and started speaking with a strong German accent. Dr Anja Lowitt, an expert in the condition from Strathclyde University whom Ms McCann consulted about her speech, said: ‘Foreign Accent Syndrome is extremely rare and usually follows some kind of brain injury. In most cases a stroke, but it could potentially also be a head injury. ‘What happens is that the person's speech disorder mimics features of one or more foreign accents. ‘So it could be that the person's speech now contains a sound that exists in French, or a particular intonation pattern typical for Italian. ‘If the speech includes features from several accents, the listener often hears the one they are most familiar with. It's also the reason why we only hear common accents. ‘Unfortunately there is currently no cure for Foreign Accent Syndrome. With some people it disappears after a year or two, others will never lose it. ‘It depends on the initial severity of the speech problem and how well the brain recovers.’ Foreign Accent Syndrome from Lenny Warren / Warren Media on Vimeo.","She is one of only 60 sufferers in the world .

With its distinctive design reaching 180 feet into the air, the new Twin Sails bridge in Poole Harbour is a pleasure to behold. Yesterday, Princess Anne arrived to officially open the £37m construction, which has been 40 years in the planning and gracefully splits in half to allow boats to pass through. There's just one problem - no cars are allowed to use it. Opening one: A huge crowd of people stand on the new £37million bridge on February 25 as the Mayor of Poole Graham Wilson opens the Twin Sails bridge in Poole, Dorset, to Pedestrians . Emergency repairs: This large chunk of tarmac fell off the bridge when it was lifted up to allow a boat through in Poole, Dorset. It has now been shutdown so repairs can be carried out . Engineers spotted a large crack in the surface and a large two square metre chunk of the asphalt surface broke off while the bridge was last lifted up. Although experts have examined the bridge, they have failed to ascertain exactly what is wrong. They may yet have to pull up all the Tarmac and relay it. But despite the problems, it has not stopped dignitaries repeatedly declaring the closed bridge 'open'. Yesterday Princess Anne was greeted by hundreds of well-wishers as she visited the site and pressed the operator’s button to raise the two leaves. Three days earlier the Mayor of Poole Graham Wilson staged a ceremonial lifting of the bridge to a Royal Marine trumpet fanfare and the cheers of 2,000 people. Before that on February 25 the mayor cut a ribbon to declare the bridge open to pedestrians. Opening two: A crowd gathers on the bridge as Mayor Graham Wilson stages the second official opening - lifting the bridge to allow boats through . Opening three: Prince Anne holds a second lifting of the bridge as it is given its third official opening. Although engineers had discovered faults the council said the event had to go ahead because 'you can't delay a royal visit' Officially open? Prince Anne is driven across the bridge - but it is now closed because of problems with the surface which will have to be re-laid, at least partially . A spokesman for Poole Borough Council confirmed there are no more opening ceremonies planned. The bridge in Poole has been planned for the last 40 years. It connects parts of the town centre with the district of Hamworthy. Engineers are working to try and repair the bridge but they cannot say how long it will remain closed to both cars and pedestrians. Workers from contractors Hochtief found chunks of rubble, in pieces measuring up to one foot long on land beneath the bridge after it was lowered hours before Princess Anne’s visit. A 60ft by 21ft area of the road surface will be pulled up and inspected and then sections of it will be relaid. Bridge of sighs: Engineers have admitted they do not know exactly what the problem with the £37million bridge is - or when it can be reopened . They do not yet know if one, two or all three layers of the asphalt will have to be relaid. Jim Bright, strategic director at Poole Borough Council, said: 'We have not fully understood the problem that we have got and are looking to the contractor and his specialists for advice. 'We do know that it is a defect that has occurred and where there is a defect appropriate remedial action has to be determined. 'Relaying the quickdrying surface will take a couple of days. 'It is a relatively small job to undertake once we understand what we need to do. 'To say ""It is going to open this week or in a week"" would just not be possible. Official opening: Mayor Graham Wilson cuts the ribbon to declare the bridge open to pedestrians last month - but it has now had to close again . 'The Twin Sails Bridge is a complex structure and our contractor has made a huge effort to complete the project on time.' A council spokesman said they could not have postponed any of the opening ceremonies as they had been booked well in advance. She said: 'You can’t delay a royal visit. 'The event on March 9 was to commemorate 85 years of the old bridge as well as celebrate the new bridge and the ribbon cutting event was part of a community weekend that we held. 'It is a construction programme and you can’t predict issues that can arise.' Celebration: People gather on the bridge for the first opening ceremony last month - but it has now had to be shutdown again .","Princess Anne declares Twin Sails bridge in Poole Harbour open but motorists aren't allowed to cross .

Struggling to lift the statute, she accepted the award, saying: ‘Oh wow I need to work out a little more. That guy’s heavy.’ Spencer’s . win comes just weeks after she won the Golden Globe for the same role . in the film, which is based on the novel about African-American maids . who take a stand during the Civil Rights era.

And, true to his role as a silent star in The Artist, at first Dujardin didn’t know what to say when he took to the podium. He eventually found the right words and said: ‘I was a very bad student. I didn’t listen in class. ‘I was always dreaming…My teachers called me Jean of the Moon. I realise now that I never stopped dreaming. 'Thank you very much. Thank you for this dream.’ Beloved . actress Betty White seemed perplexed when she was announced as the winner . for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series. It’s . not the first time the Golden Girl has won a SAG Award for her work in . the TV series Hot in Cleveland. She topped the same category last year. White said: ‘I think they made a terrible mistake.’ She then added that the award also belonged to her co-stars Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves and Wendie Malick. But, ever the funny woman, she quickly quipped: ‘I’m not going to let them keep this but I’ll let them see it.’ Alec Baldwin was another previous winner who was crowned king of his category yet again. The . 53-year-old was given the statute for Outstanding Performance by a Male . Actor in a Comedy series for the sixth year in a row for his work in 30 . Rock. The usually articulate star screamed ‘Oh my God’ several times like an overexcited teen. Baldwin, who plays Jack Donaghy in the hit sitcom, thanked the show’s writers, including co-star Tina Fey. Other winners included Christopher Plummer who was honoured for his best supporting role in the film Beginners. The . 82-year-old jokingly said: ‘I just can’t tell you what fun I’ve had . being a member of the world’s second oldest profession…’ Speaking of winning a SAG for the first time, The Sound of Music star said: ‘It’s like being lit by the Holy Grail.’ Another first time winner included Jessica Lange who was recognised for her role in the dark TV series American Horror Story. The Oscar-winner said about the Ryan . Murphy show: 'Thank you to FX and to all the crazy, wild, imaginative . people who put this thing together. 'It was a real leap of faith to jump into it, but it's been a wild ride.'

"By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 17:41 EST, 26 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:45 EST, 26 March 2012 . At least three major Tory donors have been hired by David Cameron to help determine Government policy - while a fourth profited from the conflict in Libya . At least three major Tory donors have been hired by David Cameron to help determine Government policy – while a fourth profited from the conflict in Libya. The disclosures raise serious concerns that wealthy businessmen are being given privileged access to the heart of the No. 10 machine after signing hefty cheques for the Tories. Last night Stanley Fink, who has been reappointed treasurer, sent an urgent letter to donors making clear that in future ministers will have to seek permission before using policy ideas put forward by donors. ‘If any ministerial contact with a party donor prompts a request for policy advice, the minister will refer this to his or her private office who can seek guidance from the Permanent Secretary,’ he wrote. JCB boss Sir Anthony Bamford was granted a ‘Thank you dinner’ by the Prime Minister and his party co- chairman Andrew Feldman in July 2010  in No. 10 two months after the general election. Sir Anthony, who has given more than £1.8million to the Tories since Mr Cameron became leader, was later asked to write a Government report on the future of manufacturing. Another dinner, this time in the Camerons’ private flat above 11 Downing Street, was held in November last year for Ian Taylor, the world’s biggest oil trader, who has given the Tories £466,000. JCB boss Sir Anthony Bamford, left,  who has given more than £1.8million to the Tories, was asked to write a Government report on the future of manufacturing, while Venture capitalist Adrian Beecrof, right, who has given £593,000 to the Tories since 2005 was asked to contribute to policy on the future of employment rights . Two months earlier, it had emerged that his company Vitol supplied oil to the rebels in Libya – a contract worth more than £100million. That deal was arranged by a secret oil cell in the Foreign Office set up by International Development Minister Alan Duncan, who had previously acted as a consultant to Vitol. Lord Ashcroft, who is Mr Cameron's most generous donor, having handed over £4.3million, was entertained at the Prime Minister's official country residence of Chequers in June 2010. Venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft was also asked to contribute to policy on the future of employment rights in the UK. Mr Beecroft, who has given £593,000 to the Tories since 2005, drew up controversial recommendations to allow bosses to ‘fire at will’, removing lazy and ineffectual staff, as well as changing rules on unfair dismissal to remove the burdens of tribunal cases on business. His report was championed in Downing Street by David Cameron’s chief policy guru Steve Hilton – though it was suppressed after disagreements with the Liberal Democrats. Sir Anthony Bamford’s report appears to have had more influence. He called on the Government to become champions of manufacturing and cut business taxes to support a renaissance in engineering – both of which could have benefited his company JCB. The Chancellor made cutting Corporation Tax a centrepiece of his Budget last week. Meanwhile Lord Ashcroft, who is Mr Cameron’s most generous donor, having handed over £4.3million, was entertained at the Prime Minister’s official country residence of Chequers in June 2010. A year later he was asked to head a review of the Ministry of Defence’s overseas bases. Close relationship: Tory treasurer Peter Cruddas, left, boasted that he could give donors private access to David Cameron, right . Critics believe he was also influential in persuading the Government to build a new runway on the remote island of St Helena – a £100million project of which he was the most vocal backer. It also emerged yesterday that former Tory treasurer Michael Spencer claimed that he knew in advance that the Government would veto French plans for a financial transactions tax. In an interview for financial magazine Risk, Mr Spencer said: ‘I have had it first-hand from very, very senior members of our administration who I know personally and have had good relations with for a long time, that it will be vetoed without any doubt and without any reservation at all.’ Entrainment: It also emerged that former Tory treasurer Michael Spencer claimed that he knew in advance that the Government would veto French plans for a financial transactions tax. Mr Spencer attended a lunch at Chequers, pictured, in May 2010 . Mr Spencer attended a No. 10 dinner in February this year and a lunch at Chequers in May 2010. Details of activities undertaken by donors are significant because they suggest high-level links between party backers and politicians can lead to influence over or prior knowledge of policy. The disgraced former Tory treasurer Peter Cruddas was recorded by undercover reporters saying one donor had written a paper on the subject of gay marriage for the No. 10 policy unit. He said: ‘We’ve fed that back into the party and there are some brilliant points in it and his voice has been heard. ‘If you’re unhappy about something, we will listen to you and put it into the policy committee at No. 10 – we feed all feedback to the policy committee.’ Mr Cameron’s spokesman said officials could find no trace of such a paper, saying: ‘I’ve spoken to the policy unit and the Prime Minister. This claim appears to have been entirely made up.’ The spokesman denied that there had been discussion of Government policy but admitted: ‘Of course there is going to be talk about politics in generic terms.’ Lord Fink, 54, who was made a life peer last year after a two-year stint as treasurer, was brought back because, unlike Peter Cruddas, he is seen as a safe pair of hands . The latest businessman to accept the poisoned chalice of the Tory treasurer’s role was once memorably spotted crawling on his hands and knees at the edge of a golf course lake trying to retrieve a ball which had plopped into the water. Considering Stanley Fink’s personal fortune is estimated at £118million, it might seem odd behaviour. But with donations drying up from grassroot members who are disillusioned with David Cameron’s leadership, a frugal approach may be what is required at Tory Party HQ. Fink, 54, who was made a life peer last year after a two-year stint as treasurer, was brought back because, unlike Peter Cruddas, he is seen as a safe pair of hands. He is discreet, well-liked by other Tory donors, and there has never been a hint of scandal about his business career. In his heyday in the City he was known as the ‘Godfather’ of British hedge funds, having transformed the Man Group over two decades into the world’s biggest listed hedge-fund group with assets of U.S. $88billion. He lessened his involvement in 2005, after a brain tumour was diagnosed and eventually stood down entirely, but returned to the City with another business venture in 2008. Putting political affiliations aside, he set up International Standard Asset Management, a small commodities trader, with the man who had been Tony Blair’s personal fundraiser, Lord ‘Cashpoint’ Levy. Fink is from a modest background. He was brought up in Manchester and went to Manchester Grammar School. His father was a grocer, one of his brothers trades computer parts from a garage, and the other one is a middle-manager for a car windscreen company. He has three children and met his wife Barbara 25 years ago in an old people’s home where they were both doing voluntary work. ‘In my case it was love at first sight but it was not for her. It took about six months before I plucked up the courage to ask her out,’ he said in an interview. He read law at Cambridge and his first job was as a trainee accountant with Arthur Andersen. A cerebral figure, he first became Tory treasurer after bankrolling Boris Johnson’s successful London mayoral campaign in 2008. He has given about £2.5million to the Conservative Party and has dined with the Prime Minister at Chequers. But it was as a student that he first became committed to the Tory cause. He was working in a paper factory in Bury, where he developed a new method of generating more orders. After a couple of days he was taken aside by a trade union shop steward and told this was ‘very unhelpful because he had people who weren’t able to pick orders at quite the same rate’. Fink recalled: ‘I remember thinking that was a great shame because clearly my way was better for the company. I saw a negative side of trade unions. I think that hardened my views.’ He enjoys the trappings of his success. He has a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, and a large family house in Northwood, Middlesex. He owns a chalet in the ski resort of Courchevel in France plus the luxurious hotel next door. ‘It is attached to my chalet so I get all the hotel services,’ he says. ‘It is the best of both worlds, having a private house with a Michelin chef. I go to the hotel bar and use the pool and the gym. I often go skiing with a couple of families. I like to share my good fortune with my old friends.’ With the latest scandal over funding, it could well be that Fink will have to share even more of his good fortune with the Tory Party.","Stanley Fink, has sent a letter to donors making clear ministers will have to seek permission before using policy .

A French train commuter has won 1,500 euros in compensation after repeated rail delays saw her lose her job for arriving late to work. Soazig Parassols worked as a secretary for a law firm in Lyon, but was fired after just a month because she repeatedly turned up late. But Ms Parassols, 25, was awarded compensation after arguing that her trains from Amberieu in eastern France, were delayed at least six times. During her month-long trial at the Lyon law firm the train she caught to work was delayed by anything from 10 to 75 minutes. The law firm where she was on trial in June 2010 said that her frequent lateness was damaging to the running of the company. A court in France has now ordered French rail company SNCF to pay Ms Parassols 1,500 euros (£1,250) in compensation. She had originally asked for 45,000 euros (£37,500), but the court did not award her this as they ruled that she had not suffered financial loss.

"Frances Lawrence, the widow of the murdered headmaster, wished her husband's killer 'a happier, calmer future' after he was acquitted . By . Stephen Wright and Colin Fernandez . UPDATED: . 19:22 EST, 24 August 2011 . Cleared: Chindamo, seen here after his release in 2008 for the murder of headmaster Philip Lawrence, has been acquitted by a jury for robbery . The killer of headmaster Philip Lawrence is set to spend at least another two years in prison, despite being cleared of robbery yesterday. But Learco Chindamo, 31, will not be deported when he is finally released. An immigration tribunal has ruled that Chindamo, who was born in Italy, could not be forced to leave because it would breach his human rights, in particular his ‘right to family life’. This means the murderer will continue to be a drain on the British taxpayer. Chindamo was controversially freed on licence in July last year after serving 14 years for the 1995 knife killing of Mr Lawrence. Just four months later he was recalled to prison following his arrest for the alleged robbery. He cannot be released from the recall until a decision by the Parole Board in the next few months. However insiders believe he will be kept in prison for at least another two years because of breaches of his licence conditions, including associating with a former member of his Clockwork Orange-style gang, being on the streets in the early hours and drinking heavily. At his trial Chindamo was accused of boasting about Mr Lawrence’s death to frighten 20-year-old David Sexton into handing over £20 he had just withdrawn from a cashpoint in Camden, north London. The thug claimed Mr Sexton ignited the row with drunken taunts of ‘killer’. The clash, captured on CCTV, spiralled into a seven-minute argument which ended with Mr Sexton handing over £10 as a peace offering to Chindamo and his two  co-defendants, defence lawyers told the jury. Chindamo's friends Gregory Jananto (left) and Saeed Akhtar (right) have been cleared of the cashpoint robbery . Philip Lawrence, who was killed outside St George's Roman Catholic School in Maida Vale, west London, was a pillar of society . Chindamo was cleared of robbery with . 32-year-old Gregory Jananto, the ringleader of Chindamo’s gang which . terrorised north London in the mid-1990s. Jananto, of Shepherd’s Bush, west . London, received an eight-year jail term for the near-fatal knife . mugging of John Mills, husband of the then Director of Public . Prosecutions, Barbara Mills, six months before Mr Lawrence’s murder. While on bail for that offence, . Jananto led a mob attack intended to terrorise a witness during . Chindamo’s murder trial. For this he received an extra seven-year term. Chindamo and Jananto hugged each . other in the dock at London’s Blackfriars Crown Court after being . cleared yesterday. The third defendant, Saeed Akhtar, 32, of King’s . Cross, north London, was also cleared of robbery. During his trial Chindamo spoke about . the murder of Mr Lawrence, 48, outside St George’s Roman Catholic . School in Maida Vale. He said: ‘I know what I’ve done was a terrible . thing. A horrible thing.’ Mr Lawrence’s widow, Frances, said: ‘I only wish Chindamo a happy and more productive life ahead.’ Tory MP Philip Davies said that Chindamo should remain in jail for the rest of his life. He said: ‘Life should mean life for . murder. Learco Chindamo didn’t have any concern for the family life of . the Lawrence family when he killed Philip Lawrence. ‘He should never have been released from prison, and if released only so that he could be kicked out of the country.' Learco Chindamo, seen here after being arrested for the headteacher's death in October 1996, has not been able to forget his reputation . Learco . Chindamo may have been cleared of robbery charges, but his name . continues to stir feelings of anger among many who never knew him. According to his peers, the murderer . of headmaster Philip Lawrence is regularly recognised and insulted for . the crime which shocked the nation in December 1995, bringing him . instant notoriety at the age of 15. Back in court at the age of 31 - . after nearly 14 years behind bars - prosecutors painted a picture of a . cold and calculating bully who used his conviction as a chilling weapon. Sitting in the dock, the Italian-born defendant cut a cool and intense figure, showing no emotion. There, he was reunited once again with Gregory Jananto - his co-defendant and former fellow gang-mate from their teenage years. Back then, Chindamo was already a well-known figure. A violent truant, he had managed to avoid an education almost completely and carried a knife as a matter of habit. Instead of attending school, he preferred to live within his gang which roamed the burger bars and arcades of west London. They modelled themselves on Triads and called themselves the Wo Sing Wo, or Street Warriors. On Friday December 8 1995, at the age . of 15, he and other members of the posse found themselves at the gates . of St George's School, where they planned to attack a boy who had . quarrelled with a Filipino pupil. Mr Lawrence saw what was happening . and went to the 13-year-old's aid, bringing him face to face with . Chindamo, who responded with kicks and punches. He was stabbed fatally in the heart with a single blow of Chindamo's knife. Within hours of the attack, the . teenage aggressor was back at one of his regular haunts, an amusement . arcade in London's West End, boasting about what he had done. At the same time, Mr Lawrence was in hospital. He died at midnight. The contrast between the 48-year-old . teacher - a pillar of his community and a widely-respected . educationalist - and his killer could hardly have been more striking. Mr Lawrence prized discipline and . took a fierce pride in the standards of St George's Catholic School in . Maida Vale, west London, and the achievements of its students. As a teacher and headmaster, his life was dedicated to ensuring his pupils were given every opportunity. Privately, he was first and foremost a . family man, devoted to his wife Frances, also a teacher, and their four . children, and played an active role in the life of the Catholic parish . at his home in Ealing, west London. After his death, Mrs Lawrence was to say she had been deprived of her 'rock'. Chindamo, who came to Britain aged . six, was jailed indefinitely for the murder in 1996 and ordered to serve . a minimum term of 12 years. In 2007 the youth, whose mother is . Filipino and father Italian, became the subject of further outrage when a . court ruled he could not be deported on release because he had family . in London. Official papers handed to the courts at around the same time revealed he posed a 'genuine and present risk' to the public. Mrs Lawrence protested strongly . against the decision and said she faced a campaign of intimidation to . warn her against speaking out. She went on to say the authorities . would not inform her where Chindamo was living and felt his rights . seemed to be put above hers. Chindamo, who always claimed he was the victim of mistaken identity, walked free from jail last July. He was recalled to prison on licence . after he was arrested at his home in Catford, south London, on suspicion . of robbery on November 24 of which he has now been acquitted.","Frances Lawrence, the widow of the murdered headmaster, wished her husband's killer 'a happier, calmer future' after he was acquitted ."

DNA test results today confirmed a baby boy who disappeared eight years ago is the child of the couple who reported him missing, but doubts have now been raised as to whether or not they gave the boy away with their other children. Fernando Morin and Auboni Champion-Morin, from Houston, Texas, are seeking to regain custody of the child, Miguel, who's been in foster care since last week. They declined to answer questions about why their other four children are no longer in their custody and haven't been for years, but said they wanted to focus on Miguel . A woman described by officials as the child's godmother and former neighbor, Krystle Tanner, is jailed in San Augustine in East Texas for his alleged kidnapping but officials are trying to discern whether or not her was given up. Found: Miguel Morin, left, went missing in 2004 while being babysat by his godmother Krystle Tanner, right . Biological parents: Fernando Morin, center, and Auboni Champion-Morin, right, speak to the media after an emergency court hearing Wednesday to reveal the results of the DNA tests . Tanner faces a kidnapping charge related to the child's disappearance in late 2004, when he was eight-months-old. State District Judge Mike Schneider, . who ordered the DNA testing at an emergency custody hearing last week, . is set to hold another hearing in the case next week. Child welfare officials last week . said Morin and Champion-Morin, both 29, were uncooperative with . investigators when the boy initially was reported missing. The parents . deny the allegations. Another couple told Houston . television station KHOU on Tuesday that they've been caring for the four . other Morin children, who are between the ages of seven and 14. They said Champion-Morin gave the children to them years ago and that they are the legal guardians. Champion-Morin, emerging from a . courtroom on Wednesday, wouldn't discuss the TV station report: 'Right . now, everything's a private matter. I'm not going there right now with . any of the news.' Suspicions: Questions are being asked about whether or not the Morins have their son up or if he was kidnapped from them by his godmother . Child Protective Services spokeswoman . Gwen Carter said the situation involving the other children is part of . the child welfare agency's investigation into the outcome of Miguel's . custody. 'In regard to the other children, . there's no current concern about their safety and well-being,' Carter . said. 'But in the normal course of investigating, we talk to siblings to . find out what may be going on.' Last week, Champion-Morin implied her . four children were at home and looking forward to becoming acquainted . with their long-missing brother. She said she and the children would celebrate Miguel's birthday each year and pray for his safe return. Officials have disclosed in court that Miguel, in interviews with child welfare authorities, said his name was Jaquan. They said the eight-year-old didn't . know his last name, thought he was 6 years old and identified Tanner as . his mother when shown a picture of her. The officials described the boy as . well-mannered and said he told them he attended school but couldn't read . and couldn't name his teacher or any classmates. They said there was no . evidence he was enrolled in school. CPS spokeswoman: Estella Olguin spoke to the media to confirm that Mr Morin was the biological father of the boy . The long-dormant case got new life last summer when Tanner took the boy to a hospital for treatment of a leg injury. When she couldn't provide his name or . a Social Security number, hospital staff became concerned and contacted . child welfare investigators who eventually were able to link Tanner to . the 2004 Houston case. Tanner was arrested March 12. Her . sister, after seeing reports about the arrest, called police the next . day and offered to turn over the child she believed was Tanner's . stepson. Gary Cunningham, chief deputy for the . San Augustine County Sheriff's Department, said Wednesday the case . remained under investigation and that Tanner, who was being held without . bond, was not available for interviews with reporters.","Miguel Morin was abducted in 2004 when he was eight-months-old .

Robert Bales faces the death penalty after being charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder . U.S. investigators believe the U.S. soldier accused of killing 17 Afghan civilians split the slaughter into two episodes, returning to his base after the first attack and later slipping away to kill again. This scenario seems to support the U.S. government's assertion - contested by some Afghans - that the killings were done by one person, since they would have been perpetrated over a longer period of time than assumed when Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales was detained March 11 outside his base in southern Afghanistan. But it also raises new questions about how Bales, who was formally charged Friday with 17 counts of premeditated murder and other crimes, could have carried out the nighttime attacks without drawing attention from any Americans on the Kandahar province base. The two American officials who disclosed the investigators' finding spoke on condition of anonymity because the politically sensitive probe is ongoing. Many details about the killings, including a possible motive, have not been made public. The documents released by the U.S. military Friday in connection with the murder charges do not include a timeline or a narrative of what is alleged to have happened. Bales, 38, is accused of killing nine Afghan children and eight adults. The bodies were found in Balandi and Alkozai villages - one north and one south of the base, in Kandahar's Panjwai district. Bales, a married father of two, was on his fourth tour of duty in Iraq and had been injured his lawyers say. The charge of premeditated murder means prosecutors believe the massacre was pre planned . Bales also was charged with six counts of attempted murder and six counts of assault in the same case. U.S. investigators now believe that . Bales walked off his base that night and killed several people in one of . the villages, then went back to the base. The American officials, who . are privy to some details of the investigation, said they do not know . why Bales returned, how long he stayed or what he did while there. Tears of grief: An Afghan youth mourns for his relatives, who were allegedly killed by the U.S. service member . Horrific: The bodies of an elderly Afghan man and a child killed in the Alkozai village of Panjwayi district are shown wrapped in blankets . He then slipped off the base a second . time and killed civilians in the second village before again heading . back toward the base. It was while he was returning the second time that . a U.S. military search party spotted him. He is reported to have . surrendered without a struggle. Bales is being held in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. There have been previous suggestions . that Bales could have returned to base after the first set of shootings, . but the American officials who spoke to The Associated Press on . Saturday provided the first official disclosure that U.S. investigators . have come to this conclusion. Empty: The couple's Bonney Lake, Washington home was put on the market . for $229,000. Bales' wife and two children have been moved to Joint Base . Lewis McChord in Tacoma . Members of the Afghan delegation . investigating the killings said one Afghan guard working from midnight . to 2 a.m. on March 11 saw a U.S. soldier return to the base around 1:30 . a.m. Another Afghan soldier who replaced the first and worked until 4 . a.m. said he saw a U.S. soldier leave the base at 2:30 a.m. It's unknown . whether the two Afghan guards saw the same U.S. soldier. U.S. officials have said Bales left . the base the first time armed with his 9mm pistol and M-4 rifle, which . was outfitted with a grenade launcher. Bales' civilian attorney, John Henry . Browne, said Friday that he believes the government will have a hard . time proving its case and that his client's mental state will become an . important issue. Browne has said Bales suffered from the stress of . serving four combat tours. The decision to charge Bales with . premeditated murder suggests that prosecutors believe they have . sufficient evidence that he consciously conceived the killings. The maximum punishment for a . premeditated murder conviction is death. The mandatory minimum sentence . is life imprisonment with the chance of parole.","Investigators believe the U.S soldier struck twice - returning to his base between killings .

"By . Liz Hull . UPDATED: . 04:48 EST, 20 January 2012 . A married policeman who ‘used his uniform’ to attract women for sex while on duty has been sacked. In one case, PC Troy Van-Eda, 44, took charity support worker Joanne Pinder, 34, into a police station boiler room after pulling her over for failing to wear a seat belt. The couple began a six-year affair during which Van-Eda often visited her at home for intimate relations while he was supposed to be working. Dismissed: PC Troy Van-Eda has been sacked from Greater Manchester Police for having sex with five women while on duty . But when Miss Pinder discovered she was . just one of five women he had bedded while at work, she reported him to . his bosses at Greater Manchester Police, who launched an investigation. Van-Eda denied the allegations, claiming he was the victim of malicious . lies. But at a disciplinary hearing this week, a panel of senior . officers dismissed his version of events and he was sacked for gross . misconduct. He plans to appeal. Liaison: Joanne Pinder claimed she had sex with Mr Van-Eda in the boiler room of Littleborough Police Station, near Rochdale . Last night Miss Pinder, of Rochdale, revealed how she fell for Van-Eda . after he pulled her over for not wearing a seat belt in April 2004. ‘He asked me to get into his van. We started talking and I asked if he . was going to do me for the seat belt.

We had sex in the . boiler room and the relationship went on from there.’ Miss Pinder told the hearing Van-Eda visited her at home while on duty . and that they also slept together at Milnrow police station in the town. Three years into their affair, Van-Eda confessed that he was married with three children, but separated from his wife. Appeal: Van-Eda poses for a photograph with his current fiancée Rachael Smith . Miss Pinder stood by him until June 2010, when she discovered he was . seeing another woman, who claimed she was engaged to him. Miss Pinder . confronted Van-Eda and ended the affair. ‘Then, a short time later, I . discovered he had been sleeping with other women,’ she said. Love note: Van-Eda sent this message to his lover Joanne Pinder . ‘From that moment, it all snowballed. I got phone numbers of other women . who claimed he had been with them on duty and I made a formal . complaint.’ Van-Eda, a former special constable with West Yorkshire Police, was . accused of gross misconduct but allowed to continue working on . restricted duties while an investigation was carried out. Five women who claimed to have slept with him gave evidence at the two-day hearing into his conduct. Miss Pinder said: ‘He used his police uniform to feed his obsession with women.’ Manchester Assistant Chief Constable, Dawn Copley, said: ‘This officer’s . behaviour was completely unacceptable.

Bubba, a big-hitting golfer, won the Masters after hitting a dramatic 250-yard shot on his way to victory on an extraordinary final day at Augusta. He defeated South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen on the second hole in a play-off to win his first major title.

Millions of Ryanair passengers face forking out even more money for their flight this summer, even though they have already booked and paid for it. The budget airline is threatening to impose a surcharge on flights back from Spanish airports in an escalating row over airport fees. This week, the airline sent an email to customers warning them of the backdated cost. Unwelcome news: Ryanair is threatening to impose a surcharge on flights to Spain in an escalating row over airport fees. It means millions of people who have already paid in full for their summer flights to the country, may have for fork out even more money . 'We may be forced to debit passengers for any government imposed increases in airport charges prior to your travel date,' its message read. 'If any such tax, fee or charge is introduced or increased after your reservation has been made you will be obliged to pay it (or any increase) prior to departure.' Ryanair, is now the leading airline between the UK and Spain so the charges could affect millions of people who have already booked their summer flights. It will apply to all airports in Spain, but passengers travelling from Madrid and Barcelona are expected to be hit hardest with the steepest passenger tax fees. If the proposed fees are introduced, they will only apply to passengers leaving from a Spanish airport - passengers on a flight to Spain will not be charged. According to Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s . chief executive, the Spanish government is currently considering . proposals to double fees at the country’s two main airports in Madrid . and Barcelona. Controversial decision: Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary pictured earlier this week at the budget airline's hotel launch, said 'We're not going to be funding the Spanish government's taxes' The budget airline does not shy away from passing costs on to their passengers. They offer a range of additional extras, which some airlines do not charge for. They include: . Priority boarding -  passenger gets to the front of the boarding queue and boards the aircraft first. Fee only applies per passenger/ per one way flight - £5Admin fee - this is charged for costs associated with Ryanair’s booking system- £6Reserved seating - this means passengers are guaranteed a seat with fellow reserved seated passengers in their travel group £10Infant equipment - this could apply to children's travel equipment such as a booster seat - £10 . Luggage allowance One 15kg bag, low season, booked in advance £15-£20 (depending on destination) One 15kg bag, low season, booked in advance - £25-£30 . Second 15kg bag - up to £50Musical instrument - £50Flight change fee - £50Oxygen reservation fee - this for passengers who need to travel with an oxygen tank -£100Name change fee - £110 . 'It’s a bit uncertain at the moment but it looks like the Spanish government are going to double the airport fees overnight the day the budget gets passed. We have already taken a number of millions of bookings for passengers intending to travel to these airports this summer and if they double the taxes we will be sending them a bill for the increase taxes or debiting their debit and credit cards,' said Mr O’Leary to The Independent. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: . 'The Spanish budget proposes to double passenger charges at Madrid and Barcelona airports, as well as imposing smaller increases at other Spanish airports.  It appears that these increases will become effective immediately after the budget is passed and any passengers who have already booked to travel later this summer will have to pay these higher fees, if the budget is approved by the Spanish parliament.' Airlines are legally within their rights to take money from customers who have already paid, but the decision to impose airport charges has not been finalised. British Airways has announced it will absorb any increase. Mr O’Leary said passengers who object would get a full refund: 'You can of course reject that additional payment, cancel your flight and then not fly with us if you so wish.  But we’re not going to be funding the Spanish government’s taxes,' he told the newspaper. The budget airline does not shy away from passing costs on to their passengers. Earlier this month in a somewhat controversial move, Ryanair spokesperson Stephen . McNamara said Ryanair staff had been asked to consider their own body . weight in a bid to reduce aircraft weight and avoid hefty industry . costs. The budget airline also recently announced it . is to reduce the size of its in-flight magazine, serve less ice in . drinks and encourage its staff not to pile on the pounds. The latest policy will see the airline's . in-flight magazine 'Let's Go with Ryanair' being reduced from an A4 to . an A5 format and it will also double as a menu, which could save . thousands of pounds in fuel thanks to the reduced amount of paper used. The low-cost carrier also estimates it will save more than £400,000 in printing costs. Other . measures implemented include cutting the amount of ice taken on board a . flight, and reducing the weight of trolleys and seats. In the past Ryanair has floated many controversial cost-saving ideas. Inspiration: Ryanair claims it encourages staff not to pile on the pounds with the lure of appearing in its annual calendar . Cut price airline: Last month Ryanair announced it is to reduce the size of its in-flight magazine, left and serve less ice in drinks, right,  in a bid to makes savings . Ryanair revolution: How the vertical airline seats might look - they were refused by an unnamed regulator in February this year . One of them was to remove conventional seating and offering air passengers just standing room. Instead of being allocated a seat, Ryanair travellers would perch on a narrow shelf and lean against a flat padded backboard. A Boeing 737-800 would be fitted out with 15 rows of seats and 10 rows of standing berths and passengers would be restrained with a strap stretching over their shoulder, the budget airline said. Mr O'Leary, said the refitted plane would resemble a classic London Underground train with its distinctive ball-and-strap fittings. The Ryanair boss said seated passengers would be charged £25 per ticket and standing customers would pay between £1 and £5 for their fares - it would boost the average capacity of a flight from 189 passengers to 230. But in February, Ryanair announced that an unnamed regulator had halted its plan, by refusing an application for test flights. Mr O'Leary said he was undeterred by the refusal and declared 'I think ultimately it would happen.' The airline also faced an outcry in 2009 over plans to charge passengers a pound to visit the plane toilet, in a bid to limit loo facilities on the aircraft and replace them with extra seats. The plans to ‘charge a pound to spend a penny’ have now been dropped, Mr O’Leary said last year. Ryanair has also suggested it could put passengers in the hull, in bunks and has called for flights with only one pilot instead of the usual two. Ryanair says that while it is trying to save on fuel, it will not pass on fuel surcharges to customers as happens with other airlines such as BA and Virgin Atlantic. 'Fuel is an integral part of the fare – you can’t fly passengers anywhere without it,' said Mr McNamara. 'We would rather make cost reductions and charge passengers for other services.'","Ryanair sent emails to passengers this week booked to fly to Spanish airports about possible passenger tax fee increases .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:28 EST, 29 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:52 EST, 30 April 2012 . Hunted: Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes . Three international armies have zeroed in on Joseph Kony, one of the world's most wanted warlords, to a remote African village. Obo was the first place in the Central African Republic that Kony's Lord's Resistance Army attacked in 2008. Today, it is one of four forward operating locations where U.S. special forces have paired up with local troops and Ugandan soldiers to seek out Kony, who is believed likely to be hiding out in the rugged terrain northwest of the town. For seven years he has been wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity after his forces cut a wide and bloody swath across several central African nations with rapes, abductions and killings. Part of the LRA's success in eluding government forces has been its ability to slip back and forth over the porous borders of the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Congo. But since late last year, U.S. forces have been providing intelligence, looking at patterns of movement, and setting up better communications to link the countries' forces together so that they can better track the guerrilla force. Sent by President Barack Obama at the end of 2011, the 100 U.S. soldiers are split up about 15 to 30 per base, bringing in American technology and experience to assist local forces. Exact details on specific improvements that the American forces have brought to the table, however, are classified, to avoid giving Kony the ability to take countermeasures. On the trail: U.S. Army special forces Captain Gregory, from Texas (center) speaks with troops from the Central African Republic and Uganda, in Obo . 'We don't necessarily go and track . into the bush but what we do is we incorporate our experiences with the . partner nation's experiences to come up with the right solution to go . out and hopefully solve this LRA problem,' said Gregory, a 29-year-old . captain from Texas, who would only give his first name in accordance . with security guidelines. The U.S. troops also receive reports . from local hunters and others that they help analyze together with . surveillance information. 'It's very easy to blame everything on the LRA but there are other players in the region - there are poachers, there are bandits, and we have to sift that to filter what is LRA,' he said. Central African Republic soldiers largely conduct security operations in and around the town, while Ugandan soldiers, who have been in the country since 2010, conduct longer-range patrols looking for Kony and his men. Since January, they have killed seven LRA fighters in the area and captured one, while rescuing 15 people abducted by the group including five children, said their local commander, Colonel Joseph Balikuddembe. Horrific: Kony's guerilla army has abducted . thousands of children in central Africa to join it, forcing them to . commit horrific acts of violence . There has been no contact with the LRA since March, however, according to Ugandan Army spokesman Colonel Felix Kulayigye, who said the LRA now is in survival mode. The LRA is thought to today number only around 150 to 300 die-hard fighters. 'They're hiding,' he said. 'They are not capable of doing.' But with Kony still around, there are wide ranging-fears that the LRA will be able to rebuild. 'There's periods of time when the LRA will lie low when the military pressure is too high or where there's a threat that they don't understand such as the American intervention,' said Matthew Brubacher, a political affairs officer with the UN's mission in Congo, who was also an International Criminal Court investigator on the Kony case for five years. 'But then after a while after they figure it out, if they have the opportunity they'll try to come back, so it's just a matter of time they'll try to come back. Kony always said ''if I have only 10 men, I can always rebuild the force.''' Scarred: Kony's LRA has ordered his young army to carry out acts of mutilation on the faces of other youngsters . Right now, expectations are high of the Americans serving in Obo and Djema in the Central African Republic, as well as those in Dungu in Congo and Nzara in South Sudan. 'For all the communities, the U.S. bases in Obo and Djema means one, Kony will be arrested, and two, there will be a lot of money for programs, humanitarian programs,' said Sabine Jiekak of the Italian humanitarian aid agency Coopi. Central African Republic Deputy Defense Minister Jean Francis Bozize said it's been difficult for the poor country's small military to deal with Kony in the southeast as well as several other militant groups in the north. Target: Jason Russell, co-founder of Invisible Children and director of Kony 2012 viral video campaign . An African Union mission expected to begin later this year should help expedite the cross-border pursuit of the LRA. In the meantime, Bozize said the American forces could make a big difference . 'The involvement of U.S. forces with their assistance in providing information and intelligence will allow for all forces to operate from the same base-level of intelligence ... (giving) better coordination with better results,' he told reporters in the capital, Bangui. But the military mission is not a simple one. How do you find small groups of seasoned fighters hidden deep in the jungle, who have eluded authorities for decades? How do you prevent brutal reprisal attacks on civilians? How can you bring together several countries' troops to cooperate on cross-border pursuits? The LRA usually attacks late at night, then melts back away into the jungle. Seasoned bush fighters, they employ many techniques to elude pursuit - walking along rocks or along streams to avoid leaving tracks, for example, and sometimes even marching backward to fool trackers. Kony has reportedly stopped using . radios and satellite phones for communications, instead relying on an . elaborate system involving runners and multiple rendezvous points. Key . to his capture is good information from local residents - which they . will only give when they can be sure of their own safety, according to . American commanders. 'The . population have to believe that they are secure and once they believe . they are secure from the LRA, you start to deny the LRA the opportunity . to attack villages to get people, to get food, to get medicine,' said . General Carter Ham, the head of U.S. Africa Command. That . may take some time in Obo, a town of some 15,000 where around 3,500 . people have sought refuge to escape LRA violence in the area. Rural . farmers and others stick to within three miles of the village for . safety - originally the area that Central African Republic soldiers were . able to patrol but now more a rule of thumb followed by the locals. Out there: Northern Uganda where Kony was believed to be hiding with members of the Lord's Resistance Army . They've started recently to venture out farther, emboldened by the presence of the Ugandans and Americans to help the government forces, but are too nervous to stray too wide from the safety of the village. 'They're still scared, they're still wary because Joseph Kony is still out there,' said Mayor Joseph Kpioyssrani, looking at the jungle behind him. Kony's LRA sprung up in 1986 as a rebel movement among the Acholi people in northern Uganda to fight against the Kampala government, but has for decades been leading its violent campaign without any clear political ideology. Emmanuel Daba, 33, was one of 76 people abducted in the first LRA raid on Obo in 2008 and forced to fight for the guerrillas for two years before managing to escape. 'We were trained to kill - forced to kill - otherwise we'd be killed ourselves,'he said outside the tiny radio station where he now works broadcasting messages to try and encourage others with the LRA to defect or escape. 'I still have dreams - nightmares.' This year, the U.S. Defense Department is committing $35 million to efforts to find and fight Kony. Difficult terrain: The African rebel leader is now being hunted a team of international soldiers . Since 2008, the U.S. State Department has sent some $50 million in funds to support the Ugandan military's logistics and non-lethal operations against the LRA, including contracting two transport helicopters to ferry troops and supplies. Another $500 million has been given over that time for the broader northern Uganda recovery effort in the aftermath of Kony's presence there. In Stuttgart, Ham keeps a Kony 2012 poster hanging on his office door. Though he isn't committing to the goal of the viral YouTube campaign to see Kony neutralized by the end of the year, he does define success as either capturing or killing the LRA leader eventually. 'I'm confident that the mission will be successful, but I can't give you a timeline when that's going to occur...' Ham said. 'It is one of those organizations that if you remove the senior leader and the small number of those who surround him, I believe this is one of those organizations that will not be able to regenerate.'",Wanted by International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity .

A mother who recruited women outside her children’s school to take part in one of Britain’s biggest ever sham marriage plots was jailed with her partner yesterday. Andzelina Surmaj befriended the Eastern European women at the school gate before Milan Cina matched them with Nigerian illegal immigrants who paid thousands for a marriage certificate enabling them to stay in Britain. The couple, who both came to Britain from Eastern Europe, passed only a fraction of the money to the brides, keeping the rest – as much as £26,000 – for themselves. 'Bad soap opera': Reverend Ireland was duped into marrying Maria Pretczynska and Lukman Durojaye . Scam: Andzelina Surmaj, left, befriended Eastern European women at the school gate before Milan Cina, right, matched them with Nigerian illegal immigrants who paid thousands for marriage certificates . So far 32 ‘brides’ and ‘grooms’ involved in the scam have been locked up for a total of 33-and-a-half years, with many facing deportation. Investigators from the UK Border Agency, meanwhile, pieced together evidence against the organisers, including incriminating photographs of them lurking in the background of several ceremonies. Yesterday Cina, 38, was jailed for five years for organising the weddings, while mother-of-four Surmaj, 30 – who is on the run after failing to attend court – was given three years and eight months. Judge Beverley Lunt  called the plot ‘a well-organised, commercial enterprise designed to defeat the immigration laws of this country’. Fake: Surmaj and Cina admitted their part in arranging six sham marriages. But it is thought they could have been involved in around 40 bogus ceremonies in all. Pictured is the parish church of St. Peter in Accrington, where some of marriages occurred . She told Burnley Crown Court Cina had picked churches in Accrington, Lancashire, for many of the weddings because he was counting on lax checks by local vicars. ‘Sadly, you were all too correct,’ she added. She rejected Surmaj’s claim not to have known the seriousness of the crimes, accusing the pair of ‘callously’ taking advantage of the Eastern European women’s desperation for money. The pair are thought to have been in Britain for more than a decade. A claim for asylum by Surmaj had been rejected, but she won the right to stay after her native Poland joined the EU. Cina – Czech-born and the father of the second of her four children – came here 12 years ago. He did occasional work as a handyman, using bogus identities to stay ‘under the radar’ of the authorities. Sham: Jozef Badzo and Mercy Idehen during their 'wedding' ceremony which was organised by Andzelina Surmaj and Milan Cina . Bogus: This image shows another of the fake marriages. Pictured are, left to right, Milan Cina, Adegboyega Adekunle and Andzelina Surmaj . The pair are suspected of organising 18 sham marriages at four churches in Lancashire and Manchester, although a total of 44 ceremonies have been investigated. Surmaj, who lived on benefits, befriended Eastern European women as she picked up her children from Whetley Primary School in Bradford. Once she had their trust, she persuaded them to take part in bogus marriages with West Africans in return for between £1,000 and £2,000 – although in reality, many were paid only a fraction of that. Meanwhile, Cina operated in a shady world where illegal immigrants handed over bundles of cash to fixers who could arrange wedding ceremonies. By marrying EU citizens, the Africans would win residency in Britain, including the right to work and claim benefits. The pair arranged transport to the . churches and dresses for the brides. Clergy were duped with false . passports and forged utility bills linking the ‘bride and groom’ with a . fictitious address in  the parish. False: Jozef Badzo and Mercy Idehen in a picture submitted with a UKBA residency application to appear to show their relationship following a sham wedding . In some cases, the pair even arranged ‘marriages’ involving established immigrant couples. For example, Cina found a ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ for Nigerians Omorodian Idehen and his partner Mercy Idehen. Mercy Idehen’s 2009 marriage to Josef Badzo was witnessed by Badzo’s partner Maria Pretczynska, who had in turn ‘married’ another Nigerian, Lukman Durojaye, in Levenshulme, Manchester, the year before. Investigators said the resulting tangled web was like ‘the plot of a bad soap opera’. Cina and Surmaj both pleaded guilty to assisting unlawful immigration. Surmaj also admitted making a false statement by signing a church register and possessing a fake identity card. Judge Lunt issued a warrant for Surmaj’s arrest. Legal proceedings to strip the pair of their ill-gotten gains will be held at a later date.","Charged illegal .

A disabled woman who says easyJet made her feel like a ‘social outcast’ by ordering her off a plane is taking the British budget airline to court in France. Wheelchair-bound Marie-Patricia Hoarau, 40, was told she could not take the flight from Paris to Nice because she was a ‘safety risk’. The airline is now facing charges of discrimination for the ‘humiliation’ Hoarau says she suffered. Wheelchair-bound Marie-Patricia Hoarau, 40, was told she could not take the flight from Paris to Nice because she was a 'safety risk' The legal action comes just two months after Easyjet was fined £60,000 by a Paris court for barring three other ‘unsafe’ disabled passengers from flights. Miss Hoarau, a paraplegic since a cycling accident 20 years ago, said she was allowed to travel unaccompanied on her outbound flight to Paris in March 2010. But when she boarded the plane to return to Nice, she was ordered back to the check-in desk because she did not have a ‘helper’. A fellow passenger offered to take on the role, but cabin crew refused because they had not checked in together. She was taken off the plane and given a free ticket on the next flight, while check-in staff found another passenger willing to accompany her. Ms Hoarau said: ‘I was allowed to board the plane alone, but once I was inside, they told me I couldn’t travel because I didn’t have a helper. ‘I try to cope with this disability every day and being ordered off like that in front of my fellow passengers was a slap in the face. ‘I felt humiliated and like a pariah who has no place in society.’ She added: ‘I am still waiting for a personal apology from EasyJet. ‘Their boss said he was sorry for my unpleasant experience, but only in a press release. I received no phone call from them.’ France’s disabled rights association the APF said: ‘We are looking for an exemplary sentence against Easyjet for discriminating against this woman because of her handicap.’ Easyjet’s French lawyer Philippe van der Meulen said ahead of today’s hearing at the Paris correctional court that the airline had not intended to discriminate against Miss Hoarau. He added: ‘Britain is one of the only countries in Europe to have a code of good conduct in cases like this. ‘We fly 350,000 people of reduced mobility every year, and less than one per cent of them are accompanied. ‘In this particular case, it was judged that that the woman was not sufficiently autonomous to fly alone.’ Easyjet’s French director Francois Bacchetta after Miss Hoarau launched her legal action: ‘I understand her feelings but we must respect very strict safety regulations. 'In the event of an emergency, we need to be able to evacuate all passengers in 90 seconds. ‘When a disabled passenger checks in alone, we try to find them a helper but we prefer for this to be done at the check-in.’ In January, Easyjet was fined for refusing to allow three paraplegic passengers aboard flights in Paris in 2008 and 2009. The French transport ministry said after that ruling, in August 2010: ‘EasyJet cannot hide behind safety regulations for refusing to board passengers who have difficulty moving around.’","Paraplegic, 40, was due to fly from Paris to Milan ."

"51 percent of company currently owned by Spain's Repsol . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:11 EST, 17 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:19 EST, 17 April 2012 . Argentine president Cristina Fernandez has begun moves to renationalise the country’s largest oil company, risking a major row with Spain.Fernandez hopes to take a majority stake in oil and gas company YPF by taking control of 51 percent of its shares currently held by Spain's Repsol.Both Repsol and Spain strongly oppose the move and have warned that it could turn Argentina into an international pariah. Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez - next to an image of former first lady Eva Peron to whom she has been compared - outlines a controversial plan renationalise the country's largest oil company YFP . YPF recently found a huge unconventional oil and natural gas reserve but it is under pressure from Fernandez's government to raise output while its shares have plunged in recent months on fears of possible state intervention.Argentina this year expects to import more than $10 billion worth of gas and natural liquid gas to address an energy crisis even though it is an oil-producing nation, according to estimates from the hydrocarbon sector.'We are the only country in Latin America, and I would say in practically the entire world, that doesn't manage its own natural resources,' Fernandez said. She said her proposal 'was not a model of statism' but 'the recovery of sovereignty'. Critics blame the government for an energy shortage and high gasoline prices but Fernandez said the shortage is the result of Repsol's 'emptying' of YPF, and that Argentina had a deficit of $3 billion last year partly due to energy imports.Argentines gathered in Buenos Aires' main square shouting slogans, waving national flags and carrying banners supporting the government takeover. One of them read: 'Today, with Cristina, we recovered YPF.' Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner holds a test tube containing petrol. She said the move would be a sign of 'recovering of sovereignty' YPF was privatized in the 1990s and Repsol's subsidiary in Argentina holds 57 percent of YPF's shares.Fernandez said the renationalisation was a long-held desire of her late husband and predecessor, former President Nestor Kirchner.'I hope he's watching over me because he always wanted to recover YPF for the country,' she said.But analysts said the planned takeover risks alienating foreign investors and prompting retaliation from Spain's government.Emilio Apud, a former Argentine energy secretary who now works as a consultant, said: 'It is a bad decision. It gives the Argentine government a bad image'.Apud also called the proposed law 'a bad way to treat friendly governments like Spain'.In Madrid, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo called the move arbitrary, and said it broke the climate of cordiality and friendship that had existed with Argentina.He said Spain would respond with 'forceful measures' he did not describe.The European Commission has warned that nationalizing YPF would be bad for the investment climate in Argentina, and has said it backs Spain in the standoff over the subsidiary.Fernandez, however, was unmoved by the risk of a row with Spain, Argentina's largest foreign investor. Antonio Brufau, chairman of Spanish oil major Repsol gives a news conference after the announcement in Argentina. The proposal would leave Repsol with just a little more than 6 percent of YPF's shares . 'This president is not going to answer any threat, is not going to respond to any sharp remark.'I am a head of state and not a hoodlum,' said Fernandez, who has also renationalized the country's Aerolineas Argentinas airline and nationalized the Anses state private pension funds.There was no explanation of how, or how much, Repsol and its stockholders would be compensated. Analysts say that the government might have to use Central Bank reserves, or funds from the Anses to pay for the takeover. YPF is under pressure from Fernandez's government to raise output while its shares have plunged in recent months on fears of possible state intervention . 'The issue that scares investors is not knowing how far the governmental participation will go, if it's only YPF or if it is going to include other petroleum companies in Argentina,' said Joe Amador, Latin America director for Scotia Waterous, the oil and gas arm of Scotiabank, in Houston, Texas.Even with its share prices depressed, YPF last week was valued at $13.6 billion, and buying half of that would deplete Argentina's treasury of funds it needs to maintain the populist subsidies that have kept the country's economy afloat.Repsol released a statement promising to protect the interests of its shareholders. It called the move 'unlawful and gravely discriminatory'.Spanish officials had earlier protested the plan, saying Argentina risks becoming 'an international pariah' if it takes control of Repsol' subsidiary, Repsol YPF SA.Spain's foreign minister last week summoned Argentine Ambassador Carlo Antonio Bettini to convey concern over possible nationalization of YPF, which represents 42 percent of Repsol's total reserves, estimated at 2.1 billion barrels of crude.Mexico's Economy Minister Bruno Ferrari said in recent days that Spain had requested that Mexico intervene in the row with Argentina over Repsol-YPF SA. But Ferrari said Mexico's role in the dispute is still to be determined. 'We will hold talks with Spain over the next days to exactly determine what Mexico can do,' he said ahead of the World Economic Forum on Latin America 2012 that will be held in the coastal city of Puerto Vallarta.At the forum on Monday, Mexican President Felipe Calderon criticised Argentina's move, calling it 'not very responsible and not very rational.' People hold up a banner that reads in Spanish ""We are going for all YPF"" during a demonstration in support of a bill proposed by Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez . In contrast, Venezuela's foreign ministry issued a statement voicing support for Fernandez's decision to renationalise YPF. Venezuela's state oil company also supported the Argentine decision and said it is willing to help strengthen Argentina's oil industry,'Venezuela puts all its technical, operational, legal and political experience of Petroleos de Venezuela at the disposition of the government of Argentina and its people to strenthen the state oil sector,' the foreign ministry said.Governors of oil-producing Argentine provinces have withdrawn about 15 oil leases, representing 18 percent of YPF's crude production, alleging the company failed to keep its promises to develop them. YPF has countered that it has invested millions in those areas and plans to increase production, but Argentine officials have said that still falls short.How Argentina may try to displace Repsol has been the subject of wide speculation since the government's pressure campaign began in February.The president's proposal would leave Repsol with just a little more than 6 percent of YPF's shares.Fernandez put Federal Planning Minister Julio de Vido and Economics Vice Minister Axel Kicillof in charge of handling the expropriation.The president's proposal declares that the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons is 'of national public interest' and declares that building up the nation's supply is a priority. People, carring a banner with the colors of the Argentine flag that reads in Spanish ""YPF belongs to the Argentines,"" demonstrate in support of a bill . Spain will decide specific measures against Argentina's decision to seize control of leading energy company YPF, a unit of Spanish oil major Repsol, at cabinet meeting on Friday, according to its foreign minister. Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is currently in Mexico for the World Economic Forum. Spain has promised 'clear and strong' action against Argentina for its nationalisation of YPF, but other companies and countries have found it difficult to exert concrete pressure on Argentina on similar matters. 'The most effective sanction in this world... is the loss of global investor confidence,' Foreign Minister Jose Manual Garcia-Margallo said. 'Argentina has shot itself in the foot,' he said. In March, U.S. President Barack Obama said he would suspend trade benefits for Argentina because of its non-payment of settlements ordered by a body of the World Bank.",51 percent of company currently owned by Spain's Repsol .

The video asks viewers to sign an online petition to Asma Assad asking that she take a risk and 'stand up for peace ... for the sake of your people'. Plea: The open letter appeals directly to Bashar Assad's wife Asma . Huberta von Voss-Wittig, wife of Germany's U.N. Ambassador Peter Wittig, and Sheila Lyall Grant, wife of Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, said in a letter accompanying the video that Asma Assad's 'public voice is needed'. The video, released today, alternates pictures of the stylish British-born Asma Assad with scenes of Syria's conflict and its victims. Bashar Assad's regime has been using force for more than a year to try to put down a public uprising. The French foreign minister today said international sanctions targeting Syria's repressive regime had depleted its foreign currency reserves by half - and Damascus is actively trying to evade them. Alain Juppe called for a solid international response to such Syrian 'manoeuvres' as he opened a Paris meeting of some 57 countries, including Arab League states, to reinforce sanctions against Syrian President Bashar Assad. In an effort to ramp up the pressure in the face of a faltering cease-fire, Juppe plans to hold a meeting of core members of the Friends of Syria on Thursday, a French diplomatic source said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the foreign ministers of Qatar and Turkey are among the invitees. The aim is to send a 'firm message' to Assad's regime, which has only partially complied with the truce aimed at ending 13 months of violence, the source said on condition of anonymity because the details of the meeting were still being finalised. The international community has tried a variety of ways to pressure Assad's regime into ending its crackdown, including financial sanctions, the subject of Tuesday's meeting. The actual size of Syria's foreign currency reserves isn't known, but it was believed to be around $17 billion at the start of the uprising in March 2011. Juppe didn't specify how much of Syria's finances were impacted by sanctions, but said 'our information' is that they have been cut in half.

Parents living near a new Midlands prison say they are ‘disgusted’ by the news that sex offenders will be released into the community on day visits. It has emerged that prisoners at HMP Oakwood, near Wolverhampton are to be permitted to leave the £200million jail to spend time with their families. The ‘town visits’ will form part of a rehabilitation programme and be run by private security firm G4S. Costly: New HMP Oakwood prison near Wolverhampton where sex offenders could be released on day visits to mix with the local community . Rules state that each prisoner will undergo a strict risk assessment before being allowed out of the jail on day trips. But families living close to the jail said they knew nothing of the plan. A parent of a pupil at a nearby school, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘I am disgusted with this. No one has informed us that these fiends will be free to walk around the area close to schools and other public places.’ HMP Oakwood director Steve Holland confirmed sex offenders would be housed at the jail and said G4S was negotiating to implement treatment programmes for the prisoners concerned. He insisted the prisoners would be vetted before they were included on the town visits programme. Mark Leech, editor of the Prisoners’ Handbook, said residents living near the jail had clearly been unaware that sex offenders would be walking the streets as part of their rehabilitation. He said: ‘Neighbouring residents have been complaining about extra traffic and a lack of public transport for staff and visitors, but it seems they have missed the point with their fears about the prison,’ he said. ‘They have obviously not realised that these inmates will be roaming the area with their families to prepare them for release.’ Confident: Prison director Steve Holland says every prisoner will undergo an assessment before they are permitted to leave the prison grounds for day trips with their family . The first prisoners arrived at Oakwood yesterday. The prison houses category C inmates, defined as those who cannot be trusted in open conditions but are considered unlikely to make a determined escape attempt. Mr Leech, who served time for robbery and is now a successful businessman, added: ‘I welcome the opening of HMP Oakwood, because it will help to ease overcrowding in the West Midlands and enable more prisoners from the region to be closer to their families. ‘However as a Category C Prison taking convicted sex offenders, residents need to know that these inmates can be allowed out on visits with their families once a risk assessment has been conducted.’ Mr Holland said sex offenders will initially be segregated from the general population in the jail but that eventually the goal is to integrate them into the main part of the prison. He added: ‘The community needs to be reassured that they are not put at any risk. 'Prisoners will be individually assessed before being given access to town visits.’ A spokesman for GS4 security said: 'As with any Category C prison of this size, Oakwood’s population comprises prisoners who have committed a number of offences including sexual offences. 'Prisoners may be released on temporary licence  - but only providing they meet strict criteria and pass a rigorous risk assessment. 'Only those assessed as representing minimal risk of escape or risk of harm to the public are eligible. 'Release on temporary licence is used to prepare prisoners for their eventual release from custody. 'It helps to reduce the chance of re-offending by setting up appropriate employment and rehabilitation work in the community, and maintaining family contact. 'This is essential for successful resettlement and an important factor in protecting the public. 'If prisoners breach their licence in any way, they will be subject to disciplinary proceedings.'","Town visits to be run by security firm GS4 .

In the wars of the Twentieth Century, uniforms just served to keep soldiers warm - but in future wars, they're likely to be complicated electronic systems. The Office of Naval Research is researching uniforms which can detect where soldiers have been shot - and also detect whether they have been exposed to nuclear or biological agents. Sensors for blood, radiation and chemical poisons would be woven into the uniforms themselves - dubbed 'Intelligent Uniforms.' Super soldier? An earlier prototype shown off by the U.S. army. One of the concerns with the new 'Intelligent Uniforms' is to keep the bulk of the uniforms down to manageable levels . The uniforms - in a proposal submitted by the ONR this week - would also carry GPS units and radios, so that their assessment of a soldier's health can be radioed back to base. It's one of a range of hi-tech options the Pentagon and defence companies are currently researching for soldier's uniforms, including glasses that give soldiers 'super vision' and uniforms with electric fabric that allow soldiers to communicate with one another via radio. Medical sensors built into uniforms would be no gimmick, either - at present, the first medical assessment a soldier receives is when staff reach him. On the battlefield, there can be severe delays. Of course, the idea here isn’t to replace medical care with material. It’s to give medics and surgeons a major head start, by offering initial diagnostics that’ll speed up the process. No doubt, that’d be an invaluable aid where soldier survival is concerned,' says Wired's Danger Room blog, which reported the proposal. 'In a situation where a soldier has been hit with either a single bullet or shrapnel from an explosion or has been exposed to chemical, biological or radioactive agents, within their surrounding environment, it is critical to quickly evaluate the vital organs that have been impacted and the life-saving procedures that need to be performed,' says the Office of Naval Research. 'With Intelligent Clothing, the location of a bullet can be determined with appropriately-embedded sensors within the clothing’s fibers that can estimate the depth of penetration and the effected surrounding organs. Additionally, if the person was in an environment where a CBRNE weapon had been stored, manufactured, or used, the Intelligent Clothing could identify the agents via specific biomarkers detected within the blood, saliva, sweat, urine.' Dolph Lundgren in a scene from the 1992 film: Universal Soldier: The U.S. military is increasingly creating gadgets that resemble the sci-fi film's plot, with 'intelligent' uniforms the latest idea to be tested . The hi-tech glasses under trial with the Pentagon will allow information to be 'beamed' directly into soldier's eyes from a pair of hi-tech glasses . The Pentagon has placed an order with Innovega for lenses which . focus 3D battlefield information from drones and satellites directly into people's eyeballs. The . tiny 'screens' sit directly on users' eyeballs and work with a pair of . lightweight glasses with a built-in translucent screen. 'Warfighters need to maintain their . full vision while on the battlefield,' says the company. 'At the same . time a tremendous amount of data, graphics and video are collected and . are required by specific warfighters in the field. Another groundbreaking . high-tech military system will allow any soldier in a unit to 'see' through the eyes of any of his comrades. The . new technology, which features communication antennas woven into the . fabric of military uniforms, means video from a helmet-mounted camera, . voice commands and GPS data can all be transmitted at once, even in the . heat of battle when soldiers might be lying flat to avoid enemy fire. The . system is designed to improve the awareness of a military team as a . whole, allowing soldiers to see through the eyes of their team mates in . real time. Fighters of the future: The groundbreaking high-tech army infantry system features communication antennas woven into its fabric . The way the antennas work mean there . is no need for soldiers to carry conventional radio whip-antennas which . can be cumbersome and conspicuous. BAE . Systems, which has developed the series of Body Wearable Antennas . (BWA), says it allows effective communication while helping improve . soldier's agility in the field. A . spokesman said: 'Our demonstrator shows off the capability of this . technology which transmits voice, video data and GPS location via the . same antenna. 'If one soldier spots a situation, they can alert the team and share what they can see through their helmet mounted camera. 'The . demonstration system links with a wrist-mounted commercially available . touch screen smart phone and utilises its sensors to provide an . augmented operational picture. 'This allows the team to tag objects, such as potential hazards which will appear highlighted on the phone's video image. Brothers in arms: The equipment allows for far greater communication between troops in the field (File photo) 'Another major advantage of the wearable antenna system is that it is unaffected by the position of the wearer. 'With . conventional whip-antenna systems, if a soldier has to lie on the . ground, the communication between them and that of someone who is . standing up can be severely compromised or even lost. 'Similarly, . the signal from the short antenna on a portable radio can be masked by . the user's body. A BWA system can be designed to give continuous 360 . degree coverage.' Jon Pinto, . Antennas and Electromagnetics Group Leader from BAE Systems Advanced . Technology Centre said: 'Frontline soldiers carry a huge amount of . weight when on patrol. 'Research . into body wearable antennas has shown we could reduce this burden and . in the future give forces improved communication capabilities and a . significant advantage on the battlefield.'

Systems is now exploring the potential of incorporating the system into . the suits of fire-fighters for use during search and rescue, and for . police patrol team members.","'Intelligent Uniforms' will radio base to warn if soldiers are under attack .

Turning point: Rosa Parks riding on the Montgomery Area Transit System bus, where she refused to give up her seat, sparking the modern civil rights movement . In December 1955, seamstress Rosa Parks, 42, was told by a Montgomery bus driver to give up her seat for a white man to sit, as the rules required. But Parks said: ‘No. I’m tired of being treated like a second-class citizen.’ The driver called the police who arrested her. The same day, black residents began a boycott of the bus system, which lasted 381 days. The legal challenges led to a U.S. Supreme . Court decision that forced Montgomery to desegregate its bus system and ended ‘Jim Crow’ laws separating blacks and whites at public . facilities in the South. Rosa Park’s prosecution led to widespread protest and a successful boycott of the segregated bus system. It . prompted the creation of the Montgomery Improvement Association, which . led to the elevation of a young minister named Martin Luther King. At a later campaign stop, the President reflected further: 'It takes ordinary citizens to bring about change, who are committed to keep fighting and keep pushing, and keep inching this country closer to our highest ideals.' The photograph of the President was taken by White House photographer Pete Souza, who posted the image on Twitter yesterday. President Obama spoke to 600 guests at the Henry Ford Museum, some of whom had paid $250 to attend, others $1,000 to shake his hand. Rosa Parks received the highest US civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1996 and Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1999. She died at the age of 92 in 2005 at her home overlooking the Detroit River and the border with Ontario, Canada.

Patriotic Derek Birch, 72, has hung 14 flags outside his house in Newmarket, Suffolk,  to celebrate the Queen’s 60 years on the throne. He hangs a flag on his property every year to celebrate the Queen’s birthday and draped his house with flags for the Royal wedding last year. Angered: Pensioner Birch has been told to take down the Union flags he has hung up to mark the Queen's Jubilee celebrations . Angered: Birch has been toasting the Queen's birthday every year by hanging a flag in her honour . But his housing association have sent him a letter complaining the number of flags, which measure 3ft by 5ft, is 'excessive' and causing damage to the property. The letter from Landlords Flagship Housing states: 'The way in which they are being displayed has caused damage to our property.' It warns Mr Birch to take the flags down or pay for the cost of their removal. 'It’s ridiculous, I can’t see how the flags are causing any damage. It’s a very special year which only happens once in a lifetime and I wanted to show my support. 'I think the Royal family are doing a great job and I’m a big supporter of the Queen.

Shock: He has been told that the flags are causing his property damage . He added how none of his neighbours had complained about the flags, which have been up for about a month. There are six on the front of the house, four on the sides and four on the back. 'I always celebrate Royal occasions and put a flag on my house on the Queen’s birthday and St George’s day. 'The flags look bright and colourful and aren’t causing any harm to anyone. I wish I could have put up 60 flags,' he said. Birch revealed that Birch intends to take them all down as soon as the Jubilee celebrations were over. A spokeswoman for Flagship Housing, which manages 21,500 homes in East Anglia, said: 'Two community managers visited our customer last Friday to advise Mr Birch that due to complaints received about the flags, they would have to be removed. 'Permission had not been sought to display these flags to the outside of the building which includes fixtures to our brickwork. 'Not only were there an excessive number of flags attached to the outside of the maisonette, but the size of the flags was also an issue. 'Flagship is happy for customers to celebrate the Queen’s Jubilee but activities should not be to the detriment of neighbours and the wider community.'","Has hung a flag on his house every year to celebrate the Queen's birthday .

"By . James Chapman . UPDATED: . 03:28 EST, 19 December 2011 . Supermarkets will today be told to reduce excessive packaging within the next 12 months – or face new laws that will force them to. Officials are understood to be examining radical options, including a legal right pioneered in Scandinavia for consumers to return plastic waste to the superstore where they bought it. Britain produces the equivalent weight of 245 jumbo jets in packaging waste every week. Local Government Minister Grant Shapps, who is hosting today’s summit of supermarket bosses and waste experts, said the problem was particularly acute at Christmas. At this time of year, the total potential cost to taxpayers could reach more than £168million, thanks to the price of landfill. For every ton, councils pay £56. Around 227,000 miles of wrapping paper – enough to go round the world roughly nine times –  will be thrown away this Christmas, according to Government statistics. Packaging for up to ten million turkeys and 25million Christmas puddings will also go in the bin. In total, enough waste will be produced to fill Big Ben 1,500 times. The minister said supermarkets must make a significant effort to reduce their packaging by this time next year, or face Government action. He also urged shoppers to complain to retailers about pointless packaging. ‘Christmas should be a time for sharing and celebrating but every trussed up turkey, shrink-wrapped sprout and over-packaged pudding adds to the clean up cost,’ Mr Shapps said. ‘At a time when councils are watching every penny, supermarkets should be thinking about how they can help shoppers minimise their waste. ‘I want every supermarket to commit to culling packaging by this time next year. Consumers have a big interest in putting pressure on the supermarkets to reduce their packaging, since it will help reduce their tax bills.’ Too much: Sainsbury's narrowly escaped prosecution over the packaging of this Taste the Difference Roast Beef joint which had excessive wrapping . Though supermarkets have made efforts to reduce waste, campaigners point out that more rubbish goes to landfill in Britain than in any other European country. Shoppers are routinely charged extra for buying fruit and vegetables that are wrapped in plastic rather than sold loose. Last year Sainsbury’s narrowly escaped prosecution for using excessive wrapping on its Taste the Difference Slow Matured Ultimate Beef roasting joint, which came in a plastic shrink-wrap, placed inside a plastic tray with a plastic lid and finished with a cardboard sleeve. Lincolnshire trading standards called off what would have been a landmark case after the store made voluntary reductions to  the packaging.",Enough Christmas paper waste to go around the world NINE times .

The owner of an Arlington, Texas strip-club shut down by . city officials after allegations of prostitution and drug trafficking has been . arrested for hiring hit-men to kill the local mayor. FBI agents apprehended 34-year-old Ryan Walker Grant after . he allegedly contacted an intermediary secretly working with the bureau and promised . to pay $10,000 each for the murder of Mayor Robert Cluck and Dallas attorney Tom . Brandt. Reportedly furious that Cluck and prosecutor Brandt . were blocking his attempts to re-open his Flashdancer Cabaret club, it is alleged that Grant, went to the go-between with the intention of having the pair killed. Flashdancer men's club co-owner Ryan Walker Grant who has been arrested as the FBI investigates an alleged contract killing plot against the town's mayor and a Dallas attorney . Informing the intermediary that he wanted Mexican nationals . to commit the crimes and then return across the border, the strip-club boss had . already had two phone conversations discussing the . alleged crimes. Meeting the person known as 'Individual A' at his home last . Monday, Grant checked to see if he was carrying a wire before he confirmed the . contract killings. Instead a sworn affidavit from the FBI middle-man provided . the evidence needed for a SWAT style raid on Grant at his up-market Kennedale . home last Monday. Targeted: Mayor Robert Cluck of Arlington was allegedly the subject of a contract killing and had a $10,000 price tag on his head . The unidentified intermediary’s affidavit said that upon his . final meeting with Grant he handed him photos and contact information for the . people he wanted killed by the Mexican hit-men he thought he was hiring. Insistent on using a go-between, the affidavit quoted Grant . as having given the killing of Mayor Cluck and Brandt a lot of thought. ‘I can't just call up my dude and say go hit them, this is too high-profile,’ said Grant in federal documents. The contract killing was apparently Grant’s way of resolving a dispute between himself and Arlington officials over the closure of his Flashdancer Cabaret club on 520 N. Watson Road. Both Cluck and Brandt had roles in the stalling of issuing a new license for the club which Grant agreed to close temporarily last year after 25 drug violations and 15 alcohol related violations had been logged since May 2008. ‘They just jacked me for a year of business and they're trying to jack me indefinitely, when we had a deal, and they just reneged on it,’ Grant said, according to the affidavit. Claiming that he was set to lose up to $800,000 a year with the closure of the club, Grant is being held by U.S. marshals and scheduled to appear at a detention hearing at 2:30 p.m on Friday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Cureton. Officials attached to the case argue that Grant should remain in federal custody as he is a flight risk and because of the level of intended violence in the case. Bone of Contention: Flashdancer Cabaret club which has not had its licensed renewed and has been closed for year . One of Arlington’s last businesses connected with the sex trade, Flashdancer Cabaret club was closed after a deal between the city and the state attorney general's office. City officials named the popular club as rife with drugs, prostitution, aggravated assaults and other criminal activity. Faced with a trial unless he closed last year, Grant was said to be furious that Arlington Police Chief Theron Bowman planned to revoke Flashdancer's license to operate as an adult business after Grant was accused of filing misleading paper work to the city and condoning sexual acts on the premises. Attorney Tom Brandt who was involved in the case against Flashdancer Cabaret and had successfully closed it for a year . One of the alleged contract ‘hits’, Tom Brandt used the testimony of three Arlington undercover vice-squad members and video clips to build his case. The original license Grant held expired on February 6 and despite the re-application Arlington Deputy Chief Lauretta Hill has still not ruled on the revocation following the drug, alcohol and sex charges. One clip being used in the case to remove Grant’s license shows Grant himself having sex in the office as a manager sits a few feet away and three other video’s show dancers rubbing themselves provocatively in front of customers. However, Mr Grant’s father Ron has refuted all charges brought against his son. ‘Good lord no,’ answered Ron as to whether he believed his son would have sanctioned two contract killings. The centre of controversy: Arlington city officials had claimed that offences related to drugs, alcohol and prostitution had all taken place at the Flashdancer club . ‘That is because as far as you can say he was looking forward to re-opening. ‘No, he certainly didn’t have any animosity, well, he wasn’t happy about it but he certainly didn’t voice any desire to harm anyone about it that’s for sure.’","Gentlemen's club owner Ryan Walker Grant stung by FBI in undercover operation .

Allison Baden-Clay went missing from her home in Australia 12 days ago. Her husband, Gerard Baden-Clay - a great grandson of Lord Baden-Powell - told police that she had not returned from a late-night walk. Dead: The search for Allison Baden-Clay, the wife of Gerard Baden-Clay - a great grandson of Lord Baden-Powell has ended after her body was found washed up on the banks of a river. She is pictured here with her husband . Grim discovery: The body of Mrs Baden-Clay was found by a canoeist paddling along an isolated stretch of Kholo Creek in the Mount Crosby district of Brisbane. Members of a search-team are pictured . The body of Mrs Baden-Clay was found by a canoeist on an isolated stretch of Kholo Creek in the Mount Crosby district of Brisbane, which is eight miles from the Baden-Clay home. Police said they were treating the death of the 43-year-old mother-of-three, who spoke . six languages and was a popular sportswoman, as murder. An intensive hunt for clues is continuing today in thick bushland lining the creek. The rugged bushland is popular with hikers and Scouts. Mr Baden-Clay was spoken to by police numerous times during the search for his wife, but officers declined to comment today on whether they had ruled him out as a suspect. Superintendent Mark Ainsworth said 'numerous' people of interest had been interviewed. Brisbane's Courier Mail newspaper said it understood that the search for clues would take police to a Scout camp upstream from where Mrs Baden-Clay's body was found. Investigation: Police officers have declined to comment today on whether they had ruled Mr Baden-Clay, pictured, out as a suspect. He is seen here arriving at a police station in Brisbane . The paper added that it was believed the killer could have taken Mrs Baden-Clay's body to the area where her body was found as early as 8pm on April 19 - the night she went missing. Superintendent Ainsworth said that after the discovery of the body, which was dressed in clothing similar to that worn by Mrs Baden-Clay when she went missing, her family were notified that the woman was probably her. He said her parents, Geoff and Priscilla Dickie, were still coming to terms with the news. 'They've been here,' he said, referring to the area where the body was found. He said they were 'ever hopeful that there will be a positive resolution, the same as ourselves. 'They're devastated. I can't explain it any other way.' Mr Gerard Baden-Clay - who refers to his relationship with Lord Baden-Powell on his real estate agent's website - was surrounded by family and friends at his parents' home, where he has been staying. His parents have lowered the Australian flag at the front of their house to half mast and a neighbour has done the same. On his website, Mr Baden-Clay writes: 'My great-grandfather once said that ""there are two ways to climbing a mountain: one man goes steadily upward, following the track that has been made by others…the other climber is equally anxious to reach the top, but he looks wider, he looks ahead and higher."" Grieving: The parents of Allison Baden-Clay, Priscilla Dickie and Geoff Dickie, are 'devastated' by the discovery of their daughter's body. They are pictured previously appealing to the public for information on their missing daughter . 'For me, as a businessman, having that wider focus and ambition to do things better has been my inspiration.' Superintendent Ainsworth said the creek where Mrs Baden-Clay's body was found had not been searched previously because police had been following a search and rescue manual which involved a thorough search of a one and a half mile radius around the Baden-Clay home. 'The missing person's case has been ramped up for some time,' he said. 'At this stage, we are looking at an unlawful homicide investigation.We believe it reached that level some time ago.'

The drunk captain of a ship which collided with a passenger ferry in Northern Ireland, causing more than £1million of damage, has been jailed for a year. Miroslaw Pozniak, 55, admitted crashing his cargo boat while three times over the alcohol limit but said it was because of worries over his wife’s ill-health, his defence barrister had told Downpatrick Crown Court. The married father-of-two was at the helm on March 7 when he crashed into a ferry with 100 passengers and crew on board in Belfast Lough after ignoring warnings from coastguards. Miroslaw Pozniak arriving at Downpatrick courthouse this morning before he was sentenced to one year in jail . Pozniak had no look-out despite the darkness. Judge David Smyth QC told Pozniak: 'This sentence is to make it clear that the following of the regulations in relation to alcohol and also in relation to the charting and proper adherence to accepted routes is of vital importance. 'The ending of your 30-year career and the sentence effectively demonstrate that.' The defendant dropped his head as sentence was passed. Pozniak’s defence barrister, Sean Doran, said the captain had been drinking six or seven bottles of beer in his cabin, which was out of character for him. The badly-damaged remnants of Miroslaw Pozniak's cargo ship Union Moon, moored in Belfast, after it was in a collision with a Stena ferry. It had followed a 'difficult' conversation with his wife in Poland when he learned that her health condition had relapsed after she had previously thought she was getting better. The collision happened as his boat, the Union Moon, was leaving Belfast Lough. The judge said the course was clear that the Union Moon should veer away by about 20 degrees but it did not. This caused concern at Belfast harbour control, which reminded Pozniak of the route and alerted the Master of the Stena Feronia, the boat he ultimately crashed into. About six minutes before the collision, the Stena Feronia attempted a manoeuvre which was designed to reduce the impact but it was too late to prevent a full-on collision, and the prow of the Union Moon struck the car deck of the Stena Feronia. Miroslaw Pozniak's barrister said the heavy drinking that led to the crash had been 'uncharacteristic' The judge said: 'If the route that should have been followed had been followed by the Union Moon this collision would not have occurred. 'The collision occurred because the proper course was not followed and the responsibility was entirely that of Captain Pozniak.' There was no injury or loss of life and the Lough was quiet at the time of the crash. The court heard that the Maritime and Coastal Agency had brought its own charges against the Pole. They included failing to keep a proper look-out, failing to navigate, and causing serious damage to his own ship as well as another vessel. He pleaded guilty to those charges, but denied that he failed to follow the safety rules of his former employers, along with proper watch-keeping arrangements. The latter two charges will remain 'on the books' and will not be proceeded with. Captain Alan Marsh, enforcement officer with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said today’s case sent out a message to other users of the sea: . 'It is essential that mariners recognise that there is no place for taking alcohol when you are operating a ship at any level. 'When you are navigating during the hours of darkness it is imperative that you have a look-out there and you are not alone.'","Miroslaw Pozniak, 55, admitted crashing his boat while three times over the legal alcohol limit .

A man who had just been told his wife was leaving him killed her and their daughter as she celebrated her 10th birthday in a restaurant and was shot dead by police as he fled. Kevin Allen, 51, shot wife Katherine, 42, and daughter Kerri, dead and critically injured their other daughter Kayla, 10, in the shooting inside the crowded Cracker Barrel restaurant in Ohio. Witnesses said Allen came into the restaurant in suburban Brooklyn on Thursday night with a shotgun and 'selectively' fired on his family. Tragic: Kerri Allen, left, was shot dead by her father as she celebrated her 10th birthday, her sister Kayla, who has been left orphaned after the shooting,  was critically injured and is fighting for her life . Martial problems: Kevin Allen, right, killed his wife Katherine, left, and their daughter before being shot dead by police after he tired to flee with his gun . The shooting created panic and . confusion in the restaurant, and a manager helped get people out through . a rear door, a witness said. Police . records dating back nearly 20 years painted a picture of Allen, married . at least three times, as a violent man with a history of threatening . wives and others. Just . two days earlier, Mrs Allen had told police in their hometown of . Strongsville that she had left her husband and taken their daughters . after 'an incident' on Easter and was afraid to go home to collect their . belongings. Mrs Allen . 'stated that she has not been getting along with her husband and decided . to take the kids and stay with a friend,' according to the Tuesday . police report. Aftermath: Police investigate Thursday night's shooting at the Cracker Barrel restaurant, pictured, in Brooklyn, Ohio, which left three members of the Allen family dead . Shocked: Two women hug in the a parking lot where workers at the restaurant waited to be questioned by police . Fatal: Police were forced to shoot Allen as he attempted to flee the restaurant after killing his wife and daughter . 'Initially . she wanted to pick up some items from the house, but decided not to . because it would make him mad if police responded,' the report said, . adding that Mrs Allen wanted to document 'verbal altercations' the . couple had been having. Mrs Allen called 911 from inside the restaurant on the fateful night, saying her husband was upset because she had told him she was leaving him. He left the restaurant and was circling the parking lot, she told police. She also told police she feared he might become violent. 'I'm having some spouse problems,' Mrs Allen tells the dispatcher in the 911 call. Grim: Crime scene investigators look on at the bloody scene left within the building in which the 10-year-old girl was shot in the stomach by her dad . The dispatcher then asks her if Allen owns any weapons or is armed. She says her husband had told her he'd gotten rid of a shotgun, but she had seen him with shotgun shells. She also told the dispatcher that Allen was calling one of her daughters in the restaurant. At the end of the call, Mrs Allen says, 'He's here and the police are here, too. I have to ...' She then stops speaking. The dispatcher says: 'Wait in the lobby for the officers. Do not go outside. Let them talk to him, OK? Ma'am?"" The call then ends in a jumble of noise. Officers heard gunshots when they arrived and saw Allen leaving the restaurant with a gun. Police Chief Scott Mielke said officers shot him when he refused to surrender. He died at the scene. Closed off: Brooklyn police officer stands guard at the front entrance keeping guard as crime scene investigators work inside . Mrs Allen died from shotgun wounds to her head and body, and Kerri died of a shotgun wound to the abdomen, according to the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner. Someone inside the restaurant, Robert Lovelace, told WKYC-TV that the shooting scene was chaotic. 'We all ran,' Lovelace said. He said people in the restaurant didn't know what was happening. ""We just told them, `Look, let's get out of here,'"" he said. Killer: Allen, pictured, is said to have a history of violence against partners . The manager helped move people to safety through a rear door, the company said. The restaurant will remain closed . until the investigation is completed, Cracker Barrel spokeswoman Julie . K. Davis said in an email from corporate offices in Lebanon, Tenn. ""This . appears to be the result of a domestic dispute between two guests and . no Cracker Barrel employees were involved,"" she said. Jody McIntosh, a waitress at the . restaurant, told ABC 5 that she had left after finishing her shift when a . co-worker called to say that someone 'had shot up the place'. In . February, Columbia Gas Co. requested a police escort to Allen's house, . explaining he had not paid his bill 'and has stated he will shoot anyone . who attempts to turn his gas off,' according to a Feb. 22 Strongsville . police report. The report said the company eventually worked things out with Allen. In . June 1995, police in Kirtland - about 20 miles east of Cleveland - . arrested Allen after responding to reports of a violent argument between . him and his girlfriend, Janice Koerlin. The argument was the same day that Allen received a divorce from his wife, the report said. Koerlin told police at a previous house that Allen ""had violent episodes and had smashed household items."" Three months later, Allen was arrested again after Koerlin - now his wife - said he tried to suffocate her with a pillow. The Sept. 14, 1995, report said Kevin Allen was a ""manic depressive under medication."" Police reports say Allen also was arrested for burglary and theft in 2008. Documents filed by Kevin and Katherina Allen in federal bankruptcy court in Cleveland last year indicate they owed $60,000 to various creditors, including a $20,000 hospital bill. Other creditors included several credit card companies and two other hospitals. The filing was closed March 28. Records also show that Allen filed for bankruptcy in 1991 and 2004, and that Mrs Allen filed for bankruptcy in 2000. Other court records show Allen has an adult daughter from the previous marriage that ended in 1995.

Men who said they were kept as slaves on a travellers’ site escaped by jumping into a canal, hiding in a back garden and confiding in a Community Service officer, a jury heard today. The victims were allegedly held in servitude at the Green Acres site at Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire and forced to carry out unpaid work for the Connors family’s block paving business. There was a rumour that someone was buried in a field next to the site and workers had been warned: 'If you run away you’ll end up like the person in the field back there,' Luton Crown Court was told. Patrick Connors (left) and James 'Big Jim' Connors (right) pictured outside Luton Magistrates' Court last September. Seven members of the Connors family are accused of exploiting vulnerable men for financial gain . Frances Oldham QC alleges that the . Connors family made large amounts of money by controlling and exploiting . vulnerable men. Over 15 years they are said to have kept dozens of . victims in camps under orders not to leave. Josie Connors leaving Luton Crown Court earlier this week. A court heard the traveller family used 'vulnerable' men as virtual 'slaves' Their . heads were shaved, they were paid little or nothing, were verbally . abused and on occasions beaten, it was alleged. One worker described it . as being 'like a concentration camp.' Mrs . Oldham said: 'A number of words may spring to mind to describe what was . happening. They may not in the strict sense have been slaves but they . were not free men.' Luton Crown Court heard that on 11 September last year the police entered . Green Acres where they found 13 male workers who were not part of the . extended Connors family. Seven members of the Connors family, six of who live at the site in Leighton Buzzard, face 20 charges. They . are Tommy Connors Senior, 52, and his sons Tommy, 26, James, 24, . Patrick, 20, and Johnny, 28, who lives at The Travellers’ Site, Chiswell . Green Lane, St Albans. Also on trial are his daughter Josie, 30, and . her husband James John Connors, 34. Mrs . Oldham told the jury: 'The crown’s case is that members of the Connors . family - initially father Tommy senior, and gradually over the past 15 . years children Johnny, Jimmy, Josie, Tommy and Patrick and son in law . James John - recruited vulnerable adults as workers on the pretence of . offering them paid employment, food and accommodation. 'Typically . recruitment would take place at centres for the homeless, soup kitchens . or simply on the street. 'Subsequently . these individuals were held at a succession of travellers’ sites . culminating in the Greenacres site and were forced to work for the . Connors family without payment.' Continuing . her opening today Mrs Oldham told how one man was picked up at Charing . Cross in London where he had been sleeping rough for 6 weeks. He had . been offered £50 a day, food and accommodation in a caravan. After being assaulted he is said to have decided to climb over the fence and run away. She . said: 'He got over the fence when he heard children shouting: ""There he . is"". He realised they were looking for him and jumped into the canal. There was a fisherman nearby and he telephoned the police. The area allegedly used as sleeping accommodation. Many of the workers were too scared to escape because of the fear of 'physical violence and the threat of such violence' a court heard .

The court heard the alleged mistreatment came to light when one worker escaped and contacted police . 'The . chasing men had stopped by this time and remained watching. Mr Hoffman . had the presence of mind to wave his phone at them and shouted out that . he had called the police.' One . worker was recruited outside Greggs in Wembley, north west London, by Jim and Josie who . asked if he wanted to work as a labourer for £80 a day, the court heard. They gave him a caravan to live in with two other men. He was allegedly . told if he tried to leave they would get one of the other men to murder . him. The prosecutor said he . was assaulted on a number of occasions and was once placed in the boot . of the car for 40 minutes. While in the boot Josie said that he had to . sing ‘How much is that doggy in the window?’ and ‘Bob the builder’ to . her children. The man, who . told the officers he never received payment, said the price for work on . driveways was between £2,800 and £6,000. He said he would work for 10 to . 14 hours doing heavy lifting. The only protective equipment was steel . capped boots, no goggles, gloves or other safety equipment. When . customers phoned up to complain James John handed the phone to one of . the workers who would give a false name and promise to come round to . deal with the problem - that never happened said the prosecutor.

A woman in Leighton . Buzzard found a man in a Hi Viz clothing in her rear garden who said he . was running away and wanted help. The woman’s stepson got him out of the . garden and he climbed into the one next door. The woman called the . police and the man was able to flag down a passing police car. Mrs Oldham said the jury would hear from another man who said the routine at the site was to get up by 5.30am. She said: 'Food provided was of the . cheapest kind. The toilet had no paper and the man and others used paper . napkins from the food they were given. They were allowed a shower once a . week on a Friday evening at the Tiddenfoot Leisure Centre in Leighton . Centre. In the immediate surroundings of the caravan site where he was . kept there were iron gates and motion detector lights.'

"By . Hannah Roberts . UPDATED: . 10:07 EST, 19 November 2011 . Six months after the disappearance of Timmothy Pitzen, police are hoping that a detailed analysis of his mother’s SUV will help lead them to the boy. Police released some results on Friday of a forensic analysis of the grass, dirt and debris that had accumulated on Amy Fry-Pitzen’s 2004 Ford Expedition. They are also hoping that surveillance videos and details about where Amy may have travelled that were released Friday will help jog a memory. Enduring mystery: Illinois schoolboy Timmothy Pitzen disappeared when his mother killed herself in a roadside motel room . On May 11, Amy took her only son out . of school and, without telling any family members, she and Timmothy went . on a three-day, 500-mile road trip, stopping at zoos and water parks in . northern Illinois and Wisconsin. On the third day, Amy finally called . family to report she was fine. The next morning, police found her body . in a Rockford motel. Police announced on Friday that the . lab has determined that plant material on the SUV indicate it was . stopped for a time on a wide gravel shoulder or a gravel road. Near the gravel area where the vehicle stopped, the SUV was backed into a grassy field, the beaconnews.suntimes.com reports. The lab results have given police a clearer indication of where Timmothy may have been dropped off. A few weeks ago, six months after the Illinois schoolboy disappeared when his mother killed herself in a roadside motel room, his grandmother Alana Anderson and father Jim Pitzen marked what would have been his seventh birthday by planting a 7-year-old blue spruce tree in the back garden. Anderson told the Chicago Tribune: 'I bought him a birthday card and cut out pictures of the things I would have bought for him,' 'A lighted skateboard. A remote-control helicopter.' The lively schoolboy vanished on May 11, when Fry-Pitzen, picked him up from his Aurora elementary school. In what were to be her final days mother . and son went to the zoo and a water park, one in the far north east Illinois, . the other in Wisconsin, before travelling west back into Illinois. Gone: Six months after the Illinois schoolboy disappeared his grandmother and father marked what would have been his seventh birthday by planting a 7-year-old blue spruce tree in the back garden . Fry Pitzen eventually checked into a motel near Rockford, northern Illinois alone and slit her wrists, leaving a suicide note and several letters in the post. In the notes to her husband, her mother and a close friend, she said her son was safe, and with people who loved him, but she did not say who she had left him with. According to Anderson, one of the notes warns, 'You will never find Timmothy'. And despite a massive search operation investigators have not been able to track down the missing child. Clue? One of the new surveillance clips show Timmothy and his mother walking to an elevator at the Key Lime Cove resort in Gurnee around 3:15 pm May 11, shortly after they checked in . Three . months ago police revealed that they found ‘a concerning amount’  of . the child’s blood in the backseat of his mother’s 2004 Ford Expedition . SUV. The clothes Fry-Pitzen was wearing when captured on surveillance video have never been found. This . includes the clothing she was wearing when she and her son checked out . of the Wisconsin Dells resorts, hours before she checked in alone to the . hotel room where her body was found. But the family continues to believe that Timmothy is alive. The blood may have come from a nose bleed Timmothy had about a year ago, they say. New lead? Fry Pitzen is shown here entering and leaving Sullivan Foods in Winnebago, Illinois around 8 pm May 13, not long before she killed herself. And testing of the knife Fry Pitzen used to kill herself revealed no traces of her son's DNA. 'I just try to do one day at a time,' Jim Pitzen told the Chicago Tribune. 'I hope whoever has Tim understands that he's not theirs and he needs to come home to his family.' The family’s steadfast belief that Timothy is alive is based on two things. Fry-Pitzen cared for her son deeply and showed her affection often. The 43-year-old had periodically . battled depression, but, her mother insisted, 'was not a crazy . person. She absolutely never acted bizarrely.' Missing: Timmothy, from Illinois, has not been seen since his mother killed herself in a hotel room in May . And she methodically planned her . suicide, leading Anderson and Pitzen to conclude that she'd made . similarly comprehensive plans for her son's upbringing. The . mother-of-one had helped Anderson, a retired emergency room nurse, . paint her house and clear up her backyard in recent months, asking, 'Is . there anything else I need to do for you?' She had also given her mother some antique furniture of hers that Anderson had long coveted. Toll . records reveal she made unexplained trips, in February and March, to . the area where the pair were last known to have been travelling, and to . which she had no prior connection. With . the holidays approaching, Anderson, who lives on her own, says she . misses her grandson, who would sleep at her home every other weekend. Carefree: Timmothy Pitzen is seen playing in his pyjamas before he went missing . For now she is just 'trying to put the pieces of my life together. They're just not that many of them left anymore.' 'It's . been rough,' Anderson told the Tribune. 'I think the first couple of months you're . in such shock, you're almost numb and it doesn't quite sink in. But now … . I don't expect it to be a whole lot better anytime soon.' She started a journal about a week after Timmothy vanished, in which she writes 'cute, little stories about him so he'll know what he . was like, how I felt about him; how hard we looked for him; the places . we went and things we did together.' Jim Pitzen has lost his job in . manufacturing since his son’s disappearance, but tries to keep occupied . to distract himself from his loss, and his questions. CCTV: There has been no sign of the vanished boy whose picture has been plastered on missing posters across the Midwest of the U.S. and on websites . Surveillance: These are the last images of six-year-old Timmothy Pitzen before he vanished and his mother later booked into a motel in Illinois and killed herself . Suicide: The boy's mother, Amy Fry-Pitzen, 43, killed herself . He is still angry with his wife, the Tribune reported. He said: 'I think about her all the time.' 'I just wonder what she did with our son and why she wanted . him to be with someone else.' Police are expected to release new video of Timmothy today, hoping that new leads may emerge. Forensic investigators have been working to try to identify tall grass or weeds found on the underside of the SUV to link the materials to a more specific area. After Timothy's disappearance . officers searched a remote area about 100 miles west of Chicago, where . cellphone records indicated Fry-Pitzen and Timmothy were last together. Meanwhile, mindful of time passing, the . loving grandmother has started to throw away some of her grandson's . things, disposing of clothes that no longer would fit, and toys that he had . outgrown. To remind her of Timmothy, she is holding on to his favorites: some cars and truck, a much-loved book, . 'Diary of a Worm,' and even a plastic spoon he used the . last time they visited Dairy Queen. She said: 'He's out there. And I think when he's old enough, he'll find us.'

The body of a 62-year-old missing woman has been found decapitated, dismembered and buried in a shallow grave at her co-workers house. Kathy Goble disappeared two years and a day before her body was found in the garden of Charles Eugene March in Charleston, West Virginia. Police said March, a 60-year-old grandfather, admitted to strangling his colleague and he has been arrested for her murder, WSAZ-TV reported. Victim: The dismembered remains of Kathy Goble, 62, have been found buried in the garden of a co-worker two years and a day after she went missing . His son found the remains in a plastic bag while carrying out yard work and was not sure whether they were animal or human so called 911. West Virginia State Police arrived on the scene and one trooper realised that March and Goble had both worked at Kelley's Men Shop. ""When our detectives picked him up, he was cooperative, came down to . talk to us but initially was not cooperative as far as what happened,"" Sheriff Mike Rutherford told the Charleston Daily Mail. 'When our detectives indicated that we possibly had . found the body, he indicated to us what had happened. He indicated that he strangled her and dismembered her body the next day.' 'Confession': Charles Eugene March, 60, told police he had strangled Goble and then dismembered her body . Sick: He killed her and wrapped her in a blanket in the bath tub before dismembering her the next day . The complaint says that after March strangled Goble, he wrapped . her body in a blanket and placed her in a bathtub. He . dismembered her body the next day and then buried the body in his back . yard. Goble had worked at the clothes shop in Charleston for 10 years, while March had been an employee for 30. Police arrested him at the store. Kathy was last seen on 24 April, 2010 and was filmed shopping on store surveillance cameras after leaving work. Her purchases were found at her boyfriend's home along with her phone and keys. Her boyfriend Fred Ferrell was out of town when Goble went missing. Her family reported her missing two days later when she failed to turn up for work. Her locked car, a 2004 Honda Pilot, was found abandoned two days after she was last seen, . along Interstate 64 near the U.S. 35 interchange. Questions: Police continue their investigation of the area beside the home of Charles Eugene March after remains were found there by his son . Standing watch: West Virginia State Police Cpl. R Cervera secures the crime scene as the investigation continues . No motive for the crime has yet been . given. Colleagues said they did not appear to have a different . relationship to the rest of the workers. 'We're still in shock,' Kelley's owner Kenny Waldeck told the Charleston Daily Mail. 'It's just unbelievable that somebody . that's been with us for two years since she disappeared could just . commit such a heinous crime and not show any kind of remorse, or change . in demeanor or anything that would indicate that he was remotely . involved.' He added that . they spoke about Goble every day at the shop and March, who is divorced, . never did anything to indicate where she could be. Walker went on: 'He would sit in on conversations where we would all just be like, ""What could have happened to her?""' Ongoing: Police search the home of Charles March (pictured right), who is now in police custody . Workplace: Goble had worked at Kelley's Men's Shop in Charleston, West Virginia for a decade, while March had been an employee for 30 years . The shop owner added that March had called in sick on Tuesday, the second anniversary of Goble's death. One neighbour, named only as Dana, added: 'We never would have thought he'd do anything like that.' Still wearing his suit, March was . charged with her murder and was arraigned in Kanawha County Magistrate . Court on Wednesday afternoon. The judge did not set any bond.

"By . Phil Vinter . PUBLISHED: . 04:25 EST, 22 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:24 EST, 22 March 2012 . Jailed: Nasa space scientist turned spy Stewart Nozette has been jailed . for 13 years after admitting to selling defence secrets to Israel . A former government space scientist has been sentenced to 13 years in prison after admitting he tried . to sell space and defence secrets to Israel in what turned out to be an . FBI sting operation. Appearing in federal court in a prison jumpsuit yesterday, Stewart Nozette said he was 'paying for a fatal lack of judgment.' 'I accept full responsibility,' Nozette told U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman. Prosecutors and Nozette's lawyers agreed to the 13-year sentence, with credit for the two years that Nozette has spent behind bars since his arrest. Nozette had high-level security clearances during decades of government work on science and space projects at NASA, the Energy Department and the National Space Council in President George H.W. Bush's administration. Nozette pleaded guilty to one count of attempted espionage, admitting he tried to provide Israel with top secret information about satellites, early warning systems, methods for retaliating against large-scale attack, communications intelligence information and major elements of defense strategy. In court, prosecutors played a videotape of Nozette telling an FBI undercover agent posing as an Israeli spy that 'I've sort of crossed the Rubicon,' or passed a point of no return. On the video, Nozette said he would charge Israel 'at most one per cent' for passing information about an unspecified program that Nozette said cost the U.S. government $200 million. Nozette, 54, was a 'traitor' who engaged in attempted espionage with 'unbridled enthusiasm,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Asuncion told the judge. At the time of Nozette's arrest for attempted espionage in 2009, he was awaiting sentencing on fraud and tax evasion charges. On Wednesday, the judge sentenced him to 37 months on those charges, to be served concurrently with the sentence in the espionage case. Lift off: A rocket is launched from Israel's Iron Dome missile system . in response to an aerial attack from Palestinians in the Gaza strip . Nozette was known primarily as a defence technologist who had worked on the Reagan-era missile defense shield effort, nicknamed 'Star Wars' and formally called the Strategic Defense Initiative. As a leading scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the 1990s, Nozette came up with the concept behind the Clementine space mission, which ultimately discovered ice on the moon, according to the sentencing memo in the espionage case by Nozette's legal team. One of Nozette's lawyers, Bradford . Berenson, called the espionage case 'vindictive' and an illustration of . 'overreaching government conduct' at a time when Nozette was already . enmeshed in the tax and fraud case. The . government suspected Nozette might be interested in spying after a . investigators searched his Chevy Chase, at his home in Maryland in . February 2007 as part of the tax and fraud probe. Expert: Nozette came up with the concept behind the Clementine space mission which went on to discover ice on the moon . Nozette ran a non-profit corporation called the Alliance for Competitive Technology that had several agreements to develop advanced technology for the U.S. government, but he was overstating his costs for reimbursement and failing to report the income on his tax returns. Berenson called that case 'relatively minor' and a violation that 'a lot of small businesses engage in.' The search of his home turned up classified documents, though Nozette's lawyers said in his defence that they were not marked as such. Nozette was not allowed to have unsecured classified documents in his home. Agents also discovered Nozette sent an email in 2002 threatening to sell information about a classified program he was working on to Israel or another country. The FBI decided to conduct an undercover operation to see how serious he was. The attempted selling of secrets 'never would have happened but for the tax and fraud case,' said Berenson.

David Cameron vowed to tear up 60 years of planning law to build new towns and give Britain another airport in the South East. The Prime Minister unveiled plans for a wave of new ‘garden cities’ – quickly dubbed ‘Cam Towns’ – and gave his strongest support yet for a new ‘Boris Island’ airport in the Thames estuary, heavily promoted by London Mayor Boris Johnson. Accepting there would be ‘costs and protests’, Mr Cameron shrugged off opposition to the planning overhaul, saying he wants a Victorian-style blitz on new infrastructure building to boost growth. 'Popular': David Cameron is planning to create more 'Cam Towns' like Hertfordshire's Welwyn Garden City, pictured . He warned that failure to act would condemn Britain to being a second-rate nation. But his plans were quickly condemned by rural groups and green campaigners as a blueprint for ‘disfiguring’ the countryside that would damage the fabric of Britain. In a speech at the Institute of Civil Engineering in London, the Prime Minister vowed to overcome what he called a ‘failure of nerve’ on planning. Mr Cameron rejected calls by groups such as the National Trust to tear up its new National Planning Policy Framework, due shortly, saying it would provide ‘the biggest simplification of our bureaucratic, top-down planning laws in 60 years’. He said the Government would protect green belts and national parks, but added: ‘We also urgently need to find places where we are prepared to allow significant new growth to happen.’ Determined: The PM shrugged off opposition to the planning overhaul, saying he wants a Victorian-style blitz on new infrastructure building to boost growth . Vowing to recreate a ‘visionary plan’ from 1944 to build new towns across the South East, Mr Cameron said: ‘The growth of our towns and cities has been held back by a planning system which has encouraged development of the wrong sort in the wrong places.’ He said places such as Hampstead Garden Suburb, Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City were ‘not perfect but popular’ and the coalition would seek to build more towns that were ‘green, planned, secure, with gardens, places to play and characterful houses, not just car-dominated concrete grids’. Mr Cameron said the Government would begin consulting later this year ‘on how to apply the principles of garden cities to areas with high potential growth, in places people want to live’. He added: ‘We must get our planning system fit for purpose. It needs to be quick. It needs to be easier to use. And it needs to better support growth, jobs and homes.’ The Prime Minister said the Government needed to be similarly ‘bold’ about air transport too. Risking a fresh row with the Liberal Democrats, who oppose all airport expansion in the South East, he said: ‘I’m not blind to the need to increase airport capacity, particularly in the South East. ‘We need to retain our status as a key global hub for air travel, not just a feeder route to bigger airports elsewhere, in Frankfurt, Amsterdam or Dubai.’ The Tories have ruled out a third runway at Heathrow but Mr Cameron made warm noises about building a new international hub airport East of London. ‘Yes, this will be controversial. We . will be bringing forward options in our aviation strategy which will . include an examination of the pros and cons of a new airport in the . Thames estuary.’ He praised Boris Johnson, saying he had ‘done very well in driving forward this agenda’. Mr Cameron also unveiled £150million of new investment in ‘shovel ready’ building projects that already have planning permission but are stalled by lack of investment. Chancellor George Osborne will also be announcing ten ‘super-connected’ cities that are to have universal access to super-fast broadband as part of the drive to improve telecommunications. Neil Sinden, Director of Policy for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, attacked the plans for building in the countryside. He said: ‘If the Government’s planning reforms remain unchanged from the draft published last year, pressure for sprawling development is precisely what we can expect. ‘Unless the final planning framework recognises the intrinsic value of our countryside as a whole, we fear a rash of sporadic and inappropriate development across the country, disfiguring the rural landscape which is so valued by local communities.’ But Mr Cameron vowed to stand up to the critics. ‘There will be costs and protests. And I am certainly not doing it in the hope of immediate political advantage,’ he said. ‘I can see the furious objections – the banner headlines – already.’ But he added: ‘We will take difficult decisions, we will risk short-term unpopularity. ‘We will hold fast to our vision in the face of vested interests, because our motivation and our duty is to protect and champion the national interest.’",Cameron said places like Hampstead Garden Suburb and Letchworth were 'not perfect but popular'
"By . Graham Smith . UPDATED: . 07:57 EST, 24 September 2011 . A village primary school where seven members of staff look after just two pupils is to stay open despite an annual cost of £110,000 to the taxpayer. The Ysgol y Glyn school in the village of Lower . Brynamman, near Neath in South Wales, was due to have 32 pupils running . around the playground at the start of this term. But parents in the village feared the . school is on the verge of closure and so decided to move their children to . neighbouring schools instead. Quiet education: A father this morning walks his daughter and son - the school's only pupils - to lessons . Today, . just one father took his son and daughter to the Victorian building, a four-classroom school that dates back to 1896. The two children are looked after by seven staff - a head teacher, a deputy head, a part-time teacher, a teaching assistant, a cook, a cleaner and a caretaker. Despite . the costs, education chiefs said the school may have to stay open until . the end of the year to accommodate the two children. Villager Don Gray, 60, who lives next door to the school, said: 'My children went there more than 30 years ago and it is a terrible shame to see it so quiet. 'It is a big loss and the children absolutely loved it there. The staff are great but it is a bit daft to have it just for two children. 'All the parents moved their children away because they were told it was going to close next year - they didn't want to wait.' The school costs £110,000-a-year to . run - and education chiefs are trying to find new positions for the . seven staff who are on contracts. Parents in the village blamed the failure on the local council and the Welsh government to agree on the future of the school. Costly: Just two children attend the Ysgol y Glyn primary school in . Lower Brynamman in South Wales where they are looked after by seven . staff . Last year, education chiefs had decided to close it in the summer and move pupils to neighbouring villages. But parents objected and the government agreed to postpone its closure until the end of the year. However, all but one family voted with their feet by moving their children to other schools. The father who took his son and daughter to school yesterday declined to comment on the row. But it is understood his family is planning to leave the local area and did not want to move the children to new schools twice. Karl Napieralla, director of education for Neath Port Talbot council, said: 'Our original proposals advocated closure on educational and economic grounds at the end of the summer term. 'However, the Welsh government decided to keep the school open until the end of the calendar year. 'Discussions are taking place with the school, family concerned and the Welsh government about bringing the closure forward to half term.' Local councillor Alwyn Woolcock led the campaign to save the school. He said: 'There were 197 objectors and a petition of hundreds to keep the school open. 'But back in June it was announced that the school will close on December 31.' He said there were 32 pupils on the roll, but the closure row had caused a lot of 'ill-feeling because a school is the heart of a community'. He added: 'It has left a bitter taste in my mouth and the mouths of the staff, governors and the whole community.' Talks are today under way to permanently close the school at half-term next month - but it may still have to stay open until Christmas. A Welsh government spokesperson said: 'The local authority is monitoring the situation at the school.'","The Ysgol y Glyn school in Lower .

Nicolas Sarkozy's first round defeat in the French presidential elections has contributed to a fall in the FTSE . The UK stock market tumbled today . after investors became spooked by political uncertainty in France and . the Netherlands and over a new recession in Spain. Nicolas Sarkozy was beaten in the first round of the French presidential elections by socialist rival Francois Hollande, who plans to renegotiate an agreement on limiting government spending to tackle the debt crisis. In Holland, prime minister Mark Rutte tendered his government's resignation, paving the way for early elections after a minority party refused to back austerity plans. The turmoil wiped £27.6 billion from the value of the FTSE 100 Index. It fell nearly 2 per cent, or 106.6 points to 5665.6, while markets in Europe suffered sharper falls. Yields . on government debt - a reflection of the extra risk premium demanded by . investors to lend to states - were on the rise again. The . 10-year yield on Spanish bonds was a whisker under 6 per cent - a . crucial psychological level for the markets - at 5.95 per cent while . Italy's bonds traded at 5.71 per cent. The . yield on France's 10-year bonds were marginally higher at 3.08 per cent . while Dutch bonds traded up 10 basis points to 2.41 per cent. Concerns are now growing of a re-run of the eurozone concerns that sparked a global stock market sell-off last summer. Resignation expected: Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has called an emergency cabinet meeting after budget talks collapsed . Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG Index, said: 'One potential change of government in the eurozone is bad enough, but with the Dutch government falling apart as well, investors have been well and truly spooked.' To add to the gloom, Germany's manufacturing sector shrank at its fastest rate for nearly three years, and China's manufacturing sector continued to decline, albeit at a slower pace than previously. Falling: The German Dax and the French CAC both plunged today following Sarkozy's first round presidential election defeat . Banks were among the biggest fallers in London, with Barclays down 4 per cent, and taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds down 4 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. Shavaz Dhalla, a trader at Spreadex, said: 'Dismay could be a term used to describe global markets this afternoon as a series of poor economic data from the eurozone, exacerbated by news indicating that the Dutch government was close to collapse, brought global markets to their knees. 'This, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the potential for a new but less eurozone-friendly French president, caused investors to flee in the face of uncertainty.' Against austerity measures: Dutch right-wing leader Geert Wilders refuses to support budget cuts required for the Netherlands to comply with an EU fiscal pact . Reacting to news from the eurozone: The FTSE fell in early trading, a trend that continued until lunch time today . The prospect that Mr Sarkozy will fail to win re-election spooked markets because he has been a staunch ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel, who has spearheaded the drive to hammer out an agreement to limit government spending. All but two of the 27 countries in the European Union signed up to the 'fiscal compact', with the UK among those to abstain. Enforcing austerity on the eurozone . at a time when it is struggling to grow is likely to prove difficult, . with Spain and Italy already having to let deficit-reduction targets . slip. David Miller, a partner at Cheviot . Asset Management, said: 'If Sarkozy had won comfortably yesterday, it . would have been business as usual, with France and Germany trying to . hold the eurozone together. 'However, the new prospect of a new . president and new approach to dealing with the eurozone crisis has made . investors and European markets nervous. 'We'll see muddled markets until the final result is declared.' Meanwhile, in Holland, Mr Rutte . failed to get support from a right-wing party for budget cuts that would . bring the deficit under the EU limit of 3 per cent of gross domestic . product. The political crisis could lead to . the collapse of the government and risks the country losing its prized . triple-A rating, pushing up the rate at which the country can borrow . money. Spain's central bank says the country . is now in a technical recession as the economy contracted 0.4 per cent . in the first quarter of the year following a 0.3 per cent decline in the . previous quarter. The government has said the economy is shrinking and forecasts it will contract 1.7 per cent this year.","FTSE plunges almost 2 per cent to 5665.6 .

An armed mob ‘lured’ police on to the streets by firebombing a pub so they could attack them during last summer’s riots, a court heard today. They fired at least 12 shots at officers from four guns during the night of ‘orchestrated violence’ in Birmingham, a jury was told. Prosecutor Andrew Lockhart QC said the Barton Arms pub in the inner city Newtown area was set fire to before furniture from it was used to build a ‘makeshift barricade’ and to smash into other nearby shops and offices. Violence: An armed mob 'lured' police on to the streets by firebombing a pub so they could attack them during last summer's riots, a court heard today. This dramatic image shows a gunman firing a gun at police officers . Armed: The mob fired at least 12 shots at officers from four guns during the night of 'orchestrated violence' in Birmingham, a jury was told. This image shows some of those involved that night wearing masks . But in contrast to other incidents during the riots which spread across the country and saw large-scale looting, nothing else was stolen from any of the businesses because the dozens of masked and hooded men responsible for this incident had a ‘different agenda’. Mr Lockhart said: ‘This was an event in which they carried out a series of acts that they knew a large number of police officers would be deployed to deal with. ‘It was their aim to get a large number of police officers out on the streets where they could then be attacked... They were out on the street armed and intent on violence.’ It had ‘all the hallmarks of a planned event’, with two groups of men – the first numbering 25 or 26, and the second an unspecified number - converging on the pub and ‘a cheer going up’ when they came together. The jury was shown dramatic CCTV footage of some of them smashing their way into the pub with baseball bats shortly before midnight on August 9 last year before one lit a firebomb in the bar. Four people were upstairs in the pub at the time, which would have been obvious to the men attacking it as the upstairs lights were on, Mr Lockhart added. Vandalised: The jury was told that the Barton Arms pub, pictured, in the inner city Newtown area of Birmingham was set fire to before furniture from it was used to build a 'makeshift barricade' and to smash into other nearby shops and offices . The occupants dialled 999 when they heard the windows breaking and one of them rushed downstairs with a fire extinguisher when the intruders left. As the police were deployed, some of the group moved away and one could be seen on the CCTV firing a handgun. A police helicopter followed them as they left the area. On Monday, six men and two youths went on trial at Birmingham Crown Court over the incident. They are Tyrone Laidley, 20, Nicholas Francis, 26, and Joyah Campbell, 19, and two 17 year olds, who cannot be named for legal reasons, all of Birmingham. They were joined by Wayne Collins, 25, of Luton, Bedfordshire, Renardo Farrell, of Wolverhampton, and Jermaine Lewis, 27, of Oldbury, West Midlands. Planned: The court was told that it was the aim of the mob to get a large number of police officers out on the streets where they could then be attacked. This image showing a member of the mob was taken from the police helicopter . In the dock: Six men and two youths have gone on trial at Birmingham Crown Court over the incident . They are each charged with riot, violent disorder, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, and arson being reckless to whether life would be endangered. Mr Lockhart said not all the defendants could be shown to have been carrying guns themselves, but it is the prosecution case that all of them ‘encouraged or supported’ those who did. Similarly, the firebombing of the pub was a ‘joint venture’. The jury was told they will hear evidence that some of the defendants had met the day before to discuss what they were going to do. They also heard that there is a series of links between them, ranging from having been to school together to socialising. The eight defendants each deny all four charges. Some of them say they were incorrectly identified as being present, while others claim they were there but were not involved in the disorder. The case continues.","They fired at least 12 shots at officers .

Michael Silverleaf told a court hearing today that 'we are dealing with 500 claims, potentially' from people who say their voicemail messages were intercepted by the now-defunct News of the World. NGN has paid millions to settle lawsuits from 60 actors, athletes, politicians and other public figures whose voicemails were hacked by the tabloid.

Stoke City and England footballer Peter Crouch, ex-boxer Chris Eubank, . barrister Cherie Blair - wife of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair . - and also actor James Nesbitt and singer James Blunt. The News of the World has admitted it . hacked phones to listen in to voicemail messages and ‘blagged’ personal . details through impersonation. Wayne Rooney, left, and his singer James Blunt, right, have issued damages claims in the latest round of phone-hacking litigation . In February, Mr Coogan and Liberal Democrat MP . Simon Hughes were both in court to hear that they would receive £40,000 . and £45,000 respectively plus their legal fees. The court heard that Mr . Coogan was placed under surveillance in May 2002 while staying at a . London hotel and that private detective Glenn Mulcaire posed as him to . get confidential information from Vodafone between 2003 and 2006. Former Labour spin doctor Alastair . Campbell, who was described as a ‘writer, communicator and strategist’, . received undisclosed ‘substantial damages’ and was the only one who has . announced he would be donating the money to charity. Phone-hacking by the newspaper also . caused former England football star Paul Gascoigne ‘mental harm and . distress’, the court heard. He was so convinced that the information . published about him had come from his closest friends that he suffered a . breakdown. The newspaper agreed to pay him £68,000 plus costs and . apologised for the ‘seriously detrimental effect’. But it wasn’t just celebrities who were caught up in the disgraced tabloid’s actions. Rival journalists and their families, . people who were merely friends with celebrities, relatives of victims of . the 7/7 London bombings and even a dancer who shared the same surname . as Wayne Rooney were also targeted.

He said solicitors could earn between £140 and £400 an hour. The judge said he had set 'relatively low rates'. 'I’m afraid they are not low in comparison to what most people make,' Mr Justice Vos told the hearing. 'But they are low in terms of what lawyers sometimes charge.' At a pre-trial hearing, the lawyers discussed budgets. 'The objective (is to) limit costs of this litigation, which obviously are going to be very expensive because of the number of individual claimants,' said Mr Justice Vos. 'This really is a wholly exceptional piece of litigation.' He said he wanted to ensure that legal costs were 'proportionate', did not 'get out of hand' and were not 'disproportionate to the amount at stake'. The judge added: 'That is why I have set relatively low rates.' iPhones were used 'during the relevant period' Mr Justice Vos was told today how evidence had emerged about use of iPhones by 'senior executives' at News International. Lawyers representing claimants said evidence suggested that the company iPhones were used 'during the relevant period'. They asked for iPhones and related email accounts to be preserved. The judge said who used the iPhones and what they were used for would be 'open for discussion'. Lawyers would give no more detail about iPhone evidence outside court after the hearing.

Jailed: Ronnie Hutton admitted selling 76 vans while Co-operative boss to finance renovation of his semi-detached house . A £60,000-a-year transport manager of the Co-operative Group fleeced the firm by selling off dozens of its work vehicles and using the cash to renovate his house. Ronnie Hutton, who was in charge of the firm's nationwide fleet of vans, stole 76 work vehicles over two years so he could do up his smart semi-detached home in Romiley, near Stockport, Greater Manchester. The debt-ridden boss, who had climbed through the ranks from teenage apprentice to his management post, has been jailed after admitting the theft of £132,500. The father-of-two sold on Ford, . Renault and Volkswagen vans to long-term trade partners who thought the . vehicles were being sold legitimately by the Co-operative. But . instead Hutton, 41, kept the proceeds from the sales, while bosses . somehow failed to notice the financial hole in the company's books. Hutton, . who had been group fleet manager for six years, was eventually caught . when an anonymous whistle blower wrote a letter to senior management . revealing his scam. Bosses launched an internal audit against Hutton after the tip-off, which led to him yesterday being jailed for two years. Hutton . has offered to give up his company pension as a way of paying the money . back to his former firm, which has headquarters in Manchester. The buyers of the vehicles - Wythenshawe fleet transport firm, RIJ Services - have also been left out of pocket. After the frauds came to light, the Co-operative Group suspended its contract with the family business, leading to an 85 per cent drop in their trade. Hutton had a £225,000 mortgage on his semi-detached house in Romiley, near Stockport, Greater Manchester, and had used the money to renovate the house . Hutton wiped away tears as he was jailed yesterday at Manchester Crown Court, while his wife collapsed sobbing in the public gallery. Vincent Dean, defending, said it was ‘surprising’ the hole in the books had gone unnoticed for so long. He said his client had ‘over-extended’ by the purchase and renovation of his home, and hadn’t frittered the cash on ‘fast cars and luxury holidays’. Sold: Hutton told 76 vehicles, most of which were Ford Transit vans . Jailed: Judge Robert Atherton told Hutton at Manchester Crown Court that the former Co-operative boss had committed a 'gross breach of trust' Hutton began stealing in 2008 when he found himself owing £50,000 to banks, plus a £225,000 mortgage, and had meant to pay the money back, added Mr Dean. But as the costs of the renovation project spiralled out of control, he began helping himself to more money, the court heard. Sentencing, Judge Robert Atherton told Hutton he had committed a ‘gross breach of trust’. He said: 'I can’t help thinking that this was in the first place motivated by a wish for a standard of living which you simply could not possibly have managed - and you were not prepared to acknowledge that.'","Ronnie Hutton made over £130,000 selling vans and keeping proceeds ."

A mother-of two has endured feeling permanently seasick since spending a few days on a friend's boat two years ago. Claire Farrow decided to live on a house boat with her architect husband Ian Hogarth and their two children while they built their dream home in Kensington, London. But after just a few days of staying on the boat in Chelsea, Ms Farrow was left feeling dizzy, struggling to balance and vomiting up to five times a day. Queasy: After just a few days of staying on the boat in Chelsea, Claire Farrow was left feeling dizzy, struggling to balance and vomiting up to five times a day . The 44-year-old company director, said the symptoms started when a water taxi raced passed and shook the boat violently while she was asleep. She said she felt like she was rocking from side to side all day, but took some seasickness tablets and hoped the symptoms would pass. But Ms Farrow was horrified when even after moving off the boat within days she still felt seasick - with symptoms so severe she struggled to walk down the road. With constant dizziness and sickness . and finding it increasingly difficult to work, Ms Farrow went to see a . specialist who diagnosed her with the rare condition, Mal de . Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS). There is no known cure for the condition, and Ms Farrow still suffers from symptoms over two years later. She . said: 'Having spent years designing other people’s dream homes and 15 . years looking for a site, Ian and I had found a suitable piece of land . in London on which to build a house. 'We sold our flat to fund the build and with our two children moved onto a house boat, kindly lent to us by a friend. Construction site: Claire Farrow and her architect husband Ian Hogarth filmed during the building of their home on the Channel 4 show Grand Designs . 'We moved on the Friday, and I was fine until the Monday morning when a river taxi went racing under Battersea Bridge at the same time as the tide being very high. Mal de debarquement syndrome means 'illness of disembarkation.' It is a very rare condition that is triggered by travel, such as on a boat or plane. The symptoms last long after the journey has finished. Instead of the usual symptoms of motion sickness, such as nausea, people with mal de debarquement syndrome feel as though they are rocking or bobbing, and may describe it as feeling as if they are still on the boat. Many people feel like this for a few hours after a journey, but for people with mal de debarquement syndrome, the symptoms can last for months or even years. There are currently not any known cures for the condition. Source. NHS.co.uk . 'I remember it was 6.30am and I leapt out of bed in absolute terror, the whole boat was violently rocking from side to side and I couldn’t get my bearings at all, I got off the boat as quickly as possible and went to work. 'That day I felt very unstable on my . feet, I was literally rocking from side to side. I went to the chemist . and bought myself acupressure wrist bands to ease the sickness and also . sea sickness pills, neither of which helped in any way. 'That . night I was very nervous about being back on the boat. The next morning . the same thing happened and again, I left as quickly as possible. With . the nausea and dizziness now unbearable, Ms Farrow took to the internet to . find out if there was anything she could do to ease the symptoms. Having . previously suffered from labyrinthitis, an ear condition which can . cause imbalance Ms Farrow thought she may be suffering from it again as the . symptoms she was experiencing were very similar. She contacted a labryrinthist specialist and within twenty minutes of meeting him, he diagnosed her with MdDs. Ms Farrow said: 'I was devastated, not only was there no cure, my symptoms at . this point were unbearable and by now I was throwing up regularly, he . suggested we move off the boat immediately and find somewhere else to . live. 'Luckily some friends of ours came to the rescue and let us move into a flat of theirs they had bought to renovate. 'We moved the next day, having stayed on the boat for less than a week.' 'I . went for a series of vestibular tests and it was one of the most . horrific three hours of my life as my balance and vision was put under . exceptional testing. Final creation: The family lived on the boat until their innovative mews home in central London was built . Dream home: The couple even designed a light-up dance floor in their Kensington home . 'Again I was throwing up and for someone who rarely cries, I was weeping constantly as my life with these symptoms had become unbearable, I was begging for this torture to end. 'I was prepared to do anything, if only someone could take this condition away.' But Ms Farrow was distraught to discover there was no cure for her condition and although her symptoms have eased over the years, she still faces a daily battle with the condition. Ms Farrow and her family have since moved into their dream home which featured on homebuilding show, Grand Designs last year. But she said despite living on dry land for the last two years there are still days when her symptoms are so severe she finds herself holding onto the wall to walk down the street. She added: 'I have had MdDs for two years, and on some days my symptoms are so dreadful that I feel that awful misery coming back. 'Thankfully I love walking and one of the best things to do is to walk whilst looking left and right over and over again. 'Stress makes the symptoms worse, along with headaches. On days of stress and headaches I’m rocking and rolling all over the place. 'One of the things I find hard now, apart from living permanently with MdDs, is the fact that many people see it as an amusing and trifling illness. 'What they don’t understand is it is an incredibly invasive and life changing condition, the only relief I ever experienced was when I am driving or sleeping. 'I can no longer do many things that I was easily capable of.'","Claire Farrow, 44, lived on a house boat with her husband and two children .

With a wide grin and upbeat attitude, Stephanie Decker was released from the hospital on Saturday after having both of her legs amputated following the damage sustained from the deadly tornado that swept through Indiana. ‘I must say I feel pretty awesome,’ Mrs Decker told reporters as she left University of Louisville hospital. ‘I didn't expect to feel this way. I feel healthy, I feel strong. Happy to start healing: Stephanie Decker, 37, spent two weeks in hospital and had to have her legs amputated following the destruction that hit her as she protected her two children from the March 3 tornado . Road to recovery: Mrs Decker left the hospital on Saturday saying she felt 'pretty awesome' ‘I'm ready to tackle rehab. I'm ready to get that part of this stepping stone over but I feel really, really, really good,’ she told MSNBC. Mrs Decker, 37, lost one leg above the knee and the other foot protecting her 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter as the storm flattened their 'dream home' in Henryville, Indiana on March 3. Her selfless act, which saved her life and the lives of her two children, has inspired many. She has spoken out previously about the ordeal since she arrived in the hospital two weeks ago, saying that she remembered how uncertain she was about the impending disaster that she filmed a message on her mobile phone to her husband, telling him she loved him. 'I assumed I was safe and I heard the roar like a train, and I heard it behind me, and I knew it was coming,' she told ABC News from her hospital bed in Louisville, Kentucky. 'And it was so loud that I knew that I needed to do something different. I knew staying put wasn't going to work.' 'Dream home': The Deckers had spent nine months building their home in Henryville, Louisiana . Ruins: The home was reduced to a pile of rubble by the 175 mph storm that flattened much of the town . With the house disintegrating, she grabbed her son Dominic, 8, and daughter Reese, 5, and ran to the basement, where she wrapped them in a blanket and climbed on top of them. 'I remember the whole thing,' she said. 'I stayed conscious the whole time. I couldn't afford [to pass out]. They needed me. They had to have me, so I had to figure out what to do.' She held on tightly to the children as the house fell down around her. 'Everything started hitting my back, beams, pillars, furniture - everything was slamming into my back,' she told The Today Show. 'But I had my children in the blanket and I was on top of them and I was reaching around holding them. Happy family: Stephanie was surrounded by her family at the hospital, including her husband Joe (left), son Dominic (center right) and Reese (right) A mother's love: As soon as the storm passed, Dominic, 8, ran to a neighbor's home for help . 'They were screaming, ""Mommy, I can’t live without you! I don’t wanna die, please don’t let me die!"" and I said, ""you’re not going to die, we’re going to make it"".' Then she realised she had been badly hurt, with her leg appearing as if it had been severed. She also suffered seven broken ribs and a punctured lung. Fighting back the tears, she said: 'It was cut off or it was barely attached. I took my phone and I made a video to my husband to tell him I love him.' Heroine: Stephanie Decker threw herself on her two young children to save them from the tornado that flattened their home. She has recounted the fearful moments from her hospital bed . 'I knew it was bad. If I didn't get help soon, I was going to bleed out,' she added to ABC News. Knowing his mother was hurt, it was Dominic's turn for bravery. He crawled out from under his mother and ran to a neighbor's house. 'After Dominic left, I realised I couldn't get out because I actually used the comforter I tied with them as a tourniquet. I knew I was cut,' she said. Fears: Mrs Decker was so worried she was going to die as a result of her injuries that she filmed a video on her mobile phone for her husband Joe, pictured, to tell him she loved him . Saved: Mrs Decker protected her two children, eight-year-old Dominic (L) and five-year-old Reese (R) Motherly: Mrs Decker, pictured with Dominic and her nephew, was saved when her son ran for help . One neighbour, Brian Lovins, a Clark County Sheriff’s officer, used his belt to create a tighter tourniquet and drove her until he could flag down an ambulance, which took her to hospital. Mrs Decker added, tearfully: 'I want these kids to have a mum and I did not want them to grow up without me.' Her husband, Joe Decker, tearfully said that the flattened house had been their dream home. His wife had said she always wanted to have the children's handprints imprinted in the foundation's cement, because 'we were never gonna leave here'. The small prints, with the 'Reese' and 'D' for Dominic, remain scrawled in the concrete. Mr Decker said: 'What I told her was: ""You’re alive and you get to see your kids grow up"".' The home, which was partly built by Mr Decker and his wife's father, is now completely destroyed, with a bathtub 200 feet away in a nearby field, the Courier Journal reported. Gone: The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mrs Decker said . Remaining strong: The children's hand prints can still be seen in the home's foundations . The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mr Decker added.Henryville was nearly entirely flattened by a series of tornadoes that ravaged the South and Midwest on Friday March 3, killing 39 and leaving thousands homeless.

Tyler praised the Deckers who 'lost everything' and said that the company has set up a trust fund, The Stephanie Decker Recovery Fund, to help pay their medical bills and the losses they suffered. Destruction: The Decker family home was just one of the hundreds . destroyed by tornadoes in Indiana. Damage can be seen in nearby Marysville which was . entirely wiped off the map by the severe weather .

Ministers are ready to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on new spy planes – just months after controversially chopping up a £4.1billion fleet of nine unused Nimrods to save money. A senior RAF officer revealed the Ministry of Defence wants the new planes to plug a ‘capability gap’ left by the loss of the Nimrods. David Cameron axed the ‘spy-in-the-sky’ Nimrod MRA4 aerial surveillance planes in October 2010, prompting criticism from top military figures and MPs who warned it would weaken Britain’s defences. Costly: One of the Nimrod MRA4 surveillance planes, which never entered service . But even though the then Defence Secretary Liam Fox admitted at the time the move was a ‘risk’, ministers pressed on, claiming it would save the MoD £2billion over the next ten years. Fury mounted when photographs emerged last year of wrecking crews chopping the wings off the Nimrods, which never even became operational. Now ministers are facing fresh humiliation after it emerged the cash-strapped MoD is likely to buy ‘off-the-shelf’ RC-135 Rivet Joint or P-8 Poseidon aircraft, both made by U.S. aerospace giant Boeing. Air Vice-Marshal Mark Green, director of the MoD’s joint and air capability transformation, said: ‘The underlying view of the MoD is that an aircraft is likely over the medium term to be the solution that actually fills the gap that was created when we took the Nimrod out of service.’ The then Defence Secretary Liam Fox (pictured) admitted at the time the move was a 'risk' The RAF officer was giving evidence to the Commons’ defence select committee, which has launched an inquiry into the UK’s maritime surveillance capability. He insisted the decision to demolish the Nimrods had been a ‘tolerable risk, not a gamble’. But Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy said: ‘The Government treated probably the most expensive, technically capable aircraft in our history like a second-hand car. 'They just scrapped it and chopped it into pieces.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘The decision not to bring the Nimrod MRA4 into service was difficult but our ability to operate maritime patrol aircraft is being maintained. ‘Only one Nimrod MRA4 had been delivered to the RAF and it had not passed airworthiness tests, the project was hundreds of millions over budget, years late and needed considerable extra funding to rectify long-running technical problems.’",MoD wants new planes to plug a 'culpability gap' left by loss of Nimrods .

Sandy Woodward, commander of the task force sent to reclaim the islands 30 years ago next month, said the Navy was in a 'dire' state . The Navy is as much use as 'a Swiss Navy' and would not be able to recapture the Falkland Islands if Argentina invaded, claims a veteran military chief. The broadside came from Sandy Woodward, commander of the task force sent to reclaim the islands in the south Atlantic 30 years ago next month. He said the Navy was in a 'dire' state following defence cuts which has left the service without an aircraft carrier before 2020. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'We could not retake the Falklands. If we had been in this state in 1982 the Falklands would be the Malvinas.' Rear-Admiral Sir John Forster Woodward - who is known as Sandy - compared the British Navy to the Swiss Navy - the country does not have one - and said the role of a navy was to be able to go a long way from home. He said: 'The best we can do for an expeditionary force is a day trip to France'. It is not the first time a senior member of the military has attacked defence cuts and raised concerns about the Falklands. Former First Sea Lord West has called for foreign aid cash to be diverted to defence after also warning Britain could not win a new Falklands War. And, Major General Julian Thompson who commanded the brigade of Royal Marines during the conflict, said the . islands have been left vulnerable by the cuts, and it would be 'end . of story' if Argentine forces took the British base on East Falkland. He told The Times earlier this month: 'The Argentines have a marine brigade. They've got a parachute brigade and some good special forces.' 'All they've got to do is get those guys . on to the islands for long enough to destroy the (RAF) Typhoon jets and . that's the end of it.' Sandy Woodward said the Navy was in a 'dire' state following defence cuts which has left it without an aircraft carrier before 2020. Port Stanley, the island's capital is pictured . Former First Sea Lord West has called for foreign aid cash to be diverted to defence after also warning Britain could not win a new Falklands war . Lord West says the Government was mad to cut the number of frigates and destroyers to 19, just one more than the 18 sunk or damaged in the 1982 conflict. He believes small cuts in the aid, health or welfare budgets would make a disproportionate difference to defence and would enable Britain to restore its naval strength. Lord West, then Commander Alan West, was skipper of HMS Ardent when she was sunk during the Falklands campaign. The conflict claimed the lives of 255 British and 649 Argentine servicemen. The former Labour minister believes the lessons of that war are being forgotten in the current Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). Diplomatic tension: Relations between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict . In an interview with the Plymouth-based Western Morning News he said : 'There are things which our nation thinks its forces can do, but they can no longer do them. Ever since 1945 we have been cutting and cutting. 'I am horrified our naval flotilla now comprises only 19 frigates and destroyers. Major General Julian Thompson said the islands have been left vulnerable by defence cuts . 'In the Falklands, in the first month of fighting, we had four sunk and 14 damaged. That makes you think. We seem to have forgotten that when you fight you lose things. 'Here we are with 19 frigates and destroyers. Are they bonkers? Are they mad? How have they allowed this to happen? 'Today, because we don't have the carriers with fixed wing aircraft, we could not retake the Falklands, without our maritime we could not possibly have done it. 'I believe defence should get a better crack of the whip among Government departments. It seems to me a tiny fraction of the aid budget, the welfare budget and of the NHS, so tiny it would hardly affect them, would make an immense difference to defence. 'Yes there will be howls. We won't be able to give the Indians some aid so they won't be able to build their aircraft carriers. 'We won't be able to find something in health or in welfare. That always causes howls and squeals but the amounts we are talking about are tiny.'",Sandy Woodward says the British Navy is as much use as a Swiss Navy .

Shut down: Diablo Canyon, in California, was completely closed yesterday after a swarm of salp was found clogging filters meant to keep marine life out and the unit cool . Tom Cuddy, senior communications manager, said: 'We made the conservative decision to ramp down the affected unit to 20 per cent and continued to monitor the situation. 'When the problem continued, we made another conservative decision that it would be safest to curtail the power of the unit. 'Safety is the highest priority. We will not restart the unit until the salp moves on and conditions improve. No priority is more important than safe operation of our facility.'

A 20-year-old college student is dead and another man is being sought by police after a late night altercation in the New York City subway turned deadly. LaGuardia Community College student Joshua Basin died Friday night after an oncoming train pinned him between the tracks and the platform at the Bedford Avenue stop in Brooklyn. Police are now hunting for a man identified in his 30s that witnesses say pushed him onto to tracks. Manhunt: The NYPD released a sketch of the man who allegedly pushed college student Joshua Basin on the subway tracks; though he managed to escape, Basin was run over by an oncoming train . Late night fight: 20-year-old Joshua Basin died after he was struck by an oncoming L train at Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn . The Howard Beach, Queens resident got into a verbal argument with another man while riding a Manhattan-bound L train, police said. He and the man, thought to be white and in his early 30s, exited the train at the trendy Bedford Ave stop. The man, wearing a black fleece, reportedly said, ‘It’s showtime.’ That’s when things got physical, witnesses said. During the fight, both men fell onto the tracks as hundreds of horrified witnesses looked on. Though the attacker - who is believed to have been drunk - managed to escape before the train came into the station, Mr Basin was not so lucky, and was hit by an oncoming train. ‘When I looked, he was trying to pull himself out, but there wasn’t enough time,’ one witness told the New York Post. Another witness told CBS New York: ‘There was a woman kneeling beside (Basin), and she was doing the best she could. Investigating: Police quickly blocked off the scene and are still looking for the man that was picking a fight with Mr Basin, believed to be a white male . Nightmare: Hundreds of witnesses waiting on the platform watched in horror as the two fell onto the tracks and Basin was crushed . He was taken to Bellvue Hospital with series injuries, and later died. His mother, Zena Basin, described her son as ‘happy-go-lucky,’ – the opposite of a fighter. ‘If you met him once, you will never forget him,’ she told CBS New York. ''The conductor told us all to back up away from the windows. She kept shouting, ""Get back! You don’t want to see this!""' She told the New York Daily News that she’s seeking justice for her son. ‘Whoever did this to my son needs to turn himself in. I need to find out why he did this to my son.’ Police are still investigating the incident; no arrests have yet been made. One Brooklyn resident, Sean R. Nyffeler, who was riding on the train wrote of the horrific experience on his blog. He said he was sitting in the front car – the one that pinned Mr Basin – and felt ‘two or three dull thuds that jostled the entire car.’ Mr Nyffeler wrote: ‘The conductor… told us all to back up away from the windows. She kept shouting, “Get back! You don’t want to see this!”’ Demanding answers: Joshua's mother Zena Basin told reporters that she has no idea why someone would do this to her son . Get back: The train conductor told riders 'You don't want to see this!' as they ushered riders out of the car . Though he didn’t mean to look at the gruesome scene, he said he looked before police ushered him out of the station. ‘He was stuck…between the car and the platform from his waist down, facing the train,’ Mr Nyffeler wrote. 'He was moving his arms so I knew he wasn’t dead yet, but as I stumbled up the stairs and onto Bedfore Ave. I also knew there was no coming back from that.' Brooklyn bound: The Bedford Avenue stop is in Williamsburg, a trendy Brooklyn neighbourhood that was known for its Orthodox Jewish community . The New York subway has been a backdrop to several gruesome deaths this year. Only two months ago, an unidentified man’s severed head was found wedged between the train and the platform as the L train pulled up to the 14th Street and Sixth Avenue station. The same day, 22-year-old Brian O’Mara was struck and killed while wandering in the tunnel between the First and Third avenue stops. It was unclear why Mr O’Mara, who worked at a web firm, was on the tracks. The L train runs east from 14th Street and Eighth Avenue in Chelsea, passing through Union Square, East Village, and then entering Brooklyn via Bedford Avenue. It continues out to Canarsie in Brooklyn.","Joshua Basin, 20, died after oncoming subway train after falling onto the tracks during a fight .

Millions of young Britons dream of the moment when they will finally climb onto the property ladder and get the keys to their own front door. But how many of them imagine that their first home will be in Milton Keynes? A report, published today by the financial information firm Experian, reveals how first-time buyers are being forced to buy in towns which might not be everybody’s first choice. Grim: A housing estate in Milton Keynes where almost 10 per cent of homes are owned by first-time buyers . Desirable? One of the MANY roundabouts in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire . The Buckinghamshire town, best-known for its concrete cows and complicated system of roundabouts, is named today as Britain’s first-time buyer hotspot. The report reveals one in ten households in the town - established in 1967 and now with a population of around 245,000 - is a first-time buyer. Another hotspot is Slough, a town which is still recovering from its damning appearance in the famous Sir John Betjeman poem. For many people, the town, sandwiched between the M40 and M4, reminds them of the opening line: ‘Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough!’ Landmark: Liz Leyh's famous concrete cows in Milton Keynes - a town which is popular with first-time buyers . For others, it is a reminder of BBC’s The Office, starring Ricky Gervais, as Slough was the headquarters of the fictional firm Wernham Hogg. The Office also provides a nod to another hotspot - the Wiltshire town from where ‘the Swindon lot’ came to join the Slough HQ. Other first-time buyer hotspots will be named today as Aldershot, Dartford, Basingstoke and Crawley. It comes as the number of first-time buyers in Britain has collapsed due to the toxic combination of high property prices and a chronic squeeze in mortgages. For a young person to buy, they need to be either very rich, very well-paid or have parents who are prepared to lend, or give, them the money for a deposit. 'Smart': The Centre MK - the shopping centre in Milton Keynes . The average young person in their twenties earns around £21,000, but the average house prices is around £165,000, an impossible gap for many young people to jump. The Experian report, published today, said: ‘Ever since homeownership began around the 50s and 60s, Londoners have had to move out to the regions to be able to afford a home.’ It said towns such as Milton Keynes are ‘very attractive and practical places to live which allow first-time purchasers to have the lifestyle as well as to get on the property ladder.’ Table shows the percentage of first time buyers in different towns and the average property price. 1) Milton Keynes 9.5%, £202,425 . 2) Dartford 9.3%, £205,324 . 3) Swindon 8.9%, £169,571 . 4) Aldershot 8.6%, £216,022 . 5) Hempstead Valley 8.2%, £169,255 . 6) Basingstoke 8.1%, £251,870 . 7) Crawley 7.8%, £200,274 . 8) Slough 7.8%, £207,593 . 9) Bexleyheath 7.6%, £224,096 . 10) Aylesbury 6.9%,£264,923 . Source: Experian . David Hill, chief executive of Milton Keynes Council said: ‘Milton Keynes is a very prosperous place which is flourishing despite these tough economic times. ‘The fact that we have so many new businesses opening or relocating here means that we can offer first-time buyers much needed job security.’ London dominates the list of places where first-time buyers are least likely to be have any luck, particularly boroughs such as Hammersmith, Kensington and Chelsea. In Milton Keynes, the average home costs £202,000, compared to £1.3million in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Matt Griffiths, from the campaign group Priced Out, said a generation of young people forced to rent, when they are desperate to buy, fuels considerable anger. He said: ‘Most renters can be thrown out of their flat at two months’ notice. We have the most insecure rental market in Europe. ‘This insecurity is undermining family life.

BBC radio presenter Richard Bacon has revealed he was targeted by an abusive internet troll for nearly two years after he replaced Simon Mayo on BBC Radio Five Live. The anonymous online abuse was directed not only at him, but also his wife and baby son and became so hateful, he was forced to report the suspect to the police. The 36-year-old has spoken out in a documentary about cyber bullying due to be shown tonight, despite fearing this will provide further ammunition for internet trolls. Concern: BBC radio presenter Richard Bacon has revealed he was targeted by an abusive internet troll for nearly two years . The rise of internet trolls - the name for people who offend and bait others on the web - has significantly risen with the development of social networks which people feel give them a place to insult other internet users without real-life repercussions. Bacon said the abuse began when he replaced Simon Mayo on the radio show and the man voiced his dislike of the new programme on Twitter. But then it started to take on a more sinister tone when the troll started to mention the former Blue Peter presenter's wife Rebecca McFarlane and the couple's five-month-old son Arthur. In a BBC article Bacon explained 'This fella was fantasising about my death, daydreaming about me dying in a plane crash, and expressing his hope that my body would be mangled in a car wreck.' Personal attack: The online comments started to take on a more sinister tone when the troll started to mention the presenter's wife Rebecca McFarlane and the couple's five-month-old son Arthur . 'Not content with just repeating how much he hated me on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis, he started posting links full of abuse to my wife, mother and work colleagues.' In the BBC 3 documentary, The Anti-Social Network, Bacon tried to track down his abuser and also met bereaved relatives left distraught after they were preyed on by 'RIP Trolls' posting offensive messages on tribute sites. The suspect is a man in his forties and during the three months the documentary was being made, the man posted 255 abusive Tweets. Bacon originally wanted to try to meet the troll who was targeting him, but had been advised to take it to the police. 'I wanted to know how a dislike of a radio station could go to contacting my family and tweeting about my baby,' he said. 'But the advice I got from a psychologist . and a police officer was to make an official complaint, so I'm in the . process right now of making a complaint to the police.' In an article for the Sun on Sunday, the radio presenter described how the internet abuse spread. 'A few years ago, he began a blog called . ‘Richard Bacon is a ****’. He then went on Twitter and, using as his . wallpaper a photograph of me when I had been assaulted a few years ago, . he began tweeting abuse to me, my family and work colleagues. 'As a broadcaster, a bit of abuse comes with the territory, and in no way am I comparing what I was exposed to with the shocking levels of abuse directed at the grieving families I met. 'But when the abuse started to escalate, I felt he had crossed a line,' he wrote in the newspaper. His partner  Rebecca McFarlane tried to reason with the troll on Twitter, but the abuse escalated and IT experts were called in to help piece together the identity of the suspected troll using clues from his online activity. Hate campaign: He said the abuse began when he replaced Simon Mayo on the radio show and the man voiced his dislike of Bacon's programme on Twitter . During the programme Bacon met families who had been targeted by trolls, in cases he said were far more distressing than what he had been through. 'What I have been through isn't that bad really, it's been distressing for my family but personally as a broadcaster it's something I know how to deal with. 'What's really heartbreaking is the parents and families of people who have killed themselves.' He met the parents of Tom Mullaney, 15, from Bournville, Birmingham, who apparently killed himself after being bullied online. A tribute site for him was hit by trolls, leaving vulgar messages that were seen by his family and friends. 'They see these nice tributes then they also see these weird sexual, violent comment and imagery,' he said. 'For people who don't even understand Facebook in the first place, as well as being upsetting and prolonging their grief, it's confusing.' During the documentary, he also met a self-appointed 'troll hunter', who tries to track the people down and expose them. 'What he does is he works out who they are then posts letters to their neighbours saying, 'do you know your neighbour is doing this?' In the documentary Bacon . tracked down Colm Coss, who was jailed for posting . obscene messages on sites in memory of dead people, including . Big Brother star Jade Goody and tribute site to John Paul Massey, a . Liverpool boy mauled to death by a dog . He said the 'troll hunter' told him perpetrators had started hacking other people's accounts and sending offensive messages from their identities, which could lead to retaliation. 'Imagine if you're the brother of the person who has killed themselves and you see the name and picture of a person you think is doing it, some people might react with violence. 'The troll thing is in an abstract world, but increasingly what they do is crossing over into the real world.' In the documentary Bacon also tracks down Colm Coss, who was jailed for 18 weeks in October 2010 for posting obscene messages on Facebook sites in memory of dead people, including Big Brother star Jade Goody and tribute site to John Paul Massey, a Liverpool boy mauled to death by a dog. Bacon said he hoped to alert people to the growing problem and how to stop it: 'I met two in the show, they are quite intelligent, meek and mild people and some have quite respectable jobs. 'Their power and the thrills they get all come from their anonymity.' He said he thought some trolls saw themselves as 'brave', and making dangerous 'jokes', but added: . 'But what they are doing is targeting individuals. 'They know their fellow trolls are watching. You can abuse someone in front of an audience and that's why in the end all it is is bullying. 'Some of these trolls will themselves be deserving of sympathy but that doesn't mean we shouldn't tackle them. 'It's time to stand up to them, it's time to either expose them or if you're a victim go to the police.' The Anti-Social Network airs tonight at 9pm on BBC Three.","Radio Five Live presenter said criticism of his radio show .

A couple were banned from owning animals for eight years today - after they admitted keeping 56 dogs in the back garden of their semi-detatched home. Shocked animal welfare officers found 69 animals - including 56 dogs, six birds, three cats and four chinchillas - at the family home of James Hood, 40, and wife Nicola, 32. The couple - who also have five children including a 16-month-old baby - escaped jail after they were given conditional discharges for admitting keeping the malnourished pets in filthy conditions. Cramped: The Hoods' back garden filled with huskies, German shepherds, rottweilers and Staffordshire bull terriers . Sick: James and Nicola Hood were banned from keeping animals for eight years . Magistrates banned the pair from keeping animals for eight years after hearing their home had been pelted with eggs and BRICKS since the allegations emerged. They were given seven days to get rid of the animals they still own - including a cat, seven gerbils, two hamsters, a lizard, a budgie, four cockatoos and a parrot. Magistrates in Taunton, Somerset, heard the pair admitted keeping the disease-ridden dogs in filthy conditions and pleaded guilty to nine animal welfare charges last month. The court heard RSPCA officers were greeted with a ‘sea of dogs barking wildly’ when they visited their home in Minehead, Somerset, in October last year. Officials conducted a full search of their four-bedroomed house and small grounds to discover a total of 56 dogs crammed into their back garden. Sorry sight: The picture, taken by shocked RSPCA officers, showed visibly distressed dogs . Appalling: Mostly huskies gather round an RSPCA officer after a surprise visit . They counted 36 huskies, four collies, two German shepherds, two labradors, one boxer dog, two Staffordshire bull terriers with two puppies, one springer spaniel, two doberman, three rotweillers and one greyhound. The court was told they had turned their home into a makeshift ‘animal sanctuary’. Officers also found three cats kept in an upstairs bathroom and four parakeets in the bedroom of the crying nine-month old baby. James Mumford, prosecuting yesterday, read out a statement from the vet who attended the address: ‘The situation was totally inappropriate and unsuitable for the animals. ‘Of all the 56 dogs seized the majority were well below the expected body condition score. ‘Most scored one to one and a half - with the ideal score being three - showing they were inadequately nourished.’ He told the court that many were found to be suffering from medical problems including gastro-intestinal disease and skin problems. Ian Denley, defending the couple, said: ‘I think this is a very sad case. ‘You have two people who have taken in animals for the best motives, in some instances they were to be euthanised. ‘They have clearly done what they thought at the time was the right thing. Trapped: Two puppies stuck in a cage at the house in Minehead . ‘Clearly the number of animals has been the problem and as a consequence they have not been able to cope. ‘Since proceedings have begun they have been villainised. They have had hate mail and bricks and eggs thrown at their house. ‘They are very upset and very distraught and want to put the matter behind them. ‘It was a very sad case and they want to move on for themselves and their family.’ Keith Parks, chair of the bench at Taunton Magistrates Court, gave the pair conditional discharges for 24 months and banned them from keeping animals for eight years. The couple were also ordered to pay costs of £250 each at £5 a week. Mr Parks said: ‘In recognising the seriousness of the offences and the number of animals involved you are disqualified from owning or keeping any animal for the next eight years.’ Speaking outside the court, RSPCA Inspector Amanda Swift said: ‘This is a very good sentence today - we are pleased. ‘We had a disqualification for all animals for eight years which stops them having any more animals for the foreseeable future.’","James and Nicola Hood, who also kept six birds, three cats and four chinchillas in filthy conditions, were banned from keeping animals ."

Charged: Brenda Nicholas (pictured) allegedly duped a depressed pensioner out of $1million after claiming she could lift her 'grey aura' with a 'special soap' A palm reader has been accused of swindling more than $1million from an elderly woman after allegedly telling her victim she needed help lifting a 'grey aura about her'. Brenda Nicholas, 46, has been charged with nearly 50 counts of first-degree theft from the 85-year-old Seattle pensioner over a two-year period. Police say Nicholas, who had been using the name Monica Marks, met the victim while working at the Chinatown street fair in 2007. Feeling alone and depressed, the woman agreed to pay Nicholas for a palm reading, where she was allegedly told she needed help to sort out her life, it was reported on www.seattlepi.com. Nicholas convinced the victim she could help, but at a steep price, according to court documents. She bought the victim what she referred to as a 'special soap' which she claimed would wash away her grey aura. She said it was made by a man called Father Thomas who could see the past, present and future. Nicholas also gave the elderly woman a mystery pill each time she visited intended to make her feel better, but the victim said they made her feel like she was in a 'fog'. The woman ended up making cash withdrawals ranging from $1,000 to $9,900 up to four times a week until she became broke in February 2011, police said. Accused: Nicholas met her alleged victim while working at a fair and before long had her withdrawing thousands of pounds each week for her services, according to court documents (file picture) In total, Nicholas is accused manipulating the woman out of $1,088,500. According to prosecutors, Nicholas has prior convictions for theft, embezzlement and grand theft auto in California. She is also facing theft and unlawful possession of a firearm charges connected to several other local cases. She is currently in King County Jail on $500,000 bail. Two of her associates, Gilda Ivonne Ramirez and Charles Wayne Jungbluth, are also facing multiple theft charges.","Brenda Nicholas offered to help depressed 85-year-old .

Happily, she was finally led to safety . But it seems unlikely the eurozone will also have a happy ending as countries . plunged into bitter in-fighting last night as Germany was accused of . ‘insulting’ Greece and trying to force it out of the single currency. Simmering tensions between members of . the 17-strong eurozone boiled over when senior Greek ministers lashed . out at Germany over the tough austerity conditions attached to a second . £110billion bailout. In Brussels there was open speculation . that several countries, including Germany, Austria, Finland and the . Netherlands,  now believe Greece’s exit from the single currency is all . but inevitable. One senior official said: ‘There is resentment, mistrust, really bitter debate.’ Germany’s finance minister Wolfgang . Schaeuble had earlier sparked fury in Greece by suggesting the country . is a  ‘bottomless pit’. In an angry rebuttal, the Greek . president Karolos Papoulias – an 82-year-old veteran of Greece’s . resistance against the Nazi occupation – said: ‘Who is Mr Schaeuble to . insult Greece?

The man brought in to sort out his . country’s finances post-Silvio Berlusconi said the economies had both . breached the Stability And Growth Pact. Monti also offered Greece support, saying it was too simplistic to label EU states either ‘good’ or ‘bad’. ‘There are many in the eurozone who . don’t want us any more,’ he said. ‘Our country is waging a battle of . survival within the eurozone.’ His intervention came amid . extraordinary scenes in Athens, including one incident in which a woman . who faced a wage cut and possible redundancy, threatened to jump from . her office window.

Billionare hedge fund manager John . Paulson, who predicted the credit crunch, yesterday joined  those . predicting the euro will ultimately collapse.

WAYNE Rooney and Emma Noble, the former daughter-in-law of Sir John Major, are among the latest celebrities to sue over allegations of phone hacking. Theirs are two of 46 new civil claims filed against the News of the World, it was revealed at the High Court yesterday. In April last year, Rooney wrote on Twitter that he had been contacted by Scotland Yard detectives probing phone hacking, but this is the first time he has filed a claim. His agent, Paul Stretford, has also done so. Wayne Rooney, left, and his singer James Blunt, right, have issued damages claims in the latest round of phone-hacking litigation . Model and game show host Miss Noble, who was married to former Tory Prime Minister Sir John Major’s son, James, until 2004, has also lodged a claim. Others seeking damages for alleged invasion of privacy include actor James Nesbitt, former Conservative cabinet minister and chief whip Lord Blencathra, Fire Brigades Union general secretary Andy Gilchrist and former rugby player turned TV pundit Matt Dawson. The details emerged in court papers at a case management conference held yesterday to deal with the deluge of civil claims filed against News Group Newspapers, the News International subsidiary which published the now-defunct Sunday tabloid. Emma Noble, left, who was married to Prime . Minister John Major’s son James and rugby player and pundit . Matt Dawson, right, are also suing . Hugh Tomlinson, QC, representing the majority of alleged phone hacking victims, told Mr Justice Vos that there had been 46 new cases filed. They are part of a second wave of civil actions following the settlement of more than 50 cases earlier this year, including suits filed by former deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott, actor Jude Law and singer Charlotte Church. In a previous hearing, the judge said he expected there to be 200 new claims submitted over the coming months. Mr Tomlinson told the court that there were 4,791 potential phone-hacking victims, of which 1,892 had been contacted by the police. The police believed 1,174 were ‘likely victims’. TV presenter Jamie Theakston and footballer Ryan Giggs are also on the list of 46 names released today . Mr Justice Vos yesterday criticised the high number of solicitors representing alleged victims after hearing that £10million in costs had so far been incurred. He said it was ‘unbelievable’ that 58 firms of solicitors were representing just 100 claimants and said it would be appropriate to encourage alleged victims to instruct lawyers who already had specialist knowledge of the litigation. The judge was also told that some of those bringing claims wanted to remain anonymous. But he said: ‘If you bring legal proceedings in this country, you expect to have them publicly known.’ Public figures including Cherie Blair and Alex Best, the widow of the ex-Manchester United footballer George Best, have already filed lawsuits, along with the man wrongly accused of murdering Rachel Nickell, Colin Stagg. Others include comedian Bobby Davro former boxer Chris Eubank and footballer Peter Crouch. In January, the publishers settled 37 actions, followed by another 21 in February. The cost of phone hacking to Rupert Murdoch's newspaper empire has already been estimated to be in excess of £240 million .","Judge told there are 4,791 potential victims and 1,892 have been contacted .

A choir has been sacked by a vicar after refusing to undergo criminal  record checks. The choristers have been singing together for years, but Father James Baker told them they had to be assessed by the Criminal Records Bureau. Not singing any more: Wendy Warr, Sandra Woodward and Jenny Hansford alongside Father James Baker. The choir members have been sacked because they refused to undergo CRB checks . When two members in their 80s, who have more than 100 years of church singing experience between them, refused, they were apparently sacked in front of the congregation. The vicar then sent an email to the remaining seven members saying that they should ‘step down’. Father Baker, 40, is officially said to be ‘re-examining’ the kind of music enjoyed by the 70-strong congregation St Michael and All Angels Church. He is said to be keen to introduce less  traditional sounds, including French  meditative chanting. But his intervention has sparked fury at the 19th century church in Yeovil, Somerset. The former psychiatric nurse, who joined the church in 2010, enjoys extreme sports including sky-diving, swimming with sharks and ‘Zorbing’, which involves rolling down a hill inside a large inflatable ball. Row: Musical director Jenny Hansford (centre) and Sandra Woodward, left, and Wendy Warr have all quit St Michael's and All Angels Church have all quit the choir in a row over having to undergo CRB checks . Row: Father James Baker allegedly sacked two elderly choir members who had together been singing for a combined total of more than 100 years after they refused to undergo CRB checks . He once raised money for church funds by diving into a shark-infested pool in a wetsuit complete with dog collar. And he describes music as one  of his favourite pastimes, as well  as ‘a bad game of golf’ and  home brewing. He handed the choir the  CRB forms after a Sunday service in January, wrongly believing that anyone involved with the church had to be assessed. Former musical director Jenny Hansford said: ‘Two elderly gentlemen said they didn’t need to. They went to speak to the vicar in front of the congregation and he just said, “I am sorry but you are sacked from the choir then”. The church insisted the choir quit in a row over introducing Taize meditative chanting. The Taize Community is a modern movement in northern France, founded only in 1940. The community of 100 Catholic and Protestant Monks is visited by thousands of pilgrims every year. Songs take the form of short meditative chants which are repeated over and over. Many British churches have adopted the chants. ‘They are both distraught. They are wonderfully talented and aged 83, they have both been in the choir for their whole lives. We were absolutely shocked.’ Mrs Hansford, who is also the organist at the church, said Father Baker then decided to axe the choir entirely due to the ‘tensions’. He wrote in an email: ‘The Church wardens and I regrettably feel that it would be appropriate at this time for the choir to temporarily step down with immediate effect.’ When the remaining members of the choir turned up to sing the following Sunday, they were told to sit in the congregation area. Mrs Hansford, a grandmother-of-six from Marnhull, Dorset, resigned from her post on February 22 after the vicar failed to reassure her that the choir would be reinstated. She said the choristers, who include her husband Michael, 72, a retired engineer, were now searching for other churches to sing in. She added: ‘We are a tiny little choir, just nine adult members. We were supposed to have two children join us but the vicar dismissed us before they got their robes. ‘It is heartbreaking because they were so excited.’ Fury: Sandra Woodward, left, organist Jenny Hansford, centre, and Wendy Warr who have all stood down from their positions after being ordered to undergo criminal record vetting . Father Baker’s demand for CRB checks is not thought to be related to the children’s arrival. Yesterday the Diocese of Bath and Wells confirmed all the choir members had been asked to stand down. But a spokesman said choir members were already in a ‘cooling off period’ because some had resisted Father Baker’s ‘modern’ ideas. The vicar had planned to introduce Taize chanting, from a Christian community in France. The spokesman said: ‘The church are re-examining all of the music in services and the choir has been asked to stand down as this goes on. The CRB checks were a misunderstanding, which the vicar has apologised for. He thought that all members of the choir needed a CRB check which they didn’t. ‘I don’t know whether he immediately sacked the two members on the spot but it doesn’t seem the sort of thing a vicar would do.’ Father Baker, a married father of two, was not available for comment yesterday. A Criminal Records Bureau spokesman said: ’Criminal records checks can only be requested for specified positions or people in positions of responsibility where they supervise or work closely with children and/or vulnerable people. ‘This would not be the case for a position of simply singing in a church choir.’","Two members who had together sung in the choir for a century were sacked .

The two accusations of false accounting - which date back to 2008 - claim that he 'falsified a record, namely an exchange traded fund transaction'. After Adoboli's first appearance in court, UBS revised upwards the cost of the rogue trading to $2.3billion (£1.5 billion) after previously saying the incident had cost it in the range of $2billion (£1.3billion).

David Cameron was yesterday forced to admit that NHS nurses lack compassion after being confronted by former Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips. The 68-year-old told the Prime Minister how she had witnessed  nurses walking past dementia patients ‘as if they didn’t exist’ when visiting her mother-in-law in hospital over Christmas. And she revealed how the 84-year-old, who does not suffer from dementia,  had been kept on the same ward in  Hereford Hospital as several Alzheimer’s patients, many of whom were ‘repeatedly calling out for nurses’. Pledge: Prime Minister David Cameron announces his funding plans at the the Alzheimer's Society in London today and was quizzed by Arlene Phillips, right . Mrs Phillips, a supporter of the . Alzheimer’s Society, who has spoken movingly in the past about her . father’s  battle with dementia, claimed ‘every nurse in that ward walked . up and down as if they didn’t exist’. Confronting Mr Cameron during a . question and answer session at a conference in London yesterday, she . asked: ‘How will you train nurses to care?’ Vital intervention: John Stevenson, pictured with wife Mary, said that early diagnosis for Alzheimer's gave him many extra years of active life . The Tory leader was then forced to admit lack of compassion in the NHS was ‘the biggest problem we have’. He added: ‘Some hospitals do a . fantastic job and the level of care and attention from nurses is . absolutely first class, but frankly in some of our hospitals it is not . good enough. ‘You are right, you cannot teach . people compassion – that has to be the vocation that leads you into . nursing. But I think if you look at the best hospitals and compare them . with the rest there are some things they are doing, often quite simple . things, that can be copied.’ Mrs Phillips’s intervention came . after the Prime Minister delivered a key note speech into how the . Government intends to tackle the ‘national crisis’ in care. He pledged to double the research . budget for dementia to £66million a year by 2015 and also announced . plans for all over-75s to be screened for dementia when they are . admitted to hospital. Mr Cameron said: ‘Dementia is a . terrible disease. It is a scandal we haven’t kept pace with it. 'The . level of diagnosis, understanding and awareness of dementia is . shockingly low. It is as though we’ve been in collective denial. Mr Cameron and Health Secretary Andrew Lansley have a meeting with Alzheimer's Society members before the Prime Minister's speech . ‘We need an all-out fight-back . against this disease; one that cuts across society. We did it with . cancer in the 70s, with HIV in the 80s and 90s. We fought the stigma, . stepped up to the challenge and made massive in-roads into fighting . these killers. ‘Now we’ve got to do the same with . dementia. This is a personal priority of mine, and it’s got an ambition . to match. Nothing less than for Britain to be a world leader in dementia . research and care.’ Mrs Phillips has previously spoken of . her guilt at not being able to do enough for her late father Abraham . who succumbed to Alzheimer’s disease. In the 12 years leading up to his . death in 2000, she revealed how she juggled caring for him, bringing up . her two children and trying to keep her career going. She has said: ‘I look back now and . feel guilty that I didn’t do more. I think I could have tried to have a . room for him in my house, or arranged nursing for him.’ Mrs Phillips’s comments came as figures from the Alzheimer’s Society revealed there are 800,000 dementia sufferers in the UK. Its report found that two-thirds of . sufferers admitted being lonely,  with half saying they had lost friends . since their diagnosis. One admitted he had been admonished by a barman at his local pub for repeating himself. A poll of 300 dementia patients . carried out by the charity also found nearly half felt they were a . burden to their family while another four in five felt depressed. Previously the charity had estimated there were 750,000 dementia sufferers in Britain, with around 60 per cent undiagnosed.","David Cameron says funding for research into dementia is to be doubled by 2015 .

Verna McClain, 38, appeared before a Montgomery County judge wearing a pink and white striped jumpsuit and, when asked if she . understood the capital murder charge against her, replied: 'Yes, . sir.' McClain, who recently suffered a miscarriage, is accused of fatally shooting Kala Golden Schuchardt, 28, on Tuesday afternoon in Spring, Texas before fleeing with her son Keegan Schuchardt. 'Killer': Verna McClain, 38, appeared in a Montgomery County court on Thursday to say she understood the capital murder charges against her after she allegedly shot a new mother and stole her baby . It has now emerged that McClain, a . registered nurse and mother of two, had suffered a miscarriage but did . not tell her fiance, who she planned to marry in May, the Houston . Chronicle reported. Instead, she told the man that she had given birth to their baby. Investigators claim she was looking for a baby to present as theirs, and had picked Kala at random after seeing her outside the clinic. Her sister also told authorities that McClain had told her she was planning to adopt. She added that once McClain had snatched Keegan, she said she had the baby and needed 'to do the adoption'. Ms Golden was walking to her pick-up truck after a check-up with Keegan around 2 p.m., when a woman in a 2007 Lexus parked in the adjacent spot starting fighting with her, police said. Appearance: Court appointed attorney Steve Jackson, left, talks with McClain in the courtroom . Shackled: McClain, who told her fiance she had given birth before she took the child, is transported to prison . After shooting the 28-year-old mother at close range, McClain allegedly placed the baby in her car and sped off, hitting Kala as she shrieked 'my baby!' from the ground. She died shortly after. Deputies stormed an apartment block less than a mile away after the getaway car was seen parked outside. McClain approached officers and admitted to the killing and kidnapping, police said. McClain told detectives she had taken the boy to a home in northwest Harris County. He was found there unharmed six hours after his mother had died. There had previously been reports of a man helping McClain snatch the baby but these claims appear to be unfounded, detectives said. The incident remains under investigation.

Distraught: Keith Schuchardt, Keegan's father and Kala's husband of three years, speaks on Wednesday . Baby Keegan is . now with family members, who have been left distraught by the brutal killing. Montgomery County Sheriff's Detective . John Schmitt said McClain does 'appear remorseful for what happened', . the Chronicle reported. In court, Judge Fred Edwards appointed E. Tay Bond as McClain's attorney and agreed to delay the case until Monday so he would have time to review the case. Bond said he expects McClain will plead not guilty in the case, the Chronicle reported. Caught: Investigators were led to the baby after the getaway car was seen outside an apartment where McClain's sister Corina, left, lived. McClain, right, had told her sister she was adopting the baby . Happy: Keith, pictured with Kala on their wedding day, said he was did not know how to deal with her death . After the incident, McClain's . estranged husband said he was shocked by the events. Together the couple has two children and she helped raise a third from . his previous relationship. 'She's not a violent person, so for her . to shoot someone, it was shocking,' said Theo McClain, 34, from San . Diego, California. 'This is all crazy to me.' He added that his estranged wife had . not mentioned she was going to adopt a child, and said there had never . been any signs of mental illness in the woman. County . District . Attorney Brett Ligon said authorities 'believe this was an intentional . act on her part, not that Ms Golden was targeted specifically, but that . this was part of a plan to kidnap a child'.

One of their victims, a 44-year-old woman who couldn't speak and was virtually blind, was strapped to a wheelchair as 'punishment' and locked inside her bedroom as she sobbed and screamed. Ann Leach, left in blue coat, and Joanna Robinson, right, were sentenced at Manchester Crown Court today .

Top student: Laura Johnson looked demure in a white shirt and glasses as she heard the case against her at Inner London Crown Court . A millionaire's daughter stood in the dock yesterday as a jury heard how she took part in a two-hour crime spree on the worst night of last summer’s riots. Laura Johnson, 20, ‘exercised extraordinarily bad judgment’ when she got ‘swept up’ in looting electrical goods, alcohol and cigarettes, a court was told. The former grammar school pupil is accused of driving a getaway car for three male accomplices, who went on the rampage in London. The Exeter University student claims she was forced to drive the car under duress by three young black men who were not the ‘sort of people you say no to’. But a jury at Inner London Crown Court yesterday heard that she had acted entirely of her own free will, engaging in a ‘joint enterprise’ to take ‘goods and their thieves from place to place’. Sandy Canavan, prosecuting, said: ‘She knew what she was doing. This is a young lady who exercised extraordinarily bad judgment on that night. ‘Hers were hardly the actions of somebody who was forced to drive around too scared and frightened and afraid to do anything other than that they are told. ‘The prosecution say that duress is no more than a red herring in this case.’ Dressed in a white blouse, black mini skirt and boots, Johnson spoke yesterday only to confirm her name as she stood in the dock with her co-accused, a 17-year-old youth who cannot be named for legal reasons. Also in court were her parents Lindsay and Robert, who run direct marketing firm Avongate from their home. The jury yesterday heard how she was first spotted in the early hours of August 9 by a passer-by, Witness A, who also cannot be named for legal reasons. He saw her sitting in a black Smart car on a retail park in Charlton, South-East London that was being besieged by around 100 rioters, as three men ran back and forth bringing televisions from a branch of the electrical store Currys. Miss Canavan said that one of these men was the 17-year-old co-defendant, who was ‘running back clearly to help himself to other items he wasn’t entitled to’. She said that at one point Witness A also saw the university student get out of the car and pick up a television box dropped by one of the men, which she then put in her car. He phoned the police and decided to follow the car to a nearby petrol station, where he saw one of her passengers emerge wearing a balaclava and carrying what he believed to be a kitchen knife. Privileged upbringing: Johnson was accompanied by her mother Lindsay (centre) and father Robert (right), who run direct marketing company Avongate . The prosecution said that after stealing electrical goods from Currys, the group went to a BP petrol station. They then went to a branch of Comet, in nearby Greenwich, which is where Johnson was arrested. Miss Canavan said: ‘She responded to the police shouts to stop by revving the engine with a view to driving off. She didn’t get the chance as they smashed the side window and indeed the windscreen with a view to keep her precisely where they wanted her.’ In the car police found two LCD TVs and a third TV, a microwave and alcohol and cigarettes. Miss Johnson, who is reading English and Italian, is the daughter of a millionaire businessman who lives in this home in Orpington, south-east London . Family home: Miss Johnson has been bailed to her parents' large detached house . Johnson, who before the riots had been treated for anxiety and depression at a psychiatric hospital, later told police that she had been a ‘bit concerned’ by the acts of that night but that she had driven the car as the three men were ‘not the sort of people you say no to’. On trial: Johnson at court in September, a month after the riots . She said they had jumped into her car while she ran an errand in Catford, South-East London, and had then directed her every move over the next few hours. She later told doctors she felt under duress to drive because failure to do so would result in ‘violence to her and her family’ and claimed a man known as T Man had threatened her by holding a thumb to her throat and applying pressure. But Miss Canavan said the defendants were ‘swept along as so many others were into behaviour that in the cold light of day they can hardly believe they voluntarily engaged in, but nevertheless, voluntarily engage in they did’. Johnson, who has been bailed to her parents’ large detached farmhouse in Orpington, Kent, was a high-flying pupil at Newstead Wood School in Bromley, Kent. She is also a former pupil of St Olave’s Grammar School in Orpington, the fourth best performing state school in the country. Johnson denies three counts of burglary and three of handling stolen goods. Her 17-year-old co-defendant denies two charges of burglary and two of handling stolen goods. He has pleaded guilty to one count of burglary. The jury heard that Alexander Elliot-Joahill, 18, had pleaded guilty to several charges of burglary and handling stolen goods. The trial continues.","Laura Johnson, 20, is accused of driving a getaway car for three black men .

Police investigating the suspected murder of British businessman Neil Heywood have made dozens of arrests, it was claimed yesterday. Up to 39 people have been detained in a series of raids over several months on officials linked to politician Bo Xilai, whose wife is a suspect in the death. Those arrested were reported to include billionaire Xu Ming, one of China’s richest men. The news emerged within hours of the ruling Communist Party promising a ‘thorough’ inquiry into the ‘serious political event’. Chinese . authorities were believed to have been stung by criticism in Britain . over delays in the investigation into Mr Heywood’s death in November . last year, which has prompted China’s worst political scandal for 20 . years. Reports in China . suggest Mr Heywood, a close associate of Mr Bo and his wife Gu Kailai, . was poisoned with cyanide after he threatened to reveal Mrs Gu had . siphoned millions of pounds in cash out of the country. Investigation: Chinese politician Bo Xilai and his wife Gu Kailai . Those arrested were said to have links to Mr Bo and his previous roles as a Communist Party leader in Dalian and Chongqing, suggesting most  of the raids were linked to a corruption probe into the politician. Police investigating the death of Old Harrovian Mr Heywood, 41, have begun analysing hours of CCTV footage taken from the hotel where his body was discovered. Under arrest: Billionaire Xu Ming is one of the 39 arrested, sources claimed . They hope the security film will show the married father-of-two’s final movements at the state-owned Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Nan’an, a district of Chongqing. Billionaire Mr Xu, 41, who heads the .

A former altar boy bludgeoned to death his gay lover who he suspected to be a paedophile as part of a campaign to rid the world of sex offenders, a court heard . Christopher Hunnisett, 28, beat Peter Bick, 57, over the head with a hammer then walked into a nearby police station to confess to the killing, the jury heard. The ‘cold blooded killer’ - who claimed to have been the victim of sexual abuse in the past - had added Mr Bick to a hit-list after meeting him on the internet – despite there ‘not being a shred of evidence’ that he was a paedophile, the jury was told. Hit-list: Christopher Hunnisett, 28, left, put Peter Bick, 57, right, at the top of a list of men he planned to kill because he suspected they were paedophiles, the court heard . Hunnisett, from Hastings, Sussex, previously denied one count of murder at Lewes Crown Court, saying in April, last year, ‘It is not wrong to try and stand up to evil in this world’. Police found the supermarket worker dead in his flat, in Bexhill, where he lived alone on January 11, 2011. The court heard that Hunnisett hatched his 'brutal plan' after meeting Mr Bick on the internet and embarking on a sexual relationship with him. Prosecutor Philip Katz QC said: ‘Peter Bick was living on his own in a studio flat, there is not a shred of evidence that he was a paedophile. ‘There is an abundance of evidence that he enjoyed consensual sex with adult men, including this defendant. ‘Hunnisett has strived in every devious way he could to make it look like the man he killed his a paedophile. The court was also told this was the third time the defendant had been tried for murder. In 2002, Hunnisett was convicted and jailed but later acquitted of killing alleged paedophile Rev Ronald Glazebrook at his home in St Leonards on Sea. Mr Katz QC added: ‘We will hear from a young woman who had a relationship with him after he got out of prison. She will tell you about his various and coloured sexual preferences. He talked to her about his plan to kill paedophiles. ‘He is confused about his own sexuality but that does not make it right to kill people then make himself look like a hero. He had planned to kill more men who he had been in contact with on the internet, he compiled a hit list and Peter Bick was at the top of that list. ‘On some of these internet chat rooms Hunnisett was pretending to be a woman. None of the men he arranged to meet was a paedophile. This is a cold blooded and dangerous killer.’ Claims: Hunnisett, left, alleged that he was abused by Rev Ronald Glazebrook, right. Hunnisett served eight years of a life sentence for the clergyman's killing, but was later acquitted of his murder . The court heard that Hunnisett had previously served eight years of a life sentence for the murder of an 81-year-old retired priest called Reverend Ronald Glazebrook. Following his conviction, material came to light which discredited Mr Glazebrook’s character and showed he had sexually assaulted a young boy, the court was told. His body had been dismembered and was found in two different locations in Sussex. The jury was told that Hunnisett had met Glazebrook through the church when he was young boy and later became his lodger before being convicted of his murder in 2002 . Throughout the trial Hunnisett denied knowing how Reverend Glazebrook died, claiming he found the dead body in the bath ‘panicked’ and recruited a friend to help him dispose of it. The jury convicted him of murder and he was sentenced to life. However, in September 2010 he was acquitted of the murder at a retrial by the Appeal Court - where Hunnisett alleged that the clergyman sexually abused him throughout his teens. Hunnisett then admitted punching the vicar for trying to grope him in the bathroom - and claimed he then fell in the bath and died. It was just four months after this conviction was quashed that he walked into a police station confessing to the killing of Mr Bick. Mr Katz said: ‘That history is of central importance. ‘I also want to mention that before and after both his trial and retrial and before the trial today Hunnisett has been seen by different psychiatrists and not one of them think that he is mentally ill and not one thinks he has a personality disorder.’ Mr Katz added Hunnisett had already admitted killing Mr Bick but the jury must decide whether he can mount a partial defence of diminished responsibility. He said: ‘This was a brutal and carefully planned murder, responsibility for which he is trying to escape in any way he can.’ The trial continues and is expected to last three weeks.","'Cold-blooded killer' Christopher Hunnisett, 28, drew up a hit-list of men he suspected to be sex offenders, jury hears .

A leading Cambridge University professor has called for an end to the 'self-deprecatory' English psychology that is causing politicians and the media to attack academic excellence. Professor Robert Lethbridge said the top universities go to great lengths to counter the 'toff' public image, akin to Brideshead Revisited, which he says 'bears no resemblance' to the reality. Lethbridge, the Master of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, and Provost of the Gates Cambridge Trust, said the universities reach out to applicants from all walks of life - in fact they couldn't 'try any harder'. Top universities, such as Oxford's Christ Church College (pictured), go to great lengths to counter the 'toff' public image, akin to Brideshead Revisited, which he says 'bears no resemblance' to the reality . The professor's comments come as it's revealed students at Oxford University voted against spending funds on a painting of the Queen to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee - because they felt it was supporting elitism. Undergraduates at Keble College wanted to spend £200 on a picture of Her Majesty but college members, whose alumni include the Duke of Kent’s grandson Edward Windsor, voted 54 to 17 against it. The Government has also repeatedly claimed that Oxbridge universities fail to admit enough applicants from state schools, with deputy prime minister Nick Clegg warning they institutions had a duty of care to 'ensure British society of better reflected'. Prof Lethbridge, pictured, said the universities go to great lengths to reach out to applicants from all walks of life - in fact they couldn't 'try any harder' Lethbridge said universities such as Oxford and Cambridge had been forced to go to such great lengths to counter the elitism image. 'I think we need to constantly stress that, at the very top of our education system, we are utterly meritocratic,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'We need to counter the self-deprecatory dimension of Englishness and we need to no longer retail the Brideshead Revisited, toff image of Oxford and Cambridge which some uninformed people find as a lazy target.' Lethbridge raised his concerns as he unveiled that the multimillion pound Bill Gates Cambridge Trust had reached a 1,000-student milestone. The £210 million scholarship has helped students from 94 countries since 2011, completing research in a range of academic disciplines. This month sees the 10th anniversary of the first graduations. The 'toff' Oxbridge image appears to only exist in the UK, holding back some bright school-leavers, he said. Overseas, however, applicants clamour for places at the universities. Lethbridge raised his concerns as he unveiled that the multimillion pound Bill Gates Trust, at Cambridge University, pictured, had reached a 1,000-student milestone . 'I suspect again that it is a problem of image, perception and prejudice and also a mindset which doesn’t want anyone to fail,' he told the Telegraph. Politicians in particular brandished inaccurate statistics about the universities' admissions, suggesting 'social immobility and inherited privilege,' he said. However, new student joining the institutions are 'absolutely astonished that it bears no resemblance to what they saw on TV and we have got to change that image,' he said.","Leading professor says 'toff' image bears no resemblance to reality .

They say he is no relation to 28-year-old George Zimmerman who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin on February 26. The killing has touched off widespread public outrage and protests across the country, including from Lee and other celebrities, because Zimmerman was not arrested. He says he acted in self-defense. Wildfire: An elderly couple in Florida fled their home after it was wrongly spread across Twitter as the address of the man who killed Trayvon Martin (left) by people including director Spike Lee (right) Lee tweeted late today: 'I Deeply . Apologize To The McClain Family For Retweeting Their Address. It Was A . Mistake. Please Leave The McClain's In Peace.' The school-cafeteria lunch lady, 70, . and her 72-year-old husband had received repeated visits from reporters . and neighbours after their address was posted on Twitter. The man and his wife, who has heart problems, had to be relocated to a hotel to avoid further trouble.

Lee faced considerable . backlash for the retweeting of the alleged whereabouts of Zimmerman, who . has an outstanding $10,000 bounty on him by the New Black Panthers. The post has since been removed from Lee's Twitter account. The elderly couple have no relation to George Zimmerman who shot unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, 17, while on neighbourhood watch patrol in a Florida gated community last month. Zimmerman was never arrested after claiming to have killed the teenager in self-defense. The case has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations. The couple's son William Zimmerman told the Orlando Sentinel: 'It's scary because there are people who aren't mentally right and will take this information and run with it.' According to the Sentinel, Mr Zimmerman traced the messages to California and asked the Twitter user to take down his parents' address - but his request was brusquely denied. Social media surrounding the Trayvon Martin case has reached a point of near-hysteria – including a fake Will Smith tweet to be reposted thousands of times. The alleged tweet read: ‘WE live in America where a girl that threw flour on Kim Kardashian was arrested on site. But the man who KILLED Trayvon Martin is still free.’ The fake Will Smith account, . @RealWillSmith, in fact belonged to a man from Nashville, . Tennessee, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

The intense storm system left trees uprooted and property damage throughout – while tornadoes were reported in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania with up to 17 throughout the country last night.

Damages: Mr Swinton stands in his storm-damaged family room after a tree fell through his home's roof; authorities say strong winds brought down trees and branches across southern and eastern Carroll County . The perfect storm: A tornado and waterspout swept through Hampton, Virginia, damaging boats and sending debris flying through the air . Dark skies: One witness at the marina said the gentle rain quickly turned into a twister . According to WAVY.com, a tornado and waterspout – a funnel over the water – swept through Hampton, Virginia after what witnesses described as a pleasant evening rain. ‘It was like a freight train,’ Gary McIntire, a resident of Hampton, told the station. ‘It was like the Wizard of Oz…It was really truly awe-inspiring and awful.’ At the Hampton Yacht club, boats up to 30-feet long were lifted from the water and deposited sideways, as debris and tree leaves went flying, witnesses said. Most of the damage was to the boats that were on land, WAVY.com reported. The weather system, more often seen in the Midwest and the Great Plains, left many scrambling for cover. While there have not been any injuries reported, there was significant damage to power lines and trees in the storm’s path. Fallen: In Harford County, Maryland, a tree fell into a local house, and up to two dozen buildings were severely damaged in the storm .

Harford County, Maryland saw severe damage from last night’s storms. A tree fell into a local house, and up to two dozen buildings were severely damaged in the storm, the Baltimore Sun reported. There was also a reported tornado in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, outside of Pittsburgh. Residents reported many fallen trees and property damage. A shelter was set up at a nearby YMCA for the town’s residents. According to the Weather Channel, the storm caused a dome at Robert Morris University to collapse. The school, just outside of Pittsburgh, said that all students were able to escape without sustaining injuries. Yet another tornado was reported in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The twister touched down near Highway 17, but went airborne after several minutes. The NWS warns of driving in flood waters, as it often is deeper than it appears. According to MSNBC, some 11,000 people had no power overnight. The storm also left those in nearby Prince George’s County, Maryland without electricity. The unusual storm pattern also caused a headache for thousands of commuters. Storm watchers: Seventeen tornadoes were reported across the country yesterday, with 115 high wind reports, especially along the East Coast and Mid-Atlantic . Forecast: Rain can be expected moving up into the northeast, and there will be showers in the Pacific Northwest as well in Washington state and Oregon . Inclement weather: The tornadoes and wind gusts came about in part because of lower-than-normal temperatures along the East Coast . According to NBC Washington, the Orange Line on DC’s Metro was closed due to a fallen tree on the tracks. Additional, surrounding airports suffered heavy delays beginning Friday afternoon. As the system pulls moisture in from the Atlantic Ocean, heaviest rainfall is anticipated across the Northeast and Upper Ohio River Valley. However, warm and humid conditions of the Southeast will allow for severe thunderstorm development. Behind this system in the Plains, there will be significantly cooler temperatures after the passage of the strong cold front. Temperatures will be 15 to 20 degrees below seasonable from the Central Plains through parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes. In the West, a cold front over the Pacific Northwest continues pushing moisture onshore. This will produce more widespread scattered showers across Oregon and Washington, but heavy rainfall and thunderstorms are not likely. Meanwhile, mild moisture and warm temperatures over the Central and Northern Rockies will support afternoon and evening showers and thunderstorms. Severe weather development is not likely in these areas. Temperatures in the Lower 48 states Thursday have ranged from a morning low of 26 degrees at Silver Bay, Minnesota to a high of 102 degrees at El Centro, California.","Tornadoes reported in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and North Carolina, with up to 17 twisters possible .

Review: Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks are to cut more than 1,400 jobs in the UK, they announced today . The Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks are to cut more than 1,400 jobs in the UK, their Australian owner said today. National Australia Bank (NAB) confirmed the jobs would go by 2015, following a strategic review which was announced in February. The overhaul by the banks' overseas owners will shrink the size of its UK operation, which has 337 branches and a 8,300-strong workforce. Clydesdale and Yorkshire will now focus primarily on Scotland and Northern England, NAB said, as it closes 29 of its Financial Solution Centres in southern England, as well as six back office locations. NAB said the review was in response to 'the deterioration in the economic and operating conditions' in the UK, particularly in the commercial property market. Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks racked up a £25 million loss in the first half of the year, compared with a £77 million profit in the previous year, reflecting a higher charge on bad debts and higher funding costs. NAB chief executive Cameron Clyne said: 'In the last half-year there has been a significant downgrade in the growth prospects of the UK economy, in part reflecting the drag on its recovery from heightened weakness in the eurozone. 'The action we are taking is needed to adapt to this current economic environment in the UK, and to reposition the UK banking business to improve returns for the group over the medium term.' Help: Cameron Clyne, chief executive of National Australia Bank Ltd, said that while every effort would be made to support staff, 'the substantive repositioning of the business will impact roles in the UK' He added: 'While every effort will be made to support our people, the substantive repositioning of the business will impact roles in the UK.' Yorkshire Bank was founded in 1859 in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and has 185 retail branches, while Glasgow-based Clydesdale, which was bought by NAB in 1987, has 152 outlets. Following consultation, the UK's workforce will be reduced to around 6,900. Unite national officer David Fleming said the NAB announcement was 'nothing short of brutal' for the UK workforce. He said: 'Unite finds it disgusting that the company decided to release a statement from Australia in the middle of the night so UK staff across Yorkshire and Clydesdale banks would wake up to hear that their jobs are being cut through the morning news reports. 'This is not the behaviour of a responsible or credible organisation.' NAB has been the subject of deal speculation over the last year after it was unsuccessful in the auction of 318 branches put up for sale by Royal Bank of Scotland, a deal later secured by Spanish giant Santander. Earlier this month, it emerged that the banks' customers were left unable to use their debit cards for cash withdrawals and transactions for a fifth time in recent weeks after a ‘service issue’ at the banks. Cutting: Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank are to cut more than 1,400 jobs in the UK . And last month, a hike in monthly payments hit mortgage borrowers. In a combined move that hit 30,000 customers, the pair announced an increase in their standard variable rates from an already relatively high 4.59 per cent to 4.95 per cent from May 1.

He then gave a detailed account of how the Titanic and the liner the New York nearly collided at Southampton on April 10.

Though Alexis Salaz was initially pronounced brain dead at the hospital, she has made a remarkable recovery, surmounting both physical and mental disabilities. The child’s aunt, 50-year-old Mary Horsley, was found guilty of felony child abuse and faces between 20 to 48 years in prison when sentenced next month. Making strides: 21-month-old Alexis is making a miraculous recovery after she was declared brain dead . Guilty: Alexis' aunt Mary Horsley (left) was convicted of child endangerment; the girl's mother Samantha Salaz (right) was also convicted of the same charges . During the trial, jurors heard that the Colorado Springs woman would often put tape over her niece’s eyes and put her in the shower as punishment for any small misstep. Deputy District Attorney Debbie Pearson told the court of the torture borne by Alexis. ‘If she moved, she was dunked. If she cried, she was dunked,’ the Colorado Springs Gazette reported. Ms Pearson continued: ‘Alexis never had a break. It was constant, constant torture.’ Alexis’ mother and Horsley’s niece, 19-year-old Samantha Salaz, also pleaded guilty to child abuse resulting in serious injury, and received a 24-year prison sentence. Loving father: The girl's father Joseph Saunders (right) says that she is making strides and attends therapy five times a week . Horsley’s attorney, Ed Farry, plans to appeal. He argued that Salaz – not Horsley – was to blame for Alexis’ injuries. However, Horsley was acquitted of the most serious charge against her -attempted murder – but was convicted for abusing two of her grandchildren as well. The child’s father, Joseph Saunders, said in an email to KRDO that he was unaware he was a father until the trial; Salaz apparently told him that he had miscarried. 'If she moved, she was dunked. If she cried, she was dunked. Alexis never had a break. It was constant, constant torture.' Still, the father is grateful for her daughter, and notices improvement every day. He said: ‘Within months of living with my wife, our kids and I, she had started regaining some physical activity, and its seemed as if her brain started “turning on.”’ He added: ‘She is a true miracle.’ Alexis has a long road to recovery yet – according to Mr Saunders, she has to attend therapy five times a week, and cannot walk, talk, or eat on her own.","21-month-old Alexis Salaz was punished by her aunt, Mary Horsley for 'moving and crying'

A British man who lives as an Apache Indian is fighting a court battle after being found with illegal badger paws and eagle wings in his home. Mangas Colaradas, 60, claimed the wild animal relics are part of the Native American lifestyle he has lived for 20 years - despite being born and raised in Swansea. But he was arrested after the body parts of the wild animals were found in his home filled with his Apache collection. Colaradas wore ceremonial head-dress when he appeared in court today, charged under the Protection of Badgers Act and the Wildlife and Countryside Act over the badger and eagle relics. Pleading not guilty: Apache Indian Mangus Colardas from Swansea, South Wales, says the animal relics in his possession are part of his heritage . But Colaradas pleaded not guilty - and has vowed to fight the case on the grounds that it is part of his Apache lifestyle. He wore a ceremonial head dress, tassled jacket, suede moccasins and a snake’s head necklace to deny the charge at Swansea magistrates court. Anne Griffiths, defending, said: 'My client Mangas is part of a native American Apache tribe. 'He has spent time living in these Apache communities and this is his belief.' The Apache people, split over around 13 tribes, are  usually found in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Apache was originally a word given to the natives' enemies, known as the Zuni. But over time the word became adopted worldwide and is even used by the Apaches themselves. There are thought to be about 30,000 Apaches left in America. The . Apache tribes were nearly wiped out by Europeans. They now have their . own areas, or 'reservations', to live on, where they can live by their . own customs and rules, but they must still obey the U.S. law. A . stereotypical Apache image might be an Indian with his horse. However . horses did not exist in North American until colonists arrived - but the . Apaches quickly adopted them and used them for transport. Colaradas was released on bail and is due to stand trial in August. Outside court, the father-of-six told of his Apache lifestyle in his three-bedroom detached house in the Townhill suburb of Swansea. He said: 'I dress like this all the time I’m not just some weekend Indian. I don’t put it on to show off, I put it on because I want to wear it. 'I’m against modern life, nobody cares about anybody else, nobody cares about mother earth. 'The whole point of the Native American lifestyle is that everyone believes in mother earth and treats others who you want to be treated.' Colaradas began living a Native American lifestyle after he divorced from his wife in the early 1990s. He adopted his name in honour of a famous Apache chief and now refuses to answer to anything else. In 1997 he travelled to United States to try and live on a Red Indian reservation but the American government would not let him. He then moved to Spain in 2000 wear he lived in a tipee in the mountains and the forest around Torremolinos. He said: 'I prefer being out in the wild, watching the wolves or bats or spiders going by. 'I believe in enjoying life and taking things as they come. I like sitting in wide open spaces, relaxing, being myself and being at one with nature. 'I have the motto Hóka-héy, which means it is a good day to die. I live everyday like it could be my last for we are only on this world for a short time.' Colaradas now makes his own tomahawks, bows and arrows as well as running snake shows. The animal lover added: 'I’ve cured thousands of people of their fear of snakes, I don’t believe in money, I just do it to educate people. 'I get on with animals better than most people I’ve got an affinity with them there are no bad animals just bad keepers.

Controversy: David Cameron's proposals were condemned by motoring groups as 'a toll too far' Controversial plans to privatise roads and create ‘Lexus lanes’ that would allow the wealthiest  drivers to bypass traffic jams were met with anger last night. Motoring and transport groups condemned David Cameron’s pay-to-drive proposals as ‘ludicrous’ and ‘a toll too far’. Under the plans, tolls could be introduced on new highways and existing roads could be widened to create additional lanes that drivers could use to get around congestion – at a cost. The AA warned the Government was creating ‘a poll tax on wheels’ while Labour complained of a ‘rip-off’. Haulage firms said it was ‘unthinkable’ to introduce tolls at a time when motorists and firms were being crippled with record fuel prices and the highest levels of fuel tax in Europe. Ministers have ruled out a comprehensive national network of road tolls, but only until the end of this Parliament in 2015. The row erupted after the Prime Minister said yesterday he was proposing a ‘radical’ plan to kick-start the economy by allowing private firms and investment funds to compete to build, operate and maintain motorways and trunk roads in England and Wales. Under the plans, motorists will not pay tolls to use existing roads. But firms given long-term leases on sections of motorway or dual carriageway could widen them to create additional pay-as-you-go lanes that drivers could use to beat congestion. These are nicknamed ‘Lexus lanes’ in the U.S. because only those wealthy enough to drive luxury cars can afford to use them. Mr Cameron, who used to drive a Lexus, is now chauffeured in an official Jaguar XJ limousine. Milking the motorist: David Cameron used to drive a Lexus, pictured, the expensive car that has inspired the nickname for the exclusive lanes . New roads constructed from scratch would operate like French toll roads, much like the existing system on the M6 Toll through the Midlands from Birmingham to Stafford. Motoring groups said Britain’s 33million drivers were fed up with being ‘fleeced’ and simply don’t trust ministers to live up to their promises. They fear drivers will be priced off the roads by profiteering companies, as has happened with privatised train companies. The Treasury raises more than £48billion a year from motorists in the form of duty and VAT on fuel, vehicle excise duty, VAT on car sales and company car tax – but less than £10billion of this is spent on the roads. Private operators who took over the running of existing roads would receive a share of the near £6billion raised each year from road tax according to how many vehicles used the roads. In his speech to the Institution of Civil Engineers, Mr Cameron said there was an ‘urgent’ need for private sector funds because the Government cannot afford to address growing gridlock and pothole problems. But AA president Edmund King warned: ‘The privatisation of the railway network has hardly been a spectacular success and millions of drivers will be concerned if one of our most important and used national assets, the strategic road network, is sold off. ‘Many drivers would suspect new ownership is the thin end of the wedge leading to national road pricing. New charges would be a toll too far.’ Neil Greig, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: ‘British drivers simply don’t trust the Government to come up with a new way of paying for roads that will not lead to increased costs in the long run. Drivers already pay far more in taxes and duties than they get back in investment in new roads.’ Geoff Dunning, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said tolls on new roads were ‘quite unthinkable’ and ‘ludicrous’ at a time of record fuel prices hitting motorists and hauliers. Labour’s transport spokesman Maria Eagle said motorists face ‘a rip-off’ adding: ‘The Prime Minister’s double-speak gives the impression that his privatisation plans will only see tolls applied to new roads. ‘Yet he has redefined new roads to include anything that adds capacity including road widening and junction improvements. Motorists will rightly consider that to be a clear plan for charging for existing roads.’ But Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, gave a ‘cautious welcome’ to the idea of private sector investment to tackle the ‘chronic levels of traffic and congestion’.",AA warned the Government was creating ‘a poll tax on wheels’

Untimely end: The rare black fox lays dead after it was knocked down by a car on a busy road in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire . Killed: The black fox, with its distinctive white-tipped tail, runs through a field close to the village . Bad omen? The accident happened on a busy road in Bassingbourn just four days after the fox was first spotted . Unusual: The black fox is so rare - with the colouring caused by a defect gene - that there are only a handful of the breed left in the country . 'It’s really sad that it has happened, especially as it so rare,' said Mr Moore, from Bassingbourn. 'I’m so pleased I saw it when I did and got the pictures when I did. 'Now I have seen the fox close up there is no doubt it was a black fox and it was a female. 'I think I may have seen a second . black fox but I’m not sure if it was a cub or the male. I’m hoping it . wasn’t a cub as I’m not sure it would survive if the mother is dead.' Lucky: John Moore from Bassingbourne in Cambridgeshire . Gary Sanderson, communications . manager at the East of England Ambulance Service, said he was flagged . down by motorists who had stopped to help the fox. 'After they flagged me down it was evident there was nothing anyone could do and the fox had sadly died. 'I must admit this was the first time I have seen a black fox and it’s a shame it has died.' The accident happened between 9am and 10am this morning on the Old North Road between Royston and Bassingbourn in Hertfordshire. According to legend, a black fox brings doom and disaster to anyone who sees it. Mr Moore first saw the creature, with its distinctive white-tipped tail, in fields behind his house on Monday. 'I’ve heard black foxes are mythical creatures because they supposedly don’t exist,' he said at the time. 'My neighbour thought it was a stray . dog but I looked through my binoculars and realised it was definitely a . fox, especially because of its white-tipped tail. 'I didn’t realise how rare it was . until I did some research. An RSPCA officer told my neighbour the . organisation had never seen one before as they are that rare. 'In Gaelic tradition, black foxes are . bringers of bad luck and rural communities used to tell of a fox as . ""black as night, so that it could live in a man"" shadow and never be . seen.'

In Gaelic tradition, black foxes are . bringers of bad luck. Rural communities used to tell of a fox as . 'black as night, so that it could live in a man's shadow and never be . seen.' Centuries-old superstitions are often found attached to black animals, such as black dogs and black cats.

In Medieval times, villages were very afraid of the sighting of a black fox and considered it to predict trouble or bad luck. The black fox is in fact an ordinary . red fox which has black fur or is going through a phase where the colour . of its fur is particularly dark. The phenomenon is normally seen in growing cubs and generally the fox will develop to have a dark chestnut coat. But a few red foxes will remain black . due to a rare genetic flaw dating back hundreds of years. Only a . handful of them are thought to exist in Britain. In North America, foxes with black coats are often found with a variable amount of white or white-banded hair in the dark coat. Centuries-old superstitions are often found attached to black animals, such as black dogs and black cats. The red fox was introduced to America . by the peans and black foxes exist in much greater numbers there . because they were not hunted as widely. In the UK their pelts were highly prized in the fur trade and it is believed the genetic strain became much scarcer.

Maureen and Marion Sweeney never accepted the official verdict from Goa that their sister Denyse Sweeney had died after an illegal drug binge. Their worst fears were confirmed this week at her inquest at Derby Corner's Court when they were told that no illegal substances were found in her system after her death. But it was also revealed that she had . 20 bruises on her body at the time of death, including one measuring . 4.5cm on the back of her skull. Pathologist . Dr Ivan Robinson was unable to give a cause of death and coroner Dr . Robert Hunter said the unexplained injuries 'were not investigated to . any satisfactory level' by the authorities in Goa. Maureen said Denyse's body was flown back almost a month after she died, two weeks before her 35th birthday. Maureen said: 'Her body had to be identified using a fingerprint expert because it was so badly decomposed. 'We were led to believe the cause of death was going to be a drug overdose because that is what the autopsy report we had been sent from Goa said. 'We did not accept that at all.

He was unable to save her and she was pronounced dead at 7.20am. Friends and family organised . fund-raising events to pay for her body to be flown back to Derby from .

A stricken luxury cruise liner with 100 British passengers on board has safely arrived in Malaysia after drifting in pirate-infested waters for 24 hours. Escorted by two Malaysian patrol vessels, the brightly lit Azamara Quest made its way into Sandakan port at around 8.30pm local time (1.30pm BST) today with passengers seen standing on the decks. Police and buses waited at the port to take passengers to various hotels. Consular officials from several countries, including the U.S. and Canada, were also present. Safer waters: The stricken luxury cruise ship Azamara Quest docks at the jetty at a port in the Malaysian town of Sandakan on Borneo . Homeward bound: The cruise ship was carrying about 1,000 people - mainly U.S. and European tourists . Safe: The stricken cruise liner Azamara Quest docks at Sandakan port in Malaysia after an engine fire left it drifting for a day in pirate-infested waters . The Azamara Quest drifted off the . southern Philippines after flames engulfed one of its engine rooms . Friday, injuring five crew members. The waters in that area are key hunting grounds for pirates and the Abu Sayyaf, a deadly Islamic militant group. The Abu Sayyaf wants an independent . Islamic nation in the south of Roman Catholic Philippines, and has been . responsible for high profile kidnappings of westerners, including . abducting tourists from a nearby Malaysian resort island in 2000. No passengers were injured in the . incident, but five crew members on board the ship suffered the effects . of smoke inhalation, including one who needed hospital care. Coming in to dock: The 11-deck ship arrived at Sandakan port late on Sunday after spending more than a day in waters prowled by pirates . No passengers were injured in the incident, but five crew members on board the ship suffered the effects of smoke inhalation, including one who needed hospital care . The ship informed the Philippine . coast guard yesterday that its power and propulsion had been restored . and that it was moving slowly towards Sandakan, spokesman Lieutenant . Commander Algier Ricafrente said. Azamara Club Cruises said the ship then sailed at a top speed of only six knots towards . Sandakan. The company said in a statement: . 'Unfortunately, the ship has not been able to restore power to the air . conditioning compressors. 'While this is a very difficult . undertaking, the onboard team is diligently working to resolve this . issue. The guest sentiment onboard continues to be calm and upbeat.'

It is the Dunkirk spirit and they . are making the best of the situation,' he said. 'The crew have been brilliant, they have done everything right.' Mr Scott, who owns the luxury travel . company B away, said it was the 60th cruise that his 71-year-old retired . financial adviser father and 70-year-old mother, from Chigwell, Essex, . had embarked on. He said he had received an email from his parents to say they were sailing towards Malaysia. 'They have said the staff and the captain have been fantastic,' he added.

The horrifying brutality with which an eight-year-old girl was raped and murdered has been laid bare as graphic photographs of her mutilated body were shown to a packed courtroom. Tori Stafford may still have been alive as she was being stamped on and beaten with a hammer before her corpse was stuffed into plastic bags and buried beneath a pile of rocks, jurors heard. But perhaps most haunting of all, was what she was wearing when her decomposed body was found 103 days later - just a Hannah Montana t-shirt with the words: 'A girl can dream.' When Victoria Stafford was abducted, it was the first day she had been allowed to walk home from school on her own and it was for that reason she was singled out by Terry-Lynne McClintic and Michael Rafferty . Jurors wept and the little girl's father ran out as the court viewed the pictures, some of which were so horrifying that the judge banned even the reporting of their content. The blonde and blue-eyed High School Musical fan went missing on her way home from school in . Woodstock, Ontario, on April 8, 2009, sparking a hunt for the little girl that would last for three months. Local drug addicts Michael Rafferty, 31, and Terri-Lynne McClintic, 21, were arrested a month later and charged with her murder. In April 2010, McClintic pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life, while Rafferty denied all charges. Before showing the pictures, Ontario state pathologist Dr. Michael Pollanen warned jurors at Rafferty's trial: 'While you might recognize . some of the body, you might not recognize all of it.' He went on to tell how the bottom half of Tori's body was so decomposed by the time she was found that it was impossible to tell if she had been raped or not. But he did tell the court what was clear was that she had been stamped on, strangled and beaten with a hammer. Trial: Michael Rafferty, 31, has pleaded not guilty to murder, sexual assault and abduction . He said 16 of her 24 ribs were broken and her liver was lacerated in injuries consistent with blunt trauma such as stamping. He said there were 'so many fractured to the skull' that it was difficult to see where one ended and another began. He told the courtroom, which included Tori's parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, that of four areas of her head that had been smashed, three were from a hammer's claw and one with its blunt end. He said that various fractures to her face could have been the result of kicking, stomping or blows from a hammer. In the end, Tori died due to bleeding from the head wounds, brain . damage and asphyxiation, he said. It is not clear know how long she was alive . after she was kicked and stomped. Rafferty, who has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, . sexual assault causing bodily harm and abduction, appeared unmoved by what the court heard. He sat in the prisoner’s box with his eyes either half . closed or looking up at the ceiling. And in a further move that caused huge offence, Rafferty wore a new purple shirt and grey and purple tie - Tori's favourite colour and the colour that has become the emblem of her family throughout the trial. Tori's body was found in woods adjoining a farmer’s field stuffed in plastic bags and buried under a pile of rocks. Previously, Rafferty's girlfriend, McClintic, told the court how she and Rafferty singled out the little girl because she was on her own - the first day she was allowed to walk back from school alone - and lured her to the car by saying they had a schitzu puppy. McClintic was high on Oxycontin, as she was most days, and had also smoked marijuana. Happy child: Victoria Stafford loved Hannah Montana and was looking forward to going home that day so she could play in her newly decorated room and watch High School Musical . Parents: Rodney Stafford, father of slain . Victoria Stafford, left, left the court as the graphic pictures of her body were shown.  The girl's mother, Tara McDonald, right, stayed for the duration . The drug-addicted couple made three stops, she said, to pick up Percocet, a highly-addictive narcotic pain killer, coffee and a hammer and garbage bags before arriving at the remote area chosen to kill the innocent school girl. McClintic said she 'knew what was about to happen', so walked away from the car. When pressed as to what that was, she replied: 'I believed he was going to rape her.' After Rafferty sexually assaulted Tori the first time in the front seat of his Honda Civic, during which time she could hear screams and cries for help, he called McClintic to take her to the toilet, she told the court. Disturbing case: Victoria 'Tori' Stafford was only eight-years-old when she was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered by a couple who were high on drugs . The 21-year-old recalled Tori was bleeding and crying and pleaded with her: 'Just don't let him do it to me again.' 'I told her I was sorry and that she was a very strong girl. And she said ""Like you?"" And I told her she was much stronger', she testified. The convicted child killer then took Tori back to Rafferty, so he could commit the senseless, depraved act again. Rafferty's former girlfriend told the . packed courtroom that as they were walking back to the car, Tori . wouldn't let go of her hand. All she was wearing was her favourite . Hannah Montana T-shirt. 'She asked me to stay with her. I tried to hold on to her hand but I . couldn’t stay because I knew what was going to happen,' said the former drug addict. 'I couldn’t be there for that. I left.' Testimony: Terri-Lynne McClintic, then 18, pleaded guilty to the murder of Victoria Stafford and is the key witness in the murder trial of Michael Rafferty, her ex-boyfriend and co-accused . Court sketch: Terri-Lynne McClintic took to the stand for the second time today as she recounted the horrific details of Victoria Stafford's murder at the hands of her and Michael Rafferty . 'I kept having flashbacks. Sometimes . it was like I wasn’t even there,' she said. 'I realized I needed to do . something so I turned back to the vehicle and . . . when I saw what was . going on, all I saw was myself when I was that age and all the anger and . hate and rage that I’d had and blame that I still feel towards myself . came boiling up out of me.' She . walked back to the car, put a garbage bag over Tori's head and started . to kick her. She then struck her repeatedly with both sides of the . hammer on the head, she told the court. I went back to the vehicle and I savagely murdered that little girl,' she said to a stunned and horrified courtroom. They both buried the body, she recounted, before washing themselves and the car so no evidence could be found. The pair had been dating just over a . month when they carried out the gruesome crime. McClintic said it was . Rafferty's idea and said they would be like Bonnie and Clyde. The trial continues.","Tori Stafford's decomposed body was found wearing only a Hannah Montana t-shirt with the words, 'A girl can dream'

A callous car clamper called an ambulance to help a motorist he had targeted - before continuing to clamp his vehicle after the man was rushed to hospital. Paul Wiseman had pulled over in a no-parking zone in Skipton, North Yorkshire, when he began feeling unwell, only to be targeted by one of Britain's most notorious clamping firms, Carstoppers Ltd, as soon as he stopped. The father-of-two tried to stop clamper Gareth Evans from seizing his vehicle but slumped against his Mercedes van while struggling for breath due to an extremely high blood pressure. Illness: Paul Wiseman was clamped despite nearly collapsing due to high blood pressure next to his van in Skipton, North Yorkshire . Mr Wiseman said the clamper paused briefly to call an ambulance, but then continued to clamp the van as he was rushed from the scene with blue lights earlier this month. He has since claimed that the manner in which Carstoppers 'took advantage' of his illness to clamp his car was 'despicable'. Mr Wiseman, 55, said: 'I didn’t realise it was the back of a business premises, I just needed to stop because I didn’t feel right. 'While I was waiting I saw this car come hurtling up to me and pull in front. 'This man rushed towards me carrying the yellow clamp and I got out to ask him what he was doing. 'I stood in front so he couldn’t do it. He was trying to get me out of the way so I pushed him backwards. 'I felt unwell, exhausted and was struggling to get my breath. And when I turned towards the van door I collapsed onto the floor of the van. 'He got out his phone and rang for an ambulance, but even though he could see I was unwell, he started to clamp my car. Mr Wiseman described the treatment he received from Carstoppers Ltd and clamper Gareth Evans (right) as 'despicable' 'I wasn’t in any fit state to control what was going on and to take advantage of someone in my position is despicable. 'I’m furious about it now but at the time I was more concerned about what was wrong with me.' Mr Wiseman, who runs his own cutting tool distribution business, is still awaiting the results of hospital tests to establish what caused his high blood pressure. He said his son Chris was confronted by Mr Evans, who handed him a ticket that said he had to pay £150 to release the clamp. 'Obviously Chris was worried about me and wanted to come with me to hospital so there was no point in arguing,' said Mr Wiseman. 'He had no choice but to go to the nearest cash machine, draw out the money and hand it over.' Mr Wiseman, dad to Chris, 23, and Gemma, 28, was in hospital until around 5pm as his blood pressure 'had shot up'. Mr Wiseman said he is boycotting businesses that use the firm, adding: 'Their approach is very aggressive and their actions could lead to somebody becoming seriously ill. 'There are much better ways for businesses to prevent parking without resorting to car clampers. ' A Carstoppers spokesman said the incident, like all others, was recorded on video and he was confident the clamping was carried out within the law. He stressed there were signs explaining clampers were operating. The spokesman said:  'Businesses in Skipton were sick to death of people using their parking areas for free. 'People have commented that parking fees are too high in Skipton. People choose to chance it and not pay.

A mother who went into labour at just 22 weeks has revealed her joy today after her son won his desperate fight for life. Ruth Nash, 34, was pregnant with twins when her waters broke 18 weeks early. She was told her babies had a zero chance of survival and soon after lost her daughter Matilda. However, the mother from the Isle of Wight managed to delay giving birth to her son Stanley for three weeks by lying with her feet elevated in a hospital bed. Her precious son was born at just over 24weeks weighing a tiny 1lb. In the palm of your hand: Stanley needed an operation to fix a hole in his heart . Survivor: Stanley Nash with mother Ruth and father Graham after they brought him home from hospital. Sadly Stanley's twin sister did not survive her premature birth . Mrs Nash said: 'I wanted to do whatever I could to become I mum. I would try anything. So I got into the bed, lay down, and didn’t move. 'I was told it was almost certain that I . was going to lose him. I think if I hadn’t done that I would not have . the beautiful baby that I have today.' The mother gave birth to Matilda at St Mary's Hospital in the Isle of Wight, after staying still for two weeks but she only survived only 19 hours. Ruth was transferred in her bed by ferry to Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth where there is a specialist neo-natal unit and seven days later Standley was born. Doctors rushed Stanley, who weighed less than a bag of sugar out of the maternity ward and put him straight onto a ventilator. Surgeons performed several operations on Stanley - fixing a hole in his heart and correcting ROP - an eye condition which can cause babies to go blind. It meant Ruth and husband Graham, 40, . from Ryde, Isle of Wight, were unable to hug their newborn for the first . five weeks of his life. But Stanley survived against the odds and at six months old is showing no ill-effects of his dramatic arrival into the world. Precious: Ruth had to wait five weeks before she could hug her son . New life: Stanley at just a day old at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth . Although Stanley weighed just 1lb at birth amazingly he is not the lightest baby to have survived - that record goes to Rumaisa Rahman who was born in the U.S weighing 8.4oz. The lightest baby to survive in the UK was Marian Chapman who weighed just 10oz when she was born in 1938. The second lightest was Ruby Angel Dunn who was born weighing 12.5oz in 2007. Mrs Nash said: 'When I finally got to hold him it was the best moment of my life. 'I know I have lost a child but I feel like the luckiest woman in the world at the moment.' Mr Nash added: 'It was the most stressful three weeks we have ever experienced and the last few months have also been tough. 'It may have been hell getting here but we are so happy to have come through it all with a healthy, beautiful boy.' Consultant obstetrician Nick Kenney, who treated Ruth at St Mary’s, said: 'Survival below 24 weeks is very rare. 'I have nothing but admiration for their strength and courage, never giving up hope. 'Perhaps the strongest character was young Stanley himself.'","Mother's waters broke at just 22 weeks and she was told son had ZERO chance of survival after losing twin sister .

Alex Salmond has been accused of treating the Scottish Parliament with contempt by not going before MSPs today to explain his dealings with the Murdoch media empire. Furious opposition politicians said the First Minister needs to answer questions over whether he had been prepared to intervene and lobby UK Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt on the proposed takeover of BSkyB. It comes after an email from a senior figure at News Corporation claimed Mr Salmond would call Mr Hunt 'whenever we need him to'. Under fire: Alex Salmond, pictured with Rupert Murdoch in 2007, has been accused of treating the Scottish Parliament with contempt by not going before MSPs today to explain his dealings with the Murdoch empire . During the Leveson Inquiry into press . standards it emerged that News Corp's director of public affairs, . Frederic Michel, had emailed James Murdoch and said: 'I met with Alex . Salmond's adviser today. He will call Hunt whenever we need him to.' A . spokesman for the First Minister insisted last night that Mr Salmond . 'has never spoken to or corresponded with Jeremy Hunt on this issue'. He . said it was 'total nonsense to suggest there was ever any quid pro quo . offered by the Scottish Government over the BSkyB bid'. But opposition politicians said there were still questions the First Minister needed to answer. Labour . leader Johann Lamont told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland: . 'He has not answered the question, did he make the offer to phone Jeremy . Hunt on behalf of News International. 'He has not answered that question. I think that is a fundamental question he should answer.' She . added: 'There is grave concern that it would appear that Alex Salmond . has used his office of First Minister to put his backing to a commercial . interest of Rupert Murdoch. 'The . idea of the First Minister of Scotland intervening with a Tory Cabinet . secretary on what was a very sensitive issue seems to me to be . remarkable.' Mr Salmond is due to give a speech at the Institute of Directors in London today. Anger: Opposition politicians said Mr Salmond needs to answer questions over whether he had been prepared to intervene and lobby UK Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt on the proposed takeover of BSkyB . But Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he should be appearing before MSPs at Holyrood to answer questions on the issue. Mr . Rennie told Good Morning Scotland that Mr Salmond was 'prepared to step . up and back the BSkyB bid on behalf of Rupert Murdoch'. The Lib Dem leader claimed the relationship between the SNP leader and Rupert Murdoch and was 'far too cosy'. He . added: 'It's an unhealthy one, it just shows that Alex Salmond is . prepared to do anything to secure independence and I don't think that's . what we want from a First Minister.' Mr Rennie said the First Minister now . 'needs to explain what he was prepared to do in return for support from . the Sun and the News of the World'. He . added: 'He needs to explain that to Parliament and he needs to explain . it today, at length, not in First Ministers Questions, because we . actually need a proper exploration of the issues. 'The . fact that he is not prepared to come before the Parliament today shows . the contempt he has for Parliament. He is prepared to spend yet more . time in London than actually at the Scottish Parliament answering . questions on this. 'But we . need to get to the bottom of what his relationship was with Rupert . Murdoch, whether he was prepared to do almost anything in return for . support on independence and support for the SNP in the elections.' Denial: A spokesman for Mr Salmond insisted that he 'has never spoken to or corresponded with Jeremy Hunt (pictured leaving his London office last night) on this issue' Former Tory leader David McLetchie told BBC Radio Scotland: 'Alex Salmond and his political advisers were offering themselves as lobbyists on behalf of News Corporation into the BSkyB bid. 'It is that conduct that Mr Salmond has to answer for.' Mr McLetchie, also speaking on Good . Morning Scotland, accused the First Minister of 'hawking himself around . as a lobbyist for the Murdoch empire'. He . said that was a charge the First Minister had not denied, adding: 'He . says he didn't actually do any lobbying but he has not denied making the . offer to do so.' The . Conservative MSP insisted that was 'inappropriate' behaviour, saying: . 'Broadcasting is a reserved issue, not a devolved issue. 'I'm afraid this sort of conduct simply portrays Mr Salmond as a man more than willing to suck up to the rich and famous.' The row erupted as a result of James Murdoch's evidence to the Leveson Inquiry yesterday. Shocking testimony: James Murdoch appears at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in London yesterday . Counsel to the inquiry Robert Jay QC had asked Mr Murdoch if the email to him from Mr Michel gave rise to the perception that favourable coverage of Mr Salmond in the Scottish Sun - which backed the SNP in last year's Holyrood elections - meant the First Minister would be more willing to call Mr Hunt 'whenever we need him to'. Mr Murdoch, who stepped down as executive chairman of News International in February, replied: 'No, if the insinuation is that there was any quid pro quo with editorial coverage versus a commercial agenda, I can tell you categorically that it's false. There's no connection. 'That was absolutely not News Corporation's policy and I wouldn't do business like that.' A spokesman for Mr Salmond said last night that the references to the First Minister 'in a handful out of hundreds of emails, represent internal chatter from within News International'. He insisted: 'It is total nonsense to suggest there was ever any quid pro quo offered by the Scottish Government over the BSkyB bid, and nor could there possibly have been, because the Scottish Government had absolutely no determination over BSkyB's ownership. 'Indeed, James Murdoch categorically rejected such claims in his evidence to the inquiry, and the proof of that lies in the fact that the First Minister has never spoken to or corresponded with Jeremy Hunt on this issue.' Mr Salmond had previously accepted an invitation to give evidence to the inquiry, and his spokesman said: 'He looks forward to attending and to reiterating these key points to the inquiry.'","First Minister 'needs to answer questions' over whether he had been .

A Chicago judge's computer was used to access 243 separate hardcore porn websites, it was revealed today. Someone using Associate Judge Joseph Polito's  computer login and password attempted to log on to adult websites including hugeheavybreasts.com and chubbyparade.com. The judge has refused to say whether it was him that was using the computer at the time. Porn: An attempt was made to access adult content from the judge's computer account. It is unclear who did it . Other porn sites that the user attempted to get onto included bigbras-club.com, portofdebauchery.com and teenagesextape.com. The other sites someone tried to access suggested an interest in masturbation and large-breasted women, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Other websites refer to older women and office sex. Chief Judge Gerald R Kinney has apologised 'for any embarrassment this incident has caused'. None of the attempts to visit adult websites were successful because of filters. Judge Politico - who has refused to comment on the incident - could be suspended or sacked after the case was referred to the Illinois Judicial Inquiry Board. He has been an associate judge since 2006 and was involved in small claims cases, car cases and forfeiture hearings on the five days when the computer was used to access porn. He is now involved in divorce cases. At the time he would have had a computer on his bench in the courtroom. The attempts to access adult websites only came to light in Illinois after a freedom of information request was submitted. All websites staff access are tracked to prevent workers from wasting taxpayers' money on sites not connected to their jobs. Many webpages - such as Facebook and shopping sites - are automatically blocked. Judge Polito was put in charge of a . high-profile divorce case in 2007 involving Plainfield man Craig Stebic . who was attempting to split from his missing wife Lisa. An investigation into the computer use on Polito's account was launched after the freedom of information request was submitted by the Chicago Sun-Times.

However, the documents were eventually made public after the Illinois Attorney-General said that the list of porn sites was 'unrelated to any judicial function [and] is not a judicial record.' The data released covered a six month period around the end of 2010.

The U.S. Supreme Court appeared to endorse Arizona's immigration crackdown on Wednesday, rejecting the Obama administration stance that the federal government has sole power over those who illegally enter the United States. Justices suggested by their questions and comments that states have significant latitude to adopt laws that discourage illegal immigrants from moving to and staying in the country. Arizona two years ago became the first of half a dozen U.S. states to pass laws aimed at driving illegal immigrants out, including requiring police to check the immigration status of anyone detained and suspected of being in the country illegally. Scroll down for video .

Outrage: Protesters shout slogans during the protest against Arizona's immigration law . Addressing: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer speaks to the press outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington following arguments in the Arizona vs United States immigration enforcement law case . Their day in court: Gov. Jan Brewer, centre, walks out after the Supreme Court in Washington, Wednesday, April 25, 2012, after the court's hearing on Arizona's 'show me your papers' law . Justice Anthony Kennedy, who often casts the deciding vote, referred to the 'social and economic disruption' that states endure as a result of a flood of illegal immigrants and suggested that states such as Arizona have authority to act. The battle over the law goes to the heart of a fierce national debate between Democrats and Republicans over what to do with the estimated 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the country, a number that has held steady in recent years. Critics have said the Arizona law could lead to ethnic and racial profiling of the fast-growing Hispanic population, now equal to 16 per cent of all Americans. The four conservatives - Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and Samuel Alito - all asked tough questions of the administration's lawyer. Paul Clement, right, argues for Arizona; Justices, from left are, Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, Chief Justice John Roberts, Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Samuel Alito . Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. speaks before the Supreme Court . A decision for the Arizona law would be a setback for President Barack Obama, who has criticized it and has vowed to push for immigration legislation if re-elected on November 6. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has said the government should drop its challenge to the law. Roberts, who also could play a key role in deciding the case, spurned the administration's arguments that the Arizona law conflicted with the federal system and deemed it 'an effort to help you enforce federal law.' Other parts of the Arizona law require immigrants to carry their papers at all times; ban illegal immigrants from soliciting work in public places; and allow police to arrest immigrants without a warrant if an officer believes they have committed a crime that would make them deportable. Liberal Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor asked how long suspected illegal immigrants could be held by authorities while their status was checked and whether that would violate their constitutional rights. There will be a 'significant number of people detained for a significantly longer period of time,' Breyer said. The third liberal hearing the case, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, asked more broadly about whether Arizona's new law conflicted with federal policy: 'We don't want competing ... schemes.' Fellow conservative Justice Clarence . Thomas did not ask any questions but is expected to support the Arizona . law, based on his past votes. The . Supreme Court's immigration ruling is likely to come by the end of . June, as the political campaign season heats up. It is expected around . the same time justices are likely to rule on President Barack Obama's . 2010 healthcare overhaul law. The . case, heard on the last day of oral arguments for the annual term, drew . more than 100 reporters to the courtroom press seats and scores of . people on the sidewalk outside the building. The immigration dispute is . the second most important case of the term, following the healthcare . dispute heard in March. Only . eight of the nine Supreme Court justices heard the arguments. Liberal . Justice Elena Kagan, the former top Obama administration lawyer at the . court, recused herself because she had worked on the matter previously. Her fellow liberal justices appeared to accept that the conservative majority would vote to uphold at least part of the Arizona law and focused their questions on how those provisions, which have been on hold during the litigation, would be applied on the ground. Roberts tried to cut off the argument that the Arizona law would lead to ethnic and racial profiling of Hispanics by interrupting the government attorney's opening statement and asserting that profiling was not at issue in the case. The arguments, the last of the court's 2011-12 term, offered a rematch of the same attorneys who squared off in last month's historic battle over Obama's healthcare overhaul law. Paul Clement, a solicitor general during Republican George W. Bush's presidency, represented Arizona and its Republican governor, Jan Brewer. He argued that Arizona, on the southwest border with Mexico, bears a disproportionate share of the costs from illegal immigration. He said that state's law simply complemented the federal government's efforts.

Mexico said the controversial law 'poses an imminent threat to Mexico-US bilateral relations' Donald Verrilli, a former White House lawyer and now solicitor general under Obama, argued Arizona's law would result in 'mass incarceration' of people unlawfully present in the United States and posed the risk of 'significant foreign relations problems.' The conservative Scalia scoffed at that argument, saying that any problems could be avoided by releasing the people from jail and deporting them. The Supreme Court last year upheld a different Arizona law that penalizes businesses for hiring illegal immigrants, and Roberts at one point cited that decision as a precedent. The Supreme Court case is Arizona v. United States, No. 11-182.

Unhealthy foods and fizzy drinks should be taxed to encourage healthy eating and ease Britain's obesity crisis, an academic has claimed. Dr Mike Rayner, a leading academic at Oxford University's Department of Public Health, believes ministers should up VAT on chocolate, burgers and pasties to make people eat better. Dr Rayner told the BBC that as one in four British adults is obese or overweight, the nation's obesity epidemic is costing the NHS more than £5m a year. A love of fatty, unhealthy, junk foods is causing an obesity epidemic in Britain and costing the NHS millions . To help tackle the problem, Dr Rayner proposed a 12p tax on soft drinks, claiming it could save up to 2,000 lives a year as people switch to healthier alternatives. He likened the proposed rise to existing taxes which are already in place on cigarettes and alcohol. Dr Rayner said: 'We are in the grip of an obesity epidemic. We, as a nation, are eating too many calories. 'We use taxes to discourage drinking and smoking. 'It raises lots of money for the treasury and prevented people from dying too early. There is now lots of evidence that manipulating food prices could promote healthy eating.' His proposals come a month after the government announced a controversial 'pasty tax' on hot takeaway food, though Dr Rayner said the food taxing system remains 'very muddled'. Claim: Dr Mike Rayner believes 2,000 lives could be saved each year if fizzy drinks were taxed . In 2004, Tony Blair rejected the idea of a tax on fatty foods, saying it would make Britain too much of a nanny state. MPs have suggested the way to tackle obesity is through education and better packing, which were more practical options. Steve Webb, a Liberal Democrat . pensions minister, called on manufacturers to put 'put less junk into . the food' and said of the fat tax: 'It should certainly be looked at, . but not as a tax-raising measure.' Dr . Rayner referenced how Denmark has brought in a 'fat tax' on foods with . saturated fats, saying the Scaninavian country has 'got the right idea.' He . added: 'Instead we need to rethink the way we apply VAT to food. At the . moment we have a muddled system: you do pay tax on some . relatively-healthy things like smoothies, but you don't pay it on a lot . of junk food like chips or doughnuts. 'I don't care whether it's hot or cold, whether you got it from a takeaway or a shop - I'd like us to tax all unhealthy foods from butter to biscuits. And in doing so we can tackle a problem that will only keep expanding.'","Dr Mike Rayner, from Oxford University, says taxing fizzy drinks could save 2,000 lives a year ."

For a fit young police officer keen to get out of the office and into the fresh air, it is the ideal assignment. No wonder 664 applied for the 36 places in the squad guarding the Olympic torch on its 70-day journey around the country before the London Games. Yesterday the chosen few seemed to be taking their duties in their stride during a dress rehearsal between Leicester and Peterborough. Dummy run: A female volunteer carries the (unlit) Olympic torch through Loughborough flanked by a cohort of police guards .

Just in case they find the job too traumatic, the officers are to be given psychological training on how to prepare themselves for being away from home . Yet just in case they find the job too traumatic, they are to be given psychological training on how to prepare themselves for being away from home. And after their two-month jaunt, they will be offered counselling to help them ‘reintegrate’ into the Metropolitan force. The officers will see occupational health specialists and even career advisers to help them settle back into their day jobs. Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s absurd that after two months guarding the Olympic torch, officers will be stuck in counselling rather than fighting crime. Feet up: The police complete part of yesterday's journey by train . 'These nanny-state proposals are a waste of police time and taxpayers’ money. Officers should be allowed to get on with the job they are paid for, not mollycoddled after what will likely be a fantastic experience.’ A core team of 28 officers plus eight reserves will take turns to run some or all of the daily 30-mile distance. They will form part of a wider 70-strong team selected from the Met to follow the relay and help with traffic control, security and event management. During the trial run yesterday, male and female officers wore grey shorts and T-shirts, and wore ‘bum bags’ to hold their radios, water and suntan lotion as they accompanied the torchbearers. The atmosphere was somewhat muted because the torches were not lit, spectators were not encouraged to line the streets and there was no evening entertainment. During the trial run yesterday male and female officers wore grey shorts and T-shirts, and had 'bum bags' to hold their radios, water and suntan lotion as they accompanied the torchbearers . During the actual relay, which begins at Land’s End on May 18, police could have to deal with saboteurs, protesters and terrorism. They will also be thrust into the media spotlight – something Scotland Yard said could be unsettling for officers. A spokesman for the Met said: ‘We recognise that this is a unique role never performed within British policing. Mindful of the fact that officers will be taken away from their homes for 70 days and encouraged to live as part of a team, their reintegration back into the Met after the event is already being carefully planned. ‘Occupational health specialists within the Met are already developing plans to ensure that the welfare of this team is considered at every stage and the best possible support provided.’ Jasmine Vanmali and Samuel Rowbotham carry the torch from the National Space Centre yesterday. During the actual relay, which begins at Land's End on May 18, police could have to deal with saboteurs, protesters and terrorism . The spokesman said that preparations included ‘talking to them about their career aspirations and encouraging them to plan ahead for when they are away from home’. On its journey to the opening ceremony on July 27, the torch will be carried by 7,300 nominated members of the public, with athletes and celebrities making up the remaining 700. Each will carry the flame for about 300 yards and about 110 people will take part each day. The officers chosen for the security team are said to be ‘among the fittest’ in the force. Yesterday, between four and seven Met runners at a time flanked the torchbearers for a gentle jog through the streets. They were also escorted by a police cyclist, named only as ‘Cyclist One’. The rehearsal began just after 7am at a car park in Leicester outside the National Space Centre. Hotel worker and gap-year student Jasmine Vanmali, 19, was the first of 122 volunteers to run with the torch. She said: ‘I’m excited but really cold. I just wish the flame was lit so I could get some heat from it. Holding the metal is making me even colder. I just want to get moving.’","664 officers applied for the 36 places in the Olympic torch guard squad .

And Baker Carmen Venn has seen first hand the anger felt by many women when an unhappy marriage comes to an end. She bakes divorce cakes for women who have washed their hands of their ex and want to throw a party to celebrate - with a parody wedding cake as a centrepiece. But it seems some divorcees are taking their bitterness to an unhealthy level by requesting that the celebratory cake be designed with the image of brides murdering their husbands. The specialist baker reveals she recently received a request for a bloody three-tier murder scene for an unnamed client who wanted to mark her divorce in style. Death of a marriage: Baker Carmen Venn created this murder wedding cake for a divorce party . The design - one layer of fruit cake, one of vanilla sponge and one of chocolate sponge - comes complete with a murderous icing bride at the cake’s top and a butchered groom lying at the base. Carmen, 41, from Ulverston, Cumbria, said she had taken on the job after a newly single woman approached her with a very specific request. She said: 'She asked for this design for a party and I said: ‘I don’t see why not. I like a challenge’. 'She was over the moon when I handed it on. 'It was taken to a divorce celebration at the Kill One Social Club in Barrow. The ex-husband doesn’t know a thing about it.' Carmen said her own husband John thought the design was brilliant. 'He didn’t think it was weird at all. He’s got a wicked sense of humour too. 'I’ve got a crafty streak in me. And it helps to have a sense of humour in baking.' Wacky cakes: Carmen Venn has been baking for 20 years and admits her sense of humour helps when making creations of this nature . The happily-married couple hope Mrs . Venn’s creative flair and technical decorating skills will help win . custom at her two-storey cake supply store and teaching base, Carmen’s . Cakes and Supplies, in Ulverston’s Market Street. Celebrity endorsement: Katie Price held a reported £1m divorce party following her split from Alex Reid . Mrs . Venn’s 20 years of baking and catering experience has led her to take . on a host of unusual cake commissions already, including busty women, . Beetle cars, fantasy castles with dragons, Santa asleep in bed, and . goldfish bowls. She aims to pass on some of her creative flair with cake decorating lessons starting at the store after Easter. Carmen's divorce cakes are the latest addition to a burgeoning trend for celebrating marriage breakdowns. Celebrities including Katie Price (pictured right), Jack White and Scarlett Johansson have all reportedly held divorce parties. In 2010 a London lawyer became the first in the country to sell divorce gift vouchers as Christmas presents, while Debenhams offer a divorce list with present suggestions for friends to give to someone following a split. Specific party planners are also available to organise the whole event ensuring all the finer details such as banners, balloons and a cake are in place. They can even arrange party coasters with slogans saying, 'Who needs a man when you can have a drink?' as well as supplying miniature coffins for your wedding ring.","Carmen Venn, 41, has been inundated with requests for the twisted desserts at her Cumbria bakery ."
"Case is set to cast shadow over Euro 2012 tournament . By . Will Stewart . UPDATED: . 02:00 EST, 25 April 2012 . Surveillance: Yulia Tymoshenko is being monitored 24/7 . The former Ukraine prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko is on hunger strike after being 'beaten' by guards in jail where she claims she is a political prisoner. Her case is set to cast a shadow over the Kiev government which begins co-hosting the Euro 2012 football championships in six weeks with calls for a boycott of the football tournament by Western politicians. 'Yulia Tymoshenko has declared a hunger strike,' her lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko said, adding she has not eaten since Friday. Ukrainian officials admit that warders manhandled the opposition leader - once dubbed the Thatcher of Eastern Euope - after she refused to have hospital treatment for a longstanding spine complaint, fearing that state-appointed medics would poison her or infect her with a disease. 'There is a horrible haematoma on her stomach and there are bruises on her arms,' Vlasenko said. He added that she was 'punched in the stomach' before losing consciousness. 'According to the law and the criminal administrative code, the prison service has the right to use physical force,' claimed local prosecutor Hennadiy Tyurin. He denied undue force was used and no criminal probe has been opened. Her treatment is set to spark angry protests marring the Euro 2012 contest which Ukraine co-hosts with Poland. England play three qualifying matches in the former Soviet state. The football tournament is meant to showcase Ukraine's modern outlook but 51-year-old Tymoshenko's supporters are determined to use the spotlight to demonstrate against 'Soviet-style repression'.

Her days of shopping in the EU for the president's palace are over, as ministers have decided the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is no longer welcome. The ban on travel and shopping in the EU, will come as a blow to Asma  al-Assad, whose love of pricey purchases has been well documented in the past few weeks in leaked emails. They detailed Asma placing an order for £10,000 worth of candlesticks, concern over getting hold of a new chocolate fondue set from Amazon, and swapping details with friends of crystal-encrusted designer shoes costing nearly £4,000. The announcement comes as diplomats try to crank up pressure on his government to end a bloody crackdown on popular unrest. Her name is now among 12 people added to the sanctions list, which already includes her husband. The list will be released over the weekend, but diplomats confirmed the list includes Mr. Assad's mother, sister as well. They said that Mr. Assad's 36-year-old wife would be subject to the EU's asset freeze and banned from traveling to all EU member states except the U.K. British authorities will decide whether they prevent her entering the country and a U.K. diplomat said it is premature for a decision on the issue.

Violence has intensified in recent weeks as pro-government forces bombard rebel towns and villages, looking to sweep their lightly armed opponents out of their strongholds. The international community has struggled to formulate a joint approach in the face of opposition from Russia and China to any resolution by the U.N. Security Council. Assad absorbed a major diplomatic blow on Wednesday, however, when Russia and China joined the Security Council in voicing support for U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan's bid to end violence that has brought Syria to the brink of civil war.

She is the daughter of consultant cardiologist Fawaz Akhras and retired diplomat Sahar Otri, both Sunni Muslims. Her parents moved from Syria to London in the Fifties so that her father, who is now based at the Cromwell Hospital and in Harley Street, could get the best possible education and medical training. Asma, who holds dual citizenship, . British and Syrian, was educated at a Church of England school in Ealing . before attending a private girls’ day school - Queen’s College, Harley . Street. From Queen’s, . where she achieved four A-levels, Asma went to King’s College London to . read Computer Science and take a diploma in French Literature. She . graduated with a First and, after six months of travelling, joined . Deutsche Bank as an analyst in hedge-fund management. She then moved to . the investment bank JP Morgan and worked in Paris and New York, as well . as London. On family holidays back in Syria, she met Bashar. Then he, too, came to London to study ophthalmology, though he had to leave early to return to Syria after his elder brother Basil, who had been the heir, died in a car crash. Asma started seeing him in secret, resigning from JP Morgan just a month before the wedding without being able to explain the real reason. With her father, she has set up several London-based charities such as the Syria Heritage. Vogue has described her as ‘the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies’ and has topped French Elle’s ‘most stylish woman in politics’ list. In Damascus, Bashar and Asma now live in a flat with plate-glass windows and their three boys go to a Montessori school. Asma speaks four languages and her connections with France have led her to persuade the Louvre to help her open Syrian cultural attractions.","British-born former investment banker, .

A man survived despite being stabbed 38 times in a 'determined and frenzied attack' at his home, a court heard today. David Johnson, 33, used a kitchen knife to repeatedly stab Danny Ross, 44, known as 'Fat Dan', after tying his belt around the older man’s neck and choking him until he was unconscious, Exeter Crown Court heard. The jury of eight men and four women heard that when paramedics went to the flat in Exeter a couple of hours later after 999 calls, including one alleged to be from Johnson himself using a 'fake accent'. 'Determined and frenzied': Danny Ross, also known as 'Fat Dan', survived despite being stabbed 38 times by David Johnson, Exeter Crown Court (above) heard . They found Ross sitting on a sofa in a blood-soaked shirt, surrounded by 'pools of blood'. Heroin addict Ross, a 'highly intelligent man' who has suffered poor mental health including depression since a road accident 20 years ago, was rushed to hospital after the attack on August 18 last year. But despite having lost a lot of blood and needing 70 stitches to his wounds, he survived. Prosecutor Sean Brunton said Johnson had gone with a friend to Ross’s flat in Sidwell Street in the city at around 9.30pm and told him 'you owe my dad two bags', a reference to heroin. When they got there Ross was sitting on the sofa, sobbing and talking about how he wanted to die. Needed 70 stitches: Paramedics found Mr Ross sitting on a sofa in a blood-soaked shirt, surrounded by 'pools of blood', the jury was told (file picture) Mr Brunton said: 'The defendant said to Ross: ""You want to die do you?"" The defendant then removes his belt and loops it around Danny Ross’s neck and tightened it as if to strangle him.' Mr Brunton added that Johnson’s friend made an attempt to stop him before fleeing back to his car. A few minutes later, he said, Johnson came back to the car, laughing, before saying: 'He’s dead mate. He’s f***ing dead, get over it. I strangled him and then stabbed him. I stabbed him 50 times.' The court also heard that Johnson, who had alcohol and drug addictions, had told a friend the day before the attack that he was 'struggling to cope' and needed to get out of the city or 'I’m going to get killed or kill someone to keep myself alive'. After the attack, two 999 calls were later made at around 11pm, one by acquaintances of Johnson who had found out what had happened. 'The prosecution say that a second call was the defendant making a disguised-voice call,' Mr Brunton added. Ross told police that Johnson attacked him and the defendant was arrested in the early hours of the next morning at his home in Foxhayes Road in the Exwick area of Exeter. Johnson denies attempted murder, saying he went to the flat and argued with Mr Ross, but did not attack him in any way. The trial continues.","David Johnson 'tied belt around Danny Ross's neck and attacked him with kitchen knife'

"By . Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 07:11 EST, 25 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:45 EST, 25 April 2012 . Older people are a benefit, rather than a burden, to the economy and society according to a new report. Researchers from the University College London School of Pharmacy refute the view that older people are a major source of economic problems such as reduced international competitiveness. Their study provides evidence that the benefits of living longer will outweigh the additional health and social care costs of population ageing. Positive effect: The elderly contribute billions to the economy, according to a UCL study . ‘All too often old age is seen as a time of increasing dependency, vulnerability and frailty. But older people already contribute significantly to their families’ and wider communities’ wellbeing,’ said Dr Jennifer Gill, co-author of the report. Life expectancy at 65 has increased by six years since the 1950s. As people live longer they stay healthier, at any given age. Such advances have partly been generated by the pharmaceutical revolution of 1950‐2000. Medicines for conditions such as heart attacks, strokes and diabetes, are now well understood and have already contributed significantly to falling death and disability rates, despite problems such as obesity. ‘In future decades, greater participation by people in their 60s and 70s in formal and informal work, alongside additional decreases in the number of life years spent with major disabilities, could increase national productivity by up to 10 per cent of GDP,’ said Dr Gill. One example of how those of more advancing years contribute to the economy is London-based handyman service Silver Saints, which operates a policy of employing men of more advancing years, with one aged 62 and until recently another aged 68. Operations Manager Jordan . Taylor told MailOnline: 'We find that because of their experience and . exposure to life they have a calmer approach to the job - they're more . confident and female customers are certainly more at ease with the . elderly guys.' In the 1980s and 1990s estimates indicate that just 0.2 per cent of the annual increase in NHS spending was caused by population ageing. Benefit: Hospital costs for the elderly are outweighed by their positive contribution to the economy . Even though the current figure is in the order of one per cent per annum such cost increases have been outweighed by the positive contribution of £40 billion that adults aged 65 and over made to the British economy in 2010. It is estimated that by 2030 retired ‘baby boomers’ will contribute £80 billion to the economy. The team points out that even if older people do need long term supportive care, they won’t be a burden on the economy. Co-author Professor David Taylor said: ‘For instance, the extra  public cost of the recent Dilnot proposals for making residential and community care more fairly available in England would, if implemented, probably be under 0.2 per cent of current UK Gross National Product.’","Over-65s added £40bn to the British economy in 2010 .

Primary school teacher Anna Yerrakalva who was off sick from 2004 on full pay after a catalogue of dubious medical conditions were claimed . A Teacher who lied about an accident at work and took six years off sick on full pay has been lambasted by an employment judge. Anna Yerrakalva, who had brought an unfair dismissal claim in 2010, yesterday won the case on a technicality – but was told she would receive no compensation because of her lies. However, the case has cost taxpayers  around £300,000. Mrs Yerrakalva, a widow and mother of two, went off sick after her alleged accident in November 2003. The 58-year-old primary school teacher claimed a teaching assistant had an epileptic fit in the classroom and fell on her, trapping her on the floor and leaving her with chest, neck and spinal injuries. An investigation by Dearne Carrfield Primary School in Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, concluded the accident never happened. She briefly returned to work there, only to be struck by a bus in June 2004, and has never worked since. She was on full pay of about £30,000 a year until she was suspended in 2009 – and was finally sacked the following January for gross misconduct. Her pay while off sick has been estimated at around £180,000 and the council’s legal bill is believed to exceed £120,000. Dearne Carrfield Primary School in Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, found Mrs Yerrakalva's claim was made up . However, the tribunal yesterday found . the school governors and her employer, Barnsley Council, were . responsible for an act of victimisation on grounds of disability and . unfairly dismissed her as she was not allowed to return to work and deal . with grievances according to the rules. If proper procedures had been followed she would ‘inevitably’ have been sacked fairly, the panel said. Employment judge Stephen Shore said her compensation for unfair dismissal was being reduced by 100 per cent because she ‘told a series of lies’ and added the credibility of her testimony was ‘in tatters’. The Sheffield tribunal heard Mrs Yerrakalva had been claiming disability living allowance and industrial injury benefit in 2006 and 2007 yet at the same time told her employers that she was fit to return to work. Her astonishing list of 26 symptoms in her benefits claim forms included finding it difficult to peel vegetables, open the curtains and turn on the taps. In a reserved judgment Mr Shore said she was ‘grossly exaggerating’ her symptoms. He said she was a ‘thoroughly unreliable witness’ and the account of her accident at work ‘wholly inconsistent’. Her ‘lies and dissimilitudes’ included forgetting she owned a second home in Doncaster. Her former headteacher Stephen Poxton told the hearing Mrs Yerrakalva was sacked after lying to her employers about her health. He said: ‘Her claims caused . . . an irreparable breakdown of confidence. I could not trust this teacher with children.’ Mrs Yerrakalva, who moved to the UK from India in 1981 and lives in Sheffield, also won a claim for breach of contract and unlawful deduction of three weeks’ wages and is likely to receive modest compensation at a future date.","Judge said Anna Yerrakalva told a 'series of lies' that left her credibility in tatters .

"Court told punch-up began after accused cut up following an evening bike ride . PC Paul Wiltshire said he had double vision for months . By . Jamie Mcginnes . PUBLISHED: . 10:21 EST, 29 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:02 EST, 29 March 2012 . Bristol Crown Court was told cyclist Gareth Pitt (pictured) punched an off-duty policeman . A cyclist fractured a driver’s eye socket in a bout of road rage - not realising his victim was an off-duty policeman, a court heard. Gareth Pitt, 53, punched Paul Wiltshire, who was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt at the time, as the pair argued on the pavement, it was said. A jury heard how PC Wiltshire needed surgery to his fractured left eye socket, which gave him double vision for months after the incident. Mr Pitt, of St Jude’s, Bristol, denies causing grievous bodily harm on May 20 last year at his trial at Bristol Crown Court, claiming he acted in self-defence. The court heard the spat began when Pitt, who had been at his girlfriend’s house on a nearby road, went for an evening bike ride. As he cycled down Ketch Road, Bristol, he saw a blue car performing a manoeuvre which blocked part of both lanes. Mr Pitt, who believed the driving was 'poor and inconsiderate', then asked PC Wiltshire: 'What do you think you’re doing, you idiot?', admitting he swore in the process. The pair exchanged words again further down the road and Pitt told the jury that after PC Wiltshire verbally abused him he swore and accused the officer of cutting him up. Mr Pitt then pulled over on the busy main road and asked PC Wiltshire: 'Do you want some?', the jury heard. The court was told how the officer, who is based in Southmead, a suburb of Bristol, then parked and approached Mr Pitt. However, PC Wiltshire denied provoking the cyclist. Mr Pitt told the jury: 'I was scared. I just felt I had to say something. 'I was hoping to scare him off.' He added: 'I don’t pretend it was a particularly brilliant strategy, but it was what I did. 'I felt my body space was definitely invaded. He started mocking me by saying in a silly voice, ""do you want some then, do you want some?"" 'It was an impulse gesture, it felt like a fight or flight response I suppose. I struck him because I thought he was going to hit me.' He then alleged that after the punch PC Wiltshire kicked the bike - although the officer denies this. PC Wiltshire told the court he was in 'excruciating pain' as he attempted to restrain Mr Pitt until he could be arrested. He said: 'I couldn’t see out of my left eye at all. I had no idea what injuries he’d caused to me.' Witness Christopher Samuel told the jury he had seen a man in a bicycle helmet suddenly 'flail his arms' at another man, who had put him in a 'bear hug'. Nicholas Flook, a worker at nearby Avon Tyres, said: 'I saw the cyclist hit the gentleman in the side of the head with a clenched fist.' Donna Hennessy said she saw PC Wiltshire cover his face as he tried to protect himself, but that he then got Mr Pitt in a tight headlock. She added: 'I thought he was going to actually snap his neck, that’s how much force he was using.' A verdict in the case is expected today.","Court told punch-up began after accused cut up following an evening bike ride .

The other offences took place between 2008 and 2011. The defendants will be sentenced on March 19 and were told by Judge Beverley Lunt they would be going to prison. Surmaj alleged that she did not realise now serious it was to arrange the marriages and was bailed on condition that she lives at her home address, does not travel outside the UK and reports to the police station twice a week. Cina was remanded in custody. The case follows a lengthy investigation into . around 50 ‘suspicious’ marriages in East Lancashire, and a number of . successful prosecutions. DI Paul Roach said: 'Rather than blend into the background of a metropolitan city, they played on the naivety of the rural parishes where they feel they won’ t be challenged and can brazen it out. 'Once they realise they can get away with it, they hammer away at one church until they get found out and then move on.' Since the scale of the scam first came to light, Lancashire clergy have been educated on what warning signs to look out for if they suspect a bogus wedding. No vicars in East Lancashire have been implicated in the sham marriages.","Husband and wife team offered £1,500 to cash-strapped women to act as brides .

"By . Katherine Faulkner and Deborah Arthurs . UPDATED: . 12:52 EST, 5 March 2012 . She has already proved her athletic prowess with tough physical challenges including a 50-mile endurance race. And yesterday Pippa Middleton upped the stakes by joining one of the toughest cross-country skiing events in the world. The 28-year-old – who had never done any cross-country skiing before – braved sub-zero temperatures during the 56-mile challenge in Western Sweden. But in order to make sure she would be ready for the contest, Ms Middleton engaged in a series of last-minute training sessions to brush up on her technique. Beginner: Cross-country novice Pippa arrived in Sweden a week ahead of the race to get in some practice . Oops! Pippa takes a tumble as she gets to grips with the demanding sport . Nervous? With no cross-country ski experience to rely on, Pippa revealed that she had been working on her general fitness in preparation for the contest . At ease: A natural on skis, Pippa soon picks up the cross-country technique . Arriving in Sweden a week before the race, Pippa and her brother James got kitted out with skis and poles and hit the snow to get to grips with the discipline. Already a keen skier, Pippa was at ease with the equipment - but nonetheless struggled to keep her balance on some of the course's more challenging parts. She looked determined to master the art, spending her time ahead of the race practising the rhythmic swinging of the arms and smooth leg movements necessary for the kind of efficient and high-speed skiing style needed to earn her a decent place in the pecking order. The arduous training more than paid off in the end, as Pippa managed to secure an impressive 412th place out of 15,800 racers when the race went ahead on the weekend. Envy: Pippa with a local admirer after crossing the finish line . Raring to go: Pippa Middleton arrives at the start of the Vasaloppet Cross Country Ski Race in Salen this morning to raise money for charity . Helping hand: James Middleton, who is competing alongside Pippa, zips up his sister at the start of race while she chats to a fellow racer . Pippa, wrote on her charity page: 'My brother and I are raising money for Magic Breakfast, a small registered charity that fights child hunger through breakfast clubs' After the race, one local who hands the winner a wreath, proved . the envy of many men when he planted a kiss on her cheek at the end of the . course. The Duchess of Cambridge’s younger . sister joined 15,800 other skiers for the race between Salen and Mora, . including her brother James. But sweating it out on skis did not mean her exacting sartorial standards had to slip. Miss Middleton, who turned up with immaculate hair and make-up, started . the race with a white hat but ended it in a fetching orange one, which she co-ordinated with her sunglasses and shoes. She crossed the finish line after seven hours, 13 minutes and 36 seconds – described by veterans as a ‘very impressive’ time. When asked if she minded finishing 26 minutes behind her brother, she replied: ‘No, that was probably fair.’ Despite being a beginner at cross country skiing, Pippa marched powerfully along the tough course . Pippa was a natural on the course, onlookers said . Pippa joined 15,800 other skiiers for the gruelling race . Pippa was inundated with requests for interviews after completing the race . The party planner explained she had ‘never really skied cross-country . before’, but said she and James, 23, had done ‘lots of fitness training’ in the UK to prepare for the race, as well as two weekends spent skiing . in Switzerland. During the race – much of which was uphill – Miss Middleton stopped to . drink the local blabarsoppa, or blueberry soup,  a drink handed out to . racers which is said to boost energy. Per Strid, a spokesman for the Vasaloppet race, one of the oldest events . of its kind in the world, said: ‘I must congratulate Pippa – she had a . fantastic performance. What she achieved was really impressive for a . first timer. She was obviously very fit and in very good shape.’ The Middletons were raising money for the Magic Breakfast charity, which . provides a pre-school meal to poor inner-city children in the UK. So . far they have raised nearly £7,500 for the cause. Up to the start line: Pippa Middleton has a chat with a fellow race goer before setting off on the charity challenge . Gaining speed: She proved to be an accomplished ski and looked at home on the slopes . Pippa stopped for a drink during the race and looked in good spirits when she took off again . Success! Pippa crossed the finish line in a 'very impressive' time . Pippa was unfazed by the feat of endurance, saying she had trained in the UK before undertaking the competition .

Panama police have named the boyfriend of an American woman who disappeared from the country in November as a person of interest in the ongoing case. Yvonne Baldelli, 41, went missing three months after moving to the Central American country to start fresh. Ms Baldelli set up house with her boyfriend at the time, Brian Brimager, shortly after she had been fired from her job at Procter and Gamble in California and going through a divorce. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lovers in paradise: Ms Baldelli moved to Panama with Mr Brimager who used to be a Marine . New beginnings: Ms Baldelli moved to Panama in an effort to 'start over' after a recent divorce and losing her job at Procter and Gamble in California . The pair rented an apartment together on the Panamanian island of Carenero and Mr Brimager, a former marine, played guitar in local bars. Ms Baldelli's parents last heard from her by email in the end of November, but then nothing since. Mr Brimager said that she had run away to Costa Rica and taken up with another man, but her passport records do not register any travel to the neighboring country. Her family became concerned when Mr Brimager stopped answering their calls and returned to California in December, shortly after her disappearance. Unresponsive: Ms Baldelli's parents last heard from her in November and became concerned when her boyfriend said she ran off to Costa Rica with another man . Together: Yvonne Baldelli set up house with her boyfriend at the time, Brian Brimager, shortly after she had been fired from her job at Procter and Gamble in California and going through a divorce . Her sister Michelle Valenzuela said that she sensed that something bad was going to happen when she sister headed off to Panama, telling CBS that she had an 'ominous' feeling. Aside from her senses, the first tangible clue they had was when the weekly emails stopped coming. Fox News Latino cites police sources that say the couple had a violent relationship during their time in Panama and have suggested that the possibility of a crime of passion has not been ruled out. Another unusual move by Mr Brimager was to become engaged and marry another woman in the months immediately following his girlfriend's disappearance. Making music: While in Panama, Mr Brimager played guitar in local bars . New beginning? Mr Brimager married a different woman in California, seen here, just months after Yvonne disappeared . Mr Brimager has since taken down his Facebook page, and neither he nor his new wife are responding to press calls. Since the declaration of him as a formal 'person of interest', the FBI announced that much of their investigation will take place in the U.S. That said, they will also be sending divers down to Panama to search the area around the home where Ms Baldelli and Mr Brimager lived. Some of her relatives flew to Panama to look for her in January after she did not respond to emails about a planned family reunion. Hunt: Her family suggested that searchers look for her Tiffany 'Circle Lariat' necklace that she always wore . Possible scene: This is the home where Ms Baldelli and Mr Brimager lived while in Panama. The FBI said that they would be sending divers to search the area around their home . Local investigations have turned up no solid clues about Ms Baldelli's whereabouts, or the location of her dog named Georgia May. Her family launched an effort to enlist local volunteers to search via Facebook, and the FBI has since become involved in the case. FBI investigators are also officially looking into Mr Brimager and his connection to the case. 'What we want is to bring Yvonne home and show that she's loved and cared about,' her father James Faust said.

"UPDATED: . 07:49 EST, 10 January 2012 . Experts found evidence of animals forming cliques and gathering information to help make group decisions - in much the same way as humans use Facebook Groups to streamline discussions . Humans didn't invent 'social networks', says a new study into animal behaviour - instead, our use of networks such as Facebook and Twitter actually mirrors group behaviours that can be found in whales, monkeys  and dolphins. Intelligent animals 'use' groups to share information with one another - albeit without computers or smartphones - just like humans do online. Experts found evidence of animals . forming cliques and gathering information to help make group decisions - . in much the same way as humans use Facebook Groups to streamline . discussions. The famous 'six degrees of separation' rule - which states that anyone can be related to another person in six steps - also applies to the way animals group with one another. The findings apply across dolphins, whales, primates and hooved animals. The sharing of information through social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook actually reflects tactics animals have always used to gather information about their social environment. The study was conducted by Dr David Lusseau, of the University of Aberdeen’s School of Biological Sciences. He said: 'Social networks are the same across all species and, whilst details of their structure may differ, some properties remain the same whether we are looking at killer whales, spider monkeys or, indeed, humans.' 'For example, the famous concept of six degrees of separation - the idea that everyone is linked by common acquaintances to any other person on Earth - holds true across the animal kingdom.' 'Our studies into animal populations showed the ‘small world effect’ is prevalent in the animal kingdom.' 'Also, we see cliques form in different species of animals in the same way as we ourselves experience in our day-to-day lives.' Dr Lusseau will discuss his findings in a talk next week as part of the university’s Cafe Scientifique series. He said: 'I will explain that the driver behind the formation of social networks in the animal kingdom is information-gathering.' 'This information differs between species and populations - so it could be where food is, where predators are, or how strong you are in comparison to the other animals around you which would make you more of less likely to win in a fight.' “Schools of dolphins provide an example of this. As individuals, dolphins have their own daily needs to fulfil, such as resting and eating, but they are also concerned with what they should do next as a group.'“We find that group leaders can emerge simply in particular cases because they might know the current context better than other members of the group.' Dr Lusseau believes the evolution of social media mimics the evolution of social networks in the animal kingdom. He said: 'The social-networking technology most of us now employ on a daily basis helps us to behave at a global scale in the same way we do with people we see every day.' 'It’s allowing us to share information with one another in the way that animals across the kingdom have always communicated, the only difference being that we can do it on a global level.' 'In many ways the evolution of social media is converging with the evolution of the way animals use social information.' His talk, entitled Did Animals Invent Twitter?, will take place at Waterstone’s Union Bridge in Aberdeen at 7pm next Wednesday.","Animal groups share information like Facebook groups .

A private US company,  on track to become the first commercial visitor to the International Space Station, has delayed its spaceship's launch date by at least a week. Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, was scheduled to launch the supply ship next Monday but officials have announced that the spaceship needs more testing. The Dragon spacecraft will be first private ship to go to the station but now its lift-off is likely to be around May 7 rather than the planned date of April 30 after NASA did a final review of the mission on Monday. A private US company is on track to become the first commercial visitor to the International Space Station . Necessary: NASA is counting on the private companies to keep the space station stocked with supplies and science experiments following the retirement of the space shuttles last year . ‘Am pushing launch back approx a week . to do more testing on Dragon docking code' SpaceX founder and CEO Elon . Musk wrote on Twitter. 'New date pending coordination with @NASA.' The Dragon will be hoisted aboard the . company's Falcon rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. NASA loaded the . test flight with non-essential cargo of clothing, food, computers and . science equipment. SpaceX has successfully launched the . Falcon and Dragon before, but going to the space station requires more . proven precision. NASA is turning to private companies to carry cargo . and eventually astronauts to the space station. NASA had been confident that the SpaceX mission would be able to go ahead on the scheduled date. So far, NASA has invested $381 million in the SpaceX rocket and cargo capsule, with the company and investors contributing about another $700 million, SpaceX founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk said. The Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule also are in the running to serve as a space taxi for astronauts. The United States hopes to break Russia's monopoly on flying crews to the station, a service that cost more than $60 million per person, by 2016 under a related NASA program.

'I think we've got a pretty good shot, but it's important to acknowledge that a lot can go wrong. This is pretty tricky.' If the launch is successful, the Dragon capsule would conduct a series of maneuvers and tests in orbit before NASA clears it for approach and berthing at the station. It would remain attached to the outpost for several weeks before flying back to Earth and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean for recovery. The capsule will carry 1,149 pounds (521 kg) of food and non-critical equipment and supplies to the station. It is expected to return 1,455 pounds (660 kg) of cargo back to Earth, a capability that far exceeds what the Russian Soyuz capsules can hold.

A teenage girl compelled to testify in the statutory rape trial of an ex-high school sports coach known as 'Wild Man' has claimed it was she who pursued the relationship not him. Speaking at the trial of former Alameda High School girls basketball coach Wesley Specht, 27, the unnamed girl gave intimate details of how the pair had sex on at least nine occasions, one of them being at his home. Defending the one-time professional basketball player, the girl recalled how she affectionately called him 'Punk', brought him a bottle of rum and enjoyed a date in a hot-tub at Specht's parent's house in Lakewood, Colorado. Scroll Down for Video . High School basketball coach Wesley Specht is accused of having sex with three underage girls of which the youngest was 15 between November 2010 and April 2011 . Appearing at Jefferson County District Court, the girl, who was 17 at the time the pair allegedly began their relationship, hid her face as she testified and sighed out loud as she defended the disgraced former coach. 'I cared for Wes, and they (prosecutors) knew I didn't want him to get into trouble for something we both wanted,' said the girl who is now 18 according to the Denver Post. 'The attention he gave me was really nice. He would listen to me. He would understand me.' Consent in any case of underage sex is not a defence for statutory rape in Colorado and the girl is not being identified because she was underage at the time of the alleged crime. A player with the Colorado Kings basketball team, Specht is charged with seven sexually motivated felonies relating to underage relationships with three girls from November 2010 to April 2011 at Alameda High School. Wesley Specht appears in a promotional video for the American Basketball Association's Colorado Kings where he was nicknamed 'Wild Man' One of the girls was 15 when Specht allegedly began his pursuit of her and according to a police affidavit the girl said they had sex on his desk before practice and in his car, again before practice. The girl also informed police at the time that she and Specht had exchanged 7,000 text messages and in those messages were some semi nude images and one fully nude picture of her. Hired by the high school in 2009, Specht was ironically promoted to become head coach after the previous incumbent was fired for inappropriately texting girls on the team. Wesley Specht is accused of having sex with three underage girls during his time as head coach at Alameda High School in Lakewood Colorado and receiving semi-nude and nude text messages from girls who were all under 18 at the time . The underage sex scandal involving Specht came to the attention of police after the athletic director's administrative assistant became privy to gossip they overheard during a conversation between the boys basketball coach and the principals secretary. 'It was a faculty member that finally decided what they were hearing was probably some type of an inappropriate relationship going on and came forward,' said Lakewood police spokesman Steve Davis. Upon being interviewed by police, the student claimed that the sex was what she wanted and refuted claims that Specht has in any way abused his position. Admitting to nine sexual incidents to police, she stated they had sex at his Arvada, Colorado home, once in his car in a Belmar Park parking lot and once at his parent's Highland Ranch home. Jefferson County District Court: Testifying before the court, one of Specht's alleged victims said that she wanted to be in a relationship with the former high school basketball coach . However, 'It makes no difference if it's consensual, it's strictly illegal,' said Davis. Facing seven felony counts, including a pattern of sexual assault on a child by someone in a position of trust, enticement of a child and possession of graphic images depicting underage subjects, Specht has been on a $10,000 bond since his April 2011 arrest. The court heard about a secretly recorded phone call that the 18-year old alleged victim made at the request of Lakewood Police after they had become aware of Specht's activities. Panicked over the escalating rumours about his sexual activities, Specht tried to cool his relationship with the girl. 'Those are serious rumours. That's what you don't understand,' said Specht to the teenager during the call. In addition to Specht two other staff members at Alameda High School were removed from their posts after they willingly withheld information about the coach's alleged underage affairs . However, contrary to the claims of the girl in court, the prosecution produced a chain of texts sent by Specht to the girl which indicates that he was the main driving force behind the relationship. 'Still got that bottle of Bacardi,' said Specht in a text from April 2011. 'I'm up for it if you are,' replied the teenager. Upon the former coach being arrested in April 2011, students who had been aware of the gossip surrounding Specht spoke about the atmosphere during training. 'All the basketball girls started going, 'Oh my gosh. Did you hear about Coach Wes?' said team member Savannah Duran. Wesley Specht (left no7) faces seven felony counts relating to statutory rape and no longer plays for the Colorado Kings basketball team . 'You could tell by the way he talked to some girls, it was weird for an older man.' Other girls were completely in the dark. 'No one really knew and the people who did know kind of just kept to themselves about it because it's not our business,' said Tiffany Williams. 'A lot of girls said that he was flirty with everyone. I think he was just a really friendly guy.' In addition to Specht, two other employees were fired for what they knew and how they handled the information. The trial is continuing.","One girl testifies that she enjoyed hot-tub dates with Colorado high school basketball coach .

Colombia’s diplomat in the U.S. has demanded that President Obama say sorry for the secret service sex scandal  - which he claimed has damaged the reputation of his country. Gabriel Silva gave an impassioned interview to Colombian newspaper El Tiempo where he criticised the American government's handling of the scandal which saw federal agents buying hookers. The incident became public on April 12 when one of the prostitutes argued with a Secret Service agent over her payment in a hallway of the Caribe Hotel. Mr Silva was furious that the media storm over the incident has focused on the city's sex industry - where prostitution is legal. Mr Silva told the paper: 'It is necessary, and I want to hear . it from the White House. 'A more clear expression of remorse is required . to protect the reputation of Cartagena.' Last . week, President Barack Obama described the . prostitution scandal as 'a little distracting' and branded the 12 agents . involved 'knuckleheads'. Since then, a dozen Secret Service employees, including two supervisors, and 12 military personnel have been implicated. Eight of the Secret Service officers have been forced out, the agency is trying to permanently revoke the security clearance of one, and three others have been cleared of serious wrongdoing but will face administrative discipline. The Secret Service was also now investigating a news report that employees allegedly engaged the services of prostitutes in El Salvador on another trip abroad for the president.

A lorry driver has been arrested after a head-on collision in County Durham today which left three people from the same family dead - including a one-year-old baby girl. All three killed were from the same car, a 75-year-old man, believed to be the driver, an 18-year-old girl who was rear seat passenger and a one-year-old baby who was in the rear of the vehicle. A 74-year-old woman, who was a front seat passenger of the Renault Megane Scenic, is still being treated for what were described as life-threatening injuries at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Scroll down for video . Carnage: Three members of the same family, including a on-year-old baby, who were in this car, were killed following a head-on collision with a lorry today . Wreckage: The Renault Scenic people carrier carrying four members of the same family - three of whom were killed - was devastated by the impact on the B1404 . The driver of the Volvo truck, a 42-year-old man, from Hetton-Le-Hole, was treated for whiplash and arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, police said. He is currently in police custody. The accident happened near Sharpley Golf Club on the B1404 between Houghton-le-Spring and Seaham at around 12.20pm, Durham Police said. The force of the crash sent the lorry through a fence and on to the 15th fairway, 250 metres from the impact. ‘The road has been closed to traffic and is expected to be so for several hours,’ he added. Simon Weightman, a farmer who diversified to build Sharpley Golf Club, said: ‘I suddenly saw a lorry in the middle of the fairway. Horror: The driver of the Volvo truck has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving following the fatal crash on the B1404 near Houghton Le-Spring from Seaham in County Durham this afternoon . ‘Then I saw a person get out and collapse on the ground. ‘Some golfers playing that hole turned out to be detectives and they were very quickly on the scene of the crash. ‘The bang was so loud I thought it must have been a head-on collision. ‘The lorry's fuel tank was ruptured as if the lorry had gone over the car. ‘I got a quick glimpse of the car but it was very traumatic to see it. ‘Golfers who saw it came off the course. They could clearly see it was awful.’ Mr Weightman said the crash happened on a 60mph stretch of road, close to the bottom end of the course. He . said: ‘After the collision it had gone through the old hedge, through . the new one, up an embankment, over the top of some five-year-old trees . and into the fairway.

A telescope is being built that scientists say ‘will transform our understanding of the universe’. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is being put together by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the U.S, which boasts in a statement that it ‘will capture the widest, fastest and deepest view of the night sky ever observed’. This is because it packs a 3.2billion-pixel camera that will survey the entire visible sky every week, creating an unprecedented public archive of data – about six million gigabytes per year. Snap happy: The camera on the LSST will 'transform our knowledge of the universe' The telescope will be placed at Cerro Pachón in northern Chile . This is the equivalent of shooting roughly 800,000 images with a regular eight-megapixel digital camera every night, but of much higher quality and scientific value. Its deep and frequent cosmic vistas will help answer critical questions about the nature of dark energy and dark matter and aid studies of near-Earth asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, the structure of our galaxy and many other areas of astronomy and fundamental physics. ‘With 189 sensors and over three tons of components that have to be packed into an extremely tight space, you can imagine this is a very complex instrument,’ said Nadine Kurita, the project manager for the LSST camera at SLAC. Size matters: This graphic shows just how big the LSST camera is . High flyers: The mountain-top site in Chile should be operational by 2014 . ‘But given the enormous challenges required to provide such a comprehensive view of the universe, it’s been an incredible opportunity to design something so unique.’ ‘This is the culmination of years of work by a large group of dedicated people,’ said SLAC’s Steven Kahn, LSST deputy project director. ‘I’ve personally been working on this since 2003, and it is tremendously satisfying to finally see this move forward to the point when we can begin to carry out the project.’ If all continues as planned, construction on the telescope will begin in 2014. Preliminary work has already started on LSST’s 8.4-metre primary mirror and its final site atop Cerro Pachón in northern Chile. As the primary component of all energy in the universe, the still-mysterious dark energy is perhaps the most important research target for LSST and the physicists who are building it. Yet that’s only a start. LSST’s fire hose of publicly available data will allow astronomers the world over to view faint and rapidly changing objects, create 3D maps and time lapses of the night sky and detail Pluto’s celestial neighbourhood, the Kuiper belt. ‘Not only should LSST revolutionize our understanding of the universe, its contents and the laws that govern its behaviour, but it will also transform the way all of us, from kindergarteners to professional astrophysicists, use telescopes,’ said Tony Tyson, LSST director and a professor of physics at the University of California, Davis. ‘These are exciting times!’","The camera will take the equivalent of 800,000 images by an eight-mega pixel camera every night - but of a vastly superior quality .

Glorious blue skies, sizzling sunshine and summer temperatures have put March on course to be third warmest since records began. Official provisional figures also show it was one of the driest, with 38 per cent of the normal rainfall for the time of year, the Met Office said last night. However, with clouds and cooler temperatures due to roll over Britain this weekend, forecasters say most people have just another day to make the most of the unseasonal early spring. Next week is expected to stay cooler with the chance of rain or even snow on hills in the North and Scotland. According to official records up to March 28, the average temperature for the month across the UK was 7.6c (45.7f). Since records began in 1910, only 1938 and 1957 have enjoyed warmer Marches. Rainfall was below normal for most of the UK, increasing the risk that the drought in the South, East and Yorkshire could spread in the next few months. Happy times in the sun!

After two dry winters - and without good early spring rainfalls to top up underground aquifers and reservoirs - groundwater levels are low. Seven water companies in the South and South-East are imposing hosepipe bans next week. Dan Williams of the Met Office said this March ‘looks like being the fifth driest on record, with only 1953, 1944, 1931 and 1921 in front’. The month was also far sunnier than normal, with England getting 152 hours of sunshine – around 50 hours more than average for the time of year. Today will start cloudy in the west with a risk of drizzle, but most places will enjoy another day of sunshine and warmth. However, tomorrow sees the arrival of cooler weather with some light rain or drizzle possible over the weekend, particularly in the North-West. The South and Midlands are likely to get the best weekend weather. The unseasonal weather has been playing games with nature, with cats breeding earlier in the season than usual - causng issues at cat rehoming centres - and even leading to the first crop of British tomatoes arriving a whole month early. The unseasonable hot spell has ripened 100 tonnes of tomatoes which are not ordinarily picked until the end of April - but today, the first crop was handpicked. Thousands of the tomatoes, which include piccolo and beefsteak varieties, have ripened rapidly this spring on the Isle of Wight. They are now being harvested at Wight Salads, nestled in the Arreton Valley, which is the single biggest tomato grower in the UK. The island supplies more than 8 million tonnes of tomatoes to UK supermarkets every year. The Romans first grew tomatoes on the Isle of Wight because of its favourable climate to ensure a reliable supply throughout their reign. The island now grows more than 40 varieties. Starting early: The first crop of British tomatoes was picked today a whole month early . Experts at Wight Salads say the abundance of sunshine and warmth allows tomatoes to be grown for longer on the vine. This means greater sugar production which they claim makes them 'Britain’s sweetest and tastiest tomatoes, bursting with vitamins and minerals'. Brian Moralee, growing manager at Wight Salads Group, said: 'We are thrilled with this early burst of warm, sunny weather. 'Here on the island we feel good weather more, which brings out the best in our tomatoes’ taste and quality. 'We will pick 100 tonnes this week, destined for UK supermarkets.'

He was long-blamed for the failure of Captain Scott's ill-fated expedition to the South Pole in 1911. However, a historian now believes Edgar Evans - whose injuries were thought to have contributed to the Antarctic mission's demise - was actually an unsung hero. Legendary Captain Robert Scott led his four-strong team to the South Pole as part of the Terra Nova Expedition. Doomed: The members of Captain Scott's ill-fated expedition to the South Pole (from left to right); Laurence Oates, H.R. Bowers, Robert Scott, Edward Wilson and Edgar Evans . Deadly expedition: Legendary Captain Robert Scott led his four-strong team to the South Pole as part of the Terra Nova Expedition . The group died on the return leg of their journey having lost the Polar race to the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. Until now, Welshman Petty Officer Evans was believed to be largely responsible for the failure of the mission due to a head injury he suffered when he fell and hit his on a crevasse, during the expedition. It was said his deteriorating condition delayed the explorers, diminishing their food supply and leading to their desperate demise. But now new light has been shed on his role. Historian Isobel P. Williams claims that Edgar Evans was actually a key player in the expedition and his injury played no part in the men's deaths. According to Williams they died as a result of the extreme cold and exhaustion, coupled with a 'completely inadequate' diet. Unsung hero: Edgar Evans (left) suffered a head injury and was the first to die but his determination, endurance and loyalty to Scott (right) 'makes him a hero of the British Expeditions', a historian says . Williams, a former medical consultant in Respiratory Medicine, said her research proved beyond doubt that Evans was an unsung hero. The historian, who has now published a book about her findings, said: 'Edgar was the first to die and when the news reached England, he was unfairly blamed by some, for the tragedy. 'We now have a better understanding of the appalling physical conditions endured by all members of the Polar assault. 'And my medical knowledge has given me insight into the problems suffered by the explorers on their return and particularly the difficulties that Edgar encountered. 'Edgar died due to circumstances entirely beyond his control and that his determination, endurance and loyalty to Scott makes him a hero of the British Expeditions.' Frozen in time: Scott's ship, the Terra Nova, at the Ice Foot, Cape Evans . The Terra Nova Expedition began on . November 26, 1910 when Captain Scott and his crew left Lyttelton, New . Zealand, in the hope of becoming the first people to reach the South . Pole. Despite atrocious weather conditions, Scott and four companions reached the pole in January 1912. However . their hopes of snatching the international ‘Polar race’ were dashed . after they discovered that a team led by their Norwegian rival, . Amundsen, had beaten them to it. All . five of Scott’s men died of exposure on the return journey from the . Pole, with the last three survivors being just 11 miles from the next . depot of food and fuel. Scott . held Edgar Evans in high regard, writing in his journal that he was 'a . giant worker - he is responsible for every sledge, every sledge-fitting, . tents, sleeping-bags, harness, and when one cannot recall a single . expression of dissatisfaction with any one of these items, it shows what . an invaluable assistant he has been'. The Terra Nova Expedition began on November 26, 1910 when Captain Scott and his crew left Lyttelton, New Zealand, in the hope of becoming the first people to reach the South Pole . In spite of this, for almost a century, his name has been linked with the party’s failure. Evans was believed to have suffered a serious head injury following a fall into a crevasse on the Beardmore Glacier. His worsening physical condition delayed the party and what little food they had gradually diminished. Edgar Evans, a father of three, deteriorated rapidly on the return journey, with little his companions could do to help him. He finally collapsed and died on February 17, 1912. But in Captain Scott’s Invaluable Assistant, Edgar Evans, Williams reveals that Petty Officer Evans was, in fact, an 'invaluable team member' who was 'far' from incompetent.

Thursday was a day off school for Thusha Kamaleswaran, who spent the morning watching her favourite cartoon shows on television. But at 1pm she switched channel for the lunchtime news. She knew she wasn’t supposed to, but she couldn’t help herself. Thusha’s parents had told her not to watch, desperate to protect her from hearing anything about the gangland shooting that has left her paralysed from the chest down. But last week was an important turning point in Thusha’s short life. Not only did she return to school  for the first time since the incident a year ago, but the three men convicted over the attack on her were sentenced at the Old Bailey. Still smiling: Thusha on her special mobility bike with her parents and sister Thushaika . Thusha, who has suffered from nightmares that the trio would return to ‘get my brother and sister’, wanted to know the instant a decision had been made about how much time the ‘bad men’, as she refers to them, would spend in jail. The six-year-old, who wants to be a doctor when she grows up, concentrated hard as the newsreader announced that a judge had given them life sentences. Thusha immediately phoned her parents, who were at the Old Bailey, and asked her mother Sharmila: ‘Does that mean they will die in jail?’ Sharmila, 35, told her that the gang would eventually be released, but not for many years. ‘When I heard they would go to prison for life, I thought it meant their whole lives,’ Thusha said. ‘My mum has explained that it doesn’t mean until they die, but I know they won’t be able to come out for a really long time. ‘She . told me that everyone involved was very happy that the men were going . to jail. I’m also very happy that they won’t be able to hurt any more . people. But they are nasty men and they never even said they were sorry . for hurting me.’ Thusha’s . life changed in an instant in March last year as she played in the . aisles of her uncle’s convenience store in Stockwell, South London. CCTV . pictures showed her being pushed aside as two men ran into the store, . trying to escape from three men outside. Shots were then fired into the . shop. Caged: Nathaniel Grant, who fired the gun at Thusha (left); Anthony McCalla (centre); and Kazeem Kolawoleon . Thusha, in her red . school uniform, collapsed after a bullet hit her in the chest and . damaged her spine. Her heart stopped twice and she had to be revived by . paramedics before three operations at King’s College hospital in . Camberwell, South London, saved her. It . was three weeks before her parents were told she would never walk again . and a year before Thusha was released back into their care from the . experts in spinal injuries at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, . Buckinghamshire. The three men in court were Nathaniel . Grant, 21, Kazeem Kolawole, 19, and Anthony McCalla, 20. Grant, who . fired the gun, will serve a minimum of 17½ years. McCalla and Kolawole . will each spend at least 14½ years in prison. While Thusha is relieved that the ‘bad men’ who hurt her are no longer a threat, her parents are angry that they could be back walking the streets when they are still only in their 30s. Sharmila said: ‘I felt the sentence was lenient. Thusha is in a wheelchair, probably for the rest of her life. It is a life sentence for her, but if these guys are released they will still be relatively young and able to live active lives. ‘It’s hard for me to see my child who was once so happy now in a wheelchair. I’ve shed many tears over it. So, of course, we would like life to mean life, but we have our faith in the British justice system and it only works if we can be strong enough to accept the results.’ Thusha’s father Jeyakumar, 37, who is . known as Sassi, said: ‘They have shown no remorse. During the sentencing . I kept looking at them, but they didn’t look at us. I suspect they . didn’t have the guts to look us in the eyes. I’m frustrated that they . will always be able to walk, run and move. Thusha won’t be able to. ‘We . wanted to scream at them, but if we had ranted and raved, then there . would have been no difference between us and those brutes.’ Split second before: CCTV showed Thusha dancing in the aisle of her uncle's shop .

Sassi has left his job at a factory . making plastic milk bottles to help his wife care for Thusha, who is . being eased back into a school routine for two hours a day, two days a . week before she returns full-time later this year. Thusha . has had to start a new school because her old one didn’t have enough . wheelchair access. ‘I’ve got a new uniform, which is blue, and although I . miss my old friends I hope I’ll make lots of new ones from my class,’ she said. ‘I love being back in lessons. ‘My . dad’s been helping me this week and staying with me while  I get used . to school. I was a bit  nervous about going back and quite shy at first. I know I will get used to going to school again. I have really missed . it while I have been ill and I want to learn and pass my tests so  I can . be a doctor when I grow up.’ Despite . her injuries, Thusha remains fiercely independent and is determined to . help out around the house.

'We're really rooting for the teams to come through,' added NASA Associate Administrator Bill Gerstenmaier. So far, NASA has invested $381 million in the SpaceX rocket and cargo capsule, with the company and investors contributing about another $700 million, SpaceX founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk said. The Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule also are in the running to serve as a space taxi for astronauts. The United States hopes to break Russia's monopoly on flying crews to the station, a service that cost more than $60 million per person, by 2016 under a related NASA program.

'This is a test flight and we may not succeed on getting all the way to the space station,' Musk said. 'I think we've got a pretty good shot, but it's important to acknowledge that a lot can go wrong. This is pretty tricky.' If the launch is successful, the Dragon capsule would conduct a series of maneuvers and tests in orbit before NASA clears it for approach and berthing at the station, which is targeted for May 3. It would remain attached to the outpost for several weeks before flying back to Earth and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean for recovery. The capsule will carry 1,149 pounds (521 kg) of food and non-critical equipment and supplies to the station. It is expected to return 1,455 pounds (660 kg) of cargo back to Earth, a capability that far exceeds what the Russian Soyuz capsules can hold. The European and Japanese ships that also fly cargo to the station incinerate in the atmosphere after making deliveries and do not return to Earth. NASA plans a final review of the Dragon mission on April 23 to verify SpaceX flight software.

A mother-to-be was forced to have her baby in a hospital car park after being turned away from her local maternity ward because there were no spare midwives. Ania Martin, 38, and her partner Dean were told to head to make the two-mile trip from Leeds General Infirmary to the nearby St James's Hospital in Leeds. Baby drama: Dean and Ania Martin with their baby girl who was born in the car park at St James Hospital, Leeds . However, Ania's water's broke in the car and Dean had to call 999 after finding no one at St James's reception. He was given step-by-step . instructions by emergency services staff - until a passing medic spotted . the drama and helped deliver the 6lb 11oz healthy baby girl safely. Dean and Ania - both dental technicians . who already have a two-year-old son Jan - had already visited Leeds . General Infirmary at around 4pm last Wednesday when Ania's contractions . started. Mr Martin, 39, said: 'They said there was . still some time to go and we could either wait or go home for a couple . of hours and ring ahead when we were on our way back. 'Our son had been at a childminder's all day so we decided to head home, sort him out and then come back. 'When we were on our way back later that . evening, I rang the ward to let them know, but they said they couldn't . take us because there was a shortage of midwives and the ward was full. 'They said I would have to go to St James's, but I told them I didn't know where it was. 'I was absolutely gobsmacked. I begged . and pleaded with them to help - I suggested I bring Ania to A&E so a . doctor could see her, or drop her off and they could take her in an . ambulance. 'Ania's first labour was really quick, . so I knew we didn't have much time. Her waters broke in the car and she . was telling me that she could feel the head - I was desperate, I just . wanted help from anyone. But the midwife on the LGI maternity ward told . me there was nothing she could do.' Mr Martin said he was turned away by Leeds General Infirmary (pictured) even though staff had told them to return that evening . It took Mr Martin 30 minutes to find St James's. 'I went to one wing, but by this time it was about 10pm and the reception was closed,' he said. 'I frantically drove to another ward, but this was closed too. I didn't know what to do, so I rang 999 and explained the situation. 'It was bizarre, I couldn't believe I was sitting outside a hospital calling 999 and delivering my own baby.' Mr Martin said he was incredibly grateful to a medic who had spotted the commotion and run over to help. 'She helped me with the rest of the delivery, she was brilliant. I'm so grateful the medic was around to help out because I was terrified. 'We will certainly tease the baby about how she came into the world when she grows up. And we have been joking we are going to call her Silver Volvo Estate Martin.' Both mother and baby are now at home and doing well, but Dean says he is 'disgusted' with the way they were turned away and will be lodging an official complaint with the Trust. He added: 'I needed anybody to help me, but they just turned us away. I'm disgusted. 'How can a hospital be shut? Especially when they told us earlier to come back, and they knew we would be.' A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'The maternity unit apologises to Mrs Martin for being unable to deliver her baby at the Leeds General Infirmary site. 'We made provision for her at St James's and we thought she would get there in time. Ambulances are not routinely sent to women in labour but an investigation into circumstances around the birth will be undertaken and we would encourage Mrs Martin to contact us as soon as she feels able.'",Ania's husband was told to drive her to a different hospital even though he didn't know the way .

It is the oldest surviving clipper ship in the world, being five years older than the Cutty Sark, and in better days took emigrants from Scotland to Australia, where an estimated 250,000 people's ancestors were among its passengers. For years, the City of Adelaide lay rotting on a Scottish slipway. Now, nearly 150 years after she was built, preparations are under way for one last voyage – back to Australia, where the vessel will undergo restoration. A giant steel cradle has been assembled in Irvine, North Ayrshire, so the vessel can be transported to become the centrepiece of a maritime heritage display in Port Adelaide. Saved: For years it lay rotting on a slipway at the Scottish Maritime Museum, with the cost of repairs put in excess of £10m . Named The City of Adelaide, the vessel . was built in Sunderland in 1864 and an estimated 250,000 people can . trace their origins to its passengers when it carried emigrants from . Scotland to Australia. For years it lay rotting on a slipway at the Scottish Maritime Museum, with the cost of repairs put in excess of £10million. Some . experts even suggested breaking it up as the restoration required was . so extensive, it almost required building a new vessel. The City of Adelaide travelled 10,000 mile trips between the two countries for 23 years, but her sailing days ended in 1893. The 176ft (53 metre) ship was purchased by Southampton Corporation following a cholera outbreak for use as a floating isolation hospital. Legacy: The City of Adelaide was built in Sunderland in 1864 and an estimated 250,000 people can trace their origins to its passengers when it carried emigrants from Scotland to Australia . In 1924 it was converted into a training ship at Irvine, and renamed HMS Carrick, but in 1991 the ship sank at the Princes Dock, Glasgow, and lay on the bottom of the River Clyde for a year. It was then raised by the Scottish Maritime Museum and later moved to its site in Irvine, Ayrshire. Like the other surviving clipper, Cutty Sark, it combines an iron frame with a wooden hull. In 2010 the Scottish government named a group from Australia as the preferred option to move and restore the ship. Announcement: Culture Minister Fiona Hyslop (far left) said the vessel would be returning to the city after which she was named in 2010 after the Scottish government named a group from Australia as the preferred option to move and restore the ship . Some campaigners wanted it returned to Sunderland, and one former councillor even staged a sit-in on the boat, but they lost out to the Australian bid. After announcing the decision, Fiona Hyslop, Minister for Culture and External Affairs . Ms Hyslop said: 'The City of Adelaide has an illustrious past shared by two nations, Scotland and Australia . This bid gives us the opportunity to save the ship build on that link and open up the potential for both countries to recognise partnerships and shared heritage on an international scale. 'We can now have a link between Scotland and Australia which allows both nations to share the vessel’s historical, cultural and social significance through tourism, interpretation and education.' Engineers in Australia constructed a special 100-tonne cradle, costing £680,000, from prefabricated sections which has now arrived in Irvine. Once this is assembled and checked, the hull will be jacked up to allow the cradle to slide underneath. Jim Tildesley, the project co-ordinator for the Scottish museum's . trustees, said the cradle was being assembled in Irvine under the . supervision of one of its Australian designers. He added: 'The initial . assembly is a test assembly to ensure that everything fits as it was . made in 20 different locations in South Australia and so is coming . together in Irvine for the first time. It is then subject to loading . tests to meet Lloyd's [of London] and insurance requirements before . being disassembled prior to fitting around the vessel. 'No date has been fixed as there are a number of stages and conditions . still to be met and, having cleared each of those stages, any movement . has to await an appropriate tide,' he told the Guardian.","For years it lay rotting on a slipway at .

The Church of England was plunged into a race row yesterday over the choice of the next Archbishop of Canterbury. A leading supporter of the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, who is one of the favourites for the job, said his name had been ‘besmirched’ by opponents who had resorted to ‘naked racism’. The allegation was levelled by the Reverend Arun Arora, a former member of Dr Sentamu’s staff, who is set to take up a prominent post in the Church’s national bureaucracy this summer. 'Naked racism': Dr John Sentamu (left), who is one of the favourites to become the Archbishop of Canterbury, said his name had been 'besmirched' by opponents. Lord Carey of Clifton (right) today condemned any campaign against the Archbishop of York vying for the top job . Lord Carey of Canterbury, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, today hit out at the campaign against Dr Sentamu. He told the Times: 'I am quite . appalled. If there is a besmirching campaign then it is abhorrent and I, . for one, will challenge this. 'I think John Sentamu would be a wonderful choice for Canterbury. There are other people to consider, but he has a proven track record.' He said that while other candidates . for Lambeth Palace were being discussed in terms of their opinions and . alliances, ‘it is only when Sentamu is mentioned that such . considerations give way to explicit criticism – some of it attributable, . much of it anonymous whispering, but all of it in stark contrast to the . way other bishops are being portrayed’. Mr Arora said some of the criticism . has been ‘disturbing’, citing the supposed description of 62-year-old Dr . Sentamu by one Oxford don as ‘brutish’. Mr . Arora said the use of the word was racist and added: ‘At its best the . besmirching of John Sentamu has revealed that strand of snobbery which . views outsiders as lacking class, diplomacy or civility – in other words . not one of us. ‘At worst . it has elicited the naked racism which still bubbles under the surface . in our society, and which is exposed when a black man is in line to . break the chains of history.’ Candidate: Dr Sentamu talks with the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, who is stepping down in the summer . Mr . Arora, who is about to become the Church’s director of communications, . ridiculed suggestions  that Dr Sentamu sometimes loses his temper. The . row comes at a time when various lobbies inside the CofE are competing . to get their own champion into Lambeth Palace. Gay activists are hoping . to find a figure potentially sympathetic to the cause of gay equality, . while the liberal wing of the Church is anxious to maintain its own . dominance over major appointments. Two . of the last three Archbishops of Canterbury have been prominent . liberals, and one of the current favourites, the Bishop of Norwich, the . Right Reverend Graham James, was a member of the staff of one of them, . the late Lord Runcie. Dr . Sentamu is not a favourite of CofE liberals, who do not like his firm . line against gay marriage and his generally socially conservative . stance. Nor do they like his opposition to the Left-wing doctrine of . multiculturalism, his championing of the virtues of Englishness, or his . defence of the record of the British Empire. Dr Williams, 61, announced last month that he was standing down as Archbishop of Canterbury, after ten years in the post. He is to take up the role of Master of Magdalene College at Cambridge.

Dramatic CCTV footage has been released showing the final moments of a groom-to-be who was stabbed at his engagement party while breaking up a fight between his brothers and a restaurant. Newly-engaged Antonio Lacertosa was fatally stabbed with a butcher's knife after a melee outside a Staten Island bar last month. His alleged killer, Albanian Redinel Dervishaj, was captured on camera in a heated violent row outside the bar which saw him being thrown over a car by one of Lacertosa's party. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scuffle: CCTV captures the beginning of the brawl between the groom-to-be's party and staff at the Espana restaurant in Staten Island in the early hours of March 17 . Ugly: As the brawl intensifies, a man, thought to be Redinel Dervishaj, is thrown over the top of a car bonnet . Chase: Dervishaj flees down an alleyway and is pursued by Lacertosa's party shortly before the fatal stabbing . Street cameras outside Espana Restaurant in Annadale, Staten Island, captured the large fight outside the bar, before Dervishaj disappears down an alleyway. Less than a minute later, having chased after the restaurant worker, Lacertosa is seen staggering from the alleyway clutching his side after being knifed. Dervishaj learned earlier this month he would not be indicted on murder charges, after a New York Grandy jury ruled he had acted in self defense. Lacertosa's family branded the decision a 'gross injustice', especially in light of the newly-released CCTV footage. A separate CCTV camera, installed in the alleyway, shows the ensuing row, and how seconds later, Lacertosa (top) staggers from outside the building clutching a stab wound to the chest . Stunned onlookers watch as Lacertosa collapses in the street, having been stabbed with a butcher's knife . His family said in a statement they were 'mystified' that the District Attorney’s office was unable to secure an indictment against the 35-year-old Albanian. Lacertosa's mother Linda told the New York Daily Post the new footage proves 'unequivocally' that Dervishaj and restaurant owner Ridi Zeneli were the 'aggressors and protagonists' in the scuffle which led to Lacertosa's stabbing. She said: 'We will live forever knowing that there was no justice in this case but we know that Anthony is in a better place.' Killed: 27-year-old Antonio Lacertosa was fatally stabbed while celebrating his engagement but a grand jury found it was in self-defense . Proposal: Antonio Lacertosa proposed to his girlfriend Bridgette in December . Mr Lacertosa was celebrating his September engagement to 24-year-old Bridgette Schneider outside a Staten Island restaurant when the deadly scene unfolded. Defense attorney Thomas Reilly argued Mr Lacertosa's party had become rowdy and were confronted by Dervishaj and restaurant manager Ridi Zeneli when seen urinating on the Espana Restaurant and Lounge's exterior. According to Mr Reilly, surveillance video showed 'my client getting beaten, thrown over a car. Violent past: Redinel Dervishaj was arrested in Illinois after a manhunt by New York police, but will not face murder charges . He then runs to his own car to escape and is chased down by six guys who are throwing bottles at him.' From there Mr Reilly said they dashed back into the restaurant after fleeing down an alley. Inside, Dervishaj grabbed the knife that would be used to stab Mr Lacertosa, fatally. Three days after the March 17th murder, Dervishaj was detained in Palo Hills, Illinois by the local authorities working in tandem with the New York City Police Department. Dervishaj has a violent past, police records show. In 2007 he was shot in the arm after brawling with Albanian mobsters. Planning now for a funeral instead of a wedding, Mr Lacertosa’s fiancée, Bridgette, has since been too distraught to talk. A photo on their wedding website shows a smiling Mr Lacertosa with his arm around a beaming Bridgette. The couple, who met at Tottenville High School, were shopping for a house in the neighborhood, Mr Lacertosa’s brother said. The brother added that Mr Lacertosa was 'a good kid. He carried this whole household.'

George Osborne is expected to plough another £10billion into the International Monetary Fund to help increase its resources, it emerged today.

The 43-year-old woman is being questioned by police over allegations of bribery and money laundering. She has already been sacked by the Care Quality Commission, which launched its own investigation after being alerted by a whistleblower at a nursing home. It is understood the inspector, from Northamptonshire, visited a number of privately run care homes and offered to fill out ‘favourable’ inspection reports in exchange for bribes. Her arrest yesterday morning is yet another blow for the CQC, which has been dogged by accusations it is failing to protect vulnerable patients. Only this week it emerged carers at a home rated as ‘excellent’ had repeatedly slapped and manhandled an elderly woman with dementia. A CQC spokesman said that after it was alerted, the woman was sacked for gross misconduct and the CQC informed City of London Police. Louise Guss, the CQC’s director of governance and legal services, said: ‘Our inspectors operate to extremely high standards of integrity and professionalism. ‘Unfortunately, in any large workforce there is a risk that a tiny minority may act in a way that betrays the principles of their colleagues and of the organisation as a whole, which is what has happened here. A Care Quality Commission spokesman said that after it was alerted, the 43-year-old woman was sacked for gross misconduct and the CQC informed City of London Police . ‘Having investigated allegations made to us about this inspector and found these were substantiated, we terminated their employment with immediate effect and referred the matter to the police. ‘This inspector has failed the organisation, failed the providers who rely on us to act fairly  and impartially, and – most importantly – failed in their responsibility to protect people who use these services. ‘CQC operates a zero tolerance policy in regard to fraudulent or dishonest behaviour.’ Detective Inspector James Clancey said: ‘We are working closely with CQC to thoroughly investigate these allegations. ‘We are appealing to anyone who may have information to come forward.’ Earlier this year, the CQC’s chief executive, Cynthia Bower, resigned amid concerns the organisation was failing to adequately inspect care homes and hospitals. In March, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee accused the organisation of putting its reputation ahead of the safety of patients. Other reports by MPs have criticised the watchdog for prioritising box-ticking over carrying out spot checks of care homes. But the CQC claims it has made substantial improvements in recent months and drastically increased the number of inspections. Yesterday it announced it would be investigating the standards  of care for 250 elderly folk in their own homes.","The 43-year-old woman worked for .

A new mother loves to cuddle her newborn baby but she can’t pick her up - because she collapsed with a devastating stroke during pregnancy. Claire Gibbs battled through despite being given just a one-in-ten chance of survival. However she was left paralysed down her left side and struggles to take even a few steps. Baby Kara was born a healthy 7lb 11oz with no complications, but Claire, a former nursery nurse, can’t change her nappy, bounce her up and down on her knee or take her for a walk in her pram. Claire and Steven Gibbs with daughter Kara: Claire can't change nappies or bounce her baby, but she can cuddle her . She was 19 weeks through the pregnancy with her first child when she suffered a massive stroke, aged 31. Claire, who lives with husband Steven, 27, in Pitsea, Essex, said: 'It’s a miracle Kara is here. She’s wonderful but I want to be able to hold her in both my arms and to change her nappy.' Eight months and two major operations later Claire, has learned to care for Kara, now four months old, using just one hand. Although her speech is no longer slurred, Claire, now 32, struggles to walk and needs a stick to move even a few feet. Despite ongoing physiotherapy Claire has had to accept the fact her life will never be the same. Claire fell ill unexpectedly when she 19 weeks pregnant on August 31 last year. Having just earned a promotion at the nursery where she worked as a nursery nurse, Claire was at home chatting to husband Steven when she developed a sudden headache . She went into her bedroom where she collapses. Her mother rushed into the room after hearing a 'thump' to find her lying on the floor. Claire was rushed to Basildon Hospital where they realised she had a stoke. Claire spent five weeks recovering in Queen¿s Hospital in Romford, Essex . The seizure had been caused by arteriovenous malformations (commonly known as AVMs) - in other words a massive brain aneurysm which burst and caused massive bleeding. Claire, who had to undergo two complex brain operations to save her life and went on to spend five weeks in Queen’s Hospital in Romford, Essex, said: 'I don’t remember much at all. I remember the headache and being so scared when the paramedics arrived in my bedroom because I couldn’t move. 'I knew something serious was wrong. 'They asked me to hold up my arm as a test I think to see if I’d had a stroke . 'I remember trying to cheat and tried push it up with my other hand because I thought If I could do it they’d say I was ok and everything would be normal.' When Kara was ready to be born on New Year’s Day, Claire underwent a caesarian as doctors feared a natural childbirth could bring on a another stroke. Claire added: 'When I had the stroke the doctors told my family I had a 90 per cent chance of dying. 'For ages afterwards I didn’t want anyone even mentioning that fact as it was too scary for me to take it in. 'Now I don’t mind so much as it makes me realise I was strong and that I did get through it. 'They have told me I may never get the feeling back in my left side but I don’t want to give up. 'On the plus side they don’t feel I’m at risk of having further strokes.' Claire was diagnosed with epilepsy when she was 19, but says she not thinks it was due to the aneurysm. Mr Gibbs, who has given up his job running his own eBay company to care full time for Claire and Kara added: 'We have been through a lot but we are lucky. Claire is alive and Kara is perfect.' Claire added: 'My situation is quite unusual and I was lucky. I now want to make sure more people know that anyone can have a stroke, it is not just something that happens to old people. A stroke changes your life. Even simple, but important things, like picking up my baby or opening a bottle can’t be done with one hand. 'I’m so grateful to the Stroke Association for the support, advice and information they gave me and my partner to adjust to life after my stroke. Michelle my co-ordinator has been just wonderful.' Anil Ranchod from the Stroke Association said: 'Our Life After Stroke campaign is about ensuring stroke survivors like Claire receive the support they need when they return home. 'Too many stroke survivors have told us they ‘feel of abandoned’ and ‘have to fight for ongoing support’. We want to make sure every stroke survivor can make their best possible recovery.' The Stroke Association has provided Mrs Gibbs with support throughout her ordeal.

Difficult: Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, said: 'This is still a very difficult time for Royal Mail' Stamps are 'incredible' value for money - . even after next week's price rise of at least 30 per cent, Royal Mail's . chief executive said today. Moya Greene defended the steep hike in cost - up from 46p to 60p for first class and 36p to 50p for second class - saying they would still be half the price of posting letters in France. The prices were some of the lowest in Europe and had not kept pace with inflation, and the core business was still losing money, she said. The announcement of the huge increase, the biggest since 1975, prompted a stampede, with one customer ordering 10,000 second-class as panic buying spread. Royal Mail even rationed stamps, prompting growing anger. However, Ms Greene - whose total pay for her first nine months, including her salary, . bonus (of £142,000), benefits and pension, was reported last year to be £777,611 - told the annual conference of the Communication Workers Union that the company faces a 'spiral of decline' unless conditions are imposed on competitors planning to deliver post. Ms Greene voiced strong concerns about the impact of unregulated competition, which the Royal Mail believes poses a huge risk to the six-day-a-week, one-price-goes-anywhere universal service. She became the first Royal Mail chief executive to address the annual conference, warning that competition for so-called end-to-end deliveries is an 'immediate threat'. Rival firm TNT has launched a trial delivery service in west London following a previous trial in Liverpool, saying it wanted to roll out a broader service. Rising: The price of stamps is to go up next week from 46p to 60p for first class and 36p to 50p for second class . Ms Greene told today's conference in Bournemouth: 'I am fearful that competition, if it does not have conditions imposed, will soon begin a spiral of decline in Royal Mail that will be very difficult to staunch.' She warned the union that Royal Mail faced 'hard years' ahead, highlighting fears that if firms were able to compete in the more profitable parts of the business, other parts would become more expensive to service. Ms Greene said Royal Mail had become an 'easy target' for criticism as she urged people to stop treating the company as a 'spectator sport'. She told delegates that when she took over from previous chief executive Adam Crozier 21 months ago, Royal Mail was effectively bankrupt and had to operate under a regulatory regime under which there was 'no way' it could be successful. The firm was cash negative, pensions were in jeopardy and officials were telling her it could run out of cash within four months. 'It was scary,' she said, detailing some of the changes that have been made in recent years, including the loss of 5,400 jobs last year, taking the total to 50,000 in the past decade. Sorted: But the daily postbag is now less than 60 million compared with 84 million in 2006 . 'This is still a very difficult time for Royal Mail. This is a great company which has struggled for over a decade from chronic under-investment.' Ms Greene added that at a time of 'economic turmoil' in the country, with fewer letters being posted, it was 'amazing' that the regulatory regime was allowing increases in the capacity for sorting post. In a question and answer session later, Ms Greene faced anger over the planned privatisation of Royal Mail, with one delegate saying private firms would only be interested in profits, rather than quality of service or the pay and conditions of workers. Ms Greene said Royal Mail needed a lot of capital in the next five years and questioned the success of the company being owned by the Government. 'I am not sure that Government ownership has been as great as you think it might have been,' she said, pointing out the level of job losses and regulatory regime she believes has held back the company. She added that many parts of the Government do not even use Royal Mail. Government ownership was not a panacea for future success, she told delegates, continuing: 'If we do not beat the competitors, we will not be successful, regardless of who owns the company. 'We need profits to continue to have good, secure employment and all the technology we need to be a successful company.' 'It's . clear that the more delivery work which is done by private companies, . the less there will be for Royal Mail, and core services could suffer . with higher prices and lower service standards. 'We . don't want a race to the bottom in the postal industry - we want . secure, quality jobs with recognised trade union representation. 'Competition . and privatisation bring uncertainty for everyone in the industry, as . the pursuit of profit comes before services to the public.' Dave Ward, Communication Workers Union . She was questioned about the threatened closure of a mail centre in Gloucestershire, where 450 workers are based, but replied that she could not give any guarantees because of falling mail volumes. The amount of mail posted has fallen by 25 per cent in the past five years, with the daily postbag now less than 60 million compared with 84 million in 2006. Ms Greene received polite applause from delegates to her speech. Royal Mail has warned that TNT's pilot service underlines the fact that competitors can 'cherry-pick' the most profitable, high population density routes, leaving Royal Mail to deliver to unprofitable areas. The move also raises the prospect of competitors being allowed to deliver fewer than six days a week, said Royal Mail. Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: 'TNT's end-to-end deliveries are the obvious next step in postal competition, but we fear this could lead to downgrading of services and jobs across the industry. 'We share many of Royal Mail's concerns about how this will affect the universal service and deliveries for everyone. 'It's clear that the more delivery work which is done by private companies, the less there will be for Royal Mail, and core services could suffer with higher prices and lower service standards. 'We don't want a race to the bottom in the postal industry - we want secure, quality jobs with recognised trade union representation. 'Competition and privatisation bring uncertainty for everyone in the industry, as the pursuit of profit comes before services to the public.' A TNT spokesman said: 'We want to be part of a UK postal industry that is world-class and people can be proud of. 'There is independent research that has concluded, where competition takes place in end-to-end delivery it has improved the overall performance of the universal service provider. 'TNT Post is committed to creating jobs and providing innovation and quality services in the UK, working within an increasingly competitive postal market, with an increasingly efficient Royal Mail.'","Moya Greene warns the company faces a 'spiral of decline'

Surface-to-air missiles may be stationed on top of flats as the last line of defence against a suicide jet targeting this summer’s Olympic Games. Soldiers would take over the roof of a converted factory which is home to 700 residents and has commanding views of the Olympic Park. From there, they could use a multi-million-pound laser-guided system developed for modern warzones to shoot down a helicopter attack or suicide bombers piloting an aircraft. Vantage point: Overlooking the Olympic Stadium, the flats (circled) where the missiles may be deployed . Launch site: The Army will station soldiers and high-velocity surface-to-air missiles on this residential block in Bow Quarter, East London, to ward off airborne terror threats . The range of the missiles is 3.4miles, which means they could reach St Paul’s Cathedral, Canary Wharf or parts of the North Circular from the flats in Bow, East London. But the short range raised fears that dozens could be killed by falling wreckage if a target is hit. The move is one of the final links in a defensive ring of steel around the Games. HMS Ocean, the largest ship in the Royal Navy, will anchor in the Thames to serve as a floating base for more than 800 marines. Last line of defence: Starstreak short-range missiles . Typhoon jets and helicopters will . patrol the skies as a 23,000-strong force of security guards, including . soldiers, bolsters up to 12,000 police officers on duty. News . of the missile system comes just three days after an operation to deal . with a suspected suicide bomber in Central London showcased the . intimidating array of weaponry held by police in the run up to the . Games. For the Olympics, a team of ten soldiers, protected by police, will operate the Starstreak missile system from the top of a former Edwardian water tower in Bow, 900 yards from the edge of the Olympic Park. The building forms part of a Grade II-listed gated redevelopment of the former Bryant and May match factory, where homes sell for up to £350,000. Leaflets were delivered to the 700 residents at the weekend telling them the missiles would be used only as a last resort. The Ministry of Defence said the presence of a military team and police protection around the clock will make them safer. Soldiers will deploy to the building next week during a full dress rehearsal of Olympic security, but the missile system will be loaded only with dummies. If it is given the go-ahead, the Starstreak system will be in position for up to two months during the Games, which start in July. Resident Brian Whelan, 28, said his suspicions were raised when he saw soldiers examining the water tower a few weeks ago. He said: ‘I don’t think in a democracy the military go round occupying private property and turning it into a military base without communicating with people.’ Local MP Rushanara Ali said she would be raising the matter in Parliament tomorrow. She said it was ‘unprecedented’ for missiles to be placed on residential buildings, adding: ‘This is a heavily built-up area. There has been no consultation – people have been told that this is what is likely to happen and people are very worried.’ The MoD said no final decision had been made on the missile deployment.","Soldiers would take over the roof of a converted factory .

Ms Kepley was grateful for the snow after some of her family's wheat never got enough moisture to sprout last season.

The 58-year-old has been told that due to congestive heart failure, liver failure and kidney failure, he may not make it to 60 unless he loses at least 140lbs and soon.

Home-cooked meal: Michael Hebranko, the world's most famous yo-yo dieter has been told he has to lose at least 140lbs if he can expect to survive his heart, liver and kidney failure . Over the past 24 years, the New Yorker has gained and lost a total of 4,004lbs on account of his excessive eating habits and currently weighs 588lbs - only half of his personal record of 1,120lbs. In a candid interview, the morbidly obese husband and father confessed: 'I know eating is killing me. I am a food addict, just like an alcoholic or a heroin addict. 'I've been told all my life if I kept eating I wouldn't make it to the age of 60. Now that birthday is just two years away and doctors don't think I'll make it.'

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao today warned that the country needs to embrace democracy and make urgent political reforms. Mr Wen said that the changes are needed to prevent China's economy from faltering and to spread wealth more evenly. He vowed to use his last year in power to attack mounting discontent that he warned could end in chaos - and may even see a new Cultural Revolution. Call for change: Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao today warned that the country needs to embrace democracy and make urgent political reforms . The reference was to the tumultuous period between 1966 and 1976 when Chairman Mao Zedong persecuted members of his own Communist Party in a desperate bid to reimpose his iron rule. In a three-hour news conference, his sole such event of the year, Mr Wen said: 'A historical tragedy like the Cultural Revolution could occur again. Each party member and cadre should feel a sense of urgency.' Mr Wen renewed a call for unspecified political reforms, particularly of the Communist Party leadership, saying that without them China's hard-won prosperity might fizzle. The Cultural Revolution, also known by its full title of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, took place in China between 1966 and 1976. It was set in motion by Chairman Mao Zedong (pictured) of the Communist Party in May 1966 to combat what he saw as corrosive Western influences. This was done by removing cultural, capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society. The revolution saw Mao regain his iron rule, but affected the country both economically and socially. 'Revisionists' suspected of trying to filter Western elements into Chinese society were removed through violence. It is estimated that up to 1.5million people were killed during the struggle, although a true figure will never be known. Roughly the same number suffered permanent injuries. The tumultuous period ended following Mao's death in 1976. He said: 'Reform has reached a critical stage. Without the success of political reform, economic reforms cannot be carried out. The results that we have achieved may be lost.' No democratic firebrand, Mr Wen has issued similarly vague pleas before - and become a popular if lone voice among senior leaders by doing so. This time his tone was more emphatic, as was the setting. The news conference was his last scheduled briefing before the prim 69-year-old steps down in a year after a decade in office. He said he is 'seized by a strong sense of responsibility' to speak out and referred repeatedly to the judgement of history. The recurring references to the past and the wistful, reflective tone turned the premier's news conference into something of a swan song for the most popular member of the usually remote leadership. Sometimes called 'Grandpa Wen', he comes across as warm and caring. He has been shown eating dumplings with coal miners and consoling survivors of the devastating Sichuan earthquake and other disasters. As the number three in the party leadership who is primarily responsible for the economy, Mr Wen fielded a range of questions, from local government debt to currency reform. He offered Chinese funding of U.S. infrastructure projects to create American jobs and rebalance lopsided economic ties with a crucial trading partner. He sidestepped a question asking his views of the democratic uprisings in parts of the Arab world. Mr Wen sounded resolute on government . efforts to deflate a property bubble, saying 'home prices in China are . far from coming back to a reasonable level'. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets swooned, bucking the trend in markets elsewhere buoyed by strong Wall Street gains. Sometimes called 'Grandpa Wen', the premier comes across as warm and caring. He made his comments during a three-hour news conference in Beijing . Mr Wen, President Hu Jintao and most of the leadership are stepping down to hew to unwritten rules of succession and make way for younger leaders. The turnover always invites divisive infighting that the party prefers to keep under wraps. He retires next year along with President Hu Jintao after a decade in power which has seen China grow to become the world's second-biggest economy, but which is likely to see 2012 deliver the slowest rate of annual growth during their leadership. A reflective Mr Wen said: 'Due to my incompetent abilities and institutional and other factors, there is still much room for improvement in my work. 'I should assume responsibility for the problems that have occurred in China's economy and society during my term in office for which I feel truly sorry.'","Wen Jiabao vows to use his last year in power to attack mounting discontent he says could end in chaos .

A girl aged nine suffered a fractured skull in a horrific accident yesterday when she veered off a ski slope ‘like a rocket’ and smashed into a hut. India Furness lost control on an icy slope and crashed through a safety net and a wooden fence before hurtling through the hut’s window. She was airlifted to hospital in a coma but regained consciousness and doctors said her injuries were severe but not life-threatening. Crash landing:The girl flew through this ski hut window after losing control on the slopes . An emergency medic said she was . travelling at about 30mph but her  helmet probably saved her life in the . terrifying crash on Austria’s highest mountain, the Grossglockner. India was on the second day of a . family holiday in the Tyrolean resort of Goldried, near Innsbruck, with . her parents and two older sisters. The family were skiing together when . the accident happened. Officials said the family, from Cerne . Abbas, Dorset, were on a steep ‘black’ piste – the most difficult ski . rating – when India appeared to lose control. The schoolgirl hurtled down the slope . and careered into the disused wooden cabin, smashing through the . first-floor window and across the room before coming to a halt on the . far side of the hut, 16ft from the shattered window. Her parents and . sisters raced to her side and her father Nigel, 50,  a landscape . designer, and mother Helen, 45, a caterer, called rescuers from the . slope. Medics found the child slumped . unconscious against the hut wall. She was taken to Innsbruck University . Hospital, where she was last night in intensive care. Dr Wolfgang Kratzer, who treated her . in the helicopter, said: ‘Judging by how far she was inside the hut, she . was going way too fast. She must have flown through the window like a . rocket.’ Rescue: The child was airlifted to hospital in Innsbruck by this helicopter . He added: ‘She would have been . travelling at at least 50km per hour [30mph]. She has  woken from her . coma and the prognosis is good. There are no signs of brain injury. ‘She was very lucky. She had good . equipment. Her ski  helmet saved her life.’ Officials said the family . were competent skiers but icy conditions had made the slope particularly . difficult.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley (pictured) risks igniting another row in the sector after documents revealed he is backing plans to pay less to NHS workers in poorer parts of the country . Andrew Lansley is risking a new row with the unions after supporting lower pay for thousands of NHS staff who live in poorer parts of the country. The Health Secretary wants nurses, midwives, porters, cleaners and paramedics to receive different pay packets dependent on where they live. More expensive house prices and other factors would mean NHS staff would be paid more in the south east than in the north and the midlands. Official documents prepared by the Department of Health show that the only exemptions would be managers working in new bodies established to deliver Mr Lansley’s reform programme. Chancellor George Osborne raised the issue of regional pay bargaining before the Budget, but senior Lib Dems opposed it. Mr Lansley’s submission to the NHS pay review body called for a national basic pay rate at a ‘minimum level necessary’, and forsupplements in particular regions. This would help the private sector in depressed areas compete for workers with the public sector. ‘Current rates of pay in the NHS do vary geographically, but significantly less so than the pay of comparable staff in the private sector,’ the submission says. ‘The introduction of more sensitive market-facing pay would therefore enable more efficient and effective use of NHS funds. Nurses, midwives, hospital porters, cleaners and paramedics would receive a lower paycheck under the proposals if they work in the Midlands or the north, compared with their counterparts in southern counties . ‘While the NHS pay premium is relatively high, there is the potential for private sector enterprise to be crowded out with adverse impact on the prospects for local economic growth.’ But senior Lib Dem backbencher John Pugh said: ‘Not content with cementing the divisions between the north and south, Andrew’s proposals harden the divisions between the well-paid and the rest. This demonstrates his continuing, unfortunate talent for alienating the people he needs to rely on most: NHS staff. ‘Regional pay proposals and the blinkered ideology that underpins it remains a red line for many Lib Dem MPs and risk provoking an enduring, embittering standoff within the coalition which will profit no one.’ Lib Dem MP John Pugh (pictured), co-chair of the party's parliamentary policy committee on health and social care, said the plans will further widen the divide between north and south, well-paid and the rest . And Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison, the largest health union, said: ‘For a government that says it wants to cut paperwork, introducing regional pay would be a massively expensive, bureaucratic nightmare, designed to cause huge disruption and conflict.’ Commenting on the proposals, the Department of Health said: 'Our evidence shows how more market-facing pay could help employers make better use of the NHS pay bill. 'It makes clear that  there is a compelling case for implementing market facing pay for all Agenda and Change staff in England, whether they fulfil a support role, work in admin or work on the front line, such as nurses and other clinical staff. 'The principle of equal pay applies to all staff across the entire country.'","Front line staff would be affected in Lansley's pay proposals .

Lurking deep in a dark crevice of an old museum, this nightmarish creature has been biding its time, hiding among other strange reptiles, bones and killer sea creatures. The ghoulish 100-year-old fruit bat is just one of thousands of unusual specimens to be shown to the public for the first time at The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. To celebrate its bicentenary this year, curators at the nation’s oldest natural history museum are bringing the public into the labyrinthine museum’s normally off-limits nooks and crannies for daily tours. Ghoulish: A fruit bat that hung from trees in India over a hundred years ago will be viewed by some visitors to the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia . Strange specimen: The fruit bat is just one of the hundreds of weird and wonderful creatures in the museum's collection . Visitors will be able to see a preserved Indian python, trays of perfectly-kept hummingbirds a horrifying Hellbender salamander. They may even spot a polar bear skeleton, an extinct Caribbean Monk Seal - or boxes of beautiful shells that when alive can kill a human. ‘This is a rare opportunity to get a firsthand look at some of the most stunning, and sometimes bizarre, creatures you've ever seen,’ said Academy President and Chief Executive Officer George Gephart Jr. ‘We can't wait to open our doors and show off nature's, and the Academy's, wondrous bounty.’ The museum’s collection contains some 18 million specimens representing all manner of animal, vegetable and mineral. Its many historic collections even include Thomas Jefferson's fossils. The Academy will . highlight a different part of its collection each month starting with . minerals in April and ending with fossils in February 2013. Other months . will focus on birds, fish, insects, mollusks, amphibians and reptiles, . plants and mammals. An . accompanying exhibition, ‘The Academy at 200: The Nature of Discovery,’ puts dozens of the academy's show-stopping treasures on public display – . many for the first time – and highlights research that museum . scientists are conducting worldwide on hot topics of climate change, . biodiversity, water quality and invasive species. The tours, exhibit and other events in the coming year aim to shift some focus from the museum's storied past to its present and future. Slithery: The museum's Hellbender salamander is one of thousands of strange specimens visitors may have never - and never wanted to have - seen . Preserved for posterity: An Indian python coiled up and kept in the museum's archives for the edification of future generations . As in the natural world, the axiom . ‘adapt or die’ applies to the Academy, which like many museums has . struggled in the past decade with a shrinking endowment and greater . competition for philanthropic dollars. While founded in 1812, the museum continues to stay relevant with scientists conducting groundbreaking research into avian flu in Vietnam, testing streams in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale gas drilling region and examining oysters for environmental fallout of the Gulf oil spill. Others are developing pain medicine from cone snail toxin and examining whether biofuels can be developed from the wood-digesting enzymes of ship worms. Ancient artifacts: Dozens of treasures from the natural world are already on display at the Academy of Natural Sciences . As species continue to become extinct, the images and specimens preserved in the Academy's collections will become even more crucial, said Doug Wechsler, head of the museum's Visual Resources for Ornithology (VIREO), the world's most comprehensive collection of bird photographs with 150,000 images and growing. ‘There's enough here to keep us busy for a very long time,’ said malacology collections manager Paul Callomon.

David Cameron was last night accused of handing Alex Salmond a huge propaganda coup – by giving Scotland an independent web address. The Mail on Sunday has learnt Coalition Ministers have privately approved plans to let Scotland end its website names with ‘.scot’. The move will allow official bodies and website owners to ditch the traditional ‘.uk’ address. Plans to let Wales go it alone with ‘.wales’ and ‘.cymru’ have also been given the green light. Breaking away: Alex Salmond (pictured) has been handed a huge propaganda coup by David Cameron after the PM gave Scotland an independent web address . But last night, the proposals sparked a backlash from English Tory MPs who accused the Prime Minister of caving in to campaigners wanting to break up the UK. Yorkshire MP Andrew Percy said: ‘Scotland hasn’t even voted yet on whether to go independent and all this is doing is giving First Minister Alex Salmond’s Nationalists a huge propaganda coup.’ Mr Percy said it was ‘nonsense’ to create new web addresses to rival ‘.uk’ – especially ahead of the planned referendum in which Scottish voters will decide whether they want to break away from the Union. However, the Government is expected to argue that the ‘.scot’ move is nothing to do with that. A Whitehall source said: ‘We’re also proposing to allow the creation of a .london address which Boris Johnson has backed.’ Campaigners in Scotland have been arguing for years that the country should have its own internet domain – and Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond has endorsed the plan. He said: ‘The time is ripe for the worldwide family of Scots to have their own domain, reflecting an online community defined by a shared commitment to Scottish identity, culture and economic promotion.’ Campaigners in Scotland have been arguing for years that the country should have its own internet domain (file pic) Alex Neil, the SNP cabinet secretary for infrastructure, said recently: ‘There is strong demand for a “.scot” domain and I am sure the UK Government will want to support us.’ Last night, a well-placed Whitehall source said the Coalition had now agreed it had no objection to ‘.scot’. Formal applications to create the new national domains are now expected to  be submitted within weeks. However, in a sign of tension behind the scenes, Ministers intend to block official bodies from using the address ‘gov.scot’. The Mail on Sunday understands Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan also initially insisted Wales kept ‘.uk.’ for fear of it being seen as a boost to nationalists.

David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and Boris Johnson are backing the campaign to rename the tower housing Big Ben the Elizabeth Tower, to honour the Queen’s six decades on the throne. The Daily Mail yesterday revealed cross-party calls for Parliament to mirror a tribute bestowed in 1860 on Queen  Victoria, the only other monarch in history to mark a  Diamond Jubilee. The square tower at the south-west end of the Palace of Westminster, previously known as The King’s Tower, was renamed The Victoria Tower to mark her long reign. Tribute: The tower, seen looming over the Palace of Westminster from London's Westminster Bridge, was named in honour of Queen Victoria in 1860 . Senior figures from all three main . parties are calling for the Clock Tower, the official name for the tower . which houses the famous bell nicknamed Big Ben, to be called the . Elizabeth Tower. Around the world the 316-foot tower has become one of the most well-known symbols of London and the United Kingdom. MPs accept it will continue to be known colloquially as Big Ben, but say the tower itself should carry the present Queen’s name in perpetuity. ‘It’s a really great idea and would be a fitting tribute,’ the Prime Minister told the Mail. Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg said: ‘The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee is an occasion that the whole country is keen to celebrate, and Members of Parliament are no exception. Address: The Queen last visited the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday. Above, Prince Philip looks on as she delivers her speech in Westminster Hall . 'I think the idea is an excellent one and I hope the House does so.’ Labour leader Mr Miliband said: ‘I want to give my wholehearted support to this idea. It’s a great way of recognising the amazing service the Queen has given to the country.’ London Mayor Mr Johnson agreed the capital’s most celebrated landmark should be  associated with the Queen forever. He said: ‘This is an excellent way of honouring Her Majesty, who is arguably this country’s longest serving Parliamentarian, having opened Parliament 56 times at the last count and signed into law over 3,500 bills.’ Parliamentary private secretary at the Foreign Office Tobias Ellwood, the MP who proposed the idea, said he was delighted by the support. He said: ‘Victoria became the mother of the nation in the same way that the Queen has. I believe the idea of a similar tribute to the Queen will be welcomed by MPs across Parliament and people across the nation.’ Commons Leader Sir George Young will next week raise the idea with the House of Commons Commission, which oversees the running of the Commons. He added: ‘This is an imaginative and timely proposal from Tobias.’ Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: ‘Our current Queen has celebrated so many years as our successful Monarch that the idea of renaming the Clock Tower as the Elizabeth Tower is an inspired one. It will command a lot of public support and affection.’ Anti-monarchy group Republic struck the only dissenting note, saying: ‘The idea you’re going to turn a major feature of our Parliament into a tribute to an unelected, unaccountable head of state stands against everything democracy’s about.’ But Liberal Democrat grandee Sir Alan Beith, a former member of the Commission, said: ‘The Queen’s dedication for 60 years has been a tremendous support to Parliament and the constitutional monarchy. ‘She has never let us down and it would be fitting to honour her service with a landmark to British democracy.’","Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and Boris Johnson are also backing the campaign ."

The four-year-old boy who went missing at an Arkansas Boy Scout camp over the weekend has been found dead, his family confirmed. A search team in a canoe spotted Caleb Linn's body in a tributary of the Spring River, according to the Fulton County Sheriff's office. Caleb went missing Saturday at the 900-acre Kia Kima Scout Reservation near Hardy, Ark. Searchers in boats and on horseback, foot and four-wheelers scoured the valley for days before finding two shirts he had been wearing in the river on Tuesday afternoon. His body was found less than 24 hours later. Found: Caleb Linn, four, had been missing since Saturday from a boy scout camp in Arkansas . 'As long as we have each other, it's OK,' said Caleb's uncle, Chris Bruner. Authorities narrowed their focus to . the water late Tuesday and called off the ground search for Caleb. He . had gone with his aunt and several other children to help clear storm . debris from a bridge at the camp that his aunt was looking after while . the regular caretaker was away. When five of the children left to go . back to the cabins around lunchtime, Caleb asked if he could follow. His . aunt told him he could, but that he had to stick to the road, Fulton . County Sheriff Buck Foley said. The last she saw of him before she . turned around to resume her work, he said, was Caleb standing at the end . of the bridge. Hundreds of volunteers turned out to . help in the search, and divers cleared debris and stuck an underwater . camera beneath the bridge and under ledges where they couldn't get a . clear view. Dry and unseasonably warm weather had lent hope to Caleb's . chances of survival. Even after searchers found the shirts he was . wearing the day he disappeared, Caleb's great-grandmother held out hope . someone would find him alive. 'Just because they found the clothes doesn't mean we give up hope,' Carolyn Truex said Tuesday evening. Tragic discovery: Caleb Linn, four, was in the company of an aunt and uncle when he ran after older boys in his group to catch up and disappeared - his body has been found . Wooded area: The four-year-old boy was with family helping at a clean-up project on a bridge near the Kia Kima Boy Scout Camp in Fulton County . Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill . Sadler said searchers found Caleb's body in the river about a half-mile . from the bridge where the boy was last seen. His body was to be sent to . the state crime lab. Family members, including Bruner, had . fought their way along sandy trails and through thorny branches that . would snap back with a thwack as they searched for Caleb on Tuesday. Another uncle, Joey Dawson, even swam to a small island in the middle of . the river, just in case Caleb had gotten stranded there. Caleb's mom and stepdad had travelled . from their home in Springdale, 150 miles west of Hardy, and have been . staying at one of the cabins while searchers looked for the boy. Shortly after searchers found Caleb's . body, his family started to grieve near the bridge where he was last . seen. Bruner says they'll likely bring his body back to northwest . Arkansas for a funeral there. In the meantime, a memorial fund has been . set up to help Caleb's family pay for his funeral. 'We have a little bit of money, but it's nothing like what he deserves,' Bruner said. 'We'll do what we can with what we have.'","Caleb Linn's body was found in a river, his family confirmed .

But now great swathes of Linda’s Wood in Somerset have had to be cut down because of a deadly disease that is sweeping the country. The trees were victims of Phytophthora ramorum, or sudden oak death, which is infecting thousands of hectares of forests across the UK. Ravaged: Linda's Wood in Somerset, where all the larch trees have been chopped down because of a deadly disease . It affects larch trees in particular, although it can jump species and is also infecting other trees including the Douglas fir. All of the larch trees in the memorial wood have been cut down, leaving expanses of empty land. The former Beatle planted hundreds of trees in remembrance of Linda when she died of breast cancer in 1998, aged 56. The wood borders a 100-acre nature sanctuary called St John’s Wood, which the couple bought together in 1990. Memorial: Sir Paul McCartney planted the wood in tribute to his late wife, Linda, who died in 1998 . Joe Duckworth of the League Against Cruel Sports, which runs the woodland area, told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘Some of them were diseased and it was decided that the larch would be chopped down as a preventative measure.' He added that a number of the species are being felled in the area. The disease, for which there is no known cure, has destroyed millions of trees in America and is spreading across the UK, possibly after being brought over in imported plants. Linda’s Wood was dedicated to Linda McCartney in a ceremony in 1998, where children laid posies of flowers and the Salvation Army played music by Wings, the band in which both Paul and Linda were members. Working together: Paul and Linda McCartney (top right) were both members of the band Wings . Dedicated: Sir Paul and Linda McCartney in 1982. The couple were married for 29 years . The forest has since been managed by the League Against Cruel Sports, as part of its deer sanctuary.

Brave: Chris Taylor from Lancashire will be the first man to take on the London marathon with a defibrillator implant under his skin . A man with a rare genetic disorder will be the first to complete the London marathon with a built-in defibrillator that will zap him back to life if his heart stops mid-race. Chris Taylor nearly died when he went into cardiac arrest suddenly last year. Since then he has worn a small heart-shocking device implanted under his skin similar to footballer Fabrice Muamba’s. Chris, 23, was born with a condition which means the walls of his heart are sponge-like instead of ‘compact’ like a normal heart. It means that at any time he could suffer another arrest and must limit his physical activity at all times. But despite his potentially deadly condition, Chris has pledged to take on the 26-mile challenge on April 22 in the hope of raising thousands for the British Heart Foundation. His case comes just weeks after Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba dramatically collapsed on the pitch suffering from a similar heart condition. Muamba was technically 'dead' for 78 minutes after collapsing during the FA Cup tie at Tottenham last month, but was released from hospital on Monday after being fitted with a defibrillator implant. Chris, from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, said: 'I heard about it after it had happened and watched it back afterwards. 'I saw the paramedics shocking him and it was very close to home for me. 'I can’t remember how long my own heart stopped for, but seeing the Muamba incident makes you remember being in that position. Determined: Chris Taylor in training for his London marathon bid . 'It’s one of the reasons that I’m so determined to complete the marathon because I want to raise awareness of heart conditions such as his and mine.' Chris was diagnosed with the condition, called left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy, at 15 after a series of MRI scans. His a genetic illness so rare that at that time only a handful of cases had been discovered. His father Tommy, 48, an airline pilot, carries the faulty gene and had also passed the condition on to Chris’s sister, Vicky, 24, a trainee solicitor. High-tech: The device and how it sits under the skin . Chris decided to become a school teacher and started a two year course in geography. But just four months into his first year, he suffered a sudden cardiac arrest while lying on his bed. He was rushed to hospital and spent four nights at the Heart Attack Centre at Staffordshire University Hospital. There doctors gave him three options: do nothing, have a heart monitor fitted or have a high-tech subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fitted under his arm. The implant would not only monitor his heart but would also shock him back to life if he ever suffered another cardiac arrest in the future. After discussing it with his family, Chris opted for the implant as he was terrified of suffering another cardiac arrest. Chris Taylor (front left) as a child with his family wearing his grandad's marathon medal . Chris said: 'It’s an extremely rare condition and the medical understanding of it is changing all the time. 'I wanted to do something that would help raise of awareness of my condition and others like it.' Despite the limitations of his condition, Chris has always been fit and had long wanted to complete the London marathon like his granddad, an accomplished runner. He applied for the race through the British Heart Foundation charity and when he was accepted he discovered he would be the first to complete it while wearing a defibrillator implant. Chris said: 'Doing the marathon is my way of showing people that heart conditions don’t necessarily have to hold you back. 'I won’t be able to run a lot of it because of my medication but I’m still hoping to do it in about six hours. 'And although I know it’s unlikely, I know the implant is there as a safety net if the worst comes to the worst.' To sponsor Chris visit www.justgiving.com/christaylormarathon.

Jeremy Darroch, chief executive of BSkyB requested that an article about a controversial deal be removed from the Sky News website . The chief executive of British Sky Broadcasting ordered Sky News to remove a story from its website about a controversial Formula 1 deal following complaints from racing teams. Martin Turner, executive producer of Sky Sports' new F1 channel contacted his boss Jeremy Darroch from Melbourne on Sunday ahead of the Australian Grand Prix, it was claimed. The broadcaster spent tens of millions of pounds securing the rights to jointly show most of this season's races live with the BBC, as well as a number of exclusive races. The channel was due to air its first F1 broadcast but there had been a strong negative reaction from some racing teams that Mr Turner relayed to Mr Darroch. The story outlined an deal being struck between Bernie Ecclestone, F1's chief executive, Red Bull and Ferrari. Mr Darroch ordered for the article to be taken down and John Ryley, head of Sky News started a review of the story, according to the Financial Times. The article was republished but parts were missing including a direct quote from confidential documents. A spokesman from BSkyB said: 'The piece was withdrawn for further review.  We stand by the story and, following that review, took the decision to re-publish on Monday.' A source added: 'Really it was a question about how we published the story rather than when. Sky Sports new F1 channel was due to air its first Grand Prix in Grand Prix (pictured) the day after the article was first published . 'We should have made Sky Sports teams aware because they were in the pits and were getting a reaction late on Saturday night.' The source declined to comment further on whether the news arm of BSkyB should cow-tow to demands from other branches of the organisation. Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation . withdrew its BSkyB takeover bid of Sky News as the phone-hacking scandal . erupted after questions were raised over whether it was right to buy . the rest of the broadcaster. The story outlined an deal being struck between Bernie Ecclestone, F1's chief executive (pictured, Red Bull, and Ferrari. Ofcom said it would launch an investigation into News Corp to see whether it was 'fit and proper' for such a takeover and what whether it would affect the diversity of the UK news industry. The documents appeared to show that an agreement had been made between Bernie Ecclestone and CVC, the company that owns F1's commercial rights, and racing teams Ferrari and Red Bull. Sky News reporter Mark Kleinman said in his blog that 'Goldman Sachs had been asked by CVC to examine plans for a placement of part of its stake in F1 potentially as soon as the next few months, which would form part of a process leading to an initial public offering of the business'. In the papers he had been handed, he said that Ferrari could buy a share in CVC because it had competed in the most seasons since 1959. The FT said that seven of the 12 teams that take part in Formula 1 met on Sunday to co-ordinate a response to the report. Mr Ecclestone and CVC have negotiated separate deals with Red Bulll and Ferrari,  sources told the paper, as part of an obligation to divide revenues with all teams until 2020.","Broadcaster spent millions securing rights to show live races starting with season opener in Melbourne .

An OAP 'nightmare neighbour' has been evicted after she threw her china plates at her 83-year-old neighbour. Violet Skinner, 77, waged an eight-year campaign of harassment against Joseph Doyle and his wife Ragnfrid, 78, and tried to use a garden hose to soak their beloved hardwood floors. In a fit of anger the pensioner even hurled her best Royal Worcester dinner plates at the couple. Violet Skinner, 77, (pictured) threatened to turn a hose on Joseph Doyle and his wife Ragnfrid, 78, and even hurled her best Royal Worcester dinner plates at him . In the past Mrs Skinner has been hauled before the courts for trashing her neighbours fence and screaming abuse at them when she was 'paralytic’ on home-brewed 'hooch'. The same year the neighbours almost came to blows when Mrs Skinner threw stones at Mr Doyle’s car when he complained about her noisy cockerel. The pensioner, who lives alone with four cats, has also been accused of assaulting police officers and council staff. Yesterday the retired horticulturalist who denies any wrong doing, was told she has just 28 days to pack her things and move out of her bungalow, in Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire. Father-of-five Mr Doyle described his relief at learning his nuisance neighbour was finally being forced to leave - as Mrs Skinner threatened to move into a camper van on their street. He said: 'It’s been an absolute nightmare - I feel sorry for her and have some sympathy for a woman of her age being evicted but she brought it on herself. Violet Skinner (pictured) was told she has just 28 days to pack her things and move out of her bungalow, in Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire . 'I don’t know anybody in the world who could live next door to her.' Mrs Doyle said: 'I’m so happy - I’ve got no pity for her, no sympathy, I just can’t wait until the day when she is gone.' The feud started when Mrs Skinner moved next door to Mr and Mrs Doyle in 2004, after the trio had started out as friends. But rows over snide comments, damage to their partition fence and Mrs Skinner’s noisy cockerel soured their relationship. In 2009 Cambridge Magistrates’ Court heard Skinner threatened to kill Mr Doyle and threw stones at his car after a dispute. Mr Doyle told the court Skinner aimed a hose at him and his wife as they left their house in a bid to soak their hardwood floors. Skinner denied it, but was found guilty of criminal damage by magistrates. South Cambridgeshire District Council say Skinner has even assaulted police and local authority workers. Leafy: Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire, where Skinner has been given 28 days to leave her bungalow . A council spokesman said: 'Mrs Skinner has a substantial and serious history of anti-social behaviour, including damage and physical attacks on her neighbours, our staff and the police'. Skinner still denies any wrongdoing and says the decision to evict her willforce her to have to live in a camper van. She said: 'It’s wicked and evil because none of what is said is true and none of it is my fault but I’m the one with the blame and who has to get out.' At Skinner’s court appearance for criminal damage inflicted on her neighbours’ fence, in 2009, magistrates heard she had made false accusations to police about the Doyles more than 50 times in five years. The court heard angry Mrs Skinner had chopped branches off a tree in her garden and shoved them through his garden trellis - ruining it. That evening, Mrs Skinner then hurled Royal Worcester dinner plates over the garden fence and smashed them against the Doyles’ house, Mr Doyle claimed. He described life next door to Mrs Skinner as 'terrible, absolutely dreadful'and said his wife, Ragnfrid, had become a 'nervous wreck' because she was frightened of Skinner. Mrs Skinner denied any aggression against Mr Doyle and also denied criminal damage. She told the court: 'For some reason he hates me. All he ever does all daylong is to see how he can rile me.' She claimed Mr Doyle had once said to her: 'I see you haven’t paid your bills recently. 'I see you’re still taking the ugly pills.' Magistrates found Mrs Skinner guilty of criminal damage, handing her a 12-month conditional discharge and £100 costs. Bizarrely the relationship had started as a friendship, with Mr Doyle’s wife,Ragnfrid, helping Mrs Skinner after a hospital stay. Mrs Skinner has previously said: 'I do like him. I just wish he could be afriend again.'","Violet Skinner tried to use a garden hose to soak her neighbours' wooden floors .

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 17:57 EST, 26 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:04 EST, 27 March 2012 . Going up: Royal Mail is to be given the freedom to set its own prices for first-class stamps . The price of a first-class stamp will leap by a third to 60p next month. The 14p rise was announced by Royal Mail on the very day it was handed the power to set its own stamp prices for the first time in its 172-year history. A second-class stamp, currently 36p, will jump to 50p, a rise of 39 per cent. By comparison, most workers pay is either frozen or rising at less than 2 per cent a year. Royal Mail will be able to continue to raise its prices as often – and by as much – as it likes after postal regulator Ofcom did away with current price controls. The only protection, which will last for just seven years, is a ‘safeguard cap’ on the price of a second-class stamp, large second-class letters and small packages weighing up to 2kg. Ofcom said Royal Mail cannot charge more than 55p for a second class stamp this year. This ‘cap’ will be increased with the cost of living each year until 2020. The latest price rises, which will come into effect on April 30 were widely criticised yesterday. The increases in the price of stamps followed a decision by regulator Ofcom to give Royal Mail the freedom to set its own prices . Phil Orford, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, said: ‘Effectively, this is a licence for Royal Mail to print money.’ He warned that a first-class stamp ‘without limit’ will simply become ‘unaffordable’ for many customers, such as small firms. The details of other safeguards have not been decided, and will not come into effect until April 2013. When the seven-year safeguard ends, there will be no caps on any of Royal Mail’s services unless Ofcom decides another cap is necessary. Royal Mail boss Moya Greene yesterday insisted she had ‘no option’ but to increase prices to protect the crucial ‘universal service obligation’. This is the promise to collect and deliver letters six days a week, and allow people to send a letter for the same price anywhere from the Cornish coast to the Scottish islands. Ofcom’s 251-page report, published yesterday, acknowledged the ‘critical role in the cohesion of society’ played by this ‘fundamentally important’ service. Miss Greene refused to rule out the prospect of multiple price rises each year . Robert Hammond, director of postal policy at Consumer Focus, warned of ‘a fine line between being willing to pay more and deciding to walk away from using the postal service’. Stuart McIntosh, of Ofcom, said Royal Mail has been hit by people being more likely to send an email, a text message, a Tweet and so on, than to post a letter. He said: ‘If you are thinking about communicating with somebody... the last thing you are going to do is to sit down and write them a letter.’ The Greeting Card Association said Britons send more cards than anybody else in the world. A typical adult sends 31 each year. The scale of other price rises is high. For example, the cost of a one-month ‘redirection’ service, if you move house, will jump from £8 to £12.50, a 56 per cent increase. The Communication Workers’ Union said the price rises were the latest ploy to prepare the company for privatisation next year. Last week, the firm’s pension fund was handed to taxpayers, leaving them to pay £37.5billion of ‘pension promises’ to its workers, but handing over assets of only £28billion. A Department for Business spokesman said: ‘Price rises are never welcome, but ministers are clear that the top priority is to protect the universal service on which people rely.’","30% and 39% price rise for first and second class .

Three men who were mown down and killed during last year's riots were lured into the middle of the road by a gang seconds before a car deliberately ploughed into them from behind, a court heard today. Brothers Shazad Ali, 30, Abdul Musavir, 31, and their friend Haroon Jahan, 20, died after a Mazda drove at a crowd of men protecting homes and businesses from looters. They were flung 10ft into the air after they were hit by the speeding car in Winson Green, Birmingham, on August 10 last year. Court sketch : (Top row, left to right) Joshua Ellis Donald, 27-years-old, Aaron Joseph Parkins, Ian Klim Beckford, 30-years-old and Everton Dwight Graham, 30-years-old, (bottom row, left to right), Adam King, 24-years-old, Ryan Goodwin, 21-years-old, Shaun Flynn, 26-years-old, Juan Pablo Ruiz-Gaviria, 31-years-old . Their brutal deaths came at the height of the summer disorder which rocked Britain. Eight men aged between 18 and 30 are each charged with three counts of murder. Birmingham Crown Court heard the gang . split up into three cars as part of a 'concerted plan' to ambush the . group of 100 Asian males who were standing guard by a Jet petrol station . on August 10. Tim Spencer QC, prosecuting, said tension in the Winson Green had been ratcheted up between gangs of youths driving in vehicles, looking for . places to raid or loot and a crowd had gathered to try and protect . businesses. Mr Spencer said the defendants had been . in three cars, a Mazda an Audi and a Fiesta. The court heard how the gang . signalled to each other for the Audi to slowly drive past the crowd and . shout racial abuse at them calling them 'Pakis' in order to draw as many of them into the . middle of the road. Seconds later the Fiesta accelerated . towards the men alongside the Mazda which ploughed into the group while . most of the men were not looking. Mr Spencer told the . jury: 'Had it not been for the Audi and Fiesta the crowd would not have . been in that part of the road, available for the Mazda to hit. Horrifying: Jurors watched CCTV footage of the fatal impact, which clearly shows Haroon Jahan (left), Shazad Ali (centre) and Abdul Musavir (right) being flung into the air after they were hit by the car on Dudley Road . 'They would have been either on the pavement or closer to the pavement and the safety of the pavement and forecourt provided. 'Had they not done what they did, those in the crowd, particularly those in the road, would have been more aware of the oncoming third car, the Mazda, more aware of the danger it presented and better able to try and get out of the way. 'That is why we say these three cars were driving together in a concerted plan. 'The prosecution don’t know how or when the plan was finalised. They [the defendants] knew the role that was expected of them.' Hearing: The court heard all eight defendants were allegedly in the three cars at the time of the incident . Premeditated: The court heard how the gang signalled . to each other for the Audi to slowly drive past the crowd . Haroon Jahan’s mother Tahira Yasmin covered . her face with her hands in the public gallery as the horrific CCTV of . the fatal collision was played to the jury. On the first day of the trial violent . scenes erupted in the public gallery as the 15-second film showed the impact of the crash was so violent that the Mazda’s bonnet flipped up and the nearside headlight was smashed. Mr Spencer told the court the Audi, . containing King, Goodwin, Flynn and Ruiz-Gaviria, stayed behind to . chillingly watch the reaction of the crowd following the death smash. He added: 'The actions of the Audi must have been deliberate. Grieving: Tariq Jahan pictured the morning after his son Haroon Jahan was killed after being struck by a car . Famous words: After the three men died Tarmiq Jahan (at the microphone), gave an impassioned speech in Summerfield Park, Birmingham, asking for the violence to stop . 'It must have known that the cars behind it were going to see something that they wanted to watch, to observe. 'You see all the three key vehicles . in this case just after impact and we say that picture paints the point . probably better than I can - as to the co-ordinated nature of this . driving. 'They were all in it together, each had a role to perform.' The Mazda was later torched in a bid to destroy evidence, the court was told. Joshua Donald, 27, Aaron Parkins, 18, . Adam King, 24, Ian Beckford, 30, Everton Graham, 30, Ryan Goodwin, 21, . Juan Ruiz-Gaviria, 31, and Shaun Flynn, 26, all from Birmingham, all . deny three counts of murder. Distressing viewing: Haroon Jahan's mother Tahira Yasmin covered her face with her hands in the public gallery as the horrific CCTV of the fatal collision was played to the jury at Birmingham Crown Court . Yesterday when footage was shown some relatives fled the courtroom while others sobbed as the 15-second clip showed one of the men somersault through the air. The court heard how tensions between the different communities in multicultural Birmingham had become particularly inflamed during the riots. Prosecutor Timothy Spencer QC had earlier warned the nine women and three men of the jury to ‘prepare to be shocked’ by the ‘shocking’ footage. As the moment of impact was replayed on flatscreens around the courtroom, some in the public gallery gasped in horror, while others became embroiled in an angry exchange which led to the case being temporarily halted.

Karilyn Bales told Matt Lauer this morning that her husband, Staff Sargent Robert Bales, is 'very brave, very courageous'. The Washington state woman said her husband joined the Army after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, to 'protect his family, friends and country. He wanted to do his part'.

She told Matt Lauer: 'I have no idea what happened, but he would not ... he loves children, and he would not do that' Officials say Staff Sargent Bales . wandered off base in southern Afghanistan earlier this month and killed . eight Afghan adults and nine children. The wife of the Joint Base Lewis-McChord soldier said the accusations are 'unbelievable to me'. She . said her husband had no nightmares or any other signs of PTSD, and says . she didn't ask him about the accusations when she spoke to him on the . phone. 'He seemed a . bit confused as to where he was or why he was there,' she said. 'I don't . think I'll have to ask him. I think he'll tell me.' When asked what kind of a dad her husband is to their two children - . a girl named Quincy, four, and a boy named Bobby, three - she said: . 'He's a very involved father. He loves children, he's like a big kid . himself.' ‘I have no idea what happened, but he would not ... he loves children, and he would not do that.’ She . said she was in the grocery store when she heard the news and prayed it . wasn't her husband. She soon received a call from officials who broke . the news. Money worries: Robert Bales (right) allegedly conned a pensioner out of his life savings before going into the army . 'They held my hand and just said that…they thought that he had left the base and perhaps killed the Afghan civilian,' she said. 'That was the only sentence and I just started crying. I just don't think he was involved.' When asked if she would change her mind if an official came forward and said: 'Yes he turned himself in, he did this', she replied: 'I don't think anything will change my mind in believing he did not do this, this is not what it appears to be.' He was formally charged on Friday with 17 counts of premeditated murder and six counts each of . attempted murder and assault. He could face the death penalty if convicted. According to Afghan officials, the 17th fatality was the unborn child of one of the victims. The U.S. paid $50,000 in compensation for each villager killed and $11,000 for each person wounded in a shooting rampage allegedly carried out by a rogue American soldier in southern Afghanistan, Afghan officials said yesterday. The families were told that the money came from President Barack Obama. The unusually large payouts were the latest move by the White House to mend relations with the Afghan people after the killings threatened to shatter already tense relations. These were further heightened today after a gunman in an Afghan army uniform shot dead two British troops inside a base in southern Afghanistan. The attack in Lashkar Gar appeared to be the latest in a string of 'green on blue' attacks in which Afghan security forces have turned on their international colleagues or mentors. A NATO source confirmed the victims were British. Karilyn with her husband: They have two young children together and she said he is an involved dad who 'loves kids' Robert Bales faces the death penalty after being charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder . U.S. investigators have said they believe Bales killed in two episodes, returning to his base after the first attack and later slipping away to kill again. He is reported to have surrendered without a struggle. The 38-year-old married father-of-two from Lake Tapps, Washington, is being held at a U.S. military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Karilyn Bales, also 38, has spoken to her husband by telephone twice since he was detained. The soldier called his wife first from overseas shortly after massacre, and then last week from Fort Leavenworth where the two talked about family matters and 'reaffirmed their love for each other,’ said her attorney, Lance Rosen. She once worked for Washington Mutual, the giant Seattle-based mortgage lender, according to her LinkedIn.com profile. She is now working for Amaxra, a business communications company in Redmond, Washington, as an associate technical project manager.

Oracle yesterday accused Google in court of knowingly stealing a key piece of technology to build into the search giant's Android smartphone operating system. Michael Jacobs, for Oracle, drew an unflattering portrait of Google's top executives regard for intellectual property in a battle over the mind-numbing minutiae of computer coding. 'We will prove to you from beginning to end ... that Google knew it was using someone else's property,' Mr Jacobs told the San Francisco, California court. Key witnesses: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison (left) and Google CEO Larry Page (right) are expected to testify in the early stages of the eight-week trial . The showdown centres on allegations . that Android infringes on the patents and copyrights of Java, a . programming technology that Sun Microsystems began developing 20 years . ago. Oracle, a business software maker . based in Redwood Shores, acquired the rights to Java when it bought Sun . Microsystems for $7.3billion (£4.6billion) in January 2010. Google, the Mountain View, . California-based Internet search leader, has steadfastly denied Oracle's . allegations since the lawsuit was filed seven months after the Sun deal . closed. The impasse has left it to a 12-member jury to resolve the dispute in a trial scheduled to last as long as 10 weeks. U.S. District Judge William Alsup . devoted most of yesterday's session to picking the jury, leaving only . enough time for Oracle to lay out the framework for its case. Oracle is seeking hundreds of millions . of dollars in damages and an injunction to force Google to pay . licensing fees or find an alternative to Java to keep its Android system . running. At one point in the lawsuit, Oracle estimated it might be owed as much as $6.1billion (£3.8billion). But Judge Alsup has whittled the case . down in a way that has substantially lowered the size of the potential . payout if Google loses. In a sign of how far apart the two . sides are, Google last month said it would be willing to pay $2.8million . (£1.8million) plus a tiny percentage of its future revenue if the jury . decides Android infringed on two Java patents. Google hasn't publicly estimated what . it thinks its liability might be if the jury decides Android violates, . as Oracle alleges, 37 Java programming copyrights. The copyright disagreement - the most . important point of the case - will be covered in the first phase of the . trial followed by the patent dispute. If necessary, a third phase will be devoted to how much money Google owes Oracle. Search giant: A Google logo is displayed behind the head of its Android robot mascot. The smartphone system forms a significant part of the $38billion-a-year business . Much of the evidence presented during . the trial will delve into highly technical matters likely to only be . comprehensible to programming geeks and patent-law specialists. However, there may be dramatic . interludes that lift a veil on the inner workings of two of the world's . most influential technology companies. The intrigue will include testimony . from the two companies' multibillionaire CEOs, Oracle's Larry Ellison . and Google's Larry Page. Oracle indicated yesterday that it could call Mr Ellison to the stand as early as today. Several other Silicon Valley . luminaries, including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and former Sun . Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz, are also on the list of potential . witnesses. Mr Jacobs focused much of his opening . statement on excerpts from internal emails suggesting Google knew it . needed to pay licensing fees to use some of the Java technology that . went into Android, a project that began in earnest in 2005 when Google . bought a startup run by Andy Rubin. The first phone running on Android . didn't go on sale until October 2008, about 15 months before Oracle . bought Sun Microsystems and stepped up the attempts to make Google pay . up for the Java technology. Dispute: A screenshot of Google's Android software, which Oracle claims infringes on its copyrights . Oracle cited an October 2005 email . from Mr Rubin to Mr Page as an early sign that Google realised it . probably would have to pay Sun for using Java in Android. Mr Rubin wrote: 'My proposal is that we take a license that specifically grants the right for us to Open Source our product.' Mr Jacobs pointed to a May 2006 email . from Mr Schmidt to Mr Rubin as an indication Google knew it might need . to find other solutions for Android if an agreement with Sun was not . reached. 'How are we doing on the Sun deal?' Mr . Schmidt asked in his message. 'Its (sic) it time to develop a non-Java . solution to avoid dealing with them?' By August 2010, Google still hadn't . been able to find any satisfactory alternatives to Java, according to an . email from Google engineer Tim Lindholm to Mr Rubin. 'We have been over a bunch of these, . and think they all suck,' wrote Mr Lindholm, who worked at Sun . Microsystems before joining Google. 'We conclude that we need to negotiate a license for Java under the terms we need.' The lack of a licensing agreement . ultimately didn't deter Google, Mr Jacobs told the jury, because the . company realised it needed a mobile software system to preserve its . digital search-and-advertising empire as more sophisticated phones . enabled people to surf the Internet away from their desktop computers. Java provided Google with a . springboard into mobile computing because 6million software programmers . were already familiar with the technology and could easily create . applications that would run on Android, Mr Jacobs said. Although Google doesn't charge device . makers to use Android, the company makes money from some of the mobile . advertising and mobile applications sold on the system. Google has said its mobile advertising . revenue now exceeds $2.5billion, but it hasn't specified how much of . that money comes from Android-powered devices.","Oracle alleges that Google chiefs knowingly stole its intellectual property while developing mobile OS .

One former U.S service member alleges she was raped by a fellow cadet and then forced to take out her attacker’s trash as punishment for reporting the assault to the military school. Another service member claims she was raped twice by two fellow students at the Naval Academy in Annapolis and then made to drop out after she told an army counselor about the attacks. These women are the latest in a string of former and current U.S service members who are suing military officials for systematically ignoring a 'staggering' number of sexual assaults. Naval Academy in Annapolis: Two women who said they were raped while attending U.S. military academies sued military officials on Friday, accusing them of failing to address widespread problems of sexual assault at the elite schools . Lawsuit: Leah Marquet, a former cadet at the Military Academy in West Point, said she was pressured by upperclassmen to get drunk and raped by a fellow student while she was intoxicated . In the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, Leah Marquet, 20, and Anne Kendzior, 22, said the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland and the Army's United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, tolerate sexual assault and discourage victims of attacks from reporting them. 'Both institutions systematically and repeatedly ignore rampant sexual harassment,' the lawsuit filed by the two women stated. 'Both institutions have a history of failing to prosecute and punish those students found to have sexually assaulted and raped their fellow students.' In the lawsuit, Marquet, a former West Point cadet, said she was pressured by upperclassmen to get drunk and raped by a fellow student while she was intoxicated. After she reported the assault, other students taunted her, the lawsuit said, and the school punished her for reporting the incident by forcing her to take out her alleged rapist’s trash. Systematic: Eight former and current U.S service members are suing military officials for systematically ignoring a 'staggering' number of sexual assaults (file photo) She quit West Point after becoming suicidal, the documents claimed. Kendzior, . who entered the Naval Academy in 2008, said she was raped twice by two . different fellow students, both times while she was drunk. Kendzior accused the Naval Academy of forcing her to leave after she reported the rapes to an academy counselor. The . suit accused former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and four other . military officials of failing to implement steps to fight sexual . assaults at the schools. The suit seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages. U.S. Navy Commander William Marks, a Naval Academy spokesman, declined comment on the lawsuit itself, but said the academy takes every report of alleged sexual assault 'extremely seriously' and that its 'sexual assault response and advocacy program is among the strongest in the nation.' Claims: Former Marine Corps officer Ariana Klay claims she was raped at the U.S. Marine Barracks in Washington D.C., one of the most prestigious bases in the country . Fighter: Ariana Klay served a tour in Iraq before returning to Annapolis, where the rape occurred at the hand of her superior officer . Dress: After speaking publicly, Ms Klay was harassed by other Marines saying she 'asked for it' because she wore makeup and occasionally running shorts . Officials at West Point said they . could not comment on pending litigation, but that the school takes . sexual harassment issues 'very seriously.' 'Every . unrestricted report of sexual assault is thoroughly investigated, the . results of the investigation are reviewed by legal experts and . appropriate action taken,' said Lt. Col. Sherri K. Reed, the academy's . spokesperson. Officials at the Pentagon had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. Last month, eight other women filed a lawsuit in federal court in Washington saying they were raped, assaulted or sexually harassed while in the military, and were retaliated against when they complained.

His father-in-law was allegedly overheard blabbing loudly about his son-in-law's political dealings in a crowded New York restaurant last week. Geithner, 50, was apparently in line to become president of Ivy League college Dartmouth - with President Obama clearing the way by nominating current leader Jim Yong Kim for the top post at the World Bank last month. Plotting a move? Obama nominated Dartmouth College president Jim Yong Kim (left) as World Bank president last month - allegedly clearing the way so current Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner (right) could take up the role . The revelations came straight from the mouth of Albert Sonnenfeld, a food critic whose daughter Carole is married to Geithner. The announcement was made by Mr Sonnenfeld at Bar Boulud, an upmarket eatery in midtown Manhattan, where diners sit together at communal tables to enjoy French bistro style food. According to the New York Post, Mr Sonnenfeld identified himself as Geithner's father-in-law before making the remarks within earshot of strangers, saying he would be leaving his state department role at the end of the year. He said: 'That’s why Obama nominated [Kim] for the World Bank - so that there’d be an opening. 'They offered him the presidency of Dartmouth. But now he doesn’t want it. He wants something else.' He also let slip that his daughter Carole despised entertaining Republicans in Washington, adding: 'Can you imagine having to entertain John Boehner and his wife, with his fake tan?'

It is one of the most enduring mysteries of the 20th century - the fate of American aviator Amelia Earhart who went missing without a trace over the South Pacific. Now, 75 years on, efforts to solve the riddle have been given fresh impetus after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the government's support for a new $500,000 hunt to find her plane. Clinton was due to meet with historians and scientists from The International Group for Historic (IGHAR) Aircraft Recovery today as they make plans for a trip to suspected crash site in July. Enduring riddle: American avirator Amelia Earhart, posing by her plane in Long Beach, California, in 1930, disappeared while flying over the Pacific in 1937 . Salvage bid: This graphic shows the journey Earhart had intended to make between Papua New Guinea and Howard Island in 1937. Some believe the plane wreck lies off Buka Island, but this latest search will focus on Nikumaroro island, where bones suspected of belonging to the aviator were found in 2010 . The wreckage of the Lockheed Electra . is believed to lie off the remote island of Nikumaroro, in what is now . the Pacific nation of Kiribati. Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan . disappeared on July 2, 1937, while travelling from Lae, in New Guinea, . to Howland Island during her bid to become the first woman to fly around . the world. The group believes Earhart and Noonan . may have managed to land on the island, then known as Gardner Island, . and survived for a short time. Other historians believe they crashed into the ocean. But conspiracy theories, including . claims that they were U.S. government agents captured by the Japanese . before World War II, abound despite having been largely debunked. Wading in: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (left) is offering her support to a private salvage team which is planning to search the location where Earhart if believed to have crashed . Intrigue: In her day, Earhart was extremely popular, but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive more than 75 years later . Conspiracy? There have been many theories behind what happened to Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan . Numerous attempts to find the . wreckage have failed. Last year, divers in Bougainville, Papua New . Guinea, said they were convinced they fouind the wreckage on Buka . Island, some 400 miles from Lae. But this new search focuses on Nikumaroro, which lies another 1,800 miles further east. One senior U.S. official said new . analysis of a contemporary photo of a portion of the island shows what . some people believe could be a strut and wheel of the plane protruding . from the water. Suspicions were also aroused when IGHAR found bone fragments thought to belong to Earhart on the island in 2010. Though tests to identify them proved inconclusive. The administration takes no position on the purported evidence and acknowledges there is fierce debate on the subject. The expedition, a joint public and . private venture, will coincide with the 75th anniversary of Earhart's . departure on the ill-fated attempt to become the first woman to fly . around the world. Previous visits to the island by the . group have recovered artifacts that could have belonged to Earhart and . Noonan and suggest they might have lived for days or weeks after landing . on a reef. State Department officials say . Clinton will use Tuesday's event to lend her high profile to the search . while also lauding Earhart's legacy as a pioneer for women and a model . of American courage. She will also note the Obama administration's keen interest in the Pacific. Nikumaroro Island where finger bones were found in 2010 that were thought to belong to Amelia Earhart . The 'event will underscore America's . spirit of adventure and courage, as embodied by Amelia Earhart, and our . commitment to seizing new opportunities for cooperation with Pacific . neighbors founded on the United States' long history of engagement in . the Asia-Pacific region,' the department said in a statement. The State Department and other U.S. government agencies supported Earhart and her goal. The State Department . obtained flight clearances from the countries in which she stopped and . coordinated the search effort with foreign governments. The most widely accepted theory is that the aeroplane ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven. Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for serveral months until they succumbed to injury or disease. Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island. A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press. A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale. An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip. The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity. A woman fron New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.","Team to search for plane wreck off remote Pacific island of Nikumaroro .

Authorities said they are working quickly to clean up the ‘vehicular carnage,’ adding that an accident involving this much currency is rare. ‘It is rather unique in the fact that such a sizable amount of Canadian currency is strewn about a collision,’ South Porcupine community services officer Const. Marc Depatie to CTV News. He said that passers-by have not been tempted to help themselves to a few extra dollars. ‘We are going to be using magnets and other less sophisticated means of collecting the cargo.’ Vehicular carnage: Cardboard boxes, metal, and coins litter the highway . He told cbc.ca that the rock ‘acted as a can opener,’ effectively peeled the side of the truck back, allowing coins to catapult onto the highway. A police constable at the clean-up Wednesday said like he was walking ‘on a carpet of loonies and toonies.’ According to the Ontario Provincial Police, the coins will be sent to a secure location once they are all collected. The coins were freshly minted and were due to be circulated. Watch video here: .","Brinks truck carrying new Canadian currency crashed into rock, spilling between $3m to $5m in coins across highway .

"By . Nick Pisa . PUBLISHED: . 17:31 EST, 30 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:33 EST, 30 April 2012 . Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is accused of abuse of office and paying 17-year-old prostitute for sex . Silvio Berlusconi told girls coming to his house for a bunga bunga party that he wanted a 'calmer evening' as the night before he had been he had been 'mad for it.' The former Italian prime minister, 75, was taped as he spoke to Marystell Polanco, 31, and Aris Espinosa, 22, after they telephoned him and asked if they could 'come and visit him tonight' with two other women. The conversations form part of more than 50,000 calls that were taped by prosecutors as part of the ongoing bunga bunga trial in which the politician is accused of paying a minor for sex. It was posted on the website of . Italian newspaper La Repubblica and opens with Aris talking to . Berlusconi and calling him in a cooing voice 'my little puppy,' before . asking if she had disturbed him, with Berlusconi telling her: 'I had . some important meetings but I have dealt with them. They are all . finished. How can I help you.' After . some small talk she passes the receiver to Marystell who says: 'Hi - . did you get the message yesterday that I couldn't make it?' To which . Berlusconi answers jokingly: 'Yes - they told me you didn't give a f*** . about me and that you had other more important and interesting things to . do, more sexually exciting.' Marystell . then adds laughing that she will be coming along that evening to . Berlusconi's home with the girls including sultry Venezuela beauty queen . Aida Yespica, 29, the former girlfriend of singer Craig David. Berlusconi . is heard saying: 'Tell Aida though that tonight won't be anything . special - last night we were all mad for it. I am shattered. So tonight . we will have a tranquil dinner and listen to some music, I don't want to . be the main player.' Prosecutors say that in total 33 women were regular guests at the parties Berlusconi threw at his villa in Arcore near Milan between September 2010 and May 2011 and they were paid with cash, jewellery and cars. Witnesses have told the hearing in Milan that women dressed as nuns or wore AC Milan football shirts, before performing sultry stripteases and pole dances for Berlusconi as he looked on in the basement of the villa. The charges against Berlusconi relate to Karima Keyek, nicknamed Ruby, who was 17 at the time of the alleged offences . Among those who attended was belly dancer Karima El Mahroug, who also goes by the name Ruby the Heartstealer and who was just 17 at the time and therefore a minor. In Italy the legal age of consent is 14 but paying a woman under the age of 18 for sex is seen as prostitution with a minor, although both she and Berlusconi insist that nothing untoward happened. The conversation with Marystell would also appear to be at odds with another defence made by Berlusconi, who quit as prime minister in November last year, that '33 girls is too many for any man'. In an interview last year when the allegations first surfaced he said: '... even though I am a bit of a mischievous... 33 girls in two months is too many, even for a thirty year old. It's too many for anybody.' While in another conversation Berlusconi tells Marystell that Aris is 'naughty, naughty naughty' before she passes the telephone to Aris who tells Berlusconi that he is the 'very, very, very naughty one'. He then says: 'I am in a very tough war but when I win it I will take advantage of your sweet beautiful lips.' The bunga bunga trial is due to resume on May 7 Friday. The age of consent in Italy is 14 but paying a woman under 18 is seen as child prostitution and besides this allegation Berlusconi is also accused of abuse of office with prosecutors claiming he tried to cover up for Miss El Mahroug when she was arrested on a theft charge. He is said to have knowingly and wrongly told police in Milan two years ago, that the teenager was related to the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and should be freed so as to avoid a diplomatic incident. The sex charge carries a maximum sentence of three years while abuse of office is punishable with 12 years in jail. The trial started last year and is not expected to finish until 2013 at the earliest with hundreds of witnesses due to testify including George Clooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.",75-year-old Italian PM accused of abuse of office and paying 17-year-old prostitute for sex .

Damning: Lord Tebitt accused the Prime Minister of relying on advisers 'without any experience or much understanding of the party or indeed politics' David Cameron and George Osborne were . accused of running a ‘government by chums’ yesterday as they faced a . series of  highly personal attacks from within the Tory party. Former party chairman Lord Tebbit . said the Prime Minister and Chancellor relied too much on advisers who . lack ‘experience or much understanding of the party or politics’. And he warned that Downing Street’s . ‘cash for access’ row and the fuel strike panic had reinforced the view . that Mr Cameron was ‘born to privilege’. Growing numbers of disgruntled . Conservative MPs have also accused the Prime Minister and Mr Osborne of . being out of touch with the party and Tory voters. Stewart Jackson, a former . parliamentary private secretary, said there was concern ‘that the . Government is being run by a clique’ and called for more people with . ‘principles and integrity’. The influential 1922 Committee of . Tory backbenchers has warned Mr Cameron he needs to make major changes . to the way he runs his Government. The attacks follow simmering internal . rows within the party over issues such as taxes on pensioners and . pasties, gay marriage, the fuel crisis and the axing of child benefit. The Prime Minister’s personal rating – . the difference between the number of voters who think he is doing a . good job and those who do not – plunged to -27 in the latest YouGov . poll. Writing in The Times, Lord Tebbit . said Mr Cameron’s carefully orchestrated public relations photo . opportunities such as cycling to work, and not wearing a tie to black . tie dinners, will not make voters forget his background of wealth and . privilege. Accused of being out of touch: David Cameron and George Osborne . He added that senior figures in  the . Tory Party ‘had their paths lubricated with money from cradle to school, . to university and on through public relations and Westminster village . bag-carrying’. Lord Tebbit said: ‘After another week . of hasty, ill-thought-through policy initiatives and the calls to hoard . petrol, many Conservatives are questioning this style of government by . chums.’ He described Andrew Feldman, . co-chairman of the Tory party and  a university contemporary of  the . Prime Minister, as another  ‘Cameron chum’. Mr Osborne is also under mounting . pressure from Tory backbenchers following his widely criticised handling . of the Budget. Nadine Dorries, a former nurse, attacked him for being . out of touch with working-class voters, saying: ‘At the root of much of . the catastrophe we have become is George Osborne. He drives the liberal . elite agenda.’ Unsatisfied: Both Nadine Dorries, left and Mark Pritchard, right, criticised George Osborne and David Cameron . Scandal: Disgraced Peter Cruddas , pictured left with Prime Minister David Cameron MP, was forced to resign over his 'cash-for-access' boasts . In an apparent reference to the . feuding between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, she took to Twitter to add: . ‘History is teaching us that when you have a Chancellor who is more . interested in becoming Prime Minister, he messes up.’ Criticising Mr Osborne’s . ‘self-appointed’ dual role as Chancellor and head of Conservative . political strategy, she said: ‘It’s about influence controlling . outcomes, not letting others shine ensuring own succession.’ Mr Jackson said: ‘David Cameron would . do well to take on board the criticism. The tone and tenor of his . leadership is in danger of sending the wrong signal to Middle England . voters. We need less Lords reform and gay marriage and more reducing . taxes for ordinary voters, giving small business a leg-up and telling . the EU courts where to go on Abu Qatada. ‘People are very concerned that the . Government is being run by a clique. We need more authentic voices and . less teenage scribblers at Number 10. People with life experience, . principles and integrity. We are in danger of becoming obsessed with the . liberal chattering classes who are never going to vote for us.’ Tory MP Mark Reckless warned that the . Coalition had empowered Civil Service ‘Sir Humphreys’ to make policy . decisions and accused Mr Osborne of ignoring backbenchers’ concerns over . the axing of child benefit for high-earners. He said: ‘We have seen a whole raft . of strange Civil Service initiatives rather than the political . leadership the country needs.’ Connected: Peter Cruddas claimed to have direct access to David Cameron on at least 13 occasions - even bankrolling a dinner at the Prime Minister's country retreat of Chequers, pictured . Loyalist Tory MPs hit back at Mr . Cameron’s critics. Charlie Elphicke, an executive member of the 1922 . Committee, said: ‘It is not the Prime Minister who needs to get a grip . but colleagues on the backbenches who need to realise that government is . not a cakewalk.’ Kris Hopkins, another Conservative . MP, warned that his disgruntled colleagues risked ‘compromising’ the . party. He said: ‘There should be constant challenge to the leadership, . it shouldn’t start from the position of dislike for the Prime Minister.’ But Tory MP Mark Pritchard said Mr . Cameron should hold an early reshuffle to promote more ministers from . state schools and working-class homes ‘to make the government a little . less foie gras and a little more fish and chips’.

"By . Graham Smith . UPDATED: . 10:27 EST, 26 April 2012 . Jailed: Jeremy Bamber is taken away by police after his murder trial in 1986. His latest appeal bid was rejected today . Jeremy Bamber’s convictions for murdering five of his relatives more than 25 years ago will not be referred to the Court of Appeal, officials said today. The notorious inmate, serving a whole life term for the 1985 killings, has always protested his innocence and claims his schizophrenic sister Sheila Caffell shot her family before turning the gun on herself in a remote Essex farmhouse. The Criminal Cases Review Commission said that despite a lengthy and complex investigation, it 'has not identified any evidence or legal argument that it considers capable of raising a real possibility that the Court of Appeal would quash the convictions'. The Commission said this was its final decision in its longest-running case. Bamber’s latest request for an appeal was based on a fresh analysis of three burn marks found on his father and gunshot wounds on his sister which suggested they were not killed with a weapon fitted with a 'moderator', or silencer, which suppresses the sound of a gunshot. His trial in 1986 was told he had shot his family with a weapon fitted with such a device which he had later removed. Giving its reasons in a 109-page statement, the Commission said: 'Matters of pure speculation or unsubstantiated allegation constitute neither new evidence nor new argument capable of giving rise to a real possibility that the Court of Appeal will quash a conviction. Family: Bamber's sister Sheila and her children Daniel and Nicholas were all found to have been killed by him . 'Neither can such a real possibility arise from the accumulation of multiple unsubstantiated allegations. 'The Commission is satisfied that . nothing in the submissions made by and on behalf of Mr Bamber or any . issues raised in the recent documentary can, either individually or . cumulatively, give rise to a real possibility that the Court of Appeal . would find any of Mr Bamber’s convictions to be unsafe.' Bamber was told of the decision in prison today, the Commission confirmed. A spokesman added: 'This is a final decision and brings to a close the Commission’s current longest running case. 'The Commission has given due . consideration to all the submissions made, old and new, before making a . final decision on whether to refer the case to the Court of Appeal.' Adoptive parents Nevill and June, who were shot during the rampage at their farmhouse in Essex. Bamber has always denied murder .

June and Neville, his sister Ms Caffell and her six-year-old twin sons . Daniel and Nicholas at their farmhouse in Tolleshunt D’Arcy, Essex, on . August 7, 1985. He was given a whole life tariff after being convicted of the murders in October 1986. In 2009, Bamber lost a Court of . Appeal challenge against the order that he must die behind bars. He has . twice lost appeals against conviction. His lawyer Simon McKay said his . client was 'very disappointed' and considering applying for a judicial . review of the Commission’s decision.

His lawyer today said he is 'very disappointed but remains determined to carry on the fight to clear his name' 'He is obviously very disappointed but remains determined to carry on the fight to clear his name,' Mr McKay said. 'In my view the Commission have not . applied the proper test for determining whether a case should be . referred back to the Court of Appeal. 'To be clear - four independent and . supremely qualified experts provided opinions that fundamentally . undermined the Crown case against Mr Bamber and the safety of the . convictions. 'The evidence was credible, . inherently believable and gave rise to cogent admissible grounds of . appeal that may have affected the jury’s verdict. 'This is sufficient for the case to . be referred back - whether the conviction is in fact subsequently . quashed is a matter for the Court of Appeal.

"By . Rob Cooper . PUBLISHED: . 05:19 EST, 15 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:47 EST, 15 April 2012 . Attack: Millionaire Lord Fink said that cutting tax relief for donations would discourage people from giving . The Conservative party treasurer turned on George Osborne today in a growing revolt over plans to cut relief on charitable donations. Millionaire Lord Fink, one of the country's most generous supporters of good causes, said the plans would inevitable reduce the value of donations. The tax relief cap, set at 25 per cent of a donor’s income if he or she is giving more than £50,000, is due to come into effect next April. Lord Fink told the Sunday Times: 'If you have to pay out of your capital the tax on your income you give, it will put people off.' As the backlash continued against the policy, announced by Chancellor George Osborne in last month's budget, a group of leading benefactors also warned it would act as 'a brake on philanthropy'. Senior Conservative backbencher Zac Goldsmith said he was 'ashamed' that his party appeared to have 'declared war' on the very people who should be at the heart of the Government's Big Society project. Someone earning £1million will be able to donate £250,000 to charities without paying tax on it. However, any further income given above that threshold will be taxed - reducing the amount good causes receive. Defending the scheme, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was 'not right' that some super-rich individuals were able to exploit the reliefs to cut their income tax bills 'to almost nothing'. 'There's been a lot of controversy about plans to cap charity tax relief. But it is not right that some wealthy individuals can use them without limit to reduce tax bills to close to zero,' he told the Sunday People. 'Tax without friends': George Osborne is under growing pressure to perform a U-turn over plans to cut tax relief on charitable donations . Amid reports that the Treasury was considering alternatives to the £50,000 cap, a spokeswoman said it was in talks with philanthropists to find ways to limit the impact on charities that rely on big donations. 'We support charitable giving and the vast majority of donations will be completely unaffected,' she said. Ed Miliband has said he would be happy to publish his tax return, adding he felt that enhanced transparency was 'inevitable'. But he said limits should be agreed to stop details emerging such as medical records or spouses revealing their tax details. David Cameron and George Osborne have said they are happy to publish their details and would consider making it a requirement for people seeking high office. Mr Miliband said today: 'I'm perfectly happy (to publish). I sort of think it is kind of inevitable it is going to come. 'I challenged David Cameron and George Osborne on the day of the Budget, I said to them do you benefit from the 50p tax cut? I thought a lot about this, whether it was fair to do it. 'The reason I did it was if you're coming along with a Budget which raises taxes on pensioners, raises taxes on working families, raises taxes effectively on charities, if you're personally getting a benefit only a few people are getting, I think it is a fair enough, legitimate question. 'I didn't call for the tax return to be published, but if that's the way things are going I'm perfectly happy to do it.' Critics have questioned why the tax system, rather than a charity sector watchdog, is being used to tackle what the Government says is a problem with bogus charities being used as vehicles by a small number of individuals. Senior Tory MP David Davis told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show it was a 'tax without friends' and said he expected the cap to be dropped and replaced with an alternative method to tackle the issue. The Sunday Telegraph said the main option under consideration was a US-style 'lifetime legacies' system that allowed individuals to 'donate' assets to institutions and charities but continue to benefit from their assets during their lifetime. In a letter to the paper, 46 wealthy donors including members of the Sainsbury family, urged a rethink. 'The proposal in the Budget to cap charity tax reliefs is a brake on philanthropy that may deter future donors. 'It is confusing and dispiriting, and we urge the Prime Minister and chancellor to think again,' they wrote. 'None of us view tax relief as a primary motive, although it may substantially increase our donations. 'But . it is an important signal that the decision to use wealth to help . others, rather than to enrich ourselves, is recognised, encouraged and . supported by society.' Prime . Minister David Cameron said last week that he would listen 'very . sympathetically' to charities concerned that philanthropic giving will . decline as a result of the change. Mr . Goldsmith said: 'I am ashamed that a Conservative Chancellor has not . only announced measures that will undoubtedly depress giving in this . country; he has spun a narrative in which philanthropists are now the . enemy. 'His intention to cap tax relief on donations to charity could well prove to be this Government's single costliest mistake.' Former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy . Ashdown said there was a problem with the very rich selecting charities . to fund in lieu of paying tax for public services. He . told the BBC Andrew Marr programme: 'There is a problem here but it is . simply not open to the kind of simplistic solution that Labour grabs . hold of for opportunistic reasons. Dropped: David Davis MP, pictured on the BBC's Andrew Marr show today, said he expects plans for the charities tax relief cap to be axed . 'I'm president of UNICEF UK, I know exactly how this hits big and small charities. 'But . there is a problem. What is the Government trying to do? It's trying to . make sure the rich pay their taxes and don't dodge them. 'Just . imagine everybody did this, that everybody said I'm not going to pay my . taxes, I'm going to donate to a charity of my choice. 'No taxes - no hospitals, no schools, . no welfare. There is a sensible balance to be struck here. If the . Government has to recalibrate, retreat if you like, to find that balance . that is right and proper they should do so.' Shadow . chief secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'The Government have talked about . some people giving money to dodgy charities. If that's happening then . the Charities Commission need to investigate. 'We've got our major charities, universities, and arts organisations in this country saying it is going to cost them. 'Yes we want to make sure people are paying their fair share of tax but the people who seem to be losing out from this change aren't tax avoiders - it's the charities and people who rely on the charities.' Senior Liberal Democrat Sir Menzies Campbell told the Sky News Murnaghan programme he had written to George Osborne about the impact on charities in his capacity as Chancellor of St Andrew's University. He said: 'The proposals the Chancellor has made could easily hit the kind of targets we need to seek out ourselves in order to persuade people, such as former graduates, to make generous donations. 'The Government is obviously accepting it has got to go back and look at this again. 'Very rich people should pay their fair share of tax and that is why the tax regime, and it's been Liberal Democrat policy, to take the poorest people out of tax altogether. Everyone should pay what they are assessed to pay.'","Millionaire Lord Fink says plan to cut relief will 'put people off' giving to charity .

A real-life Billy Elliot who was paralysed after a street attack has defied doctors by dancing again. Professional ballet star Jack Widdowson, 19, suffered serious spinal injuries last November just two days after a starring stage role. His devastated family rushed to his bedside and doctors feared he would be never be able to dance again after the attack in Cardiff, south Wales. Just 48 hours earlier Jack had . achieved his life-long dream of dancing in a leading role by performing . as Demetrius in Bern's Stadttheater in Switzerland. Now after just five months, Jack has . performed his first jump and has been offered a number of stage roles. He does 120 push ups each night as he battles to get fit again. He will dance in public next month for . the first since being injured in a short performance with the English . National Ballet. Then in June he will take a leading role in a . contemporary dance production. 'There was just something in me saying . ''I am going to dance again''. I really, really want to get back to it. To me, dancing is indescribable. You do it because you love it,' he . told the Sunday Telegraph. The attack on November 5 marked a . dramatic turn of events for Jack. Two nights earlier on November 3 he performed in front of his proud . father, Julian, a doctor. Jack had been an understudy in the . premiere of Ein Winternachtstraum, a reworking of A Midsummer Night's . Dream - but was catapulted into the role of Demetrius after one of the . dancers broke his wrist. Dr Widdowson, 53, texted his wife, Celia, and the happy couple believed that their son would have a glittering career on the stage. Jack and his father flew back to the . UK the following day and went to Cardiff to celebrate the . recent performance with his two  brothers George, 17, and Mark, 21. The stage star, from Farmborough, . north east Somerset, was walking home but became separated from his friends when the incident happened on a . canal path. Back at the family home in Bath, . Somerset, Dr and Mrs Widdowson, were toasting to their son's success . when there was a knock on the door from police. Their joy turned to shock as officers told them there had been an incident in which their son had . been taken to the University Hospital of Wales with serious neck . injuries. The parents, two brothers, and sister . Chloe, now 23, kept a bedside vigil, but they began to plan for what . life would be like for Jack. Their son had no feeling from the neck down and they thought about how they could adapt his computer. Focussed: Jack Widdowson (left) at home with his family last Christmas after recovering sufficiently from an alleged attack which nearly left him paralysed. He is pictured with (left to right) his father Julian, mother Celia and older brother Mark . But Jack was determined that he would dance again. 'Somehow I didn't ever think: ''That's . it, I'm never going to walk again''. I did certainly wonder if I could . return to Switzerland for the next week's performance,' he added. Over the next few months spurred on his attitude Jack slowly regained feelings in his limbs as he underwent physiotherapy. He spent much of the day just trying . to move his wrists but within four weeks was already taking his first . steps and had left hospital in just six weeks.

The Bank of England governor sensationally admitted last night that he failed in his duty to help prevent 'the worst recession since the 1930s' and the implosion of the British banking system. In a landmark speech, Sir Mervyn King said: 'So why, you might ask, did the Bank of England not do more to prevent the disaster? We should have.' He admitted he bitterly regrets that he and his colleagues did not 'shout from the rooftops' about the impending financial disaster – which continues to have crippling consequences for millions. Limited powers: Bank of England Governor Mervyn King (second from right) in Washington on April 21 . In the first radio broadcast by a Bank governor for more than 70 years, Sir Mervyn said he had not been 'blind to what was going on' in the run-up to the crisis, but failed to stop it. After reminding listeners the Bank was stripped of its power to regulate banks when Labour came to power in 1997, he said: 'Our power was limited to that of publishing reports and preaching sermons. 'And we did preach sermons about the risks. But we didn't imagine the scale of the disaster that would occur. 'With the benefit of hindsight, we should have shouted from the rooftops that a system had been built in which banks were too important to fail, that banks had grown too quickly and borrowed too much, and that so-called light-touch regulation hadn't prevented any of this.' Sir Mervyn, who was giving this year's BBC Today Programme Lecture last night, expressed deep sympathy for victims of the crisis. He said the number of people searching for work has rocketed by 'over a million' in Britain to 2.65million. 'To many of you, this will seem deeply unfair,' he said. 'And it is.' Sir Mervyn also attacked some bankers, . who continue to take bonuses while their firms' share price collapses . and dividends are scrapped or slashed. Nearly . £1,000billion of taxpayers' money was used to prop up the banking . system at the worst point of the crisis. Though some institutions fell, . he said 'almost all banks would have failed had not taxpayer support . been extended'. He quoted . the Queen, who asked a professor at the London School of Economics: 'Why . did no one see this coming?' Sir Mervyn said the answer was 'extremely . simple', adding: 'No one believed it could happen. There was a failure . of imagination to appreciate the scale of the fragilities and their . potential consequences.' Failed: The Bank of England and The Royal Exchange, in Threadneedle Street, London . 'No one could quite bring themselves to believe that in our modern financial system the biggest banks in the world could fall over. But they did.' In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Sir Mervyn reinforced his protests that the Bank of England should not accept sole blame for the crisis and that it was a collective failure of a flawed system. He said: 'My main point was not to try and blame anyone. This wasn’t the fault of a few bankers, a few politicians or even a few central banks. This was a failure of a system and I accept our share of responsibility in going along with a system of banking that failed.' He added that reform of regulation and the separation of powers away from one single body was key to averting a similar banking collapse in the future. He said: 'One of the big lessons from the crisis was that the idea of concentrating all kinds of regulation in one regulator didn’t work. And for very good reason which was the people running it were continually under pressure from press, politicians… to focus on things like consumer protection – the Equitable Life crisis and so on. 'And I don’t think it makes sense to worry about the finances of banks in the same organisation as people are doing that kind of regulation. So it’s being separated. And I think that’s important. 'I don’t think any central bank or indeed any finance ministry or regulator feels that they’ve come out well from this because something very wrong happened that’s very clear. 'What we can do and the only thing we can do now is make sure we learn the lessons. And I think in Britain we’ve learned more lessons than most other countries.' Epicentre: Sir Mervyn said the banking crisis which rocked the City of London was the result of failings of bankers, politicians, and central banks . Sir Mervyn also used this follow up interview to his landmark speech to back the Government's ‘textbook response’ to the economic crisis - despite the UK's slide back into recession. He blamed the spike in food and energy prices for growth stalling but in a boost for Chancellor George Osborne insisted there were ‘signs of a recovery’. The UK suffered a shock return to recession after official figures showed the economy shrank in the first quarter of this year, following a contraction in the final three months of 2011. Labour has claimed it is a recession ‘made in Downing Street’, but Sir Mervyn backed the coalition's approach to tackling the budget deficit. ‘The strategy was that there would be a gradual move towards reducing the budget deficit over five years, that there would be an acceptance of the significant fall in sterling of 25per cent and there would be a rebalancing of the economy,’ he said. ‘We had to rebalance our economy because we had a trade deficit. So this was an absolutely textbook response to the situation. ‘If it had not been for the squeeze on real take-home pay being exacerbated by the rise in energy and food prices then I think we would have seen some growth.’ He said there was a ‘patchy picture’ around the country but ‘there are indeed signs of a recovery coming and we see that in the business surveys and I think also in the employment data’. ‘So I think a reasonable view would be that we would start to see steady, slow recovery coming during the course of the year.’ Flaws: Regulators failures to deal with the banking sector's increasingly risky deals helped cause the crash, the Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King said . Explaining his claim there had been no unsustainable boom he told Today: ‘The speed at which the economy as a whole was growing was sustainable and the proof of that was that unemployment was basically constant and that inflation was low and very stable. ‘So there was no sign that the economy was growing too quickly in total or too slowly. ‘What was unsustainable was the balance within it. I have talked many times over the previous 10 years about the fact that we were building up a trade deficit, that this was leading to higher levels of consumption than could be sustained and that at some point this would have to come to an end. ‘But this wasn't a problem that was unique to the UK, this was a reflection of what was going on in the world economy as a whole.’ The new powers being given to the Bank, with the creation of the Financial Policy Committee and the restoration of the responsibility for regulating the sector, would mean problems could be targeted more effectively, he told Today. He urged the Government to introduce the Independent Commission on Banking's proposals to ring-fence banks' investment banking activities from their high street arms. Sir Mervyn compared allowing the two to co-exist without some barrier between them to building 'nuclear power stations in densely populated areas'. Investment banking activities should be kept far away from customers' savings, current accounts and mortgages, he said. ■ Business leaders dashed hopes of quick recovery by predicting zero growth in the current April to June quarter of the year. However, the CBI forecast it would rise to 0.7 per cent in the third quarter followed by 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter.","Bank of England governor said Labour stripped it of its power .
