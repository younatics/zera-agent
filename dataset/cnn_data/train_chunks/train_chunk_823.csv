"By . Graeme Yorke . European champions Real Madrid have been ordered to close part of the Bernabeu for one match after the club was charged for racist behaviour by fans during their Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich in April. 'Following the charge of racist behaviour by Real Madrid supporters during the match (Article 14 of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations), the Control and Disciplinary Body has ordered the partial closure of the Santiago Bernabeu for one match,' UEFA said in a statement. 'More specifically, sectors 120 and 122 of the stadium will be closed for the club's next UEFA competition home game. Real Madrid are obliged to display a banner with the wording ""No to Racism"" in those sectors.' Punishment: Champions League winners Real Madrid will have to close part of their stadium for one game . Unacceptable: The punishment from UEFA relates to the racist behaviour of their fans against Bayern Munich . Real beat Bayern 1-0 in the first leg on their way to a 10th European Cup. Spanish football has been plagued by racist incidents this season, the most high profile involving Barcelona's Dani Alves, who took a bite from a banana thrown at him by a Villarreal fan during a La Liga match in April. Villarreal were fined 12,000 euros (£9,760) by the Spanish federation and the Anti-Violence and Racism in Sport Commission appealed the perceived leniency of the punishment. Levante's Senegal midfielder Papakouli Diop complained of racist abuse from Atletico Madrid supporters this month and fans of Real Betis allegedly directed abuse towards one of their own players in November.","Real Madrid will play one game with a partial stadium closure next season .

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . Carl Froch is a man on death row according to George Groves, who plans to be his public executioner at Wembley in their Battle of Britain. That provocative description of Froch on the eve of their Wembley showdown was just about the only nasty moment of their final media confrontation before they duel for the world super-middleweight championship. Groves is unconcerned that such a remark, in the context of the dangerous old game of prize fighting, might be frowned upon. Winning shot? George Groves has vowed to stop Carl Froch with a left hook at Wembley . Days away: Groves and Froch went head to head on the Wembley pitch after the press conference . Champion: Froch defends his WBA and IBF super middleweight titles at the national stadium in London . Team Groves: The challenger had a huge entourage at Wembley for the final press conference . The fight game is a brutal sport, with two warriors attempting to land the knockout blow. At its best, it can provide epic sporting drama, demanding fitness, skill and bravery. Fighting talk to sell tickets is as old as the Queensbury Rules but why must modern fighters, obsessed with boosting pay-per-view numbers for their television paymasters, resort to such puerile rhetoric? Talk by George Groves that his champion opponent Carl Froch is on ‘death row’ is unedifying and insulting. Groves may be confident. Groves may feel he can win. But this trash talk should have no place in a sporting arena. He is using the language of a loser. He used the analogy to reinforce his belief that the Nottingham Cobra is about to be hit by the enormity of the biggest fight to take place in post-war Britain. Groves says, ‘Hit he will be, by the scale of the event as he comes out and by the left hook with which I predict I will knock him out. ‘He is like a man on death row because he knows what’s coming… his hour of destiny. ’I say everything for a reason. It’s all considered. I don’t worry what people think, that they sometimes mistake my self-confidence for being too cocky. As for me, I’m never nervous before or during a fight. I’m always calm and composed – and even more so now because both Carl and I know that this is a fight he can’t win.’ Froch responded in a less outrageous manner, saying: ‘Yeah, I’m apprehensive but not because of George. This is a huge event in which I want to perform in a way that will show the world what I can do. ‘That’s the pressure on me but I always perform at my best under pressure.’ Game on: Froch and Groves were remarkably calm at the final press conference at Wembley . Favourite: Froch is confident he can defend his two world titles at Wembley on Saturday . Almost there: Froch and Groves faced the media for the final time as they get ready to take to the ring . Groves insists that, for the most part, . he called a halt to the mind games with which he angered and unsettled . Froch before their first fight ‘because I don’t want to upset him . any more’. He added: ‘I want to keep him in a quiet place to think about what’s coming.’ Froch . retorted:  ‘I saw George somewhat subdued and perhaps it’s getting to . him now. He didn’t say a word to me so was unusually quiet. ‘It . can be like that before you go against a great fighter. It was like . that for me when I boxed Jermaine Taylor in America. I was super . confident in the weeks leading up to the fight and then came the main . press conference – like this one – and it suddenly dawned on me what a . terrific champion I was about to face. I was right about that, having to . get off the floor to win by knocking him out in the last minute.’ Groves . did stir the pot a little more by reiterating his opinion of Froch as a . technically deficient boxer and putting some of the blame for that on . his renowned trainer Rob McCracken. He . said: ‘McCracken is a good trainer but Carl ignores his instructions . once the fight warms up and like most boxers reverts to type in a . crisis. I think it’s possible that Rob is so aware of Carl’s reputation . as a warrior who can take shots and still win that he has neglected . working on his technical skills.’ Tight team: Groves claimed Rob McCracken (left) is partly to blame for Froch's deficiencies . Man in the hat: Froch responded by criticising Groves' trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick's professional record . In your corner: Promoter Eddie Hearn (centre) is backing his man Froch to beat Groves for a second time . McCracken . had a distinguished ring career of his own and is also head coach of . the GB boxing team, which he steered to a medal haul at the London . Olympics. Froch was quick to . contrast McCracken’s record of 33 wins against only one defeat in the . course of winning British and Commonwealth titles with the background of . Groves’ trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick. Froch . said: ‘I don’t pay much attention to Paddy Ritzcracker. He . had just five professional fights. And while I respect any man brave . enough to get in the ring, his record is five fights, five defeats, . three of them by the big KO. ‘I . trust Rob absolutely and he is bringing me to this fight, at 36 years . of age, back to the best physical and mental condition I’ve ever been in . my career.’ In rebuttal, of . the Groves predictions of easy victory, Froch said: ‘First it was going . to be three rounds, then it might be five, now it’s going to be the . left hook instead of the big right he knocked me down with in the first . round of our last fight. ‘I don’t listen to his nonsense either.’ Enter the champion: Froch makes his way into the final press conference at Wembley on Thursday . Fighting talk: Groves and Froch are both confident of knocking each other out at the national stadium .

"By . David Tyrer . Southampton and England striker Rickie Lambert looks poised to join his boyhood club Liverpool, who released him as a 15-year-old. We asked David Tyrer of fan website Live4Liverpool where he sees the Scouser fitting in to Brendan Rodgers' team and how likely the big man is to succeed. Hardly a fortnight has passed since the season ended and Liverpool have been linked with nearly half of Southampton's first team. Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Nathaniel Clyne, even Luke Shaw's name has been thrown up. But when Rickie Lambert became the first that the south coast side had received an official bid from Liverpool for it was a shock, to say the least. Taking to Twitter you could see the concern from many - was this another Andy Carroll in the making? Another Englishman who's ability has been incorrectly inflated by his nationality? Listening to some, it would seem so. But being a Scouser at Liverpool means much more than being English; it can often afford you more time to prove yourself and, as we've seen in the case of Jon Flanagan, that is no bad thing. It is for this reason (although, not this reason alone) that Lambert's proposed move to Liverpool was greeted by most fans with a kind of whimsical positivity. Goalscorer: Liverpool target Rickie Lambert (left) celebrates scoring for Southampton this season . On target: Lambert shows his delight in notching goals for bother England (left) and Southampton . 'Good for him!' is the almost resounding sentiment, as it is rare that a local lad finally gets the opportunity to play for a club whose crest he has emblazoned on his shoulder at 32, though it should be noted that this move is in no way sentimental by the club. Sure, the fact that Rickie’s a Scouser will almost certainly help, in that he'll likely give that elusive 'extra 10 per cent' but there is no doubting he is being brought in to do a very specific job. While Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez will undoubtedly still be the club's main strike-force, Lambert is being purchased for those games when all the skill and trickery in the world get you nowhere, for when you need a totally different approach. It may now be a dirty phrase in English football but Lambert is a 'traditional centre forward' and at times Liverpool lacked that last season. With the increase in games next season too it would be much more heartening to have an option like Lambert from the bench than Victor Moses or Iago Aspas. Working hard: Lambert goes through his training drills for England ahead of this summer's World Cup in Brazil . Other Saints targets: Liverpool are also keen on Southampton's Adam Lallana (left) and Dejan Lovren . Not another Carroll: The differences between Lambert and Liverpool flop Andy Carroll's games look clear . Many may cry 'What was wrong with Carroll?!' but while their games are somewhat similar, the resounding difference is that Lambert is an experienced, canny pro and - most importantly - scores goals: 28 in his last 2 Premier League seasons, to be precise. Can you really grumble at a 15 goal-a-season striker for £4 million? Oh, and did I mention he's a Scouser?

"By . Martin Hardy . West Ham have put together a £10 million package to land the Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback. Colback sees his contract at the Stadium of Light run out this summer and the 24-year-old has sparked a Premier League chase between Newcastle, Swansea and the Hammers. Newcastle believed they were favourites to land the Geordie at the end of last season, with the player privately ready to make the controversial switch to St James' Park. On the move: Jack Colback is set to leave Sunderland this summer with West Ham leading the race . Pay rise: Colback is set to be paid around £50,000-a-week . He was one of the worst paid players at Sunderland last season on around £6,000-a-week, having come through the ranks. That alerted their North-east rivals, who were keen to push through a quick deal at the start of the summer. However West Ham have blown their rivals out of the water by putting together a four-year deal that will rocket Colback's salary up to £50,000-a-week. Winning the race: Sam Allardyce and West Ham believe they are front runners to land Colback . The whole package will cost around £10 million but Hammers' bosses believe that is off-set by the fact they won't have to pay a fee for a player who has been at Sunderland since he was a youngster. Colback has emerged as a key player at Sunderland over the last three seasons, playing over 100 times in the Premier League for a succession of managers, from Steve Bruce, Martin O'Neill, Paolo di Canio through to Gus Poyet. Poyet was eager to keep the English player this summer, but the club does not have the financial muscle to see off West Ham.","Midfielder out of contract at the Stadium of Light and set to leave .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Andy Murray is thoroughly enjoying himself at the French Open, not just on the court but also with all the speculation surrounding who he might employ as coach in succession to Ivan Lendl. The Wimbledon champion eased through to the third round with a comprehensive 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 victory over Australia’s Marinko Matosevic in a manner that suggests he can go well into the second week. After the one hour and 56 minute victory he addressed what is the biggest sub-plot of his career right now and admitted that he has spoken to at least one woman about coaching him in the future. Vacancy: Andy Murray walks past empty seats in his box during his French Open second-round victory . The day after Amelie Mauremo claimed, a tad disingenuously, that she spent three hours watching him play a Kazakh in the first round purely as research for French TV, Murray asserted he would not be afraid to go against convention and be coached by a woman. He changes his tune regularly about the whole matter but said on Thursday: 'I’ve spoken to a few people, male and female.  For me I don’t care. I don’t really care whether some of the other male players like it or not. 'I was coached by my Mum for a long time. There have been ex players around who have said ‘oh your Mum shouldn’t be around or she shouldn’t come and support you or come to watch. It’s silly. Everyone is entitled to have the team around them that they want. Everyone works differently. 'Some men might not work with a female, some men might work well with a female coach. It is just whatever your preference is and whatever your needs are.“A lot of people have been talked about, and they are all very good, I like all of the people that have been mentioned. When the time is right I will make an announcement.' Hovering: Amelie Mauresmo (back 2nd right) watched Murray's Roland Garros opener on Tuesday . Far from ‘having to put up with it’ as he insisted, Murray is clearly liking the speculation. He could shut it down by declining to discuss it – like he does the topic of Scottish independence for example – but obviously does not find it too much of a distraction. His mother Judy wants to see more women coaching in the professional game, and back in London on Thursday talked of what it is like to be in a ‘male-dominated world’. 'I think I came in for a load of rubbish talked about me because I was the mother of sons,' she said at an event for the Women’s Sports Trust with Microsoft. 'If I was the mother of daughters I don’t think anyone would really have noticed me, or if I’d been the father of sons. Women in decision-making positions will make more things happen.' We are family: Murray poses for the cameras with his mother Judy after winning Wimbledon last year . Her son’s next opponent will be the German Philipp Kohlschreiber, the world number 24 from Germany who will be quite different to the entertaining Australian affectionately known as ""Mad Dog"". Murray faced the dog on the Oval-shaped Court One, known as the Bullring. It is due to be pulled down as part of the redevelopment of Roland Garros, which is a shame, as something the French Open has over Wimbledon is the character of its outside courts in relation to those of the All England Club, which are functional and soulless by comparison. The 27 year-old Scot said he will miss court one when it is gone, with the crowd tight in on the players and able to hear their every exhalation and, in this case, expletive, of which there were quite a few from the Aussie. Happy man: Murray waves to the crowd after booking his place in the third round of the French Open . As Murray pointed out: 'Everyone picks up on the players who speak English but some of the stuff in other languages is a lot worse.' Kohlschreiber is likely to employ better tactics than Matosevic, who could hit explosively but did not always use his brain. Time and again, for example, he kept directing his second serve to the lethal Murray backhand and time and again it got drilled back past him. It was an assured display from Murray with quick starts to each set and some strong serves when they were needed, but the test of how he will really cope at a Grand Slam without a senior coach in his box is about to come. Eye on the ball: Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber is Murray's next opponent on Saturday .","Murray admitted he has spoken to a least one woman about becoming his new coach .

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . Chris Jordan’s five for 29 in England’s 10-wicket victory against Sri Lanka on Wednesday is only the latest remarkable chapter in the story of an emerging talent that has seen Alec Stewart liken him to Malcolm Marshall. While it may have been the dream of playing in West Indian maroon that first inspired Jordan as he grew up in Bridgetown, Barbados, it is now the lure of Lord’s that is calling. Jordan was introduced to the game by his father, Robert, and would spend ‘special’ summer days watching the West Indies at the island’s Kensington Oval. His sister Keisha played hockey for Barbados but cricket was Jordan’s passion. He tried to emulate Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose as a skinny child playing joyfully on the outfield during the lunch breaks and fondly recalls delivering throw-downs to Brian Lara. Jordan attended Charles F Broome primary school and then Combermere High with the pop star Rihanna, but a Pro-Am cricket festival set his life on a completely different track. Then and now: Chris Jordan after scoring 208 for Combermere High (left) and taking five wickets for England . English lad: Jordan (far right middle row) lines up with his team-mates at Dulwich College . Flying high: Chris Jordan is elated after taking the prized wicket of Kumar Sangakkara on Wednesday . He happened to play in a team captained by former England batsman Bill Athey, who recognised his talent and selected him as only the second young Caribbean cricketer to profit from a scholarship programme at Dulwich College, a prestigious independent school in south-east London. Jordan’s mother Rosita, a secretary at a Bajan bank, had grown up in south London. Her son, a British passport holder, duly retraced his family roots 4,000 miles away in England’s capital, spending a year at the boarding school in 2006-7 before settling in the city. ‘It was a huge step for a boy, coming from Barbados to a big private school in London but he did it,’ said Athey. ‘He’s a personable lad and he played football for the school as well, so he was well in with the other boys straight away. It was easy to see his talent but our scholarship students have to be academically strong as well, which Chris was. He could bat, bowl and field well in the deep or close to the wicket. There are very few with that genuine all-round ability.’ Jordan’s talent soon attracted the attention of Surrey, too. Nadeem Shahid was the club’s 2nd XI coach and went to watch Jordan at Athey’s invitation. ‘I thought: “Crikey, this kid is pretty special”,’ said Shahid. ‘He was so raw. He’d run in really hard from this long run-up and he could bowl very fast. When batting he could hit the ball hard but he wasn’t quite the finished article.’ Jordan’s rawness, however, was what made him so special in Shahid’s eyes. Pictures of him as a teenager reveal a baby-faced assassin and he played with a freedom and a childlike enjoyment that, thankfully, had not been coached out of him at an early age. His potential was evident for all to see. ‘I invited him for a 2nd team net and he impressed again, so we picked him in a 2nd XI game,’ added Shahid. ‘He took three or four wickets and scored about 20 runs so I called up Alan Butcher (then Surrey’s 1st XI coach) and said: “You really have to have a look at this kid”. He was in the 1st XI nets the next morning. ‘Chris was such a nice kid, always well-behaved and very respectful of his elders. We had a tour in  Barbados and he showed us all around. He was so well-mannered, even if he was full-on on the pitch. Raw talent: Jordan making a successful LBW appeal in an under-15 match for Combermere School . In the family: Chris's mother Rosita (centre) grew up in south London and his sister Keisha played hockey for Barbados . Fast and fuious: Jordan steamed in and took five Sri Lankan wickets for 29 runs . ‘Chris was one of those kids that make you think: “I’m so glad he’s made it”.’ Former England captain Stewart was another impressed by Jordan’s natural ability, even if ‘CJ’ is a Manchester United supporter who took a lot of stick from this staunch Chelsea fan. ‘CJ was the best young talent I had seen since Graham Thorpe,’ Stewart told Sportsmail. ‘They are very different cricketers, but you could just tell Chris was going to be a superstar. He made everything look so easy. ‘It’s a big shout but I likened him to a young, poor man’s Malcolm Marshall, who was the greatest bowler I ever played against. ‘I’m not saying CJ will get that close but he’s a quick bowler who can swing the ball out and a fine fielder as well — a very good slip with a good head on his young shoulders.’ Former West Indies captain Sir Clive Lloyd was also struck by Jordan’s talent during a match at The Oval in 2007. When he realised the fast bowler was Barbados-born, he asked Mark Butcher for Jordan’s telephone number, only to be referred to the Surrey captain’s father, who duly stalled and tried to put Lloyd off. Undeterred, . Lloyd asked after Jordan again when he saw Alan Butcher at a function . that winter, but was told: ‘Sorry, Clive, too late. We’ve nicked him!’ Jordan . seized his opportunity in England by joining Surrey aged 17 but, six . years, 1,044 runs and 97 wickets later he was released by the county . side. A once-promising career looked as if it might remain unfulfilled . after Jordan missed the whole of the 2010 season with a ‘horrific’ back . injury and then struggled to adjust his bowling action. Running the show: Jordan careers off after having Angelo Mathews caught behind . Richard Thompson, chairman of Surrey, said: ‘Chris was given plenty of exposure to the first team and he was well thought of but, when he was with us, he suffered a horrific back injury - a stress  fracture - which ruled him out for the whole of 2010. ‘Every man and his dog had a go at diagnosing the problem. When he came back he had to remodel his bowling action and it took time for him to find his rhythm. ‘It didn’t work for him and he needed a change of environment. He left in 2012 after six years with us and he went to Sussex where Mark Robinson has done a brilliant job with him. ‘There is no side to Chris, no edge. Now he has made a huge impact with England and it is  wonderful to see.’ Stewart also speaks of Jordan with considerable fondness, backing him to become a mainstay of the England Twenty20, one-day and Test teams, even if he is no longer wearing Surrey colours domestically. He added: . ‘CJ had some injuries which may not have been diagnosed straightaway and . then, later on in his Surrey career, his statistics didn’t back up his . talent when he did get an opportunity. But I still believed he was going . to be a top-class cricketer. ‘I . rang Mark Robinson at Sussex and Martyn Moxon at Yorkshire and said: . “He’s something very, very special. Take him on board because I still . believe in him”. Pumped up: Jordan celebrates the wicket of Lasith Malinga as Sri Lanka collapse at Old Trafford . Worthy acclaim: Jordan (centre) salutes the crowd as his team-mates give him a round of applause . ‘People are allowed time to mature and you should always judge people in adversity. When you have little setbacks the great ones come through stronger. I’m very, very pleased to see what he’s achieved.’ Former Australia fast bowler Brett Lee noted Jordan’s ‘serious raw pace’ and predicted he is ‘destined to get a lot of wickets’ after watching him perform in Brisbane earlier this year. It was a one-day match that featured Jordan’s stunning catch off his own bowling to take the wicket of David Warner. England bowling coach David Saker has also heralded Jordan as the ‘ultimate professional’, while captain Alastair Cook has been impressed by the way the 6ft 2in bowler has taken everything in his stride. There is a sense of desperation to find an instant hero at a time of flux in English cricket, but Jordan’s performances so far this summer have suggested this very raw talent can step up and roar for years to come. ‘What I like about him is his  attitude,’ said Cook. ‘He hasn’t changed at all since the first day he walked into the changing room. He’s desperate to do well, and he’s got a hell of a lot of talent as well.’.","Jordan took a career best five for 29 against Sri Lanka on Wednesday .

"By . Quentin Letts . Television reality shows normally pulsate with optimism. Participants greet one another with air kisses and whoops of delight. They look ahead to fame and riches. That's reality TV, right? Not quite. Not in the case of a new Channel 4 series called My Last Summer. Its participants hobble and weep. Not for them the possibility of years on the Hello! magazine circuit and chat shows. For all these people are - or were - terminally ill. All the participants from My Last Summer suffer from a terminal illness, left-right: Andy, Jayne, Ben, Lou and Junior . They decided to talk about their shared predicament in front of the cameras and the result is powerful, emotionally draining television. It may also help us as a society to be a little less distant about death, something I wish I had known earlier. The five sorry souls who took part, three of whom have died before the series starts next Wednesday, were taken to a manor house in Gloucestershire. The opening programme shows the uneasy bonhomie, soon followed by sobbing tears and bursts of bleak anger, as they welcome one another to this most unwelcome of clubs. Breast-cancer sufferer Jayne, 58, has a penchant for wine, laughter and lipstick. At first encounter she's irrepressible, determinedly insisting that she will keep her head held high. Taciturn Andy seems to be the opposite. He was told at 41 that he had leukaemia. He nearly overcame the illness, then he developed lung complications which, inescapably, will kill him. Andy has a family and money worries (shortly before his diagnosis he stopped paying into a crucial insurance policy). He walks through the gardens and stoically wonders if he'll be buried there. Folksy mother of four Lou, whose motor neurone disease is expected to kill her within a year, is just 38. Her youngest daughter, who's six, will not utter the word 'dead'. Instead she says 'chocolate'. 'When you're... chocolate... can I have your phone?' she asks her darling mum. Somehow, Lou manages to laugh at this innocent question. I'm afraid it made me bawl. 'Lou's,  daughter will not utter the word 'dead'. Instead . she says 'chocolate'. ""When you're... chocolate... can I have your . phone?"" she asks her darling mum. I'm afraid it made me bawl' Former . disc jockey Junior, 48, was once a dude, quite the Romeo about town (he . had 11 children by ten women). That was before he learned he had . prostate cancer. Junior is now struggling to contain his despair. He is . supported by his girlfriend of 16 months, 46-year-old Sonia, a woman of . eloquence and beauty. We . see them having a searingly upsetting row. 'I just want to give up,' says Junior, who is in terrible pain. 'I ain't got the fight in me.' Sonia . leaves the car in fury, her saintly patience fraying - and who can . blame her? Is terminal illness not sometimes as hard for those who watch . their loved ones dying? I suppose there could be an argument that the . cameras should have been turned off  - as Sonia at one point requests. Yet . there is public value in the insights we gain. Junior is now in a . better place but the grieving Sonia has done a noble thing in baring her . emotions so that we may understand better the maelstrom people in her . position must endure. Finally we . meet Ben, 57. He's a former ferry worker who says he's smoked himself . to an early death. Philosophical, he hopes his fate will alert others . not only to the dangers of cigarettes but also to the needs of . terminally ill people to be allowed some normality. 'I'm . not dying of cancer,' he told me - shortly before he died. 'I'm living . with cancer.' Ben may look the least healthy of the five but appearances . can be misleading. We soon see how the amazingly chirpy Jayne is at the . end of her thread. Quentin with his father Richard in 2004. Richard was also diagnosed with terminal cancer . She breaks down as she discloses that her husband of 25 years couldn't cope with her illness. On the day she was going for her test results, he reportedly sat in his chair and said, 'I've just made a tomato sandwich' and let her go to the doctor alone. When she returned with the news that she was terminally ill, he allegedly said, 'Oh', and left the room. Jayne adds, 'If you can't talk to your family and friends about it, who can you talk to?' Gosh, that question hurt. You see, my dear, quiet, undemonstrative father went through a terminal illness before his death at 82 four years ago. He refused the treatments that might have given him a couple more months. He faced the demon death with the greatest dignity. Watching My Last Summer forced me to revisit that time - a period, for our family, of heightened memories, an exhausting time when all other life seemed suspended - and I saw how I could have done better. What did this series do to me? I nearly write that it shamed me, but perhaps it is truer to say that it showed me, too late, how I might have behaved in a different way. Papa was diagnosed with terminal cancer one November afternoon. I was on a train when my mobile rang and one of my sisters gave me the news. I hastened to my parents' house and found my mother on the phone and my father reading the paper. 'Oh, hullo,' he said, as though it was any normal day. 'Your mother shouldn't be long.' Shouldn't be long. Shouldn't be long. To this day the words toll in my mind. Should I have flown to his arms and given him a hug? He was not that sort of father. Yet maybe he would have liked it. The participants in My Last Summer say it's a relief to meet people in the same boat. At last they find they don't have to explain all the time how they're feeling. Jayne talks of being momentarily 'free from people who just don't know what to say'. 'Watching My Last Summer forced me to . revisit that time - a period, for our family, of heightened memories, an . exhausting time when all other life seemed suspended - and I saw how I . could have done better' Jayne says her husband went through 'PLOM' syndrome - poor little old me' - and dwelt on his own misfortune at being left behind. It may have been more complicated than that - somewhere out there he will be nursing his grief. But Jayne's words do illustrate the loneliness of the terminally ill and the way that they're denied so much normality. Lou voices a worry that will, I suspect, make viewers gasp with tears. She knows that her husband John will never be able to play the mumsy role for their girls. 'Daddy's not going to be able to plait their hair or give them motherly chats about periods,' she says with the anguish of knowing another woman will bring up her daughters, yet 'not knowing who they are now. You don't know if they're going to do it right. If they're going to love them right. I want to choose them now. But John will have a fit!' My father and I had never had a chatty relationship but I wish, in those final months, I'd assured him he had been a fine father. I wish I'd told him how much I respected him. I regret that I allowed my English reserve to trump the imperatives of love. My mother assures me he knew we all loved him and I'm reasonably sure she's right. Even so, I would now feel more complete if I had described to him the depth of my regard. 'Look,' said Ben, as we finished our conversation, 'I've had a bloody good life. I don't mind sharing the end of it.' Thank you, Ben, and all who took part in My Last Summer. It may be hard watching for those who have lost loved ones to terminal illness but like the best tragic drama, it leaves you with a sense of catharsis and of understanding better this vale of tears we call life, not least when we know it must soon end.

"By . Nick Harris . Leeds United’s players failed to receive their wages as scheduled on Friday but club owner Massimo Cellino insists there is no lack of cash and a banking technicality is to blame. The club’s bank account has been frozen because Leeds face a winding- up petition, filed by former managing director David Haigh, over money he claims he is owed by the club. Leeds are confident the petition will be thrown out when heard in court on 9 June. Haigh, meanwhile, remains in a Dubai jail, accused but not yet charged of fraud and embezzlement. Not my fault! Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has blames a bank technicality of failure to pay players . A Leeds spokesperson said: ‘FA rules prohibit the payment of players’ wages from a personal bank account. We are making strides to unfreeze the club’s bank account.’ A source close to Cellino said: ‘The players will get their money, definitely. It’s there but it’s just a case of working out how to get it to them.’ Desert storm: Former Leeds director David Haigh (C) is in a Dubai jail accused of fraud and embezzlement . Leeds’ immediate future is likely to remain chaotic with Cellino preparing for a face-to-face showdown with manager Brian McDermott and his squad on Monday as Cellino assesses who will stay at the club for next season. It seems unlikely McDermott will remain in his current role but Cellino is wary of sacking him if that will entail a big compensation payout. He could stay in a different role although is unlikely to want that.","Leeds players have not received their wages on Friday .

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . The jostling began in the bottom half of the women's draw on Thursday with a place in the French Open final very much up for grabs. Although it is the exit of Serena Williams that made the biggest headlines, with Maria Sharapova still in the top half of the draw, there is a clear favourite. Without Australian Open champion Li Na in the bottom half, things are much more open. Contender: No 4 seed Simona Halep plays a backhand during her third-round victory at Roland Garros . The highest seed left is Romanian Simona Halep, whose remarkable rise up the rankings made her fourth seed for the tournament. Last year she was ranked outside the top 50 but seven titles since have turned her into a real contender for the biggest prizes. Halep, though, has only reached one grand slam quarter-final, at the Australian Open in January, so a semi-final or final would be breaking new ground. The 22-year-old looked in good shape against Britain's Heather Watson in round two, winning 6-2, 6-4 to set up a clash with Spain's Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor. Asked if she was feeling the pressure, Halep said: 'A little pressure, but I want just to stay focused for every match, because here every match it's very tough. 'It's a tough tournament and I have to play my best, to do everything on court match by match, and I will see how far I can go. I expect every match to be difficult, so I cannot say that I'm thinking about the finals or something like this.' Through: Halep shakes hands with Britain's Heather Watson (left) after winning in straight sets . The direct beneficiary of Li's first-round loss could be 28th seed Andrea Petkovic, a 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 winner over Stefanie Voegele on Thursday. The German is the only seed left in her quarter and next meets Li's conqueror Kristina Mladenovic, who backed up her big victory by defeating American Alison Riske in three sets. Petkovic said: 'I always only look match by match, but when things happen like with Li Na, everybody sort of approaches you like, ""Your draw is wide open, you're going to win the tournament"". 'You have to stop them, because Li Na lost for a reason, because there are other good players that can beat you if you're not at your best. It's not that your draw is wide open. 'It's a cliche to say I just look at the next round, but anybody who does anything else is going to lose.' Tongue out: Germany's Andrea Petkovic reacts during her three-set victory over Stefanie Voegele . There are five players left in the bottom half who have made a grand slam final - Sara Errani, Jelena Jankovic, Petra Kvitova, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Ana Ivanovic - with the latter three having won titles. Kuznetsova and Ivanovic have both won the French Open, and the latter is having her best season since her Roland Garros triumph in 2008 and must be a strong contender. Ivanovic, who overcame a tricky hurdle in teenager Elina Svitolina, next plays Lucie Safarova while Kuznetsova, always a big danger on clay, takes on Kvitova. Pumped up: Former French Open champion Ana Ivanovic celebrates her progression to the third round . Another player who will have her eye on the latter stages will be American Sloane Stephens, who reserves her best form for the grand slams. The 15th seed has never made a final on the WTA Tour yet has reached at least the fourth round at her last five grand slams, including a semi-final at the Australian Open last year. Stephens again looks to be hitting form at the right time, beating Polona Hercog 6-1, 6-3 on Thursday. Asked to explain the discrepancy, Stephens said: 'If I had the answer for you I would tell you, but I don't have the answer. Hitting back: American Sloane Stephens was on top form as she beat Polona Hercog in straight sets . 'I probably would be doing whatever it is that I do here, I'd do every week. But I just come out and play and compete, and I guess at the slams it's a little bit better than the other weeks.' Sharapova is in third-round action on Friday against Argentina's Paula Ormaechea while third seed Agnieszka Radwanska, the highest seed left in the tournament, opens proceedings on Court Philippe Chatrier against Ajla Tomljanovic.","The early exit of Australian Open champion Li Na has opened up the bottom half of the women's singles draw .

"By . Mike Dawes . As revealed earlier this week Sportsmail's Chris Foy wrote that Dylan Hartley would be fit for Northampton Saints' Aviva Premiership final against Saracens on Saturday. Northampton have named Dylan Hartley on the replacements' bench for Saturday's Aviva Premiership final against Saracens at Twickenham. The England hooker, who was sent off in last season's Premiership final loss to Leicester, has been sidelined since suffering a shoulder injury two months ago. But he now looks set to play a part in the end-of-season showpiece as Saints target their first title success. Comeback king: Dylan Hartley is on the bench for Northampton Saints' Aviva Premiership final vs Saracens . Up for it: England international Hartley has been sidelined for two months with a shoulder injury .

Venue: Twickenham Stadium . Kick off: 3pm . And it could also mean him heading to New Zealand early next week, where England face a three-Test series against the All Blacks. Players involved in this weekend's final will not be available for the first Test in Auckland on June 7. The England squad flew to New Zealand earlier this week, with a second group from Northampton and Saracens setting off some 48 hours after the final. The second Test is on June 14. England flanker Tom Wood, who captained Northampton to Amlin Challenge Cup final success against Bath last week, continues as skipper, leading a side that shows just two changes from seven days ago. Scrum-half Kahn Fotuali'i replaces Lee Dickson, while prop Salesi Ma'afu returns from suspension and starts instead of Tom Mercey. England prop Mako Vunipola's hopes of touring New Zealand have seemingly receded, though, after he was ruled out of the Saracens team due to a knee injury. Vunipola is replaced by Richard Barrington, who packs down alongside Schalk Brits and Matt Stevens in the front-row. It will be Stevens' final Saracens game before he joins the Sharks in South Africa. Saracens skipper Steve Borthwick also bows out this weekend, making his 265th and final Premiership appearance before retirement. He will be partnered in the second-row by Mouritz Botha. In the back division, a rotational switch sees scrum-half Neil de Kock starting instead of Richard Wigglesworth.

"By . Richard Spillett . Shocking CCTV footage has captured the moment a knife-wielding teenager realises he is a murderer. Edward Redman, 18, is shown laughing and joking in the footage, filmed after he brutally attacked tragic 17-year-old Jay Whiston in September 2012. The footage shows Redman's mood suddenly changing as he puts his hand to his mouth, the moment police believe he was told that Mr Whiston had died from his wounds. Scroll down for video . CCTV captures the moment Edward Redman (left, in red top) realises he has killed Jay Whiston in a brutal knife attack at a party in 2012 . After putting his hand to his mouth, Redman leans over and shows his accomplice, Rhys Hennebry, a message on his phone . Redman, pictured in the red top, stabbed Mr Whiston at a party in Colchester, Essex which had been advertised on Facebook and Twitter. Redman and his friend Rhys Hennebry, 19, who is also shown in the footage, fled the party after the attack. About 90 minutes later, they were seen running for a bus and, after getting on, Redman receives a message, which he shows to Hennebry before putting his hand over his mouth in shock. Redman then made a series of frantic phone calls and text messages, the details of which were later deleted from his phone. The CCTV footage was released after Hennebry was yesterday locked up for his role in Jay’s murder. He was sent to a young offenders’ institution for three years on two charges of affray. During the pair's trials, Chelmsford Crown Court heard the party had been well organised until a number of uninvited guests, including Redman, arrived. Killer Redman (left) was given a life sentence for stabbing Jay Whiston (right) outside a party in Colchester . CCTV footage was released after Rhys Hennebry, 19, pictured, was yesterday jailed for his role in the murder. Redman and Hennebry boarded the bus shortly after fleeing the party following the attack on Mr Whiston . Police released the footage after Hennebry was sentenced for his part in the killing. Redman was jailed for at least 17 years for the murder earlier this month . Redman is shown making frantic phone calls after the message police believe told him Mr Whiston had died from the wounds he had inflicted . The jury heard that Redman and his friends 'spread an air of fear' and told party goers that they were 'tooled up'. A . confrontation then developed when one of Redman's associates attempted . to steal alcohol from Mr Whiston's friends, the court heard. Redman stabbed Mr Whiston inside the house before following him onto the street where he delivered the second, fatal wound. Redman and Hennebry then fled the scene and boarded the bus on which the CCTV footage was filmed. The court heard that Mr Whiston, from Clacton, Essex, collapsed onto the street outside the party and was rushed to hospital but was later declared dead. The court heard Mr Whiston had tried to defend a friend after Redman gatecrashed a party he was at in 2012 . Tributes are placed at the scene as police forensic experts examine the area around the house where the part was held in 2012 . Redman, of Colchester, received a life sentence for the murder and was given a minimum sentence of 17 years in jail. Hennebry, also of Colchester, admitted affray and was sent to a young offenders institute for three years this week for the attack on Jay and another incident the night before. At the end of Redman's trial, Mr Whiston's mother Caroline Shearer paid tribute to her son in a highly emotional victim impact statement. She said: 'All I know is when you lose a child your heart is literally ripped out. Grieving the loss of your child is the hardest work I will ever have to do. 'It is a war I will never be able to finish fighting - a peak I will never be able to climb. Jay’s heart was so big they stabbed him in it - they couldn’t miss it.'","Edward Redman stabbed Jay Whiston at party in Colchester, Essex in 2012 .

"By . Sally Lee . A New Zealand pensioner has been rescued in California after his vehicle was stuck in the mud during his search for a lost gold mine. Luckily the 85-year-old, who cannot be named, was saved by activating his New Zealand locator beacon on Friday morning. He was searching for the gold mine which he first discovered as a boy. The 85-year-old man's vehicle was stuck in the mud while looking for a California gold mine. He activated his New Zealand locator beacon to call for help on Friday morning . Mike Roberts, a senior search and rescue officer of New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre (RCCNZ), said the beacon's signal was received about 9.30am yesterday. Mr Roberts said they were able to quickly confirm with the man's son that he was in California. He then notified the Californian Office of Emergency Services, who found and rescued the man about 30 kilometres east of Paradise, California at 2pm. The New Zealand pensioner was found in Paradise, California at 2pm on Friday . Mr Roberts said the man escaped injury although his vehicle was firmly stuck in the mud. He said the man resumed his search for the mine, about 120 kilometres north of Sacramento, after his vehicle was freed. His family were notified of the successful search. Mr Roberts said this incident showed the benefit of carrying a 406 MHz distress beacon, which is legally required to be registered. 'No matter where you are in the world, when a New Zealand-coded beacon is activated the signal will be picked up by both the RCCNZ and the rescue co-ordination agency in the region where the beacon is,' Mr Roberts said. 'As in this case, we work with the other agency to assist in the response and because the beacon was registered we were able to provide useful information about the man.'","A New Zealand pensioner, who cannot be named, was searching for the gold mine he first discovered as a boy .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Richard Branson may have plans to launch the first privately manned space flight this year, but at $250,000 (£148,400) a ticket, Virgin space travel won’t come cheap. For those desperate to get a taste of the experience, Swiss Space Systems (S3) has just launched what it claims will be the world's cheapest ZeroG flights. With prices starting at €2,000 (£1,600; $2,700), the flight will see passengers experience 20 to 25 seconds of weightlessness each time the plane transitions from climbing to descending. Scroll down for video . Swiss Space Systems (S3) has just launched what it claims will be the world's cheapest ZeroG flights. S3's flights, like existing ZeroG services, will involve putting passengers aboard a modified aircraft that performs a series of mid-air parabolas - or u-shaped manoeuvres . S3's flights, like existing ZeroG services, will involve putting passengers aboard a modified aircraft that performs a series of mid-air parabolas – or u-shaped manoeuvres. This gives passengers a feeling of weightlessness for just over six minutes in total, allowing them to feel similar sensations to that of an astronaut floating on the International Space Station. Nasa puts its astronauts through a much tougher version of the same flights as part of their training, pushing trainees to the brink of sickness in what is described as the 'vomit comet.'

It can be achieved by going into deep space, far from any gravitational body such as planets and stars. A cheaper option is to take a parabolic flight.This involves putting passengers aboard a modified aircraft that performs a series of mid-air parabolas – or u-shaped manoeuvres. Combined, these maneouvres give passengers a feeling of weightlessness for just over six minutes, allowing them to feel similar sensations to that of an astronaut floating on the International Space Station.

A dozen passengers can have a ‘tailor-made experience’ in the VIP Room, which will cost an €50,000 (£40,500 or $68,000) and comes with a watch and a flight suit. S3 plans on starting the flights in Japan next January for anyone above the age of eight, with 14 other locations opening throughout the year. Earlier this year, the Swiss group unveiled radical plans to launch a space shuttle from the top of an Airbus passenger jet as part of a separate project. Swiss Space Systems said the system will be a far cheaper way to launch satellites - and claims it can sell launches for £7 million ($12 million) or around a quarter of the price currently charged. The firm claims its system, which could launch satellites weighing up to 550lbs (250kg), could take to the air in 2017. The Swiss Space Systems launch model uses an Airbus A300, an aircraft already certified for zero gravity flights, to take the shuttle up to 10,000m on its back. Once it reaches this height, the shuttle will be launched to take it to an altitude of 49.7 miles (80km), when the spaceplane doors open and put the satellites into orbit. When this operation has been completed, the shuttle will return to earth by gliding towards its launch airport - and can be reused. Richard Branson may be moving ahead with plans to launch the first privately manned space flight, but at $250,000 (£148,400) a ticket, space travel won¿t come cheap.

"By . Sophie Borland . Plans to harvest private data from patients’ NHS files are causing a ‘crisis of public confidence’, the Royal College of GPs said yesterday. The professional body said it was ‘very worried’ that the public had not been properly informed about the scheme, which is due to begin this spring. Information about past illnesses, medication, weight and blood pressure will be taken from medical files and put into a database unless patients opt out. The Royal College of GPs has warned the NHS that they face a backlash for lack of information about their data sharing plans . NHS officials say the data will be used for important research and to show up poor care – and that all the data will be made anonymous. But experts say patients will be identifiable from their data – which will be passed on to private companies including insurance firms. A growing number of GPs oppose the care.data scheme, and say their patients will refuse to give them information for fear it will be harvested. Yesterday the Royal College – which represents 46,000 GPs – accused NHS officials of failing to inform patients about the scheme. The organisation said patients had not been told why their data was needed, nor how they could opt out. Professor Nigel Mathers, the Royal College’s honorary secretary, said: ‘We are very concerned that, with just seven weeks to go before the roll out, the public have not been properly informed about the benefits of and the safeguards surrounding the care.data  program. The result of the failure to make the case for  the scheme is the crisis of  public confidence that we are now seeing. ‘We urgently need a renewed national push by the authorities to ensure that patients are fully informed about the benefits of the scheme, what their rights are, and what their rights to opt out are.’ The warning comes just days after the Royal College’s former chairman backed the scheme by claiming it was ‘perfectly safe’. Patient data about their previous medications, medical histories, procedures and other personal information risks being shared to private companies like insurance companies, something that might cause the NHS to face a trust crisis . Dr Clare Gerada, who stepped down in October, said patients had ‘nothing to fear’ by sharing their data and promised it would be held in a ‘safe haven’. Writing in a national newspaper, she added: ‘We, patients and citizens alike, will all be the beneficiaries, as scientists, analysts and health service planners will have access to  an amazing source of information.’ But at least four GPs are so opposed to the scheme they have opted out all the thousands of patients on their lists – apart from a few who are willing for their data to be shared. These four include Dr Gordon Gancz, who practises in Oxford and has been warned by NHS officials that his actions may cost him his job. The scheme is set to begin next month. At first, data will only be taken from a few  surgeries to check the system works properly. It will then be rolled out nationally in April. NHS England claim the data will reveal where patients are receiving a lower standard of care. But officials admit data will also be shared with private firms – including insurers – who could use it to drive up premiums for patients with certain illnesses. Last week data expert Professor Sir Brian Jarman warned that firms could track down individuals within a few hours. The information is meant to be stored anonymously – with only dates of birth and postcodes on file – but Sir Brian said it would be easy to find patients from those details. Last month the NHS began posting leaflets about the scheme but in many instances they have been thrown out as junk mail. And the leaflets do not fully explain how to opt out, with some surgeries asking for it in writing and others wanting it done by phone. Phil Booth, of the campaign group medConfidential, said: ‘This publicity campaign has been a complete fiasco. There is absolutely no justification now for the upload of information from patients’ records. ‘NHS England has failed to communicate what it is doing. Virtually none of the people I meet – normal folk – are aware that anything is going on. ‘If they are going to have an opt-out mechanism, they must write to each patient and tell them exactly what is happening with their data, why and to whom it is going to go.’","NHS warned that data sharing could cause 'crisis of public confidence'

The Portland toddler managed to successfully bid for a 1962 Austin Healey Sprite on eBay after playing with her father's smartphone last month. The first her father knew of her secret shopping spree was when he received an email from eBay congratulating him on the winning $225 bid. Road to discovery: Sorella Stoute with the Austin Healey Sprite she bought on eBay . 'She decided to open the eBay app, and . started clicking around and one thing led to another and we own a car,' Paul Stoute told KOIN News. At first, the Oregon couple were not sure whether they could afford to take on the car, which needs a lot of work. However, they have decided to keep it and Mr Stoute plans to do it up in time for Sorella's high school graduation or 16th birthday. Family project: Paul Stoute plans to restore the classic car and give it to Sorella when she is 16 . 'I’ve done a lot of body work in the past, like bondo and stuff like that,' he said. 'But this is another realm altogether.' His wife, Christiana, told Fox 12: 'It comes with two engines. They're both in the back seat.' Sprites that have been restored can sell for nearly $14,000. After deciding to keep the car, the couple contacted Sorella's grandmother, Carlene Stenejhem, to see if they could store it at her house. At . first, Ms Stenejhem did not believe Mrs Stoute when she called to say . Sorella had bid on a car that they now needed to pay for.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A tea caddy carved from a mulberry tree may have been planted by Shakespeare himself has gone under the hammer for £13,000 at auction. The antique - which features a tiny carved bust of The Bard - was whittled out of wood recovered from the famous tree planted outside the playwright's home. It lay in a private collection for years but was finally passed on for a five-figure sum after it was sold off at Christie's auction house in London yesterday afternoon. One of a kind: The tea caddy made from the mulberry tree which grew in William Shakespeare's garden at New Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, which sold at Christie's auction house in London yesterday for £13,000 . The immaculate caddy, dated 1760, is emblazoned with Shakespeare's coat of arms and contains three ornate sliding-lid compartments decorated with intricate mulberry fruit designs. Reverend Francis Gastrell - who bought New Place in Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire, after Shakespeare's death - had the tree cut down in 1756 after he became fed up with visitors asking to see it. The bard: A portrait of William Shakespeare (1564-1616), which is believed to be the only surviving painting made of him during his lifetime . He had planned to burn the tree but enterprising locals flocked to purchase the wood in order to create Shakespeare souvenirs - kick-starting the historic town's centuries-old tourist industry. Woodworker George Cooper - whose signature is carved into the 6in high by 10.25in wide wood-and-metal box - created dozens of trinkets from the timber. Antiquarian John Jordon wrote Cooper was a 'poor joiner of Stratford, whose curiosity excited him to work with what little he was able to purchase into toys, such as tea chests, boxes and tobacco-stoppers etc., some of which were prettily carved.' Similar items made by Cooper have already fetched large amounts after sparking bidding wars at international auction houses. A 1759 mulberry wood tea caddy by Cooper was sold at Christie's New York in 1981 for just over $7,000 (£4,300) and is now held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Another was sold anonymously in 2009 at the same venue for $20,625 (£12,500). Historical records suggest Shakespeare . planted the original mulberry tree himself after landowners were . encouraged to grow them to promote UK silk production. Nash's House next door to the site of New Place: Shakespeare's final retirement home was demolished by its owner in 1759 in anger after he had a local planning application rejected and his taxes were raised . After taking over the New Place property, Rev Gastrell applied for planning permission to extend the garden, but was turned down and his tax was increased. Furious, the minister retaliated by demolishing the house in 1759, enraging the locals who forced him to leave town. Since Shakespeare's death, other mulberries have been planted in the New Place garden - all that's left of the original property. The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust attracted controversy last year when it applied for permission to cut one tree, planted in 1946, to make way for excavation work.","Antique went under the hammer at Christie's in London yesterday .

Psychologists said three minutes on the classic brain-teaser can reduce cravings long enough to stave them off. It works by distracting the user's brain so they don't have time to visualise snacks, alcoholic drinks or cigarettes . Almost half of male gamers in a recent study admitted they have turned down sex to continue playing. While a fifth of female gamers said they’d missed weddings and hen dos. More disgustingly, one in seven gamers confessed to relieving themselves in an empty drinks bottle to avoid having to leave the room with gamers in Birmingham among the worst offenders. The research was commissioned by Domino’s Pizza. During tests, researchers asked a group of volunteers to rate their cravings in terms of strength, vividness and intrusiveness. Half the participants were told to play Tetris for three minutes, but only half actually got to use the classic 1984 tile-matching game while the others half waited for it to boot up. The individuals playing Tetris experienced 24 per cent weaker cravings than those waiting unsuccessfully for the game to load.

'Often those feelings result in the person giving in and consuming the very thing they are trying to resist. 'But by playing Tetris, just in short bursts, you are preventing your brain creating those enticing images and without them the craving fades.' More than 170 million copies of Tetris have been sold worldwide since it was invented by programmer Alexey Pajitnov in the Soviet Union.

Ms Wu, who worked at a Starbucks in Midtiown Manhattan, filed a formal complaint to the district manager in February after her co-workers fondled her and propositioned her for sex, the New York Daily News reports. Holly Wu, 27, says she was called 'big booty Holly' by co-workers who continually sexually harassed her . Wu says she was fired without warning from her Midtown Manhattan Starbucks three weeks after she filed a sexual harassment complaint . She says her co-workers also called her 'big booty Holly' and poked her in the bottom - despite her pleas not to. The harassment didn't stop there, either. Her co-workers often showed her pornography at work, as well. 'It was very upsetting to work in that environment,' she told the Daily News. Three weeks after she sent the email complaining about the harassment, she was fired without warning. Her bosses told Ms Wu, a shift manager, that she was canned for asking a barista to work 45 minutes later. Ms Wu says she was repeatedly propositioned for sex, fondled, massaged and shown pornography by her male co-workers . She says Starbucks refused to look into her complaint. The federal lawsuit cites seven other cases filed for similar reasons since 2008. Ms Wu said the company has a policy against sexual harassment - one that it violated by not investigating her complaint. A spokesperson for Starbucks said the company doe not comment on pending lawsuits. However, the company said it has no tolerance for sexual harassment at its stores.","Holly Wu says she was fondled, propositioned for sex, shown pornography and poked in her bottom by male co-workers .

"By . Deni Kirkova . and Bianca London . In the quest to make us slimmer without lifting a finger, an injection has been invented letting us literally pee out our fat. A water solution is injected into stubborn areas around the body, breaking down excess fat cells, allowing us to absorb them into our bloodstream - and then wee them out. The new treatment, dubbed Aqualyx, claims to be an effective alternative to liposuction. The jabs break fat cells, allowing us to absorb them into our bloodstream - and then wee them out . It contains plant polymers, which binds with the cell walls of the fat tissue before rupturing and releasing the fat to be dissolved. The formula liquefies the fat cell which is then eliminated when you urinate over a three-week period. Makers say the solution completely destroys the fat cells so they can’t grow back. It can be used on your thighs, stomach, knees, chin, buttocks, stomach, back and even your neck. Describing its new treatment, Mills Medical Service say it 'gives you the body you’ve always dreamed of without fearing the fat will return'. The treatment, which claims to be the only registered fat removal injection on the market, says it has no downtime (other than slight bruising and swelling for 48 hours). 'Aqualyx isn’t an injection for weight loss; it is used for contouring the body and slimming down those stubborn fat areas. Combined with a healthy diet and exercise, the fat won’t grow back either.' say the brand. One session costs £250, which Mills Medical say is all that's needed for the chin area, while the tummy may need a few more treatments. But is it all too good to be true - can it really be effective and safe? Dr Arun Ghosh, from the private Spire Hospital in Liverpool says the injections could pose a health risk. Aqualyx, like lipo, is not recommended for weight loss goals but rather to contour the body . He told the Daily Star: 'It's dangerous to re-absorb fatty acids into your bloodstream because if it's dissolved down into salt it would send cholesterol levels sky high.' Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD of 111 . Harley Street, said: 'I don’t use fat removal injectable in my clinic . and certainly have no plans to until there is further research and . trials published. 'It’s . always important that prospective patients thoroughly research . treatments before they book, and these injectables are very new to the . market with little evidence of their efficacy other than that produced . by the manufacturer. 'While . the cost is certainly affordable and attractive, those thinking of . having the procedure must look at alternatives available that have . proven results and existing patient testimonials.

Iran yesterday blamed the U.S. and Israel for the assassination of a university professor and scientist who played a key role in the country’s controversial nuclear weapons programme. Two hitmen on a motorcycle were said to attached a magnetic bomb to the car of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan killing him and a passenger instantly as they sat in the Iranian-assembled Peugeot 405 in northern district of the capital Tehran. A 32-year-old chemistry expert and director of the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in central Iran, Roshan was said to have been involved in the development of Tehran’s atomic programme. The assassination had strong similarities to other executions in recent years of scientists linked to the programme and underlined the belief that a major covert operation is underway against it. Iran has accused Israel’s Mossad, the CIA and Britain’s spy agencies of engaging in an underground “terrorism” campaign against nuclear-related targets, including at least three killings since early 2010 and the release of a malicious computer virus that temporarily disrupted controls of some centrifuges - a key component in nuclear fuel production. All three countries have denied the Iranian accusations. Yesterday Tehran pointed the finger at . the US and Israel as being behind the latest ‘terrorist’ attack but . promised it would not be a setback to the expanding nuclear programme. ‘The bomb was a magnetic one and the . same as the ones previously used for the assassination of the . scientists, and the work of the Zionists (Israelis),’ Deputy Tehran .

Tepco has removed 814 out of 1,533 fuel rod assemblies from the No. 4 reactor since November. 'We stand ready to help in any way we can,' Kennedy told reporters after her visit, when she made a stop at a Tepco facility near the nuclear power plant. The plant was damaged beyond repair by the March 11, 2011, disaster when a 9 magnitude earthquake triggered tsunami waves that hit the plant on the coast north of Tokyo, causing one of the world's worst nuclear disasters.

Caroline Kennedy, left, and her son Jack Schlossberg, second left, wearing protective suits and masks, listen to Masuda Naohiro, third left, an executive of Tokyo Electric Power Co. Shortly after the accident, the United States sent in water pumps, fire trucks, drones and protective suits and masks. Kennedy, daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy, said in a statement the United States 'will offer our experience and capabilities, in particular, toward the near-term resolution of ongoing water contamination issues'. Radioactive water poses a long-term risk at the plant and it could take more than three decades to clear it up. The plant has been hit by a series of accidents this year including a 100-tonne leak of radioactive water from storage tanks. After touring the plant, Kennedy told reporters that it's hard to visualize and understand the complexity of the challenge just from reading about it.

Kennedy visits the unit four to inspect the operation to move a spent fuel rod to a cask at the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant . Wearing a protective suit and a mask, an employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) walks through an aisle covered with red plastic sheets . She expressed gratitude to those who continue to work at the plant. Contaminated water accumulates at a rate of 400 tonnes a day at the plant as groundwater flows into the destroyed basements of the reactor buildings and mixes with highly radioactive water used to cool melted fuel. Row upon row of huge blue and grey tanks that store contaminated water are lined up while pink, white and purple azalea bushes are in full bloom nearby. Overgrown plants curl onto the streets while pipes snake across the site where numerous cranes still stand. About 1,200 to 1,300 tanks storing about 450,000 tonnes of contaminated water are on site and over the next two years Tepco wants to set up enough tanks to store 800,000 tonnes of water, said Kenichiro Matsui, a spokesman for the utility. Wearing protective suits and masks, Japanese journalists head to the central control room for the Unit One and Unit Two reactors when U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy visits . Wearing protective suits and masks, employees of Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) walk carefully through a dark aisle in the plant . Up to 5,000 workers are on site each day, according to the Tepco spokesman, Matsui, up from about 4,000 a year ago. In future, that number is likely to increase to about 6,000, he said. Overseas companies including U.S. ones are eager to get in on the clear-up work and the decommissioning of the six reactors at the wrecked plant but most contracts have gone to Japanese companies. Kennedy, accompanied by her 21-year-old son, drew crowds of workers when she arrived at the Tepco facility. 'It's good that she's here because the situation at the plant needs to be reported worldwide,' said one man who now works as a driver for plant workers after hitting his annual radiation exposure limit in his former job at the site.","Caroline Kennedy was accompanied by son Jack Schlossberg on their first visit to the plant .

"By . Mark Duell . A daughter whose mother was raped and murdered is facing a lifetime of never knowing where the killer buried her - because it would breach his human rights. Both Martin Stafford's prison and the European Union are stopping mother-of-one Tracy Richardson, 30, of Swinton, Greater Manchester, from contacting him. Stafford, 45, was found guilty and jailed for the murder of Michelle Gunshon and sentenced to life in prison. He was also found guilty of false imprisonment, rape and preventing the burial of a body. Blocked: Tracy Richardson (left), 30, of Swinton, Greater Manchester, whose mother Michelle Gunshon (right) was raped and murdered, will never know where the killer buried her . Although the crimes were committed in . 2004, Stafford evaded arrest when he fled the country and was only . brought to justice in 2012 after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court. He . was extradited from Ireland, where he had been serving time in jail for . rape and false imprisonment. But Stafford has never disclosed where he . left the body of Mrs Gunshon. Ms Richardson told the Sunday Mirror that the unidentified jail would not hand the . murderer a letter from her because the governor thought it would be . 'intrusive' and in breach of his human rights. She . then discovered police cannot ask Stafford where Mrs Gunshon’s body is . buried, because he has to give them consent to ask him, according to the . terms of his EU extradition from Ireland. Killer: Martin Stafford (left) was found guilty and jailed for the murder of Ms Gunshon and sentenced to life in prison. Ms Richardson left this message (right) outside Birmingham's NEC, where her mother used to work . Family: Ms Richardson aged six with her mother Michelle Gunshon and younger brother David as a baby . Ms . Richardson can now only find out where her mother is buried by asking . Stafford to tell her in person - but she must get a visitation order in . order to do this, and that must be signed by Stafford. In memory: Now the only way Ms Richardson can find out the truth is to beg Stafford to tell her in person . ‘I'm . in total shock,’ she told the newspaper. ‘He should have lost his human . rights the second he decided to commit those evil crimes. 'He's not a . human in my eyes, he's a monster. All . I want is to lay mum to rest and give her the dignity she deserves. 'But . I have no hope of doing that unless someone gets Stafford to admit . where she is.’ Mrs Gunshon . was aged 38 and working as a security guard at Birmingham's NEC when she . went missing in 2004.

He had murdered her before 'spiriting her body away' and . fleeing the country, a court heard. He . was issued with a European Arrest Warrant and extradited to be charged . with her murder after completing a rape sentence in 2012 - but was never . asked by police where he put the body, as a condition of this warrant. Ms . Richardson said: ‘They won't even tell me what prison he's in. I have . no hope any more. It doesn't make sense - he's a convicted murderer.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 23-year-old woman claims she has 15 personalities - and must buy Christmas presents for all of them. Kimi Sands suffers from a rare condition called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), which results in her different personalities taking control of her body at any given time. She has spent hundreds of pounds buying gifts for all 15 of her personas, which include Japanese chef Satou, 22, exercise-addict Fiona, 17, and four-year-old twins Jack and Safyer. Scroll down for video . Changeable: Kimi Sands, 23, with partner Chris. She suffers from a rare condition called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), which results in her different personalities taking control of her body at any given time . Ms Sands, 23 from Cardiff, said: ‘Christmas is a bit more expensive for me than for others because obviously I have so many people to buy for. ‘Including myself, there are 16 individuals to get presents for. These can be anything from alcohol for the older personalities to teddies for the kids.’ Ms Sands’ condition, DID, is commonly known as multiple personality disorder. People who have DID can experience shifts of identity as separate personalities and each identity may be in control of their behaviour and thoughts at different times - each with a distinctive pattern of thinking, needs and desires. Young: Kimi as Jack, aged 4, who is twins with Safyer, right. She has spent hundreds of pounds buying gifts for all 15 of her personas . Mixing it up: Kimi as exercise-addict Fiona, aged 17 (left) and as Ashy, aged 23, from Yorkshire . Ms Sands’ personas started to develop . when she was three years old but it was not until she reached the age of . 20 that she was diagnosed with DID by a psychotherapist at The . Pottergate Centre for trauma and disassociation in Norwich. Her personality switches can last anything from a few minutes to several days at a time, which is typical of the condition. She . can become personas such as Yorkshire man Ashy, 23, flamboyant . Essex-born Koumi, 17, genderless Finn, 14, and a party-loving bisexual . called Theodore, aged 15. Ms Sands’ partner, Chris Lee, 24, said the festive season can be a struggle for the couple financially as there are so many individuals to buy presents for. He said: 'It’s hard. We’re a couple . but at the same time, we have this internal family. You’ve got to pay . for gifts for everyone else,’ he said. Different ages: Kimi as bisexual Theo, aged 15 (left) and as 25-year-old Abigail (right). Her condition, dissociative identity disorder, is commonly known as multiple personality disorder . Kimi as Fyn, aged 14 and right, as Kitten, who is 'very secretive'. Her personality switches can last anything from a few minutes to several days at a time, which is typical of the condition . Mr . Lee is usually buys the presents for Kimi’s younger personalities, as . they prevalently tend to get 'overexcited' during shopping trips. ‘The kids go mental in the toy store and want to buy everything,’ he said. ‘It’s . funny because when I’m queuing at the till with My Little Pony figures, . people often mistakenly assume that I’m buying presents for my . children.’ However the pair believe the money and effort is all worth it. Mr Lee said: ‘Giving the presents to everyone is so much fun. The kids are ecstatic and emerge from Kimi immediately. ‘But then it’s very difficult to make one personality leave so you can give the next gift to another one.’ Ms . Sands added: ‘I lose a lot of time when my alters take over. When I was . at school, Ashy attended it in my place quite regularly. Kimi as Aimee, who has not disclosed her age and as her 'normal' personality. Her personas started to develop when she was three years old but it was not until she reached the age of 20 that she was diagnosed . ‘In that time, he got with all of my female friends. When I returned, rumours were going around that I was a lesbian! ‘Teenager Theodore takes advantage of the fact that I have an age identification card and goes out drinking. ‘I’ve lost whole evenings because of him and I wake up the next morning with terrible hangovers,’ she said. It is not only at Christmas that Ms Sands has to spend money on her other alter egos. ‘You have to make a lot of compromises . when you have 15 personalities. I have to stock my wardrobe with . different clothes for everyone. The boys would be angry if they had to . wear dresses. ‘I also have . to make sure that there’s always vegan food in the fridge for Fiona. It’s complicated making sure everyone’s diet is catered for,’ she said. Variety: Mr Lee said that he has come to love all of Ms Sands' personalities in different ways and is able to have a night out with the boys, as well as taking the younger 'kids' to the zoo . Mr Lee said that he has come to love all of Ms Sands’ personalities in different ways and is able to have a night out with the boys, as well as taking the younger ‘kids’ to the zoo. However they retain a strict rule of no romantic intimacy between Mr Lee and Ms Sands’ other personalities. She explained: ‘It’s mostly just me with Chris. Although sometimes I allow him to kiss and cuddle Koumi, who is gay. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is the most complex dissociative disorder and is also known as multiple personality disorder (MPD). Some people see it as a personality disorder, although it is not. The defining feature is severe change in identity. People who have DID can experience the shifts of identity as separate personalities. Each identity may be in control of their behaviour and thoughts at different times and each has a distinctive pattern of thinking and relating to the world. Dissociation can affect a person's perception, thinking, feeling, behaviour, body and memory. The impact of dissociation varies from person to person and may change over time. How well a person appears to be coping is not a good way of telling how severely affected they are. A person's sense of reality and who they are depends on their feelings, thoughts, sensations, perceptions and memories. If these become disconnected from each other, an individual's sense of identity, their memories and they way they perceive themselves in the world will change - and this is what happens to sufferers of Dissociative identity disorder. SOURCE: Mind . ‘Some of my alters are romantically involved with each other though. Theo is going out with Finn. ‘Theo has his own Facebook profile and asked Finn to join the social network so they could be in a relationship together online,’ she added. Ms Sands, a part-time artist, wants to educate more people about the disorder and regularly uploads videos on YouTube featuring her other personalities. ‘Every time you see a DID sufferer in a film, they are portrayed as evil. I often have to explain to people that I’m not an axe murderer!’ she said. ‘I want to deliver a positive message through my videos.’ Ms Sands does not let her condition get in the way of life and tries to remain optimistic about it. She says: ‘Yes it’s a painful disorder but there are so many happy bits to having DID. ‘I always have company. There is someone by my side all the time.’ A spokesperson for Mind, the mental health charity, said: ‘Dissociative identity disorder is the most complex dissociative disorder. 'You may experience shifts of identity and each one may be in control of your behaviour and thoughts at different times. Every identity you have has a unique pattern of thinking and way of relating to the world. ‘If you are experiencing these symptoms then we would urge you to talk to a family member or friend about how you’re feeling or seek help from your GP or a psychiatrist. 'A health professional can assess your symptoms and discuss all your treatment options with you.’ More information and help can be found at the charity’s website.","Kimi Sands suffers from a rare condition .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The Obama administration is poised to entertain a flood of new clemency applications from thousands of federal prisoners who were given harsh sentences under mandatory-minimum laws following drug convictions, Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday. Holder said in a short videotaped statement that he wants to shrink the federal prison population by a modest amount while ensuring 'that those who have paid their debts have a chance to become productive citizens.' At the center of the move is a set of old sentencing rules that punished crack-cocaine offenders with more time behind bars than users or traffickers of powder cocaine. Civil rights groups have claimed the practice amounted to racial bias since crack – a solid, smokable form of the highly addictive drug, has been more popular in African-America, inner-city communities since its introduction to the U.S. in the early 1980s. The announcement is part of an ongoing Obama administration push to re-evaluate sentences for drug crimes that officials believe were unduly harsh and were imposed under old federal guidelines that treated convictions for crack cocaine offenses more punitively than those involving the powder form of the drug. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Big move: Attorney General Eric Holder announced that his Department of Justice will start presenting far more clemency requests from drug offenders to the president for his consideration . Cocaine has more than a century's worth of history in the United States, reaching its apex in the 1960s and '70s during a period of social permissiveness that embraced drug use and sexual promiscuity . Clarence Aaron of Mobile, Alabama was sentenced to life in prison in 1993 for possession with intent to distribute cocaine; President Obama commuted his sentence in December . But the new rules will also embrace sentencing disparities of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine users and low-level dealers. The GOP-led 'War on Drugs' era included dramatic increases of some mandatory sentences, a move designed to crush networks of narcotics dealers and sweep the streets clean. Holder suggested Monday that the move hadn't achieved its goal, and had left thousands languishing in custody unfairly. 'There are still too many people in federal prison who were sentenced under the old regime – and who, as a result, will have to spend far more time in prison than they would if sentenced today for exactly the same crime,' he explained in his video. 'This is simply not right.' Reactions were partisan and swift. 'What you see is a moral imperative being seized on by the White House,' a Democratic strategist in Michigan told MailOnline. 'This is the stuff of legacy building.' A Republican election consultant, also in Michigan, countered that President Barack Obama's timing was suspect. 'Isn't it an election year?' He asked. 'Oh, yes. That's right. It is. Anything to distract his base from the miserable failure of Obamacare.' In December Obama announced that he had commuted the sentences of eight federal drug convicts, including six who were handed life sentences. 'Each of them has served more than 15 years in prison,' the president noted at the time. 'In several cases, the sentencing judges expressed frustration that the law at the time did not allow them to issue punishments that more appropriately fit the crime.' A month later the Justice Department issued guidance encouraging U.S. defense lawyers to help drug offenders with no history of violence to start the process of appealing to the White House for clemency. In the 1980s the advent of cheaper 'crack' cocaine rocks brought the drug a wider market, and it quickly became a drug of choice in the black community in the U.S. Ezell Gilbert of Tampa, Florida (L) was given a 292 month sentence in 1997 for possession with intent to deliver cocaine base and marijuana, and Stephanie Yvette George of Pensacola, (R) got a life sentence the same year for conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute; Obama freed them both in December . International: Drug trafficking is a trillion-dollar business worldwide, with much of the narcotics smuggled into the U.S. and other nations through increasingly ingenious methods like this cache stowed inside heavy machinery . The Obama administration has begun to add dozens of lawyers to the legal staff assigned to handle such applications. Historically, very few have been approved. But that could change soon, now that Holder has opened the door for a new criterion: the difference between an existing sentence and oen that would be handed down today in similar circumstances. 'The Justice Department is committed to recommending as many qualified applicants as possible for reduced sentences,' Holder said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters on Monday that he couldn't estimate how many felons would be released. 'In terms of how many deserving candidates are out there, I couldn't begin to speculate,' he said. Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, told the Associated Press that he was excited by the prospect of a sudden break from the past inertia in clemency applications. 'What you see is some focused attention on the part of the administration to deal with this in a serious way,' he told the AP. Members of Congress quizzed Holder this month in a Capitol Hill hearing, with Virginia Republican Rep.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 19:46 EST, 26 January 2012 . Regrettable tweets: One in four post messages on Twitter we wish we hadn't . In these days of instant communication it’s all too easy to put a tweet into gear while your brain’s still in neutral. According to a survey, one in four of us have regretted posting something on a social media site, mainly because it was inappropriate or upset someone. Around 40 per cent of 2,000 polled said they used websites such as Twitter and Facebook to speak up on an issue they felt passionate about. Almost half believed that what they said had made a difference. Posting comments was not without its pitfalls though, according to the study to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. More than a quarter admitted they would say, or have said, something on a site they would never say to someone’s face. A third of respondents had also witnessed or been a victim of online bullying. Professor . Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology, Fellow of . Magdalen College, Oxford, who analysed the findings, said: 'The rapid . increase in the availability and use of social media has brought with it . many positives and, as our research has revealed, one of these is the . ability to speak up for things we are passionate about. 'However, . it is important to remember that it is through experience in . face-to-face interactions that we learn many of the social skills needed . to navigate our way through our complex social world. 'Our research has shown that people are more prone to saying something on social media that they later regret, because in these digital environments we don’t receive the immediate checks and balances that we get during face-to-face interactions. 'This can therefore result in a careless or inappropriate tweet, or at worst, cyber bullying.'",One third of Twitter users have also witnessed or been a victim to online bullying .
"By . Tara Brady . The FBI has admitted it spied on Nelson Mandela during his first visit to the U.S. after he spent 27 years behind bars. Agents recruited an insider from the South African leader's own circle who provided the FBI with his itinerary for the trip in June 1990. A memo dated May, 30, 1990, from the Atlanta office to the then FBI Director William Sessions confirms the FBI had an informant. Nelson Mandela stands with his wife Winnie (left) after placing a wreath at the grave of Martin Luther King Jr on June 27, 1990. First-left, Coretta Scott King, the widow of M. L. King . At the time the CIA had been accused of providing information to apartheid authorities in South Africa which led to Mandela's arrest in 1962. Mandela was the leader of the African Natoinal Congress which was deemed by the U.S. to be a 'terrorist organisation' and was only removed from the list in 2008. According to the memo, a member of Coretta Scott King's staff had the itinary drawn up for Mandela's trip to Atlanta. Coretta Scott King was the widow of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Nelson Mandela meets Coretta Scott King and three of her children at the Martin Luther King Jr Centre in Atlanta Georgia in 1990 . The informant also said Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan wanted to meet Mandela but this did not happen until 1996 when Mandela was South African president. The 334 page document was released following a Freedom of Information request by campaigner Ryan Shapiro. However, 169 pages were withheld on national security grounds. Mr Shapiro is suing the National Security Agency, CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency for the records on Mandela. He told Al Jazeera: 'What's missing from these documents is often as illuminative as what's disclosed. 'Not only did the FBI heavily redact and withhold documents, but there's virtually no discussion of U.S intelligence community involvement prior to Mandela's 1990 release from prison.' It is likely the FBI was concerned about keeping Mandela safe during his visit. A letter dated May 26, 1990, to a Houston newspaper read: 'Remember John F. Kennedy in Dallas?? Bring this black murderer to Houston and we will give him a welcome the world will not forget!!!' Nelson Mandela and Coretta Scott King, widow of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., sing and dance at a victory celebration for Mandela in Johannesburg . Fingerprints were taken from the letter by the FBI but the person who wrote it was never caught. A memo sent to an FBI agent on June 18, 1990, read: '[Department of State] representatives have classified the threat level for this visit as ""high,"" and threats to harm Mr Mandela have been received.' One log specifically said Mandela would be assassinated 'either in Atlanta or Miami.' Thousands of Americans gathered to see Mandela during his 11-day stay in the U.S in 1990. The South African leader died aged 95 at his Johannesburg home in December last year after a prolonged lung infection. His nation and the world were plunged into mourning for the man hailed by global leaders as a moral giant. Mandela died aged 95 at his Johannesburg home last year after a prolonged lung infections. Politicians and celebrities posted their tributes to the great South African upon hearing of his death. U.S. President Barack Obama said the world had lost 'one of the most influential, courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth'. After almost 50 years of ruthless segregation, Nelson Mandela brought black and white South Africans together as equal partners in a new democracy. The man jailed for 27 years healed the wounds of apartheid, rising above personal animosity and revenge to become revered across the globe.","Agents recruited an insider from the South African leader's own circle .

"By . Suzannah Hills . An ancient Greek cave nearly the size of four football pitches and with its own underground lake may be responsible for sparking the age-old myth about the Greek underworld god Hades, archaeologists claim. The cavern - named Alepotrypa which means 'foxhole' - laid undiscovered for centuries in Diros Bay, Mani, southern Greece, until a man walking his dog found a tiny entrance to the cave in the 1950s. Experts have spent the last few decades excavating the cave and believe hundreds of people lived inside Alepotrypa, making it one the oldest prehistoric villages in Europe, before the cave entrance collapsed burying everyone alive 5,000 years ago. Scroll down for video . To the depths of hell: It has been suggested that this cave called Alepotrypa might have helped serve as the inspiration for the mythic ancient Greek underworld god Hades . Behind the legend: Greek archaeologist and director of the Diros Project, Giorgos Papathanassopoulos, believes that people used to make pilgrimages to the cave because it was seen as the entrance to Hades' underworld . In Greek legend, Hades was the King of the Underworld, a hidden kingdom of the dead. He is a greedy god who is greatly concerned with increasing his subjects. He also presided over funeral rites and defended the right of the dead to due burial. As soon as he was born, Hades was devoured by Kronos, the Titan god of time and the ages, along with four of his siblings. Zeus later caused the Titan to disgorge them, and together they drove the Titan gods from heaven and locked them away in the pit of Tartaros. When the victorious brothers then drew lots for the division of the cosmos, Hades received the third portion, the dark dismal realm of the underworld, as his domain. Geographically, the underworld is surrounded by a series of rivers: The Acheron (river of woe), The Cocytus (river of lamentation), The Phlegethon (river of fire), The Styx (river of unbreakable oath by which the gods swear), and The Lethe (river of forgetfulness). Once across the rivers an adamantine gate, guarded by Cerberus, forms the entrance to the kingdom. Archaeologists have now uncovered tools, pottery, obsidian, silver and copper artifacts that date back to the Neolithic Age, which began in Greece began around 9,000 years ago, soon before the Stone Age. But the most important find - that the cave was used as a cemetery and for burial rituals - has led researchers to believe it could have inspired the legend of Hades' underworld. The first archaeologist to ever dig inside Alepotrypa, Giorgos Papathanassopoulos, suggests that the Neolithic residents believed the cave was Hades. Researcher Michael Galaty, an archaeologist at Millsaps College in Jackson, Missorri, told LiveScience: 'You can easily see why Giorgos would make that hypothesis. The cave really does recall the underworld, Hades and the River Styx. 'Alepotrypa existed right before the . Bronze Age in Mycenaean Greece, so we're kind of seeing the beginnings . of things that produced the age of heroes in Greece. 'You have to imagine the place torchlit, filled with people lighting bonfires and burying the dead. 'The . burial sites and rituals that took place really do give the cave an . underworld feel. It's like Hades, complete with its own River Styx. Hidden treasures: The cave in southern Greece remained hidden for centuries until it was discovered by a dog walker in the 1950s . Mass graves: People apparently performed burials and spiritual rituals in the cave . Historical importance: Experts believe the cave society dates back to the Neolithic Age - making it one of the oldest prehistoric villages in Europe . 'Giorgos Papathanassopoulos has always argued...that the cave was a kind of pilgrimage site where important people were buried, leading to the fanciful idea that this was the original entrance to Hades, that it was the source of the Greek fascination with the underworld.' The cave is more than 1,000 metres long with a huge central chamber but the archaeologists still have a long way to go before they have explored the entire ruin. Mr Galaty added: 'We don't know how much deeper deposits go. For all we know, we might have Neanderthals down there. We just haven't dug deep enough to know.' On site: Diros Project co-directors Michael Galaty and William Parkinson, of The Field Museum, overlooking Diros Bay where the cave is based in western Mani . A lot to learn: Researcher Takis Karkanas analyzing deposits in the 1,000 metre long Alepotrypa Cave .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron today called on US drugs giant Pfizer to ramp up its commitment to Britain before bidding again for rival UK firm AstraZeneca. The Prime Minister said he was 'not satisfied' with the American company's promises to safeguard British jobs. He told MPs: 'I want more.' Mr Cameron said he agreed with Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable who yesterday refused to rule out intervening to block a formal bid. David Cameron rejected Ed Miliband's accusation that he was acting as a 'cheerleader' for Pfizer's in its bid for Britain's AstraZeneca . David Cameron was prepared for Ed Miliband's assault on his handling of the bid - accusing Labour of setting up the rules governing foreign takeovers . But he warned the row must not trigger a retreat to protectionism. Mr Cameron said the UK 'benefits massively' from foreign companies investing cash in Britain. His remarks came after Labour leader Ed Miliband said there was 'deep concern' over the proposed takeover of AstraZeneca by Pfizer. Mr Miliband said: 'The deal would have an impact for decades to come on British jobs, British investment, British exports and British science.' The Labour leader called for an independent assessment of this bid and whether it is in the national interest. But the Prime Minister said: The . assessment I want is from the business department on this deal or, . indeed, because there isn't now an actual offer on the table, any . subsequent offer.' Mr . Cameron said the commitments made so far by Pfizer - including keeping . at least 20% of the research and development workforce in the UK - were . 'encouraging'. But he added: . 'Let me be absolutely clear, I'm not satisfied, I want more. But the . way to get more is to engage, not to stand up and play party politics. Labour party leader Ed Miliband went on the attack during Prime Minister's Questions - demanding an independent assessment of the US bid to see if it is good for Britain . 'The more we can do to strengthen the assurances the better.' AstraZeneca has so far resisted approaches from its rival. But the US giant has not given up hope of completing a £60 billion-plus deal - potentially the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British company. Fears have been raised that resulting cost-cutting could cause the loss of thousands of highly-skilled jobs and undermine the UK's science base. Mr Cameron dismissed suggestions from Labour leader Ed Miliband that he was 'cheerleading' for the deal by tasking the Cabinet Secretary and ministers to discuss the situation with both companies. He said: 'We are fighting for British science and I just think it is a pity that he is trying to play politics rather than backing the British national interest. 'I will judge all these things about does it expand British jobs, British investment, British science?' The Prime Minister said the country must not close its doors to foreign investors. 'Britain benefits massively from being open to investment. Nissan is now producing more cars than the whole of Italy,"" he said. 'Jaguar Land Rover, under Indian ownership, has created 9,000 jobs in the West Midlands since I became Prime Minister. 'Vodafone and indeed AstraZeneca have benefited from the backing of an open country to go out and build and buy businesses around the world. 'There is more inward investment into Britain today than the rest of the European Union combined. Don't let's put that at risk.' The PM also said it was 'absolutely right' for Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood - Britain's top civil servant - to engage with both companies. Mr Cameron said: 'Our entire approach is based upon trying to secure the best possible deal in terms of jobs, investment and science. 'That is why I believe it was absolutely right to ask the Cabinet Secretary to engage with Pfizer, just as we're engaging with AstraZeneca and I do find it extraordinary that we have been criticised for this.'","The Prime Minister says offer on the table 'encouraging'

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The Obama administration's Veterans Affairs Department scandal deepened on Wednesday, with a whistle-blower from a Texas VA hospital saying the health system is run like 'an organized crime syndicate' and a preliminary inspector general report declaring that veterans in Phoenix waited an average of 115 days to be seen by a doctor. The VA was rocked last month with allegations that 40 veterans died waiting for medical treatment at a health center in Phoenix, Arizona because staffers manipulated the appointment system to delay care. The Daily Beast reported Wednesday that those delays appear systematic and ordinary – and endorsed by some in positions of power in the Texas VA health system. Waiting and waiting and waiting: Wounded and sick veterans are waiting an average of 115 days for care in the Phoenix VA, while a manipulated appointment system made it look like a 24-day wait was typical . Disabled veterans make up a large contingent of those waiting for care at VA hospitals in at least 26 states . At the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System's Olin E Teague Veterans' Center, doctors debated now to back-date veterans' 'requested' appointment dates to make it look like published goals were being met . Obama has been an occasional visitor at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. During this visit, he prayed with a veteran and his family members . And the new . interim inspector general report found that at least 1,700 veterans . were denied spots on official waiting lists in Phoenix alone. And 84 per . cent of them waited longer than the 14-day limit that's etched into . published VA guidelines. Under Phoenix's phony reporting system, the 115-day delays appeared to be only 24 days long. In Phoenix, administrators changed computer records so it would appear that doctors were seeing veterans soon enough to satisfy existing standards. Meanwhile, they actually worked from a secret, off-the-books list. In Texas, the manipulation took the form of back-dating appointments and taking advantage of technicalities in published guidelines in order to avoid an overflow of patients. VA guidelines dictate that veterans should be seen by a medical professional within 14 days of the 'desired date' they request. Texas officials are accused of changing those desired dates in order to give schedulers more breathing room – and better employee performance reviews. The Daily Beast suggested that the wrongdoing has been going on, unpunished, for years, raising doubts about whether any internal review of the agency would likely change the status quo. 'For lack of a better term, you’ve got an organized crime syndicate,' a Texas VA whistle-blower told the website's reporter. 'People up on top are suddenly afraid they may actually be prosecuted and they’re pressuring the little guys down below to cover it all up.” 'I see it in the executives' eyes,' the whistle-blower added. 'They are worried.' Those performance reviews are key, since reporting subpar statistics means administrators 'won't stay a director very long and they certainly won’t get promoted,' the whistle-blower said. 'No one is getting rewarded for honesty. They pretty much have to lie, if they don’t they won’t go anywhere.' Some in VA leadership appear to be conscientious enough to demand high standards. In one email chain published by The Daily Beast, a scheduling coordinator named James Anderson told VA doctors statewide to change the 'desired date' for some veterans' care. The Central Texas VA Chief of Staff, William Harper, would hear none of it. 'You cannot do this!!!! This is essentially fraud,' he replied. 'The desired date is what it is and if we don’t meet the standard then we will work to improve.' Injuries you can't see: U.S. Army retired Sergeant Jim Mylott suffered a brain injury while serving as a Military Police Officer in Diwaniya, Iraq -- when a truck drove through four road blocks striking him and killing two others . Under fire: US Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki (C) is facing calls for his resignation over the VA medical care scandal . Silence: President Barack Obama didn't mention the Veterans Affairs Department scandal at all on Wednesday as he delivered the commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point . Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America CEO Paul Rieckhoff said the news could get far worse. 'This newest case just further illustrates that the scandal is much more far reaching than most people realize,' he said. 'Phoenix was just the tip of the iceberg. Scandal has become the new normal.' Congressional Republicans have responded to the crisis by demanding that VA Secretary Eric Shinseki allow veterans to seek private medical care – with full reimbursement – if they wait more 30 days or more for treatment. House Veterans Affairs Committee chair Rep. Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican, said Tuesday that he would soon introduce a bill to cement that demand into policy. 'We simply can't afford to wait for the results of another investigation into a problem we already know exists,' Miller said in a statement. 'That's why I'm calling on Secretary Shinseki to take emergency steps.' A VA spokesman responded in a statement that it was already redoubling its efforts nationwide. 'Each of our facilities is either enhancing their clinic capacity to help veterans get care sooner, or where we cannot increase capacity, increasing the care we acquire in the community through non-VA care,' statement read. 'Each of our facilities is reaching out to Veterans to coordinate the acceleration of their care.' One legislative proposal has already stalled in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate. The Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act passed in the House by a 390-33 margin . but a Senate committee chaired by the socialist Vermont . Sen. Bernie Sanders has delayed considering it until June. The bill would give Shineski and future VA secretaries broad authority to remove administrators who are complicit in delaying or denying care to veterans. Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn called for an FBI investigation on Wednesday. Wounded Iraq war veteran Joe Beimfohr receives care from the VA system, along with millions of other men and women who served in uniform . Robert Jesse (C), principal Deputy Undersecretary for Health in the Department of Veterans Affairs, has taken over since former Undersecretary Dr. Robert Petzel resigned, and is sparring with Congress over subpoenas . One good apple in a rotten barrel: Dr. William Harper (R) warned Texas VA doctors that back-dating 'requested' appointment dates was 'FRAUD' 'Hundreds . of our nation’s heroes have disappeared from the appointment books and . been denied medical care at the hands of scheming bureaucrats focused on . their own financial gain,' he said, 'instead of the health and . well-being of America’s veterans.' 'This . is a sad day for our nation and the only fitting response in the . short-term is for the president to direct the FBI to investigate these . reports immediately.' The . VA's health care division could have trouble explaining its failures . since records show it is flush with cash it hasn't been spending. The Daily Caller reported Tuesday that the VA will 'carry over' about $450 million in medical care funding from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015. Shinseki was given $54.6 billion to work with overall this year – an annual allocation $10 billion higher than in the first full-year Obama budget. That year the agency shifted $1.449 billion in medical-care funding, money that it couldn't spend, into the following year's budget. Even if veterans' care improves dramatically, the GOP is already making hay out of the scandal. On Wednesday the Republican National Committee launched a telephone 'robocall' and Twitter campaign declaring that President Barack Obama is responsible for the VA mess, and urging heavy turnout among Republican voters in November. The GOP is specifically tying the scandal to 10 vulnerable Democratic members of Congress, hoping to flip their seats to the Republican column. For VA administrators, avoiding patient backlogs and racking up a good rate of on-time medical care – whether records are accurate or not – can contribute by as much as 50 per cent to the performance-ratings scores that determine annual bonuses and career advancement.","Shocking inspector general report found average wait times of 115 days in Phoenix, although manipulated waiting lists made it look like just 24 days .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Travel experts in the US are predicting a six-year high for the number of flights taken this summer. Around 210 million - 2.28 million a day - holidaymakers and business flyers are expected to take a plane trip on US carriers between June 1 and August 31. It will be a rise of 1.5 per cent compared to last summer and the highest level since 2008, according to the trade and lobbying group, Airlines for America. Airline passengers are increasingly satisfied with their flights, according to a new US airline satisfaction study . The forecast includes 29.9 million travellers - or 325,000 a day - flying US airlines to international destinations, an all-time high. Canada, Mexico, the UK, Germany and Japan are the top five nonstop international destinations, based on published schedules. And, despite rising airline ticket prices and fees for everything from checked bags to changed flights, airline passengers are increasingly satisfied with their flights, according to the 2014 North America Airline satisfaction study. Passenger satisfaction measured at a record high 712 points on a scale of 1,000 - a 17-point increase from 2013. The airline study measures satisfaction with North American airlines based on seven criteria in order of importance: costs and fees; in-flight services; boarding, deplaning and baggage; flight crew, aircraft; check-in; and reservations. Satisfaction with costs and fees rose from 618 last year to 642 this year. Airlines are expecting more passengers to fly this summer than ever before . Alaska Airlines continued to rank first among North American legacy carriers, increasing its customers' satisfaction by 20 points to 737 points, followed by Delta Air Lines (693 points) and American Airlines (684 points). The average rating for the legacy carriers was 683 points out of a possible 1,000. Air Canada came in fourth with 683 points, followed by United Airlines (658 points) and US Airways (656 points). Customers prefer the low-cost carriers over the legacy carriers, awarding them an average of 763 points out of a possible 1,000 points. JetBlue Airways dominated the low-cost category, ranking first for the 10th consecutive year, with 789 points out of a possible 1,000 points. Southwest Airlines came in second place (778 points), followed by WestJet in third place (734 points). Despite these improvements in customer satisfaction, airlines don't do so well when compared with other industries it appears. Comparing airlines' average 712-point satisfaction, hotels (777 points), rental cars (775 points) and even mortgage lenders (771 points) do better in customer satisfaction, according to J.D.

It has raised concerns Britain's forces will produce a generation of senior officers 'who haven't felt the collar' of a criminal and lead to 'risks to the public', the President of the Police Superintendents' Association Derek Barnett has said. 'One of the benefits of having an operational grounding is that you have been able to deal with critical incidents, you have dealt with the very sad incidence of dead bodies,' he added . Fast track: Rules restricting young stars flying up the ranks of British policing will be relaxed, meaning some could be chief constables at 30 . This brat pack of talented police . officers could also become chief constables by the time they are 30 . under the new Government plans. Foreigners can also join the British . police for the first time while experienced individuals from other . industries like politics, business and the armed forces can be given . senior jobs. 'The fast-track-to-inspector scheme will attract the brightest with the most potential to go on to become leaders,' Mr Green said. 'Direct entry at senior ranks will make sure that there is access to the best pool of talent, those who have proven leadership and business skills and who can bring with them fresh thinking from other sectors.' Currently nobody under the age of 40 is in any of the 330-or-so top jobs in British policing, but the fast-track scheme could halve the 20 to 25 years it would take to get there. Damian Green: 'Direct entry at senior ranks will make sure that there is access to the best pool of talent', the policing minister said . Changes would also allow individuals like American supercop Bill Bratton, who tackled gang crime and reformed policing in New York and Los Angeles,  to run the Metropolitan Police. Mr Bratton was courted by David Cameron to run Scotland Yard in 2011, but was blocked from applying because of concerns about appointing a foreigner to a post with national security responsibilities. The overhaul is part of a package of reforms that were drawn up by ex-rail regulator Tom Winsor in the most wide-ranging review of police pay and conditions in more than 30 years. Changes: Supercop Bill Bratton, pictured running LA police, says he would love to run the Met as Downing Street is changing rules to allow foreigners to run British forces . Under his proposals, 'exceptional' applicants would have the chance to rise from civilian to inspector in just three years. Successful businessmen and women, along with members of the armed forces and the security services, should all be encouraged to apply to the fast-track scheme, Mr Winsor said. Mr Winsor, who is now Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary, previously said he wanted to end the notion of policing as an intellectually undemanding occupation. He added that the 'brightest and best' applicants with skills 'distinctly above those of factory workers' were needed. Sir Peter Fahy from the Association of Chief Police Officers said the changes could see existing officers frustrated in their bids for promotion. 'All chief constables have served on the beat, experiencing the reality of day-to-day operational policing with the public. This is the model used by other countries who have followed the British system such as the USA. Bill Bratton, former chief of New York started this way. The direct entry officer class model tends to be followed by para-military police forces such as the French CRS or the Italian Carabinieri. 'Acpo has no problem with bringing in expertise from outside and in many forces up to 50% of staff are non police officers. Every force has senior civilian staff in top leadership positions in such fields as human resources, finance and IT. On the other hand such matters as firearms operations, murder investigations and dealing with public disorder are commanded by those with proven expertise and records of achievement.' Damian Green predicted there would be a foreign Metropolitan . Police Commissioner in 'years rather than decades'. 'I have no idea [when], but, yeah, years rather than . decades. I think if five years ago you said ""can you envisage the Governor of . the Bank of England talking to you in a Canadian accent?"", you would have . thought that was a bit odd. 'But actually, Mark Carney is, I am told, the best . central banker in the world and it’s great that he’s going to apply those . talents in this country and the same will be true of senior policemen.' He said the Government was committed to the reforms, and the . consultation which would be announced today was on the implementation of the . plan. 'It will happen and we’re consulting on how best to do it. But I think bringing in new talent so that our very, very good police service . becomes even better in the future is absolutely essential to continue the . reform that has successfully led to a fall in crime in this country.' Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told a policing conference earlier this month that it was time to 'consider and support' direct entry. He added that he would like to see one in 10 senior officers recruited from outside the police force. In addition, a proposal to allow candidates from the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among others, to front up forces in England and Wales is expected. That will pave the way for a renewed interest in Mr Bratton, 65, who said that leading the Met is ‘the only job’ that interests him in the UK. The move will unsettle Bernard Hogan-Howe, Met commissioner since September 2011, who has faced criticism over his handling of the ‘plebgate’ affair involving former chief whip Andrew Mitchell. Fear: The London riots, which spread across the UK, shocked the nation and Bill Bratton's track-record in LA and New York is seen an ideal way to prevent a repeat . Mr Bratton, who was consulted by Mr Cameron over tackling gangs after the summer riots in 2011, was credited with halving the murder rate in New York  and cutting violent crime in Los Angeles. He advocates a zero-tolerance approach to policing. He said running the Met was a unique and internationally important post. ‘There are three Western police agencies that have great significance in international policing – London, New York and Los Angeles,’ he said. ‘I’ve had the privilege of leading the two police departments in the US that have that international impact and that is something that is part of my interest in the Met.’ At the heart of Bratton's policing tactics are the use of injunctions, which restrict the movements of those accused . of being in gangs or involved in organised crime. He . also uses the 'broken windows' theory - where he demands every crime . should be investigated, however small, as he believes it will also . reduce more serious crimes too.","Downing Street is changing rules about running UK forces .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Whenever you're on the verge of big business, the last thing you want is the skeletons in your closet being aired out to all and sundry. But that's exactly the problem that confronts One Direction's Louis Tomlinson who is believed to be on the verge of buying his beloved football club. Just days after shocking video footage of the 22-year-old apparently smoking cannabis in Peru emerged, it has been revealed that the singer plans to buy League One side Doncaster Rovers. But, lifelong Rovers fan Louis - who even made an appearance for the club's reserves team earlier this year - is said to be concerned the recent controversy could jeopardise his chances. Scroll down for video . One Direction's Louis Tomlinson, 22, has made a formal bid to buy League One side Doncaster Rovers and negotiations are said to be at an 'advanced stage' Louis, who was born in Doncaster, is a lifelong fan of Rovers and even made a professional appearance for the reserves team in February after signing to the club's books last summer . He has now taken his love for the club one step further - by joining forces with businessman John Ryan, who previously owned the club before selling off a large share to a consortium . According to The Sun, a source said: ‘The timing of . the Peru video has really upset him because he doesn’t want anything to . jeopardise the deal, which is very commercially sensitive and worth a . seven-figure sum.’ The pop star was embroiled in controversy this week after exclusive . MailOnline footage of him and bandmate Zayn Malik, 21, showed them smoking a suspicious looking roll-up. Neither have addressed the video but Louis is said to be concerned the 'scandal' could hinder his plans to takeover his hometown club. The singer, who was born in Doncaster, is a season-ticket holder at Rovers and made . his professional appearance for the reserves team in February after . signing to the club’s books last summer. He now plans to . take his love for the club one step further – by joining forces with . businessman John Ryan, who previously owned the club before selling off a . large share to a consortium. The pair are said to be in the . process of setting up a trust to buy the recently-relegated side and . negotiations of a formal bid are said to be at an ‘advanced stage’. It . is thought Louis and Mr Ryan – who still owns a quarter share of the . club – will act as co-chairmen if their bid is successful. The . pair, who hope to become the new owners as early as July, have . ambitions to take the club back to the Championship within a year and . into the Premiership within three. 'Joint . lit. Happy days!'  Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson smoked a 'roll up . cigarette' and joke about marijuana in a video taken in Lima, Peru, last . month . Controversial: In . MailOnline’s exclusive video, Louis Tomlinson, 22, can be heard putting . on an accent while speaking about doing drugs. He then says: ‘It’s . green only, Nig.’ The insider said Louis and Mr Ryan plan to buy the club – which was relegated from the Championship this season – outright. If successful, Louis would be the . first pop star chairman of an English football club since Elton John . famously took over at Watford in 1976. ‘This . is his passion project – and it will happen. He’s putting everything . into it because of his love for the side,’ the source said. A spokesman for Doncaster Rovers today confirmed the club was discussing a proposed takeover. It . is thought the singer will attract a number of new investors to the club . if he does purchase it – thanks to his worldwide following from One . Direction fans and supporters. He managed to draw a crowd of an additional 2,000 extra fans to the Keepmoat Stadium when he donned a Rovers shirt for a reserves match against Rotherham United in February. After the match, which ended 0-0, he told his 15.5 million Twitter followers: 'Wow what an incredible experience. Can't put into words how I feel. I will never forget pulling on my own Doncaster Rovers shirt! 'Really can't thank the team, the gaffer and every single person involved at Doncaster Rovers enough! I feel like a 10 year old again. 'And obviously a huge huge thank you to everyone who came down :) a real credit to our fans :) hope it was a good day out!' One Direction's Louis Tomlinson spent time with Doncaster's reserves side earlier this year and joined in with a training session (pictured) Louis managed to draw a crowd of an additional 2,000 extra fans at the Keepmoat Stadium when he donned a Rovers shirt for a reserves match against Rotherham United in February . However, many fans have turned their back on the star and One Direction after the controversial footage of him and Zayn talking about drugs and smoking a ‘joint’ emerged. Louis has also been further lambasted for apparently using a racial slur in the video which was filmed as they were being escorted by car to a show in Lima, Peru, on April 27. In the footage, Louis uses the word 'nig' - which fans say is a shortened version of the N-word. One Direction fans - as well as MPs and racism campaigners – have demanded apologies from the band in light of the video. They say the boy band has abused their position as role models and risked encouraging their young fans to copy them. Even Louis’ father, Troy Austin, 45, said he was ‘worried’ for his son after watching the controversial footage. He said his son had previously vowed to never touch drugs or get a tattoo and said ‘fame and money have changed him’. Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik didn't address the controversy when One Direction played at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on Wednesday night (pictured) Despite the band putting on a united show at the opening night of their tour, it is thought the scandal could create a divide in the band . Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said: ‘He’s a different person to that person three years ago. ‘I do believe that being that famous will be taking its toll on them. They need a serious talking to.’ However, the band have remained unusually quiet and didn’t make any apology for the controversy when they performed to 50,000 people at Sunderland football club's Stadium of Light on Wednesday for the opening night of their UK tour. The only reference made to the scandal was by bandmate Liam Payne, 20, who joked about his skinny jeans then, in response to something shouted by a member of the crowd, added: ‘No more media attention, please.’ Despite the band putting on a united show at the opening night of their tour, it is thought the scandal has created somewhat of a divide in the band. Harry Styles reportedly blasted Louis and Zayn for their ‘stupid and reckless’ antics, while it is also understood he and Niall Horan, 20, already take separate ‘non-smoking’ private jets to gigs to avoid their bandmates’ smoking. MailOnline has contacted representatives of Louis Tomlinson for comment.","The 22-year-old singer is 'setting up a trust to buy League One club in July'

"By . Jessica Jerreat . The LA Clippers have been sold to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in a $2 billion deal after their previous owner Donald Sterling was given a NBA ban over racist remarks. Ballmer, who retired from Microsoft in February, is said to have reached a binding agreement with Sterling's wife, Shelly, who had been handling the sale of the team. The sale comes just days before a NBA panel was due to meet to discuss revoking Sterling's ownership over the team in light of the racism scandal last month. Donald Sterling's female friend tries to cover her face as the pair walk to a coffee shop in Los Angeles . As disgraced LA Clippers owner Sterling walked out of Rite Aid with a bar of chocolate, his friend ducked for cover behind a car . Sterling chats on the phone while his mystery companion covers up in a scarf outside a Starbucks . On the day . the deal was announced, Sterling was spotted looking relaxed as he had . coffee with a mysterious woman in Los Angeles. While the 80-year-old appeared at ease, his redheaded companion appeared embarrassed and tried to cover her face with a scarf. Sterling had handed control of the sale negotiations to his wife afterthe NBA banned him for life in April over racist comments. While the deal between Balmer and Shelly Sterling has been agreed, it still has to pass the approval of a NBA panel. Although Sterling's lawyer had said he . planned to fight his NBA ban and push to remove him as Clippers owner, . it seemed that Sterling was not standing in the way of his wife's . efforts to sell the team. Steve Ballmer punches the air as he watches the Clippers play the Golden State Warriors in April . Ballmer, who retired as CEO of Microsoft in February, has promised that the Clippers will remain based in LA . The likely . new owner, Ballmer, retired from Microsoft in February after 14 years . as CEO, and has an estimated fortune of $20.3 billion, KCTV5 reported. The Clippers have not yet confirmed the sale to Ballmer. The team had been bought by Sterling for $12.5 million in 1981. Before the deal can be sealed, it has to be approved by the NBA - and Sterling, who had dithered over whether he would allow his wife to sell the team he has owned for more than 30 years. Sterling's attorney, Maxwell Blecher, told CNN: 'The league on Tuesday has a guillotine over his head.' He . added that Sterling planned to challenge their right to remove his team . over an illegally recorded conversation in which he allegedly made . racist remarks. 'He . wants to be vindicated. He doesn't want his tombstone to say, ""Here . lies Donald Sterling, racist"". And the NBA has the power to make that . right,' Blecher said.

The mystery redhead keeps her head bowed as Sterling leads the way from the drug store to the coffee shop . For a brief moment the woman Sterling was having coffee with reveals her face as the pair walk across a parking lot . Ballmer, . 58, beat off a $1.6 billion bid from a group including David Geffen, . Oprah Winfrey, Larry Ellison, and the Guggenheim Group, the LA Times reported. The $2 billion price tag for the team is nearly the fourth highest price for a NBA team. The highest price for a team was when the Dodgers were sold for $2.1 billion in 2012. Ballmer, . who stood down from his role at Microsoft earlier this year, has . promised that if the deal is successful, the team will remain in LA and . not be moved to his hometown of Seattle. While Sterling looks unfazed at having his photo taken, his companion turns away from the cameras . The sale came on the same day results from an E-Poll showed 92 per cent of Americans had named Sterling as the most hated man. The . poll of 1,100 Americans aged between 13 and 49 put Sterling at the top . of the hate list, ahead of convicted fraudster Bernie Madoff, OJ Simpson . and Justin Bieber. 1 Donald Sterling          92 percent2 Bernie Madoff            90 percent3 O.J.

"By . Francesca Chambers . Federal lawmakers are lining up to tell President Barack Obama to fire Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki now that an inspector general report has confirmed that a Phoenix, Arizona,VA hospital lied about how long veterans were waiting for care. 'If Secretary Shinseki does not step down voluntarily, then I call . on the president of the United States to relieve him of his duties, to . fire him,' Arizona Senator John McCain, a Republican, said during at a press conference this afternoon at his Phoenix office. 'If Secretary Shinseki does not step down voluntarily, then I call on the president of the United States to relieve him of his duties, to fire him,' Arizona Senator John McCain said on Wednesday . Arizona Senators John McCain, left, and Jeff Flake, right, sharply criticized President Obama's slow response to the VA crisis Wednesday afternoon . Today's report 'makes it clear that . the systemic problems' at the VA 'are so entrenched that they require . new leadership to be fixed,' Colorado Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat, said in a . statement. 'Secretary Shinseki must step down.' 'Sec. Shinseki has proven time and again he is not that leader. That’s why . it’s time for him to go,' House Veteran's Affairs committee chairman Jeff Miller, a Republican from Florida, chimed in. An Inspector General report released today found that at least 1,700 veterans . were put on secret waiting lists at the VA health care system in Phoenix, Arizona. This is the same facility that is linked to the deaths of 40 veterans who perished while waiting for care. Managers of the Phoenix VA Health Care System claimed veterans were only waiting two weeks to a month for appointments, when in reality they were often waiting an average of 115 days to be seen by VA doctors for the first time, the IG's review found. And that's just the results from the initial report. A total of 26 VA hospitals are now under investigation. 'With the launch of inspections of VA . facilities nationwide, it’s time to put the partisanship aside and focus . on what’s right for our veterans,' Montana Senator John Walsh said. 'It is time for President Obama to remove Secretary Shinseki from office,' the Democratic congressman said in a statement. 'The IG report tells us info we already knew from a 2013 report,' Republican Senator Jerry Moran, a longtime member of Congress' Veterans Affairs committees, tweeted. 'How many . more studies is it going to take for this Admin to take action?' Shinseki said in a statement that the initial findings of the IG report were 'reprehensible.' He noted that the VA has been conducting an internal review of the Phoenix hospital since April and officials there are already on leave. But no one from the facility will be fired at this time, he said. 'It is important to allow OIG’s independent and objective review to proceed until completion,' Shinseki said. 'OIG has requested that VA take no additional personnel actions in Phoenix until their review is complete.' Since the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General's interim report was released yesterday, a slew of lawmakers have called on Shinseki, right, to resign. Shinseki is pictured here on Memorial Day during a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia . Since the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General's interim report was released today, a slew of other lawmakers have called on Shinseki to resign and many have also called for the Department of Justice to launch a criminal investigation. 'Leadership starts at the top,' Montana Rep. Steve Daines, a Democrat, tweeted. 'The horrific misconduct that occurred under the watch of Secretary . Shinseki is unacceptable and leaves our Veterans untrusting of the . department,' Rep. Dennis Ross, a Democrat from Florida, said. Arizona Democratic Rep. Krysten Sinema called the report 'unconscionable' and Republican Rep. Paul Gosar said the VA's behavior was 'disgraceful, . despicable . and . dangerous.' 'This is a sad day for our nation and the only . fitting response in the short-term is for the President to direct the . FBI to investigate these reports immediately,' Texas Senator John Cornyn said in a statement. Department of Justice chief Eric Holder had said previously his agency had no plans to look into the VA scandal. Today's report could change his calculus, however. 'These allegations are . not just administrative problems. These are criminal problems,' McCain said during today's presser. 'We need . the FBI and the Department of Justice to be involved in this . investigation.' Leading Veterans group the American Legion had already called for Shinseki to step down over the initial allegations. Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America founder Paul Rieckhoff said today that the IG report was 'damning and outrageous.' 'It also reveals the need for a criminal investigation,' he said. 'The VA’s problems are broad and deep - and President Obama and his team haven’t demonstrated they can fix it.' He said he was withholding issuing a statement on Shinseki specifically until he took the temperature of other members of his group, though. President Obama said at a press conference last week that he would wait to see the results of the VA's investigation before making any decisions about Secretary Shinseki. 'At this stage, Rick is committed to solving the problem, and working with us to do it,' Obama said, fondly referring to Shinseki by his nickname. 'And . I know that Rick, his attitude is, if he does not think he can do a . good job on this, and if he thinks he's let our veterans down, then I am . sure that he is not gonna be interested in committing to serve,' Obama continued. The President peppered the VA secretary with with praise even as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were urging him to take bold act. The president has not yet commented on the release of the Inspector General report today, however, Deputy . National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told CNN this afternoon that . President Obama finds today's report 'deeply troubling.' The senior administration official would not say where the president stands on Shinseki's job status, saying only, 'We're focused on making . sure these veterans who've delivered for this country get the care they . need.'","'I call on the president of the United States to relieve him of his duties, to fire him,' McCain said, presuming Eric Shinseki won't leave his VA job .

"By . James Rush . A boy with a shaking voice made the first distress call from a sinking South Korean ferry, three minutes after the vessel made its final turn, it has been revealed. The boy was put through to the fire service after calling the emergency 119 number, before being forwarded to the coastguard two minutes later. His call was followed by about 20 others from children on board the ship, a fire service officer has told Reuters. Scroll down for video . Searchers and divers look for people believed to have been trapped in the sunken ferry Sewol off the southern coast near Jindo, south of Seoul, South Korea . The Sewol ferry sank last Wednesday on a routine trip south from the port of Incheon to the traditional honeymoon island of Jeju. Pictured is the search and rescue operation on Tuesday . A family member of a missing passenger prays while waiting for news from rescue and salvage teams at the port in Jindo . The Sewol ferry sank last Wednesday on a routine trip south from the port of Incheon to the traditional honeymoon island of Jeju. Of the 476 passengers and crew on board, 339 were children and teachers on a high school outing. Only 174 people have been rescued and the remainder are all presumed to have drowned. The boy who made the first call, with the family name of Choi, is among the missing. His voice was shaking and sounded urgent, a fire officer told MBC TV. It took a while to identify the ship as the Sewol. 'Save us! We're on a ship and I think it's sinking,' Yonhap news agency quoted him as saying. The fire service official asked him to switch the phone to the captain, and the boy replied: 'Do you mean teacher?' The pronunciation of the words for 'captain' and 'teacher' is similar in Korean. Emergency service workers carry a body, recovered from the capsized passenger ship Sewol, to an ambulance at the port in Jindo on Tuesday .

Family members of missing passengers on the capsized South Korean ferry Sewol look out to sea at a port in Jindo, where family members of missing passengers gathered on Tuesday . The captain of the ship, Lee Joon-seok, 69, and other crew members have been arrested on negligence charges. Lee was also charged with undertaking an 'excessive change of course without slowing down'. Several crew members, including the captain, left the ferry as it was sinking, witnesses have said, after passengers were told to stay in their cabins. President Park Geun-hye said on Monday that instruction was tantamount to an 'act of murder'. A 22-year-old female crew member however has been hailed a hero after she stayed behind to help students off the boat. A relative of a passenger aboard the sunken Sewol ferry awaits news on his missing loved one at a port in Jindo . Park Jee-Young handed out life jackets to students on the boat in a bid to help them escape while the ferry was sinking, even though she wasn't wearing a life vest, South Korean media reported. Witnesses told Yonhap news agency that she told students that crew members must stay on the ship until everyone else leaves, and that she would follow them after helping passengers. Her body was one of the first to be recovered after the ferry sank and now lies in a funeral home in the city of Incheon. Floral tributes left at the memorial room contained messages including 'We will always remembers your sacrifice' and 'Hero', it has been reported. An aunt of the 22-year-old, who did not want to give her name, told CNN: 'This is so unfair that our Jee Young had to die while the captain ran away. 'Jee Young was so responsible, and the captain just ran away.' Park is reported to have left college to work for the ferry company in order to support her family following the death of her father two years ago. Other members of the crew are also reported to have given their lifejackets to passengers as the ferry sank. Others worked from rescue boats to break windows with hammers and pull people trapped in cabins to safety. At least seven of the 29 crew members are missing or dead, and several of those who survived stayed on or near the ship to help passengers, Associated Press has reported. Two policemen stand guard as a priest says prayers at the port in Jindo, where family members are waiting . Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the South Korean ferry which sank last week, is pictured in a promotional video . Four crew members appeared in court on Tuesday and were briefly questioned by reporters before being taken back into custody. One unidentified second mate said they had tried to reach the lifeboats, but were unable to because of the tilt. Only two of the vessel's 46 lifeboats were deployed. Two first mates, one second mate and the chief engineer stood with their heads lowered and it was impossible to tell who was speaking. Coast Guard divers prepare to jump into the water during a search and rescue operation for missing people at the ferry Sewol sinking site . One said there had been a mistake as the boat made a turn. Another said there was an eventual order to abandon ship. He said the crew gathered on the bridge and tried to restore balance, but could not. 'Maybe the steering gear was broken,' one said. Media said the ship lost power for 36 seconds, which could have been a factor. Public broadcaster KBS, quoting transcripts of the conversation between the crew and sea traffic control, the Jindo Vessel Traffic Services Centre, said the passengers were told repeatedly to stay put. For half an hour, the crew on the third deck kept asking the bridge by walkie-talkie whether or not they should make the order to abandon ship, KBS said. No one answered. 'At the time, we could not confirm what the situation was on the bridge,' KBS quoted a crew member as saying. 'We kept trying to find out but ... since there was no instruction coming from the bridge, the crew on the third floor followed the instructions on the manual and kept making ""stay where you are"" announcements. At least three times.' Lee was not on the bridge when the ship turned. Navigation was in the hands of a 26-year old third mate who was in charge for the first time on that part of the journey, according to crew members.

Wearing tracksuit bottoms and a polo shirt with the England rugby logo on it, Harry was clearly in a boisterous mood as he began the kick-around as an outfielder. Aryon Tandel, nine, said: ‘He tackled me and won the ball but I managed to tackle him back. He was taking it quite seriously.’ Brandon Norman, eight, scored a goal against Harry’s team. Good sport: A handshake from the prince . ‘He gave me a tap around the ear and said well done,’ Brandon said. The prince, vice patron of the Rugby Football Union, also joined in a game of touch rugby. George Hill, nine, said: ‘He told me I had to stay behind the ball and joked that if I went in front again he would slap me.’ Harry met participants in the Prince’s Trust Team Programme, which helps disadvantaged young people, then travelled to the Suffolk Show to meet young farmers and watch a Royal British Legion parade.","Young royal took a turn in the undersized goal at the Inspire Suffolk project .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back has been voted the greatest movie of all time in a poll of more than 250,000 film fans. The film, which came out in cinemas in 1980 three years after the first Star Wars movie, topped a poll of 301 titles in Empire magazine beating Francis Ford Coppola's mafia masterpiece The Godfather into second place. Batman sequel The Dark Knight came in third with The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction rounding off the top five. Classic: Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back has topped a poll to be named the greatest film of all time . Star Wars creator George Lucas said it was 'a privilege' to see the film top the poll. He said: 'The fans like The Empire Strikes Back the best, partly because it is so dark. It's an overall story and as it happens in the second act, things get dark. 'I never really planned it to be three separate films but when it became three separate films, it had an interesting effect of each film having its own personality, caused by the plot.' Star Wars creator George Lucas said it was 'a privilege' to see the film top the poll . Other films in the top 10 include the first Star Wars film, Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Jaws. Empire's editor-In-chief Mark Dinning said: 'We are delighted, if not surprised, that The Empire Strikes Back has been voted the Number One Greatest Movie Of All Time, by the hundreds of thousands of readers of Empire. 'This is a movie that when it was released managed to make Star Wars both bigger and more intimate all at the same time. 'And today it retains all of its power, wit, heart and spectacle. 'With Star Wars very much back in the current conversation with J.J. Abrams shooting Episode VII, this is a timely reminder of the power of Star Wars to capture the imagination of film fans the world over. 'It may be set in a galaxy far far away, but this is a series of movies that will always be very close to our hearts. And, for now at least, The Empire Strikes Back is this indelible franchise at the very top of its game.'","Sci-fi classic takes top spot in Empire magazine poll .

"By . James  Nye . On June 6, 1944, HMS Belfast fired the shots that launched the D-Day landings - heralding the liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany. Aboard the flagship was Hollywood director George Stevens, who captured the historic event on one of the earliest 16mm color cameras for his own personal records. He continued to film the war in kodachrome through the beaches of Normandy, onwards to the liberation of Paris, confronting the horrors of German concentration camps and finally, entering a war-ravaged Berlin. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Scroll Down for Video . Ok, let's go: HMS Belfast fired the opening shots of D-Day in June 6, 1944, signifying the largest amphibious invasion in history . Armada: One of 'Steven's irregulars' films the combined American, British and Canadian invasion force that landed on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944 . Might: British warships escort their landing craft to the three beaches they and the Canadians were earmarked to invade - Sword, Juno and Gold . Hollywood: Director George Stevens at his camera aboard HMS Belfast - he would later go on to win two Oscar's in the 1950s . Bearing witness: Writers, directors and cameramen from the special coverage unit of the Allied expeditionary force fanned out among the Allied armies on D-Day to cover the 'greatest seaborne invasion in history' His extremely rare film went unseen for decades until his son discovered the developed film after his father's death - providing color images of pivotal moments hitherto recorded in black-and-white. Stevens, who made his name in the 1930s, directing Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in 'Swing Time' in 1936, was dispatched to Europe by General Dwight Eisenhower to head up what he called 'combat motion-picture coverage.' Planning: Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery contemplates one of his many victories as Allied forces launched their assault on Nazi forces in Europe . Clearing mines: Each town in Northern France that the Allies fought the Germans over came at a great cost - as street-to-street fighting, snipers and land mines took their toll on the liberating forces . Decimated: Entire swathes of northern France were destroyed during the fighting that expelled the German forces . Chaos: Rustic French towns lay in ruins after the fierce fighting between Allied and Nazi forces . Total ruins: An army jeep drives through what is left of a French town filmed by the color camera of George Stevens . The Supreme Allied Commander was concerned by the success of Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda movies and wanted to produce his own 35mm monochrome film for newsreels back home. While those were a success, it was the personal footage that Stevens shot with his own 16mm camera that fascinates today, released for the first time this month on Blu-Ray. The unseen film discovered by George Stevens Jr. was turned into 1994's documentary , D-Day to Berlin - giving an incredible glimpse into the bittersweet final days of the greatest conflict known to man. In the documentary, Stevens recalls the first time he watched the films, astonished to see his father on board the HMS Belfast, preparing to land on French soil. Son: George Stevens Jr. discovered his father's developed but unedited color film footage of the Second World War and converted it into a documentary called 'D-Day to Berlin' Liberators: American soldier are greeted like heroes as they enter Paris in late August, 1944, after months of heavy fighting . Heroes: America soldier are greeted by Parisian women as they roll their forces into Paris - which spent almost four years under Nazi control . Release: Four years after Nazi forces goose-stepped down the Champs Elysees, American soldiers ride down the Parisian boulevard to a rapturous response from the city folk . Return: General Charles de Gaulle is welcomed to the victory parade in Paris on August 29, 1944 . 'This film came on and it was sort of grey-blue skies and barrage balloons, those big things that hung in the sky, and it was on a ship. 'It turned out to be the HMS Belfast, and it was suddenly I realized the morning of the 6th of June, the beginning of the greatest seaborne invasion in history,' he said in a recent interview according to The Daily Telegraph. 'I had this feeling that my eyes were the first eyes that hadn't been there who were seeing this day in color, and I watched this film unfold and on this ship - and all of these men with their flak jackets and anticipation of this day - and around a corner on the ship comes this man - helmet and jacket - and walks into a close-up, and it's my 37-year-old father. It was so moving.' The filmmaker, who later would win Oscar's for directing 1951's 'A Place in the Sun' and 1956's 'Giant' begins his color film footage of the war on that fateful day, almost 70 years ago. Next stop Berlin: George Stevens then traveled with American troops as they made their way across the heartland of Germany . Allies: As they drove further and further into Germany - they were greeted by the flags of the Big Three - Great Britain, The Soviet Union and The United States . His remarkable historical account takes his filming unit across decimated French towns, were street-to-street fighting proved an attritional slog. Onwards from there, Stevens witnessed first hand the liberation of Paris, where Generals Charles De Gaulle, Patton and Montgomery all vied behind the scenes for battlefield glory. Stevens films the launch of the failed Operation Market Garden, popularly known as 'A Bridge too Far', in which British and American paratroopers failed to take Arnhem - to arguably shorten the war. At Dachau concentration camp, Stevens saw the sheer horror of humanity - his color images of dead bodies providing a glimpse of the evil of the Nazi final solution. Horrors: But at Dachau, Stevens was confronted with the full evil capabilities of man at the concentration camp . Disgust: He saw first-hand and filmed in color what the Nazi's had committed as they sought their final solution . Heartbreaking: Many of the Dachau concentration camp 'inmates' were quarantined and sprayed with DDT following a typhus outbreak to prevent further deaths . Cowardly: Following liberation, some of the German troops in Dachau pretended to be Jewish prisoners to avoid arrest and punishment, according to George Stevens' reports . Grainy: At the Elbe, Soviet troops crossed the river to meet American soldiers for their historic first meeting . 'It was extraordinary to see them all together': A week after leaving Nordhausen, German Army Group B had been encircled. This was the largest surrender of WWII that had been photographed . In color: This grainy grab of George Stevens footage shows the moment that Soviet and American forces exchanged flags as they met on the banks of the Elbe . Final destination: Once victory was secured after VE-Day, George Stevens filmed the aftermath at the Brandenburg gate in a decimated Berlin . The Allies drove eastward: General Bradley's 12th Army Group made contact with Ukrainian personnel near the German town of Torgau on the banks of the Elbe, linking the Americans and Russian army . Stevens then carried on into Germany and captured the momentous meeting of the forces of the United States and the Soviet Union on the banks of the Elbe. D-Day to Berlin is narrated by Stevens Jr. and contains interviews with his father's film crew, known as the 'Stevens irregulars'. 'We thought at the time that this was the only color film of the war in Europe. As it turned out, there was some German film that had not yet been discovered,' he said. 'But it is the greatest body of color film, and World War II was a black-and-white war. That's how we see it. That's how we saw it. And suddenly to see it in color, it just took on a whole other dimension.'","Hollywood director George Stevens compiled stunning color documentary footage of the final days of World War 2 .

"By . Associated Press . The unnamed child was made to walk a mile home from school (picture posed by a model) A judge sentenced a Hawaii man to one year of probation and a $200 fine for making his son walk a mile home from school as a form of discipline. Judge Kathleen Watanabe called the punishment 'old-school' and no longer appropriate, the Garden Island newspaper reported Thursday. Robert Demond of Kilauea said he picked up his son from school and asked about a matter that had been brought to his attention. When the son didn't respond, Demond made him walk home to think about his actions. The age of the boy is unclear. Demond's attorney and a prosecutor didn't immediately respond to a request seeking comment from The Associated Press. Demond was also ordered to attend a parenting class after being convicted of endangering the welfare of a minor, a misdemeanor. Demond pleaded no contest and said he would handle the situation differently now after the case went through two courts. Demond told Watanabe in court on Wednesday that he didn't think the punishment was morally wrong or criminal. He said it was a common form of punishment when he was growing up. Watanabe said times are different today, given child predators and traffic. Demond's attorney Margaret Hanson argued Demond had no criminal history and isn't a risk to the community. Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Gary Nelson said the punishment was inappropriate but Demond did it to teach his son a lesson, not out of anger.","Judge called punishment 'old-school' and no longer appropriate .

"By . Fiona Keating . It’s like a science experiment which has gone horribly wrong. The weirdly hypnotic event of a piece of putty devouring a magnet was captured on camera by Scott Lawson . The YouTube video clip took Lawson an hour and a half to film, but thanks to a time-lapse sequence, it can be seen in all its glory over a matter of minutes. However, it might need to be played repeatedly to make sure your eyes aren’t playing tricks. Scroll down for video . Separate: The two objects begin completely apart but placed close together . Fatal attraction: An iron-infused lump of putty makes its move on the magnet . Going: Ferromagnetic particles in the putty are strongly attracted to the magnet and very slowly engulf the surface of the magnet . Going: The magnet shown is a powerful neodymium iron boron magnet, can disable the magnetic strip on a credit card . Gone but not forgotten: The magnet is completely engulfed by the putty . The putty’s seemingly magical properties can be explained by science, as the material is infused with millions of micron-sized ferromagnetic particles. As Lawson explains on his YouTube page: ‘Ferromagnetic particles in the putty are strongly attracted to the magnet and very slowly engulf the surface of the magnet. ‘The putty looks and feels like regular silly putty, but the difference lies in the fact that it has been infused with millions of micron-sized ferrous particles.’ And it wouldn't work with just any old magnet, as the one in the video has very special properties. Lawson noted that the magnet shown in the clip is a powerful neodymium iron boron magnet. It’s the type that can destroy a TV screen or disable the magnetic strip on a credit card. Eventually, the putty would arrange itself around the magnet so it's as evenly distributed as possible. An estimated 140 million people use magnetic therapy to relieve pain, improve circulation, reduce swelling, minimize stiffness, and increase overall performance. They include professional athletes, doctors and chiropractors. Scientist and medical experts believe that magnets heal and strengthen the body. A review in the Journal of Psychiatric Research suggests that repetitive magnetic stimulation benefits numerous psychiatric disorders, including depression and mania. A strong magnetic field is used to induce electric currents that modulate the neuronal circuits; these changes resemble those produced by antidepressant drugs. double-blind studies at Baylor College of Medicine, published in the Archives of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine concluded that permanent magnets reduce pain in post-polio patients. The results were reported in The New York Times. Time magazine also reported on the growing use of magnets by champion golfers and other professional athletes to relieve pain and improve strength. Magnetic therapy has long been a significant component of the health industry in Japan and China. Therapeutic applications of magnetic fields are now becoming a scientifically acceptable and respected part of the medical communities of the United States and Europe. There are now Neuromagnetics Institutes and the Bioelectromagnetics Societies all over the world which use magnets to treat and cure a wide range of illnesses and injuries. Evidence gained from research suggests that magnetic therapy may: •    Relieve pain •    Reduce inflammation •    Naturally increase the production of melatonin and the growth hormone •    Restore energy •    Increase blood circulation and release of oxygen from free radicals •    Prevent or reverse infectious states and degenerative diseases •    Promote metabolic processing of toxins •    Support the healing process .","YouTube video shows the incredible powers of putty which has a mind of its own .

"By . Ryan Lipman . An invasion of aggressive mosquito could spell disaster as they threaten to end the great Australian outdoor barbecue. The exotic Asian tiger mosquito is capable of spreading dengue fever to southern capital cities including Sydney and Brisbane. While it's impossible to say exactly when we can expect to see the pest make Australia home, scientists are certain they will arrive here. 'It's definitely only a matter of time,' QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute associate professor Greg Devine told AAP. Asian tiger mosquito: The large and aggressive pest is set to invade Australia according to scientists . The species can carry diseases including dengue, yellow fever, Ross River and chikungunya virus and because they thrive in and around homes, could put Australia's outdoor lifestyle at risk . 'It arrived in the Torres Strait about 2005, but of course that's not the only route at which it can come in. 'There is no doubt it is coming eventually because it's been picked up so many times at Australia's borders.' But in a bid to stay ahead of the pests, Queensland scientists are breeding the highly invasive species, which is able to bite dozens of times a minute. The scientists are studying the only colony of the mosquito in Australia, wisely kept behind locked doors in the Brisbane medical research institute. Brisbane's QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute is home to Australia's only colony of the mosquito, which is being studied by scientists . Associate professor Greg Devine, pictured, said it was a matter of when the pest spread to cities including Brisbane and Sydney . Associate prof Devine said the research is critical because the Asian tiger mosquitoes can introduce the debilitating chikungunya virus and spread diseases such as dengue. 'What we'd like to understand is the real risk of transmission in urban centres like Brisbane and Sydney,' he said. 'We are also looking at the way it would interact with native mosquitoes so we can determine how rapid its impact will be.' Most concerning however, is the risk the pest posed to the outdoor lifestyle enjoyed by so many Australians, because the mosquitos flourish in and around homes and are capable on biting all day. 'It's come to be known as the barbecue stopper, and for good reason,' associate prof Devine said. But the large pest can also spread diseases such as yellow fever, Ross River virus and chikungunya. Common in southeast Asia, there is currently no treatment for the chikungunya virus, which can leave those bitten with severe joint pain for months. Stay away!

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Hoards of giant tropical Sunfish have invaded the North Sea because of strong winds, scientists have revealed. The massive Sunfish - which weigh an average 157st each and measure 15ft by 12ft - have been spotted in Lincolnshire, Kent and Norfolk. Large shoals of Sunfish - the largest bony fish in the world - have been tempted away from the mid-Atlantic by a massive hatch of jellyfish, which is their main food. Marine expert Paul Lee with the giant sunfish he stumbled across earlier this month in Norfolk . Sea monster: Ocean sunfish can measure 15ft across from fin to fin and 12 feet from nose to tail . Marine scientists believe the sunfish, whose scientific name is Mola mola, have been carried round Scotland to the North Sea by strong prevailing winds and currents. Here they have been dying because they cannot easily tolerate water temperatures below 12C. The British Marine Life Study Society has recorded significantly more sightings of sunfish on the East Coast than last year. In January this year a sunfish was found on the beach in seaside resort Margate in Kent.Then dog walker Matt Hyde, 44, found another while walking his Labrador Jimmy along The Sandilands beach near Sutton-on-Sea. Wildlife enthusiast Carl Chapman made a third discovery of a dead sunfish on the beach in Overstrand, Norfolk, on December 9. In early December Carl Chapman (pictured above) found a dead sunfish in Norfolk. November a six-stone sunfish was discovered washed up along The Sandilands beach near Sutton-on-Sea, Lincolnshire. Back in January another Mola mola was found on a British beach - this time at the seaside resort of Margate in Kent. Scientists believe they were following a shoal of jellyfish when they were caught by strong prevailing winds. The sunfish, which can grow up to a whopping 157st, died due to the cold as they find it difficult to tolerate water temperatures below 12C. Other recent unusual finds along our coastline include a 35ft sperm whale which was discovered 14 miles from Sandilands at Skegness Pier in April. In 2011 a 55ft fin whale washed up on the beach in Lynmouth, Devon, which normally lives far away in the North Atlantic. In 2008 an extremely rare 12ft Sowerby's beaked whale and a baby Risso's dolphin were found within days of each other on the western shores of St Agnes on the Isles of Scilly. Andy Horton, director of the British Marine Life Study Society, has recorded more sightings of sunfish on the East Coast than last year. He said: 'It is rare and unusual to get sunfish in the North Sea. They are mainly found in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and the furthest I had ever previously seen them go is the Cornish coast. 'When there are stronger prevailing winds and currents the jellyfish and sunfish are carried to the South West coast of Britain. 'Then if the prevailing winds are strong enough some navigate around Scotland to the North Sea. The levels in the North Sea are higher this year. 'For sunfish to be washed up is even rarer as the prevailing winds would usually propel it away from land. 'I have heard of sightings in Irish and Welsh waters but on an English beach on the east coast is rare.' Disc-like sunfish weigh an average 2,200lbs and measure 15ft across from fin to fin and 12 feet from nose to tail. The sunfish swims on its side on the surface to gain heat from the sun, which is how it got its English name. Its scientific name, Mola mola, is based . on the Latin for 'millstone' which it was thought to resemble due to . its colour, rough skin and round shape. Its top and bottom teeth are fused to form a beak and it has claw-like teeth in its throat to help mash its diet of jellyfish. The sunfish's skin, which is covered in dense mucus, is so leathery that it is host to more dermal parasites than any other sea creature. It has even been reported to leap 10 feet out of the water, supposedly in an attempt to rid itself of infestations. The giant sunfish which washed up on the Norfolk coast. It may have been caught in a strong current that carried it around Scotland . Young fish are silvery in colour and adults are usually grey above, silvery grey to brown on the side, and paler or dusky on the belly, with differing mottling and spots. They have a unique ability to suck and spit water at the same time, which helps drag in their prey.Sunfish develop their truncated, bullet-like shape because the back fin which they are born with never grows. Instead, it folds into itself as the enormous creature matures, creating a rounded rudder called a clavus. They tend to swim alone and their mating practices are poorly understood. They live 10 years in captivity but their lifespan in the wild hasn't been confirmed. Sunfish have been recorded in British waters before but their appearance is becoming more and more regular - a fact attributed to the rising temperatures of UK seas. The fish are also known to swim of course when following shoals of small sealife, which they feed off.","Sunfish usually found in tropical and temperate waters .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Suspect: Police believe Michael Sheer, 21, shot dead his parents Mark and Lydia Sheer and sister Amy Sheer, 15, before turning the gun on himself in a murder-suicide . A 21-year-old man is believed to have shot dead his parents and teen sister in a bloody memorial day murder-suicide, but the motive for the attack remains a mystery. Michael Sheer killed his parents Mark and Lydia Sheer, 55 and 54, as well as his 15-year-old sister Amy Sheer, according to a statement from the Orange County Sheriff's Department. They apparently died early Monday at their home in Mission Viejo, authorities said. Deputies went to the upscale neighborhood around 3am after receiving reports that a man was yelling and shots might have been fired but couldn't confirm the reports after patrolling for several minutes, the Sheriff's Department said. A relative found the bodies on Tuesday, more than 24 hours later. Michael Sheer had attended Saddleback Valley Christian High School in San Juan Capistrano and played football as a freshman in 2007, the Orange County Register reported. He also loved bodybuilding, neighbor LJ Otto said. The Sheers were a 'good Christian family' who homeschooled their children for elementary school, Otto said earlier this week. Amy Sheer had just started as a freshman this year at Crean Luteran High School in Irvine. The school has planned a chapel service to pray for the family. Scroll down for video . Victims: Michael's father Mark Sheer was a business coach while his mother Lydia was a stay-at-home mom . Too young: Sister Amy Sheer, 15 (pictured above with their mother), was about to finish her first year of high school . Scene of the crime: The four bodies belonging to the Sheer family were discovered at their upscale Orange County home on Tuesday, but investigators believe the shooting actually happened on Monday . Mark Sheer worked as a 'tactical business coach' offering seminars for financial professionals, according to his website.  He also taught Bible study with his wife at a Lutheran church. Lydia was a stay-at-home mom. 'The mom was a homemaker, always making cookies,' Otto recalled. 'She was so cute. I came over here for Valentine's Day and she still had her Christmas trees up and she said, ""it's Christmas all year round. We love to celebrate.""' 'It was just one of those all-American families. This is a complete shock to me, a complete shock,' Otto said. The Sheer's church, Mount of Olives, is offering grief counselors to parishioners. 'We are all devastated to learn about this tragedy. The Sheers were part of our family here at Mount of Olives [Lutheran Church],' senior pastor John Steward told the Los Angeles Times 'and we ask everyone to pray for their extended family and friends. A team of detectives and crime scene investigators enter the home where the four bodies were found . 'Our primary concern is the welfare of our congregation, and particularly our teens and young adults who knew the Sheer children,' Steward added. Sheriff's officials said there was no history of previous calls to the home. The newspaper said Michael Sheer's only criminal record involved three speeding tickets since 2009. 'They were literally the nicest family I ever met in my life,' 21-year-old Kendra Leach, who knew the family through Mount of Olives Lutheran Church, told the Register. A neighbor, who refused to give her name, told the Times that the residents of the home were a 'perfect Christian family.' She said her daughter was close friends with one of the family's children. One neighbor told the Register that she thought she hear a young girl crying inside the home early Tuesday morning. 'It was just awful crying,' neighbor Anila Whitney-Miller said. 'That kind of screaming was so hard. Then it just stopped.' Police have not revealed a motive for the crime .","Mark and Lydia Sheer were found dead on Tuesday in their Orange County home, along with son Michael, 21, and daughter Amy, 15 .

"By . Antonia Hoyle . Antonia shows off her fabulous new figure . Last week I revealed how I lost  my pregnancy weight thanks to the latest scientifically proven exercise regime that involves just three sessions of less than 15 minutes  a week. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can transform your figure more effectively than spending twice as long on more moderate exercises. The key is working out as hard as you can in short bursts. After I embarked on a routine under the guidance of Zana Morris, owner of The Library gym in West London, I lost an astonishing 10 lb in six weeks - and I was exercising just 38 minutes a week. Last week I detailed the exercises I did for each of the three sessions - for legs, chest and back, and shoulders and arms. Today, I reveal a three-minute ab-blaster, plus some more of Zana's exercises. Do these exercises in order every time you work out. Keep your knees together at all times to  make the exercises more efficient. With all these exercises, if you end up tensing, you tend to hunch your shoulders and put strain on the neck. So remember: shoulders down and relaxed, neck long, face up to the ceiling. You should aim to be pulling with your core. If you struggle, start with sets of ten and work up to 20. The key to success is pace. Each workout should be performed correctly and as swiftly as possible. Do not rest. FRONT CRUNCHES . HOW: Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, hands resting behind your ears. Pushing your lower back into the floor, pull your upper back off the floor with your stomach muscles, aiming your chest to the ceiling.  Curl upwards and forwards. Keep your chin tilted slightly, leaving space between your chin and your chest. Lower your body back to the floor. Repeat. DO: 1 SET OF 20 . SIDE CRUNCHES . HOW: Adopt the same position as front crunches. Pushing your lower back into the floor, pull your upper back off the floor with your stomach muscles while twisting your upper body to  the right. Your left elbow should get as close to your right knee as possible without moving your arms from the start position . Lower your upper body to the  first position. Pull your upper body off the floor while twisting your upper body to  the left, this time trying to get your right elbow close to your left knee. Lower your body to the floor.  This is one rep. Repeat. Fighting fit: Antonia's story last week . DO: 1 SET OF 20 . SIDE BENDS . HOW: Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, elbows out and hands resting  behind your ears. Lift your upper back 4in off the floor. Using your abdominal muscles and keeping your upper back the same distance from the floor, swing your upper body from your waist as far as you can to the right, towards your lower body. Try to get your right elbow close to your right knee.

"By . Daniel Miller . A woman accused of having sex with skeletons after police discovered pictures of her kissing human skulls has been convicted of disturbing the peace of the dead and ordered to undergo treatment for psychiatric problems. The 37-year-old Swedish woman has not been named, but pictures of her collection of human bones, including ones of her snuggling up to bed with a skull, were released last month. Prosecutors in the city of Gothenburg had alleged she used the bones for sexual gratification but she avoided charges of necrophilia and she was instead charged with 'disturbing the peace of the dead'. Guilty: These police pictures are taken from the investigation into a Swedish woman charged with possession of human skulls and bones, which the prosecution claimed she used for sexual purposes . Close relationship: Police found astonishing photos in which a woman is seen kissing and hugging the skulls . Skull: The prosecution claimed the woman had handled the bones in a 'shameful' and 'unethical' manner . She reportedly told a local newspaper in Gothenburg that she was an 'odd bird' but 'not sexually . interested in necrophilia'. She was also convicted of weapons crimes and sentenced to probation. A court statement reads: 'Criminal . protection starts when a person dies, and the protection remains as long . as there are remains of the deceased. 'The fact that the woman had moved . bones constitutes a crime because she was unauthorised to do so, just as . it's a crime to put together a skeleton and have it lying on the floor, . to have bones in plastic bags, and to sell them.' The woman, had denied the allegations - claiming she collected the bones out of . historical interest. Her grisly hoard was discovered in September when police were called to the woman's flat following reports of gunfire. Photos . from a morgue were reportedly found hidden in the woman's home as well as a drill,  body bags and an . access code to a morgue. However police found no . proof that she was a grave-digger. Tucked up: A Swedish police handout showing a human skull in a bed in the apartment of a 37-year-old woman . On the floor: The Swedish woman was charged with possession of human skulls and bones, which the prosecution claimed she used for sexual purposes . In her flat: Police also allegedly found CDs titled 'My Necrophilia' and 'My first experience' as well as photos in which a woman is seen kissing and hugging the skulls . Extraordinary: The 37 year-old woman kept at least six skulls, one spine and 'a large number of other bones' in her Gothenburg apartment, according to the prosecution's charge sheet . In storage: The Swedish news agency TT cited a prosecutor as saying that the 37-year-old woman is suspected of using the remains, which included six skulls and one backbone, in 'sexual situations' Collection: The woman, from south-western Sweden, was charged at Gothenburg District Court yesterday . 'Previous comments': The woman allegedly wrote on an internet forum a few years ago: 'My morals set my limits and I'm prepared to take the punishment if something should happen. It's worth it' The Goeteborgsposten newspaper alleged that she wrote on an . internet forum a few years ago: ‘My morals set my limits and I'm . prepared to take the punishment if something should happen. 'It's worth . it. I want my man like he . is, whether he is dead or alive. He allows me to find sexual happiness . on the side.’ 'I want my man like he is, whether he is dead or alive.

The woman, who has admitted that the . items were kept in her apartment but denies doing anything wrong, was . arrested in September and faces up to two years in jail if found guilty. 'Some of the photos show a woman . licking a skull,' prosecutor Kristina Ehrenborg-Staffas told The Local newspaper in Sweden.

The app, put together by students at Rutgers University in New Jersey, harvests data from Instagram to tie together photos' location metadata to their physical location. It allows users to search images by keyword then shows a constant stream of pictures from the cult photo-sharing service - revealing exactly where and when they were taken.

Risque: The app, put together by researchers . from Rutgers University, New Jersey, highlights just how much personal . information we are revealing online, privacy campaigners say . Described by Gizmodo as a 'stalker's wet dream', privacy campaigners have said the app highlights just how much personal information we make available online when we upload our photos. Rutgers' social media information lab put together the website, entitled 'The Beat', using data from Instagram's application programming interface (API). This stream of source code, common to many web services, allows third-party developers to use information from the site to put together their own related online apps. On The Beat, users can filter photos from Instagram by entering a related hashtag into a search bar. It then displays photos tagged with the search term with images of the address where they were taken. Out of respect for privacy, there appears to be a blacklist for certain search terms, like 'underwear', 'porn' and 'sex' which could reveal risque or explicit photos. However, other related terms, like 'bikini', are not blocked.

Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'People might be happy sharing photos of what they’re doing, but how many people would want where they are doing it to be public? 'Location data is one of the most sensitive pieces of data and yet countless apps are using it without most people knowing. 'It’s one of the most valuable pieces of data to advertisers who can target you on and off-line as a result, so it’s hardly surprising companies like Google and Facebook are looking for as many ways as possible to track where you are.

"By . Mario Ledwith . Rising costs: Britain's top five supermarkets have increased the price of budget egg lines by an average of 40 per cent in the last year . Egg prices have risen by 40 per cent over the past year, making it increasingly difficult for cash-strapped shoppers to purchase cheaper sources of protein. Rising input costs have resulted in supermarkets hiking the price of budget own-brand egg lines, traditionally one of the cheapest family foods. All of the UK's 'big four' supermarket chains were selling six-packs of eggs for below £1 last year. But Asda and Morrisons are now the . only supermarkets selling eggs for less than £1, but even their products . have been subject to huge price increases. A pack of six Asda Smart Price eggs . from caged hens now costs 98p, up from 69p last year, according to a report in consumer magazine The Grocer. Six . Morrisons M Savers eggs cost 99p, up from 65p at the start of 2012. Sainsbury's is offering a pack of six . Basics own-label Freedom Foods-endorsed barn eggs for £1, compared with . 79p last year. Tesco is selling its cheapest pack of six eggs for . £1.09, also up from 79p. Hike: The rising prices have been blamed on increased production costs and EU rules on battery cages . While price rises have been most dramatic on budget eggs, more expensive lines have also been hit. Out of around 130 comparable hen egg lines at the top five supermarkets, 68.7 per cent are now more expensive than last year, 16 per cent are the same and just 15.3 per cent cheaper.

The retailers say that higher input . costs have pushed up prices. A spokesman for Tesco told the magazine: 'Factors such as the rising commodity costs of wheat and soya mean that . some products, including eggs, have increased in price slightly over the . past year.' This view was echoed by Sainsbury's, as a spokesman said: 'Increasing wheat and soya prices mean that, . in common with other retailers, we have had to increase the price of . some of our eggs.' Morrisons added that new EU rules on battery cages, which came into force in January 2012, had also pushed up prices.","Budget lines have risen in price due to higher input costs and EU rules on battery cages .

"By . Simon Danczuk . That Cyril Smith was a paedophile is known. But in a devastating book - serialised in the Mail this week - Labour MP Simon Danczuk exposes the industrial scale of his debauchery and how the Establishment, Liberal Party, police chiefs and even MI5 covered it up. Today Danczuk, MP for Smith’s old Rochdale seat, reveals how the 29-stone monster was saved from prosecution time after time... After spending many months wading through abuse, despair and wretched politics in pursuit of Cyril Smith, I had just about gone as far as I thought possible. I wasn’t sure if I had the stomach to deal with much more — when a key piece of the jigsaw I’d almost given up on finally turned up. I got access to the police files on Cyril Smith. No more lies: In his new book, Labour MP Simon Danczuk exposes how the Establishment, Liberal Party, police chiefs and even MI5 covered up Cyril Smith's sexual abuse . I was in a restaurant in London when I . first got sight of them. They were placed in front of me by a . journalist, and I put the menu down and started to devour every word. There . was plenty there that I already knew, having pieced it together from . other sources; but there was one section that quickly grabbed my . attention. Henry Howarth had succeeded Cyril as mayor of Rochdale in 1967 and was the leader of the Rochdale Liberal Party. During the police investigation into Cyril at the end of the 1960s, he was interviewed by Detective Sergeant Jeffrey Leach. Howarth offered some robust advice to the police regarding the prospect of charging Cyril with child abuse. Protected: Cyril Smith, pictured with fellow Liberal Democrats Jo Grimond, David Steel and Jeremy Thorpe, was 'allowed' to continue his abuse despite police trying to investigate . ‘May I offer a personal opinion,’ he . began. ‘I sincerely hope that this matter is not prosecuted before the . court. In my opinion, as a Justice of the Peace, it is not court worthy. ‘The . prosecution can do no good at all, and the backlash will have . unfortunate repercussions for the police force and the town of Rochdale. It is no secret that Cyril and I are buddies, and not only . politically.’ In other words, the leader of the . local Liberal Party was threatening the police. Notes from Detective . Sergeant Leach underneath this account acknowledge as much. ‘The veiled threats and innuendoes contained therein,’ he remarks, ‘reflect Howarth’s general attitude to this inquiry.’ I’d . already known that Cyril was leaning hard on the police, but I didn’t . know that the local Liberal Party was doing the same. What ‘unfortunate . repercussions’ for the police could Howarth possibly have had in mind as . he tried to bully them into dropping their investigation? 'The door was open': His victim says he will never forget how Cyril Smith, pictured with then Liberal leader David Steel in 1977, abused him in the House of Commons . Reading on, it quickly becomes . apparent that Leach has doubts about Rochdale police. Referring to . evidence of Cyril’s abuse given by the council’s children’s officer, . Lyndon Price, Leach casts doubt on whether Rochdale’s Chief Constable . Patrick Ross ever acted on it. ‘It is quite feasible,’ he notes, ‘that Mr Ross would keep it to himself because of the status of the man involved.’ As he found he could get away with his abuse, Cyril Smith began to take more risks, as Ron Foynes testified. A member of the Royal Military Police based at Rochester Row in Westminster in the late Seventies, Ron got in touch to share what was an open secret at the time. ‘Cyril Smith was into young boys, we all knew that,’ he said. ‘We heard plenty of stories about him.’ These stories would be shared at the Corporals Mess bar where Ron and his fellow RMP officers socialised with the Royal Parks Constabulary, whose police station was in St James’s Park. ‘The Parks officers explained how they carried out observations and arrests in the male public toilets in the park, close to the junction of Marlborough Road and the Mall,’ he said. ‘These toilets were a regular meeting place for homosexuals and young male prostitutes after dark.’ On a number of occasions police officers had detained Cyril Smith after he was caught ‘in acts of gross indecency with young lads’ at these toilets. On each occasion, they’d been told by those higher up the chain of command to discontinue their inquiries due to the status of the individual concerned. How many times had Cyril Smith been arrested or pulled in by police only to be released as soon as the phone call from high office was made? I wondered if he actually got a thrill out of being caught — knowing they couldn’t pin anything on him because he was a protected man. The files also offered clues to the defence that Cyril was prepared to give if the matter went to court. Under questioning, he tried to claim he was in loco parentis where the boys abused at local schools and hostels were concerned. They were on his property, and in all matters medical and relating to general discipline, Cyril claimed the boys had signed off legal responsibility for him to care for them. In other words, he could do whatever he wanted. Detective Inspector Leach knew only too well that no court in the land would buy this. ‘In my opinion,’ he wrote, ‘it is without merit. It will not withstand even superficial examination.’ Concluding, Leach seemed confident of a prosecution. Under questioning, Cyril ‘had difficulty articulating, and even the stock answers he offered could only be obtained after repeated promptings by his solicitor’. Unfortunately, the Director of Public Prosecutions did not share the same confidence. In a letter to Lancashire Police in 1970, DPP Sir Norman Skelhorn said he did not consider there to be a reasonable prospect of a conviction. Referring to the statements by Cyril’s victims, he said: ‘The characters of some of these young men would be likely to render their evidence suspect.’ It may as well have said that as long as a high-profile politician decides to abuse boys of lowly social status, then there is zero chance of him being prosecuted. It more or less outlined a code of conduct for abusers. Stick to vulnerable people from broken homes and the law will give you a wide berth. The injustice contained in these words is as strong now as it was then. It was a loophole so huge that even someone as gargantuan as Cyril could skip through.

"By . Martin Robinson . Fleeing court: David Lowe was seen running from court with his face covered as protesters demanding he was jailed set up a picket line . A pet owner who starved his dog so badly she looked like a 'walking skeleton' from a 'concentration camp' was forced to flee court by campaigners angry he was allowed to walk free. David Lowe, 33, neglected 15-year-old Fly until the animal was less than half her normal body weight, but avoided jail because he had shown 'remorse'. Bolton Magistrates' Court heard when the tan-coloured Lurcher was rescued she was barely breathing and had to be put down. Lowe of Farnworth, near Bolton, Greater Manchester claimed he had money troubles and blamed his ex-girlfriend for failing to feed Fly, but was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. Yesterday he had to face a crowd of demonstrators from across the UK who raised a 20,000 name petition calling for him to be jailed. But magistrates said although Lowe's behaviour passed 'the custody threshold' they suspended the 12 week sentence for 18 months due to his 'remorse.' He was banned from keeping animals for life and will only be able to appeal against the order in 25 years time. Police were called to patrol the demonstration outside the court and Lowe ran away with his face covered. After the case, Lorraine Edwards, 41, who runs a Lurcher Rescue centre in Hertfordshire said: 'All we wanted was justice for Fly but the current justice system is not doing enough. This man should have gone to jail because he a let dog die. 'The maximum sentence he could have faced was six months but people should get a lot more than thar for neglecting animals in this way. What happened to him is a normal example of the courts being lenient to animal cruelty cases. 'There was just no need to let a dog starve and this case has really pulled on the heart strings of people. We feel very passionately about it because the courts are so lenient. 'Because Fly is no longer around we have to make a stand for her by being the voice for her to let the magistrates know this case is totally unacceptable when there's so many people who can help. It's disgusting.' Another protestor said: 'He starved that dog so much she looked like something out of a concentration camp. The fact he went free from court is outrageous.' Emaciated: The vet who examined Fly said it was the worst case he had seen in his 30-year career . Shocking: The Lurcher incredibly thin and had to be put down because she was injured and struggling to breath . Poster: 'Monster' Lowe avoided jail because of his mental health problems and the remorse he had shown . Pain: Fly 'suffered immeasurably' at the hands of her owners and showed real bravery to last as long as she did, the court heard . Earlier Tony Stock, prosecuting said the investigation began in October last year after an RSPCA officer Insp Vicki McDonald went to Lowe's flat and saw Fly lying down in its basket by the side of the kitchen. Mr Stock added: 'She was immediately shocked by how emaciated the dog was. The defendant confirmed the dog was his but said his former partner had been responsible for the dog as well. 'He went on to tell the inspector that his ex as he called her had asked him to put the dog down but he did not want to do that. He added that he was surprised the dog had lasted as long as it had. 'He said that Fly had last seen the vet a few months ago. He went on to tell the inspector that the dog had only got so bad in the last couple of weeks and attributed most of the dog's problems to the fact she was old.' But vet Angus McKenzie said in a statement he felt Fly 'was the most severely emaciated dog dead or alive that he had ever seen in the 30 years he had been in practice.' The dog was 12-15 per cent dehydrated and weighed just 8.1kg which is less than half her ideal body weight. The dehydrated dog, was diabetic, had overgrown claws, signs of a tooth abscess, a mammary tumour, and severe advanced dental disease. Upset: Dozens from all over the UK came to the court to 'demand justice for Fly' Vigil: The protesters said that Lowe should have been jailed for the crime and said the justice system is failing . Message: This banner was one of several tributes to the the tragic Lurcher . Police presence: Greater Manchester Police was called in to deal with the situation yesterday . Mr Stock added: 'Fly was is a dog severely emaciated and the photographs show the quite graphically. 'Given the number and severity of the issues affecting Fly - all of which could have been treated - it was Mr McKenzie's feeling that the only humane action was to put her to sleep. 'The dog suffered immeasurably which the vet described as the totally neglect of the defendant. The vet called Fly 'a walking skeleton.' In his opinion that suffering could have been alleviated at an earlier stage. 'That dog could have lived a healthy life if advice and treatment had been sought.' Insp McDonald went to interview Lowe but he claimed he had not 'committed any offence.' The court heard he had been given £20 to take his dog to the vets when she became so poorly but he failed to do so as he feared it would be put down. In mitigation Lowe's lawyer Peter Leather said his client had mental health problems and claimed Fly became neglected when he split up with his girlfriend and was left homeless. Passing sentence JP Dr Derek Tate said: 'The custodial threshold has been crossed but we are going to suspend the sentence. This is clearly because we believe a rehabilitative element would be more appropriate in your case. Lowe will be ordered to pay £1,000 costs and an £80 victim surcharge at the rate of ten pounds a week. The vets fees of £528 will be paid by the taxpayer. RSPCA inspector Ms McDonald said after the case: 'This is the most serious case of malnutrition I have ever seen. It was hard to believe that she was still alive. Individually each condition could have been treated but together it was kinder to put her to sleep. 'I understand that it's that difficult to let go of a dog you have had for years but you can't leave them to get into this state. It is unacceptable and heartbreaking.'","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . John Hall . and Louise Cheer . and Ryan Lipman . A 20km-high ash cloud from the volcanic eruption of Mount Sangeang Api in Indonesia is playing havoc with Australia's flight paths. Darwin remains cut off to all air services and thousands of people have been left stranded in the city after the ash cloud blew over the Northern Territory coast line, forcing the airport to close. Flights from Darwin will remain cancelled until at least Sunday, while ash plumes are also affecting other aircraft around the country bound for Bali, with the island's airspace is also disrupted. On Saturday night, all flights from Melbourne to Bali were cancelled, reported The Age. 'Our team of meteorologists are continuing to monitor the situation, in consultation with the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre,' Virgin Australia spokeswoman Jacqui Abbott said. Planes at East Kimberley Regional Airport in West Australia have also been grounded due to the plumes. Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss told AAP flights coming across the Top End could be affected for days. 'Depending on wind and other weather conditions, the ash has the potential to affect flights to and from other airports, including Brisbane, during coming days,' he said. 'This is currently being fully assessed.' Scroll down for video . The powerful explosion took place at Mount Sangeang Api in the Lesser Sunda Islands - an area that plays host to 129 active volcanoes. The Sunda Islands sit inside Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire'. Since Sangiang Api's first recorded eruption in 1512, it is believed to have erupted a total of 20 times . The polygon with the broken line indicates the ash from the continuing eruption and the one with the solid line indicates the initial ash cloud . The volcano, Sangeang Api, in Indonesia's Lesser Sunda Island has erupted three times since Friday afternoon, with the first ash cloud, between 20,000 and 50,000 feet high and up to 15km wide, moving south-easterly over central Australia on Saturday night at about 100 knots but scattering quickly. The plume has been affecting Darwin and is expected to be in the area for the next 18 hours to 24 hours, reported Seven News. A second cloud at about 45,000 feet was over Darwin and moving east at about 60 knots, while the third ash cloud, north-east of Bali, is expected to miss Australian airspace. Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre meteorologist Tim Birch  said it was impossible to prediction how long the ash cloud would affect flights to and from Darwin. 'It is entirely dependent upon what happens with the volcano.,' he said. But using current weather conditions and looking at volcanic action, Mr Birtch said it was likely that eastern ports including Sydney and Brisbane would not be affected. On Saturday morning at least 18 flights were cancelled coming in and out of the airport, The Australian reported. Domestic and international flights run by Virgin, Jetstar, Qantas, Emirates, Malaysia, SilkAir and Airnorth airlines were abandoned. It is not known when flights will resume. A Jetstar spokesman confirmed 530 passengers were affected by the cancellations, while Qantas passengers have been put up at the Rydges Darwin Hotel Airport to wait until the cloud passes. 'We offered accommodation to passengers around the country as a result of (the cancellations),' a Qantas spokeswoman said. Tourists have taken to sleeping on the floor at the airport while they await flights to start up again . She said people could keep up-to-date with flight information by logging on to the Qantas website. On its website, Virgin said its team of meteorologist would continue monitoring the situation along with the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in the Northern Territory capital. 'We will recommence normal operations as soon as the volcanic ash cloud safely allows it. All guests will be re-accommodated onto alternate flights,' a statement said. The ash cloud off the coast is moving south towards Alice Springs and is sitting between 6km and 13km above the ground. Mr Truss said it had potential to affect flights at other airports but Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Bureau of Meteorology were continuing to monitor the cloud. 'Passengers are advised to check with their airlines for further information,' he said. Airservices Australia - the nation's air navigation authority - has started diverting international flights around the cloud. The bureau's Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre manager Emile Jansons said the cloud was dispersing but this could change. The Sangeang Api volcano is about 1400km away from Darwin and has erupted three times since Friday afternoon . Mr Jansons said it was moving at 130km/h to 150km/h towards the centre of Australia and they were not expecting it to impact on Brisbane or Sydney right now. 'There is a very strong jet stream so the boundary (of the cloud) may come further south,' he told AAP. The current advice from the bureau is the ash cloud will continue to cover the Northern Territory coast for another 18 hours. Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said the issue with flying near or through the cloud was not just visibility, but the effect it had on the plane. He said silica contained in the cloud could cause extensive damage to a jet. 'The damage it can do to the aircraft can be abrasive,' Mr Gibson said. 'It can melt and stick to the engine.' The Bureau of Meteorology is monitoring the situation. After erupting, the volcano sent a distinctive spaceship-shaped ring of pyroclastic smoke high into the air. Pilots in the area reported seeing the cloud rise 20km high, spreading over a 40km area . The volcano sits in Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire' - an area where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur in the basin of the Pacific Ocean. It has 452 volcanoes - 75 per cent of the world's total . This is not the first time flights have been cancelled because of volcanic ash. In 2010, Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull eruption caused massive flight delays across western and northern Europe over six days in April, affecting hundreds of thousands of people, but interruptions to local flights continued through until May. The incredible moment Indonesia's huge volcano erupted, sending ash spewing an estimated 20 kilometres into the sky, was captured in pictures. The powerful explosion took place at Mount Sangeang Api in the Lesser Sunda Islands - an area that plays host to 129 active volcanoes - and sent a distinctive spaceship-shaped ring of pyroclastic smoke high into the air. The photographs were taken by professional photographer Sofyan Efendi during a commercial flight from Bali to the fishing town of Labuan Bajo in West Nusa Tenggara province. The arrival and departure screens from inside the Darwin Airport show the number of flights cancelled. 530 Jetstar passengers have been affected by the cancellations on Saturday . Thousands of people have been left stranded at the Darwin Airport after multiple airlines cancelled flights in and out of the city . The photographs were taken by professional photographer Sofyan Efendi during a commercial flight from Bali to the fishing town of Labuan Bajo . Scores of farmers who work but do not live on the Indonesian island were ordered to leave and not return until the volcano has finished erupting, said Muhammad Hendrasto, head of Indonesia's National Volcanology Agency. There are not believed to have been any deaths or injuries as a result of the eruption. Authorities have had Mount Sangiang Api on high alert for almost a year, he told China's Xinhua news agency. The volcano sits in Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire' - an area where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur in the basin of the Pacific Ocean. It has 452 volcanoes - 75 per cent of the world's total. Since Sangiang Api's first recorded eruption in 1512, it is believed to have erupted a total of 20 times.

"By . Sarah Dean . Brave: Jordan Rice, 13, told rescue workers to make sure his younger brother, Blake, was saved first during the Queensland floods in 2011 . When schoolboy Jordan Rice insisted that rescuers save his little brother first as raging flood waters surrounded them in Toowoomba, Queensland, in January 2011, his incredible bravery touched hearts all over the world. The 13-year-old's actions saved his 10-year-old brother Blake's life over his own, as they stood stranded in rising waters with their mother Donna during the deadly flash flood. His final words: 'Take my brother first,' led to promises from politicians that Jordan would posthumously receive the Cross of Valour - Australia's highest civilian honour for bravery. Three years later, his father is still waiting for the accolade. In a heartbreaking letter to Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Jordan's father John Tyson has written: 'Three years on, I feel like Jordan's bravery has been forgotten about, and all the talk by politicians were empty gestures.' He has started a campaign to get his son the award that he so deserves after then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard told him 'the legend of Jordan's amazing courage will go on'. Ms Gillard met Mr Tyson on a visit to Toowoomba while speaking with flood victims, three months after the devastating floods in January 2011. During the meeting she even autographed Jordan's brother Blake's cloth sling, which he was using to nurse an arm injury caused by the natural disaster. Scroll down for video . Promises: Then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard (right) spoke with Jordan's father John Tyson and brother Blake Rice (left) at a reception for Toowoomba flood victims on 5 April 2011 . Grieving: Jordan's father John Tyson (left) and brother Blake Rice (right) want their brave family member awarded with the Cross of Valour . Liberal leader Tony Abbott also recommended Jordan receive the Cross back in 2011 but nothing has yet eventuated. 'I was so proud. I waited, waited and waited - but it never happened,' Mr Tyson says in a petition on Change.org. 'Nothing will ever bring Jordan and Donna back. But it would mean the world to us to have his last moments of bravery acknowledged.' The gold Cross of Valour was established in 1975 to replace the British George Cross, previously awarded to Australians, and has so far only ever been given to five men. It was last awarded in 2003, to two heroes from Western Australia who entered bombed Bali nightclub Paddy's Pub, in the tourist district of Kuta, in 2002 to rescue people, despite ongoing explosions and their own personal injuries. The rescue: Blake Rice (centre left) was saved from a car trapped in heavy flash flooding in the town of Toowoomba. His brother Jordan told rescuers to take Blake first . Tragic: Warren McErlean (left) who rescued Blake from the floodwaters that hit Toowoomba and the boys' mother Donna (right), who was also killed . Campaigning: John Tyson (right), seen here with Blake Rice (left) outside the Brisbane Coroners Court in October 2011, has called on the PM to stick to his promise . In January 2011, Jordan, his brother and his mother were trapped on the roof of the family's car as raging floodwater surrounded them. When a Good Samaritan, Warren McErlean, waded over to rescue the family Jordan insisted his little brother was saved first despite not being able to swim himself. 'Moments later, Jordan and his mum were swept to their deaths,' Mr Tyson said. Mr McErlean, who saved Blake, told news.com.au he completely backs the petition. 'I'm right behind anything that will remember what Jordan did and goes towards recognising his actions.' To Tony Abbott, . My son's last words were 'take my brother first'. He and his mother were trapped on the roof of our family car as the massive 2011 Queensland floodwaters surrounded them – and as a good samaritan waded in to help my brave little son Jordan, just 13 years old, insisted his little brother was saved first. Jordan couldn't swim. He must have been petrified. But he put his fears aside to make sure his brother made it through the terrifying flood. Moments later, Jordan and his mum were swept to their deaths.Time can never heal what losing them has meant for us. We're still devastated, and struggling. In the wake of the floods there was a glint of light in the darkness – there were calls by politicians in Canberra for Jordan to be recognised for his incredible bravery. 'The legend of Jordan's amazing courage will go on,' said Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Tony Abbott, who was opposition leader, said Jordan should get the Cross of Valour, Australia's highest civilian award for bravery. I was so proud. I waited, waited and waited - but it never happened. Three years on, I feel like Jordan's bravery has been forgotten about, and all the talk by politicians were empty gestures. Nothing will ever bring Jordan and Donna back. But it would mean the world to us to have his last moments of bravery acknowledged. This photo taken on January 10, 2011 shows flash floods described as an 'inland tsunami' smashing through mountainside Toowoomba . Flood waters surged through streets, inundating the city of Toowoomba . Debris and overturned cars were seen in central Toowoomba between following the flash flood which ripped through the town centre on January 10, 2011 . Rescuers struggled to save Jordan and his mother Donna during the floods . A spokeswoman for Mr Abbott told the website he supported Mr Tyson's calls for Jordan to be appropriately acknowledged. 'Nominations for bravery awards in the Australian Honours system are considered by the Australian Bravery Decorations Council, which makes recommendations to the Governor-General,' she said. 'The Prime Minister has approached the Governor-General to ask for his support in ensuring proper consideration is given to any nominations for bravery awards relating to this tragic incident.'","Jordan Rice was killed during the 2011 Queensland floods .

"By . Martha De Lacey . Mexican surrealist painter Frida Kahlo has always been something of an enigma. Famed for her colourful but disturbing self-portraits, that unabashed mono-brow, a turbulent marital relationship with fellow artist Diego Rivera and a raft of severe health problems, Kahlo, who was born in 1907, has fascinated art lovers for decades. But now the mist is clearing over a little more of her life, thanks to a new exhibition of her clothes, orthopaedic paraphernalia and even prosthetic limbs being displayed inside one of the Mexico City homes she shared with her husband.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron today faced claims he was ‘stuck-up', after boasting he likes shopping in Waitrose because the customers are nicer. The political battle over the weekly shop erupted after the Prime Minister shared his views on ‘supermarket sociology’. After claiming there was ‘something about’ Waitrose customers who are more ‘engaged people’, Labour accused Mr Cameron of making a ‘bizarre and empty-headed intervention’ at a time when many families were struggling to make ends meet. David Cameron set out his 'supermarket sociology' while on a visit to a store run by Waitrose¿s parent company John Lewis in Cheadle, near Manchester . Mr Cameron gave an insight into his weekly shop while on a visit to a store run by Waitrose’s parent company John Lewis in Cheadle, near Manchester. Waitrose has faced criticism for a new scheme offering free coffee to people with loyalty cards, with some customers complaining it has attracted a different clientele. Mr Cameron told staff yesterday: ‘I have got a piece of supermarket sociology, which is that there is something about Waitrose customers ... they are the most talkative. ‘I found that if I shop in Waitrose it takes me about twice as long as everyone wants to stop you and have a chat. Whereas in other supermarkets I find I can dart round very quickly and get everything. ‘It is something about your customers, they are very talkative, engaged people.' Mr Cameron revealed that he shops at Waitrose - regarded as a favourite of the middle classes - whenever possible. He uses Ocado - another firm catering to the higher end of the market - to deliver goods to Downing Street. However, . he said he went to Sainsbury's near his constituency home in Chipping . Norton, Oxfordshire, ‘because there isn't a Waitrose’. The Prime Minister said he found customers in Waitrose more talkative when doing his shopping . But Labour said the remarks showed he was out of touch. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher said: ‘Families are on average 1,600 a year worse off since David Cameron became Prime Minister. ‘Most families understandably have to shop around and watch every penny because of the cost-of-living crisis, plus very many people increasingly have to rely on food banks. ‘This is a world away from that of David Cameron. There's nothing wrong enjoying shopping at Waitrose. 'But Cameron seems to be saying that at Waitrose you get a better class of shopper. ‘This is a bizarre and empty-headed intervention from a Prime Minister who increasingly gives the impression of being stuck-up and out of touch.’ Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also case doubt on the claims. In the last few weeks I’ve shopped in Asda, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Tesco’s, so there you go. 'I’ve done the full spread and at the moment - I will do further market research - I haven’t discerned any great difference,' he told LBC radio. In 2012 Mr Cameron had to give Waitrose a miss when he went shopping in a Morrisons branch in Plymouth . Labour has had its own problems with Waitrose. Last month frontbencher Andy Sawford wrote to every MP complaining that the free coffee deal was having a 'stark effect' on other coffee shops and should be scrapped. Last year the Prime Minister was ridiculed for admitting he does not know how much a supermarket loaf costs – because he bakes his own using a bread-making machine. The Prime Minister was asked the price of a ‘value’ range loaf after claiming he is not out of touch with ordinary people over the rising cost of living. He guessed it was more than £1 – in fact it is 47p – then by way of explanation got himself into a deeper hole by saying he does not eat ‘the value stuff’. Instead he uses a £100 breadmaker and a brand of Cotswolds artisan flour which costs around £4.40 a bag. In comparison a 1.5kg bag of Tesco’s own brand flour costs only 65p.","Prime Minister reveals his 'supermarket sociology' theory to staff .

"By . Leon Watson . Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya, a winner of the Sakharov human rights prize who challenged the island's communist regime for decades, has died in a car accident, the government and a priest said. Paya, 60, is the second key dissident to die in Cuba in less than a year. Manuel Gonzalez, a priest in the eastern Bayamo area, where the accident took place, said: 'His death has been confirmed. Reports have confirmed Cuban opposition leader Oswaldo Paya, pictured here in 2003, has died . 'We went to the hospital and an official showed us his identification.' Paya died on Sunday on the road linking Bayamo, in Granma province around 465 miles east of Havana, and the city of Las Tunas. 'We don't have any other details. We can only hope that there will be an autopsy and that an investigation is launched,' Gonzalez said. Gustavo Machin, an official in Cuba's International Press Center, a department of the foreign ministry, said another Cuban died in the accident that claimed Paya's life. A Spanish national and a Swedish national were injured and are receiving medical assistance at a local hospital, Machin said. Paya, an engineer specialising in medical equipment, was the founder of the Christian Liberation Movement advocating political change in the Communist-run island. Aida Valdes, centre, a member of the Christian Movement of Liberation speaking after the death of Paya . Relatives and friends arrive at the house of Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya, in Havana, Cuba, after he died in a car crash . He began his dissident activities in the wake of the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia designed to put an end to the so-called 'Prague spring,' a movement to ease the Communist grip on the Central European state. Paya earned international attention in 2002 when, on the eve of the arrival of a visit by former US president Jimmy Carter, he presented parliament with more than 11,000 signatures of support for the Varela Project, an initiative calling for change in Cuba, then run by Fidel Castro. Carter mentioned the Varela Project in his televised speech at Havana University, prompting then-Czech president and human rights champion Vaclav Havel to nominate Paya for the Nobel prize. Oswaldo Paya, Cuba's leading dissident, shows a box filled with approximately 14,000 petitions signed in support of the Varela Project at his home in Havana, in 2003 . Paya was a long-time campaigner against former Cuban leader Fidel Castro (pictured) Grieving relatives of Paya in Havana, Cuba, on Sunday . Paya won the European parliament's Sakharov prize later that same year. Other past winners of the prize named after Soviet-era physicist and political dissident Andrei Sakharov include anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela and former UN chief Kofi Annan. Although the Varela Project was rejected by the National Assembly, Paya pursued his efforts to bring about change -- efforts that saw him win other rights prizes and a honorary doctorate from Columbia University in New York. His death follows that of fellow dissident Laura Pollan, the founder and leader of the Ladies in White, who died in a Havana hospital in October 2011 after suffering acute respiratory distress. Paya was married to Ofelia Acevedo. The couple had three children. Two Catholic nuns said the family had made plans to fly to Bayamo. Dissident Guillermo Farinas said that Paya was 'a person who contributed to the democratisation of Cuba through his dedication to the cause.' Although Paya was never imprisoned for his opposition activities, many of the 75 dissidents jailed in spring 2003 belonged to his Christian Liberation Movement.","Oswaldo Paya is the second key dissident to die in Cuba in less than a year .

"By . James  Nye . Five wolf pups abandoned by their parents during a huge wildfire in Alaska have been rescued and taken to Anchorage Zoo. On Tuesday, firefighters battling the Funny River blaze on the Kenai Peninsula heard small yelps coming from a den and decided to investigate. Inside they discovered five dehydrated wolf pups, who had all suffered a run-in with a porcupine, needing quills removed from their tiny bodies. Safe: One of the wolf pups rescued on Tuesday is cradled by a firefighter battling the blaze at Funny River in Alaska . Medics Eric Zucker and Alicia Renfer hydrate and remove porcupine quills from the wolf pups found in a den next to a firebreak. Firefighters found the den while fighting the Funny River Horse Trail Fire . Safety: Eric Zucker and Alicia Renfer tend to one of the pups rescued on Tuesday at Funny River . Steve Miller, deputy manager of the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, contacted the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Jeff Selinger, who came to assist the firefighters. However, when he arrived, Selinger was too big to fit in the 10-foot-deep den and a smaller volunteer was needed to slip inside. Five pups - three males and two females - had been living on their own for two days, while sadly, another one had died prior to their rescue. All the pups had porcupine quills sticking out of them and the first thing the rescuers did was give them sugar water through a pipette to hydrate them. Thanks! The firefighter gets a thank you kiss for pulling the pup out from their den after being abandoned by their parents who fled a forest fire . Later in the day, the Department of Fish and Game drove the pups to the Alaska Zoo in Anchorage, where the zoo's curator took them in. 'They would have died if we didn’t pull them out,' said firefighter Jefferson Sam to The Alaska Dispatch. 'For me, it was the right thing to do.' Firefighter Brian Nichols told the Peninsula Clarion that caring for the pups was 'just like holding a dog'. 'They were hungry and trying to suckle on anything. It was just like holding a puppy, they’re so young they don’t know any better.' Tired: The rescued wolf pups were transferred to Anchorage Zoo where they are currently being cared for . The sky above many portions of Kasilof glowed orange on Wednesday as the Funny River Fire continued to burn a more than a 10 mile strip of land stretching from Funny River Road in Soldotna down to Tustumena Lake . At Anchorage Zoo the pups spent all day Wednesday with the zoo veterinarian being fed puppy-milk replacement formula every few hours. At two weeks old, the pups weighed 2.5 pounds, about a half-pound less than normal. Some of the pups had developed abscesses and were put on antibiotics after being stuck with the quills. Unfortunately, because they have been handled by humans they cannot be set back into the wild. Plans are in progress to find them a good home.","Alaskan, firefighters on the Kenai Peninsula at Funny River, stopped battling inferno when they heard yelping .

"By . Damien Gayle . The captain of the South Korean ferry that capsized three days ago with hundreds of schoolchildren aboard today defended his decision to delay its evacuation. Police charged Lee Joon-Seok and two of his crew early in the morning. All three have been criticised for leaving behind hundreds of passengers, while abandoning ship themselves. But Lee insisted he feared the outcome could have been worse if he had given the order to man the lifeboats too early. 'At the time a . rescue ship had not arrived,' he said. 'There were also no fishing boats around for . rescues, or other ships to help. 'The currents were very strong and the water was cold at that time in the area. I thought that passengers would be swept far away and fall into trouble if they evacuated thoughtlessly.' Scroll down for videos . Lee Joon-seok, centre, captain of the ferry Sewol which sunk in the water off the southern coast of South Korea, talks to the media before leaving a court which issued his arrest warrant in Mokpo, south of Seoul . Their arrests came as divers fighting . through rough seas finally reached the sunken vessel and began pulling . the bodies of drowned victims from inside. Lee has been charged under maritime law with negligence and failing to secure the safety of passengers. Thirty-two have been confirmed dead so far, and a further 273 are still missing. Most of them are schoolchildren who were on a high school holiday trip. As the arrests were being made, dive teams who had spent two days vainly battling powerful currents and near zero visibility, finally made it to the passenger decks of the 6,825-tonne Sewol. 'Civilian divers spotted three bodies through a window,' a senior coastguard officer said. 'They attempted to get in and retrieve them by cracking the window, but it was too difficult,' he said in a briefing to relatives of the missing.

Even . with a powerful underwater flashlight, visibility was measured in . inches as the diver was seen groping his way blindly along the side of . the ship with the help of a pre-attached rope. Captain Lee was arraigned this morning along with the two officers in charge of the bridge at the time.

Experts have suggested many more . people might have escaped if they had moved to reach evacuation points . before the ship listed sharply and water started flooding in. The . relatives camped out in the Jindo gym - most of the them parents of . high school students - have sharply criticised the pace of the rescue . operation, accusing officials of incompetence and indifference. Only 174 were rescued when the ferry sank and no new survivors have been found since Wednesday. Nam . Sung-Won, whose 17-year-old nephew was among the missing, said the . clock was fast running down on the hope that some may have survived. 'We don't have much time. Many people here believe this is the last possible day for finding trapped passengers alive,' said Mr Nam. 'After today, hope will be gone.' Rescue team boats sail around buoys which were installed to mark the area of the sunken ferry as they search for passengers believed trapped in the Sewol . South Korean frogmen talk at each other as they search for passengers from the sunken ferry: Teams who had spent two days vainly battling powerful currents and near zero visibility, finally made it to the passenger decks today . For those relatives ready to accept the worst outcome, the coastguard had set up a tent near the gym to take DNA tests to facilitate eventual identification of recovered bodies. Standing in the queue to give a sample was Han Mi-Ok, whose teenage son is listed as missing in the disaster. She told AFP: 'Up until yesterday, I was still hanging on to some hope. But today I'm bracing myself for the worst.' More than 350 of those on board were students from Kang's Danwon High School in Ansan city just south of Seoul. The unfolding tragedy was compounded by the apparent suicide yesterday of the school's vice principal, Kang Min-Kyu, who was seemingly overcome by guilt at having organised the trip, and surviving the sinking. It is understood that a note was found in his pocket which read: 'Surviving alone is too painful while 200 remain unaccounted for. I take full responsibility. I pushed ahead with the school trip. 'I will once again become a teacher in the afterlife for my students whose bodies have not been discovered.' South Korea's Ministry of Ocean and Fisheries has released a transcript of the conversation between Jeju Vessel Traffic Services Centre (VTS) on Jeju Island and the Sewol, the ferry that sank on Wednesday. Originally in Korean, the transcript has been translated by The Associated Press. It starts off from the first distress call made by the ferry. Sewol: Harbour affairs Jeju, do you have reception of the Sewol? Jeju VTS: Yes, Sewol, this is Harbour affairs Jeju . Sewol: Please notify the coast guard. Our ship is in danger. It's listing right now. Jeju VTS: Where's your ship? Yes, got it. We will notify the coast guard. Sewol: The ship has listed a lot. Can't move. Please come quickly. Sewol: We're next to Byeongpung Island. Jeju VTS: Yes, we got it. Jeju VTS: Sewol, this is Harbour affairs Jeju. Do you have reception? Sewol, Harbour affairs Jeju. Sewol: Harbour affairs Jeju, this is Sewol . Jeju VTS: Sewol, this is Harbour affairs Jeju. Channel 21, please. Jeju VTS: Sewol, this is Harbour affairs Jeju. Sewol: Jeju, Sewol here. Jeju VTS: What's the current situation? Sewol: Currently the body of the ship has listed to the left. The containers have listed as well. Jeju VTS: OK. Any loss of human life or injuries? Sewol: It's impossible to check right now. The body of the ship has tilted, and it's impossible to move. Jeju VTS: Yes, OK. Please wear life jackets and prepare as the people might have to abandon ship. Sewol: It's hard for people to move. Jeju VTS: Yes, got it. Sewol: Harbour affairs Jeju, do you have reception of Sewol? Jeju VTS: Yes, this is Harbour affairs Jeju, Sewol. Sewol: What's going on with the coast guard? Jeju VTS: Yes, we have notified the coast guard. Currently we are calling Jindo VTS and Wando VTS. Please hold for a moment. After this, Jeju VTS notified other ships and Wando VTS. Grief: The relative of a missing passenger who was on the Sewol sits by the water at the port of Jindo and cries as she waits for news from the rescue team . Initial questioning of the captain has focused on what actually caused the ferry to sink. Tracking data from the Maritime Ministry showed the vessel made a sharp turn just before sending its first distress signal. Some experts believe a tight turn could have dislodged the heavy cargo manifest - including more than 150 vehicles - and destabilised the vessel, causing it to list heavily and then capsize. Captain Lee confirmed he was not at the helm when the ship ran into trouble. The ship was being steered by a 55-year-old helmsman identified by his surname Jo, under the supervision of the female third officer. Reports suggested it was the first time that the sailor had navigated those waters. 'It may have partly been my fault,' Jo said at the arraignment. 'But the steering gear rotated unusually fast.' Three giant, floating cranes are now at the rescue site, but coastguard officials stressed they would not begin lifting the multi-deck ferry until they were sure there were no survivors inside.","Police arrested Captain Lee Joon-Seok and two of his crew early this morning and they were charged in court .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nick Clegg has ordered a team of senior Lib Dems to start drawing up plans to remain in power after the next election. With more than a year to go until polling day, Mr Clegg named a team of five MPs and peers who he hopes will be able to secure his place as Deputy Prime Minister for another five years. Lib Dems hope the negotiating team will prevent a repeat of the catastrophic ditching of the party’s flagship pledge to scrap tuition fees, but Labour said the move proved how ‘arrogant, delusional and out of touch the Lib Dems are’. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has appointed a team of five people to help negotiate him back into power in 2015 . A new opinion poll shows that support for coalitions is beginning to rise again, with both the Tories and Labour fearing they could fall short of an overall majority in 2015. Downing Street was last week forced to play down suggestions David Cameron was planning to rule out another coalition in the Tory party manifesto. Labour has also insisted it is battling for a majority, while making overtures to the Lib Dems should they need a power-sharing deal. Mr Clegg told his party’s MPs that he has asked Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, to head up the group of MPs and peers who will hold talks in the event of another hung Parliament in 2015. It is a similar process to what happened ahead of the 2010 election, when Mr Alexander also took part in Coalition negotiations and ended up pairing with the Conservatives. The move shows that Mr Clegg would accept overtures from both the Tories and Labour if neither of the main parties achieve an overall majority. Mr Clegg wants to recreate the success of the last negotiating team, which included D(left to right) David Laws, now schools minister, Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Chris Huhne, who was jailed, and Andrew Stunell, who is standing down at the election . Mr Clegg said: ‘The Liberal Democrats will fight the next election as a strong, independent party. ‘Though, like last time, we do not take any outcome of the next election for granted and so we want to be prepared for any eventuality. ‘By preparing well, we will ensure that the Liberal Democrat Party is best placed to deliver a stronger economy in a fairer society in whichever circumstances we find ourselves in.‘I remain of the view that the worst outcome next year would be either a Conservative or Labour only government - because only the Lib Dems can anchor the country in the centre ground.’ The Lib Dem leader made his announcement at the weekly meeting of the parliamentary party in the Commons last night. Along with Mr Alexander, the team will be made up of Baroness Brinton, from the party’s federal policy committee, aid minister Lynne Featherstone, education minister David Laws and pensions minister Steve Webb. Before the last election the same team comprised of Mr Alexander, Mr Laws and MPs Andrew Stunnell, who is retiring, and Chris Huhne, who was jailed last year for perverting the course of justice. Flashback: The coalition was formed in May 2010, days after David Cameron failed to secure an overall majority against Labour's Gordon Brown, who was ousted from Number 10 . While analysis of the coalition agreement suggested the Lib Dems secured 75 per cent of their manifesto, high profile policies like the pledge to scrap tuition fees and oppose a VAT rise were jettisoned, leading to a dramatic slump in the polls. Mr Alexander said: ‘We owe it to the British people to be as well prepared as possible so that we can ensure a responsible, stable outcome, as we did in 2010. ‘We are on a journey as a party of government. Having Liberal Democrats in government next time is the only way to secure the economic recovery, keep British politics in the centre ground, and deliver a stronger economy in a fairer society. That is why we take preparing seriously.’ But Michael Dugher, Labour’s shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: ‘This shows how completely arrogant, delusional and out of touch the Lib Dems are. ‘The Lib Dems have a new rallying cry: go back to your constituencies and prepare to break your promises. ‘This is a self-serving committee for more horse-trading, squabbling and broken promises. ‘The only people who will decide the outcome of the next election will be the British people and they know the truth about Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems: you can't trust a word they say.’","Five MPs and peers start drawing up plans for negotiations in 2015 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Seattle Seahawks star Richard Sherman has condemned those who called him a 'thug' after his adrenalin-fueled, post-game rant on Sunday saying that the word is the 'accepted way of calling somebody the n-word nowadays'. The corner back, who is on his way to the Superbowl, said on Wednesday that he has done nothing 'villainous' such as be suspended for off-field fighting or arrested - actions that could be considered thug-like behavior. Sherman has apologized on several occasions for . verbally attacking San Francisco 49ers running back Michael Crabtree on . TV after winning the Super Bowl qualifying game. However he condemned those who launched attacks on him with racial undertones. Scroll down for video . Seattle Seahawks' Richard Sherman, pictured at a press conference on Wednesday, said that being called a 'thug' was the accepted way to use the 'n-word' nowadays . According to breitbart.com, Sherman told the press conference on Wednesday: 'I know some ''thugs,'' and they know I'm . the furthest thing from a thug. I've fought that my whole life, just . coming from where I'm coming from. 'Just because you hear Compton, you hear Watts, you hear cities like that, you just think ''thug, he's a gangster, he's this, that, and the other,'' and then you hear Stanford, and they're like,''oh man, that doesn't even make sense, that's an oxymoron.''' He added: 'You fight it for so long, and to have it come back up and people start to use it again, it's really, it's frustrating.' In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, a composed Sherman apologized for the tirade following the SeaHawks 23-17 win over the 49ers in which he played a crucial role with a pass deflection in the end zone that resulted in the game-clinching interception. After the game, Sherman told ESPN's Erin Andrews: 'Well, I'm the best corner in the game. When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's the result you're gonna get .... Don't you [Crabtree] ever talk about me! Don't you open your mouth about the best or I'm gonna shut it for you real quick.' Sorry: Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman apologized for attacking Michael Crabtree in an epic sideline rant in an interview two days later with CNN . 'It's a small part of who I am': Richard Sherman said adrenaline and a long-standing grudge made him launch his attack on Michael Crabtree . In Wednesday's interview, Sherman said: 'It was really mind-boggling. And it was kind of - it was kind of sad that the way the world reacted - you know, I can't say the world. I don't want to generalize people like that, because there are a lot of great people who didn't react that way. 'But for the people who did react that way and throw the racial slurs and things like that out there, it was really sad.' He says his behavior has to be seen in the context of playing an intensely competitive sport. 'If you catch me in the moment on the field when I am still in that zone, when I'm still as competitive as I can be and I'm trying to be in the place where I have to be to do everything I can to be successful ... and help my team win, then it's not going to come out as articulate, as smart, as charismatic -- because on the field I'm not all those things,' he said. But he says there's no excuse for the people who called him a 'thug' and a 'monkey' on Twitter. 'What they did was an actual reality. They showed their true character. Those were real comments, not in a moment, not in a - you know, they had time to think about it. They were sitting at a computer and they expressed themselves in a true way. And I thought society had moved past that.'

"By . Amanda Williams . Hundreds of British jihadis have returned from fighting in Syria, sparking a terror alert in Britain. Senior security officials have said that around 250 British based 'extremist tourists' have returned home, and are now suspected of wanting to carry out attacks here. The figure is five times higher than previously thought and includes several 'veterans' who have fought in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Fighting: Security officials are closely monitoring 250 British-based jihadis linked to the Syria. Above, rebel fighters fire a rocket-propelled grenade at an army checkpoint in the Ain Tarma neighborhood of Damascus . MI5 and police have already intercepted an alleged serious plot by jihadis returning from the war torn region last Autumn. They were said to be planning a Mumbai-style gun attack on civilians in a crowded place, possibly London. The returnees are now being monitored by the security services, The Sunday Times reports. A senior Whitehall security official told paper: 'Well over half of those who travelled out have come back.' Last week it was announced that extremist videos which help to radicalise impressionable young men are to be blocked from the internet in the UK. The . Home Office is in talks with web companies to refuse access to violent . films hosted overseas 'at a network level', MailOnline can reveal. The . plans for what will effectively be ‘cyber border controls’ have been . drawn up by James Brokenshire, promoted to immigration minister at the . weekend. Conflict: Around 400 extremists are believed to have travelled to Syria. Above, a rebel clutches his head . Ministers were spurred into action by the growing threat from jihadists in Syria. Around 2,000 Europeans are thought to be fighting in Syria, including at least 200 known to the British security services. It . is feared that fighters returning to the UK will seek to radicalise . young men in particular to launch terror attacks at home and abroad. Anti-terror police and the Crown Prosecution Service can currently demand that vile videos posted on UK websites be removed. Since . February 2010, the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) has . taken down more than 21,000 pieces of illegal terrorist online content. If . the CTIRU and prosecutors deem material to be illegal it can be blocked . from parts of the public sector, including schools and hospitals but . this does not extend to domestic users and filters can be turned off. Last week, video footage capturing the final moments of a British suicide bomber's life was released by a terrorist group in Syria. The clip, recorded by the al-Qaeda-aligned group Jabhat al-Nusra, shows Abdul Waheed Majeed relaxing and smiling moments before he carried out the suicide attack, the first by a Briton.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Butchered: Jomali Morales was stabbed 19 times by Markeece Dunning and left for dead in a housing project elevator in lower Manhattan . A Manhattan man who admitted stabbing to death a former model in 2011 has been sentenced to life in prison. Markeece Dunning, 22, was sentenced Thursday after pleading guilty earlier this year to first-degree murder for the horrific killing of 42-year-old Jomali Morales that left her with 19 stab wounds in her face neck and back, officials said. Morales’ butchered body was infamously found covered in blood February 12, 2011 in the elevator of Baruch Houses, a city housing project on the Lower East Side. Prosecutors contended during today’s sentencing that Dunning planned to rob and rape Morales as soon as he saw her in the hours before she was found dead. The woman was later found to have been intoxicated at the time of her death, and investigators believe that impaired her judgement enough that she allowed Dunning to convince her to go to his apartment that morning instead of returning home, a source told MailOnline. Authorities called her ‘the perfect victim.’ Dunning made a false promise to the woman, which he did not tell authorities, and she agreed to go to his home, the source said. Morales was later found dead, and police arrested the then-19-year-old Dunning one month later. She was tragically laid to rest on what should have been a day of celebration. ‘Because of Markeece Dunning, Jomali Morales’ family planned her funeral on the day they should have been celebrating her 43rd birthday,’ asid Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr. ‘After horrifically murdering Ms. Morales, the defendant left her to die in an elevator of the Baruch Houses,’ Vance continued. Her belongings were later found sifted into separate plastic bags scattered through the building, authorities said. Sexually motivated: Dunning admitted to wanting to rape and rob Morales the minute he saw her, but instead wound up stabbing her in the face, neck and back . Where she was found: Morales' bloody, lifeless body was found in 2011 slumped over in this housing project elevator . Morales’ mother Petra Vitale told WABC shortly after the killing that ‘she was like a light that lit up the room.’ The one-time model had grown up on the Lower East Side and left the city only to return with a young daughter, her mother said. That girl is now being raised by her grandmother. Dunning was only a teenager when arrested, but he had already logged 11 prior arrests for crimes ranging from drug possession and trespassing to gang assault, officials said.","Markeece Dunning admitted pleaded guilty earlier this year to killing Jomali Morales in 2011 .

The rabbit, hippo and giraffe emerging from the coffee cups are the astonishing work of a barista in a Japanese cafe. Japanese latte artist Kazuki Yamamoto has taken coffee art to a higher level. While others may try swirling their flat images on foam, the 26-year-old specialises in building 3-D sculptures, some of them even climbing out of one cup and into another. Purrr-fect coffee: These cute cats look like they're posing for the camera. Japanese latte artist Kazuki Yamamoto has taken coffee art to a higher level . Creature coffee: Tokyo resident Mr Yamamato, 23, says each artwork takes between three and five minutes . The barista’s currently working in Cafe10g in Osaka but dreams of opening his own place in Tokyo where making art, however fleeting, is more than just a perk of the job. Among his temporary masterpieces are pictures of pop sensation Psy, and Disney characters Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Pinocchio. Yamamoto has made a name for himself on Twitter, where more than 82,000 followers receive daily tweets with images of his latest creations. But he’s hardly the only latte artist to emerge from Japan. Time for coffee: A Salvador Dali-esque melting clock adorns this cup of java . Help me! A polar bear struggles to escape his caffeinated peril .

Hot beverage bath: The nimble-fingered barista first created 'flat white' pictures on coffees and moved into sculpture . Yamamoto’s friend Kohei Matsuno, a 23-year-old originally from Osaka who now works at a café in Tokyo, also creates coffee characters from anime to Lady Gaga. More recently, Matsuno has begun recreating famous works of art like Edvard Munch’s ‘The Scream.’ He uses a toothpick and a spoon for such fine details. The milk and foam parts go on first, then he uses toothpicks to add ‘shading’ with espresso. The whole process, he says, takes about three to five minutes. Some controversy exists within the coffee community as to whether or not there is excessive focus on latte art amongst baristas. The argument is that too much focus on the superficial appearance of a drink leads some to ignore more important issues - such as taste. Intricate: Some sculptures, such as this cat watching fish in a pond, are spread over two cups. Many show popular cartoon characters, such as the three-eyed aliens from Toy Story .

"By . Andrew Levy . The number of young men applying to go into higher education is reaching crisis point, the head of the university applications service has warned. A huge gender-gap is opening as young women choose to continue their education at university after leaving school while their male peers start work instead. The number of girls applying to study for a degree this year is more than a third larger than that of boys. Experts have warned of a huge gender-gap opening as young women choose to study at university while their males peers opt to enter the world of work. According to UCAS figures 78,860 more women than men have applied to university this year in the UK . If the trend continues, the gulf between male and female students will soon overtake the difference between rich and poor students, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service said. According to its figures, in England, over 62,000 more women than men have applied for places this year – a rise of five per cent in just 12 months. This is despite a one per cent fall in the 18-year-old population. UK-wide figures are even worse, with a 76,680 gulf representing a 5.8 per cent increase. Young people from the most disadvantaged areas are now twice as likely to apply as they were in 2004. If both groups continue in the same direction, men will become the group most in need of intervention to increase numbers in the early 2020s. UCAS chief executive Mary Curnock Cook said: ‘There remains a stubborn gap between male and female applicants. ‘Young men are becoming a disadvantaged group in terms of going to university and this under-performance needs urgent focus across the education sector.’ UCAS chief executive Mary Curnock Cook, said: 'There remains a stubborn gap between male and female applicants. Young men are becoming a disadvantaged group in terms of going to university and this under-performance needs urgent focus' Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, said more young women aim to go into higher education because they enjoy studying more, do better in exams and don’t feel the same need to ‘assert’ themselves by getting a paid job immediately after school. In a reference to so-called ‘social engineering’ which has seen universities encouraged to accept lower grades from teenagers with deprived backgrounds, the Commons adviser added: ‘I wonder if, in support of widening access, we ought to consider young men with lower A-level grades than women.’ Last summer data from UCAS set alarm bells ringing about white schoolchildren, who are now less inclined to apply to university than any other  ethnic group. Just 29 per cent of white school leavers registered an interest to take a degree, compared with 34 per cent of black teenagers, 41 per cent from Asian families and 57 per cent from Chinese backgrounds. A total of 408,300 English residents applied to universities by the January 15 deadline, the second consecutive annual rise. It means the 424,800 record set in 2011 could be broken next year.","Gender-gap is opening as women choose university while boys opt to work .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A 23-year-old Massachusetts cab driver who went out for dinner with the Boston Marathon bombing suspects hours after the attack has been charged with obstructing the investigation. Khairullozhon Matanov, who is originally from Kyrgyzstan, is alleged to have also met the Tsarnaev brothers and spoken to them in the days after the April 15 attack. Although Matanov is not believed to have had prior knowledge of the attack, he is facing charges of destroying records and making a false statement in a terrorism investigation. Arrest: Khairullozhon Matanov is facing charges of obstructing a terrorism investigation after allegedly deleting files from his computer . Court date: Khairullozhon Matanov, second left, appears before a judge on Friday to face charges over his alleged actions after the bombings . The Quincy resident has lived in the U.S. since 2010, when he arrived on a student visa. He was later granted permission to stay because of unrest in his home country. At his court hearing on Friday, hours after police raided his apartment, Matanov wore a Levi's T-shirt and jeans as he entered no plea. According to the indictment, seen by the Boston Globe, Matanov had been friends with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and allegedly joined him in activities such as 'discussing religious topics and hiking . up a New Hampshire mountain in order to train like, and praise, the ""mujahideen"" [Islamic guerrillas]'. After dining with the brothers a few hours after two devices had been detonated near the finish line of the marathon, in an attack that killed three and injured 260 others, Matanov appeared to show support for the bombings. Nervous: An attorney for Matanov, who moved to the U.S. from Krygzstan in 2010, says his client is frightened by the charges . Suspects: Tamerlan, right, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, seen on security footage on the day of the attack. That night, they met Matanov for dinner . Arrest: Matanov was handcuffed and led away from this Quincy apartment at about 5.30am Friday . He allegedly told a witness the attack 'could have had a just reason, such as being done in the name of Islam,' the indictment said. Cab driver Khairullozhon Matanov was friends with the Tsarnaev brothers before the Boston Marathon bombing. He had joined older brother Tamerlan for a hike where they allegedly praised mujahideen. On April 15, 2013, just 42 minutes after two bombs were detonated near the finish line of the marathon, Matanov called the brothers to invite them out for dinner. An indictment claims that as a manhunt for the suspects - at this point still unidentified - got underway, Matanov spoke to the brothers on a cell phone. On April 17, the 23-year-old from Krygyzstan visited Tamerlan at his home. He first realized they were suspects when police released pictures of the brothers. On April 18, Matanov allegedly tried to call Dzhokhar's cellphone. No one answered. After the brothers were named as suspects, Matanov allegedly deleted 902 video files and 377 document files from his computer. He allegedly asked two people to take cell phones from him. Early on in the investigation, Matanov was interviewed voluntarily by police. On May 30, 2014, he was arrested at his apartment. It added that he claimed 'he would support the bombings if the reason were just or the attack had been done by the Taliban, and the victims had gone to paradise'. It was only days later that he started to express sympathy for the victims, and say the bombings might have been wrong. During this time he allegedly saw the brothers, suspected of being behind the attacks, a couple of times. He allegedly tried to contact both Tamerlan and Dzhokhar twice on a cellphone, and saw Tamerlan in person on two occasions, including at the suspect's home on April 17. According to the indictment, Matanov didn't realize his friends had been connected with the bombing until the FBI released pictures of them on April 18. He allegedly tried to contact the brothers one last time, on the morning of April 19, when he called Dzhokhar's cellphone. No one answered. At that point, Dzhokar was the focus of a massive manhunt, and his brother had already been shot dead by police. After the brothers were named as the suspects, Matanov is accused of making false statements to investigators, and deleting files from his computer of 'violent content or calls to violence'. He also allegedly tried to get two people to take cell phones from him, so they wouldn't be found when the FBI searched his apartment. By deleting the files, the indictment says Matanov: 'Obstructed the FBI’s determination . of his internet activity ... and the extent to which he shared the . suspected bombers’ philosophical justification for violence, among other . topics of interest'. Connection: Brothers Tamerlan, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, right, knew Matanov . Refuge: After arriving in the U.S. on a student visa, Matanov was given residency because of unrest in his home country . Accusations: Matanov could face a lengthy prison term if he is found guilty of obstructing the investigation . Although he was interviewed voluntarily by a detective, Matanov allegedly made false statements to hide the extent of his friendship with the brothers. Matanov, who has no family in the U.S., was described as being 'nervous and frightened' by his defense attorney, Ed Hayden. 'He had no intent to mislead the FBI and, from what I can see, whatever he did, didn’t impede the investigation,' Hayden told the Boston Globe. Matanov has been charged with one count of destroying altering and falsifying records and documents, and three counts of making a false statement in a federal terrorism investigation.

Forensic: Investigators survey the site of a bomb blast on Boylston Street a day after two explosions hit the Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts on April 16, 2013 . If found guilty, the cab driver could face up to 20 years in prison for the first charge, and up to eight years for each of the three false statement charges. He is being held without bail until a hearing, scheduled to be held on Wednesday. Matanov is the fifth person to face charges surrounding the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is charged with carrying out the attack, and three of his university friends are facing charges over the alleged removal of a backpack and laptop from his dorm room.","Khairullozhon Matanov is accused of destroying records and making false statements during a terrorism investigation .

Masters champion Phil Mickelson, and Carl Icahn - the richest man on Wall Street - are being investigated by the FBI over claims of insider trading involving them and legendary Las Vegas gambler William Walters.

Walters, who plays golf with Mickelson, is a well-known sports gambler who met Icahn through a mutual acquaintance and struck up a friendship, according to Reuters. Sources who have been briefed on the investigation claimed that Icahn had accumulated a 9.1 percent stake in Clorox in February 2011. In July, the activist investor made an offer for the company that valued it at above $10 billion and sent its stock soaring.

"By . Lydia Warren . An Illinois high school denied its graduating seniors their diplomas after they threw their caps in the air during their commencement ceremony after they were told not to. The day after the celebration, staff at Ridgewood High School in Norridge wrote on its website that class representatives would have to apologize for the 'disrespectful and insubordinate behavior' if they wanted the students to receive their diplomas. Superintendent Dr. Robert Lupo wrote a blog post about the incident to the students at the school, which appropriately has the slogan 'Home of the Rebels', referring to their athletic team. The blog said the students had been warned against throwing the caps because the age-old tradition was dangerous that could leave students 'with cuts and black eyes'. Scroll down for video . Rebels: A video of commencement at Ridgewood High School in Norridge, Illinois shows students throwing their caps in the area after they were told not to, in case other students were hurt . 'It was a simple instruction,' he wrote. '""Please do . not throw the caps or there will be consequences.""  The graduates heard . this and made their choice to mar what should have been a joyous event. 'Perhaps it is the final lesson they will take away from . high school: there are consequences for behaviors in life. If you are . unwilling to face those consequences, perhaps you should rethink your . actions.' The blog has since been removed and after the decision sparked outcry - with many students saying the school were being unfair or taking the celebration too seriously - the school reversed its decision. 'Regarding the distribution of diplomas; we recognize that most of those who participated in the graduation ceremonies were well-behaved and followed instructions,' an announcement said. Anger: Supt. Dr. Robert Lupo said they needed to know there were consequences for their actions . 'I am sorry that the ceremony was marred by a few students who chose not to follow those instructions. 'Consequently, we have re-thought our policy and will be sending out diplomas to all members of the class of 2014 today.' The students have previously expressed their disappointment after school staff refused to hand out diplomas. 'I just think it’s really ridiculous,' Jackie Rios told WMAQ. 'We worked so hard to get to this point.' 'It was kind of silly that they would request them not to,' parent Mary Sticha added. 'It wasn't a way to disrespect anyone, it was just a way to do something together and celebrate the end of the year.' Scene: A day after the decision was announced, staff reversed it and said students could have their diplomas . Comments on Lupo's blog also called the decision 'the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard'. 'Maybe it is you, Dr. Lupo, that needs to grow up,' the comment said. But other commenters agreed with the decision, with one saying: 'Children need to learn from their actions. And at this point they are still children. Grow up.' Before the reversal, the students were told that they could collect their diplomas if class representatives apologized at a meeting on June 4. This is no longer necessary.

"By . Associated Press . A daughter of ailing radio personality Casey Kasem has been granted regular visits with him on Friday after raising concerns about his care. The ruling by a judge in Washington state marked the latest twist in the ongoing dispute between Kasem's wife Jean and her stepdaughter, Kerri Kasem, who has said in court filings that her father suffers from a form of dementia. Casey Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, 'American Top 40' and 'Casey's Top 40.' Now 82, he and his wife have been staying with family friends west of Seattle. Scroll down for video . Fighting in court: Kerri Kasem, one of the radio host's daughters from his first marriage and she has been filing police complaints claiming that her father's health is being threatened . Happy verdict: A Washington state judge ruled today that Kerri should be allowed regular visits with her father . Protection: Kerri Kasem asked to have a witness there when she does visit her father because she says she has 'been accused of things I haven't done' Jean Kasem has been in control of his medical care and has controlled access to him, blocking three of his children from seeing him in recent months, according to court filings. Ailing: Casey Kasem is now 82 and in frail condition (pictured in 2003) Last week, she was served with a California court order that temporarily suspended her powers to determine his medical treatment and expanded Kerri Kasem's authority to determine whether her father is receiving adequate care. Jean Kasem told KING-TV then that her husband was getting the best possible care and she was 'not going to allow anybody to shred (her) family on unfounded facts and malicious accusations.' In court on Friday, Kerri Kasem said her father was suffering from bedsores along with lung and bladder infections. Kasey Casem was not in court. In her ruling, Kitsap County Judge Jennifer Forbes said Kerri Kasem will be allowed daily visits for up to an hour and can have her father examined by a doctor. After lawyers for Jean Kasem raised . concerns about pictures of Casey Kasem being given to the media, the . judge told Kerri Kasem that any images from her visits could not be . distributed beyond herself or her lawyer. Forbes . also ruled that Casey Kasem must stay in Washington state unless some . sort of deal is struck to return him to California, and that Kerri Kasem . could bring a witness to her visits with her father. Defending her stance: Casey Kasem's wife Jean, who is Kerri's stepmother, maintains that he is well-cared for and she has actively fought to keep Casey from Kerri . Support: Liberty Jean Kasem, Jean and Casey's daughter, was in the court by her mother's side . Relocated: Jean and Casey Kasem, who was not present in court on Friday, have been staying with friends in Washington state . 'I actually would like to have somebody in there,' she said. 'I have been accused of things I haven't done. It's for my protection.' Forbes scheduled another hearing for June 6. Earlier this month, a judge in Los Angeles expressed concerns about Casey Kasem's whereabouts and safety after an attorney for his wife said he did not know where Kasem was. The Kitsap County Sheriff's Office tracked him down the next day and said appropriate medical care was being provided.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . and Francesca Chambers . President Obama announced late Friday morning that he has accepted 'with considerable regret' the resignation of scandal-hit Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. But the shake-up had all the markings of an Oval Office firing. At a hastily arranged press conference, Obama said: 'Ric's commitment to our veterans is unquestioned. His service to our country is exemplary.' 'I am grateful for his service, as are many veterans across the country,' he said. The president said Shinseki, a wounded Vietnam veteran, was a 'very good man' and that it was his own decision to step down – he was becoming a 'distraction' to sorting out the waiting list scandal that has engulfed the agency and the White House in recent weeks. It was 'Ric's judgement that he could not . carry out the next stages of reform without being a distraction . himself,' Obama said. 'My assessment was, unfortunately, he is right.' But just a few hours earlier, Shinseki spoke at a meeting of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans in Washington, D.C., sounding very much like a man prepared to fight for his job with big plans to fix his agency's 'breach of integrity.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Awkward: A visibly perturbed Barack Obama said Friday that Eric Shinseki was out as VA secretary, less than two weeks after his chief spokesman expressed deep confidence in the war hero who resigned Friday amid widespread troubles with veterans' health care . Out with the old and in with the new: Eric Shinseki (L) resigned as VA secretary on Friday, with his deputy Sloan Gibson (R) set to replace him on a temporary basis . Shinseki's resignation follows last month's high-profile departure of former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and may indicate growing dysfunction inside the Obama White House . MARCH TO THE SCAFFOLD: Shinseki (C) presided over a VA system whose medical centers have let dozens of veterans die while they waited to see doctors for the first time; his final appearance as an Obama cabinet secretary came at a meeting of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans in Washington, D.C. as he faced loud calls for his resignation . Obama also said Friday that he had received a . report proving that reported medical-system abuses were widespread, and insisted that . misdeeds would not go unpunished: Senior staff at the VA were being . fired and bonuses cancelled for senior staff. 'I think he is deeply disappointed in . the fact that bad news did not get to him,' the president said of Shinseki, 'and that the structures . weren’t in place for him to identify this problem quickly and fix it.' Support for Shinseki had quickly eroded on Capitol Hill, with more than 100 members of Congress calling for his ouster by Friday. Many were Democrats facing tough re-election battles in states where Republicans dominate the electorate. But leading the charge was Republican Sen. John McCain from Arizona, where the VA's most high-profile failures first surfaced. 'If Secretary Shinseki does not step down voluntarily,' McCain said Wednesday, 'then I call on the president of the United States to relieve him of his duties, to fire him.' More congressional outrage and high-road commentary followed Friday morning's changing of the guard. Another Arizonan, Republican Paul Gosar, laid the scandal squarely on Obama's shoulders. 'President Obama has ostensibly forced Secretary Shinseki to resign over the scandals and systemic failures at the Veterans Administration. I appreciate the President and Secretary Shinseki heeding my call and those of my colleagues to resign. But I say accountability ends at the President’s feet,' Gosar said Friday. 'As the sign on President Harry Truman’s desk in the Oval Office stated, ""The buck stops here."" ... The president needs to step up and set a better example of leadership.' 'With Secretary Shinseki’s resignation today, we can begin to address the systemic dysfunction that has plagued the Department of Veterans Affairs for years,' said California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the powerful Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the House of Representatives. 'There are serious problems at the VA that won’t be solved simply by replacing the secretary,' explained a more defensive Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from the state of Washington. Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer took a swipe at the Obama administration, saying the VA lacked 'accountability' and 'is in desperate need of stronger, more aggressive leadership.' A pair of senators, one from each major party, also demanded a criminal investigation by the FBI. Senate Appropriations Committee chair Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, and its vice-chair, Alabama Republican Richard Shelby, said they would propose a bill next week giving the FBI the resources it will need 'for criminal and civil investigations into allegations that the VA falsified patient records at centers and clinics across the country.' 'This scandal has dragged on over a decade,' they wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder. 'We believe the Department of Justice should begin investigations right away ... and bring any charges that might be appropriate.' New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, known on Capitol Hill as a partisan's partisan, said in a statement to MailOnline that Shinseki 'is in the fullest sense of the word a true patriot. In keeping with General Shinseki’s stellar character, he offered his resignation because he realized, as every good soldier does, that the buck stops at the top.' Obama . said Friday that VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson would step in as acting secretary of the . VA while the administration looks for a permanent replacement for . Shinseki. The president said he spoke to Gibson this morning . and 'made it clear that reforms should not wait.' Fired? Shinseki sounded Friday morning like a man grappling with how to fix his ailing agency, but hours later Obama said he 'offered' his resignation instead . Famously aloof: Obama appeared Friday morning in an Oval Office interview on the 'Live With Kelly and Michael' show, calmly describing a 'serious conversation' he was about to have with Shinseki about 'whether he ... has the capacity to take on the job of fixing it' 'I said we will not tolerate misconduct, and we will not,' Obama said. 'I said that we could better, and we will.' Obama also announced that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors, who is . leading the VA's internal review of its practices, will stay on temporarily at the . VA while reforms are put in place. Support for Shinseki seemed to crater in recent days, with press secretary Jay Carney refusing on Thursday to answer a yes-or-no question . about whether the president still had 'confidence' in Shinseki. On May 19, as the worst of the allegations against the VA yet came in, Obama's chief spokesman stated flatly that 'the . president has confidence in Secretary Shinseki.' But on Thursday he . dodged a point-blank dare to repeat that endorsement. Carney calmly offered a contradictory set of guidelines about actions the . VA and the White House should take in response to the brewing veterans' health care scandal. 'This is very important,' Carney said just minutes into his briefing on Thursday. 'The VA should not and must not wait for the current investigation of VA operations to conclude before taking steps to improve care.' Moments later he told reporters that President Obama would likely wait before taking action. 'The . president identified last week that he expected a preliminary report . from Secretary Shinseki's internal audit very soon,' instructed Carney. 'And once he receives . that he'll be able to evaluate those findings along with what we're . seen in the interim report from the inspector general, and then assess . where we are at that time.' Off the wait list: Shinseki couldn't survive more than 100 demands for his head from members of Congress . In . his last public appearance as an Obama cabinet secretary, he . apologized, and conceded that his agency had 'a systemic, totally . unacceptable lack of integrity.' But . hours before he was to meet face-to-face with Obama in the Oval Office, . Shinseki was focused on fixing that 'breach of integrity' – describing . the firing of top VA managers at the agency's medical center in Phoenix. While . Shinseki was speaking, Obama was appearing on the 'Live With Kelly and . Michael' show in a segment taped a day earlier. He described a 'serious conversation' he would soon have . with his VA secretary about 'whether he thinks that he is prepared and . has the capacity to take on the job of fixing it.' On . Wednesday the VA's inspector general released a . preliminary report showing that veterans in Phoenix, Arizona, waited an . average of 115 days for a first medical appointment, and that 1,700 of . them were left off of waiting lists and denied care entirely. About 40 veterans died while waiting to see doctors in Phoenix alone. An internal review of the VA headed up by Nabors found that managers at more than 60 percent of the VA's hospitals had been lying about how long veterans were waiting for care and there was a 'systemic lack of integrity within some Veterans Health Administration facilities.' That report hit Obama's desk Friday morning after Shinseki delivered brief remarks to the homeless veterans group. Shortly after, Shinseki resigned. 'He felt like new leadership would be -- would serve our veterans best,' Obama said on Friday. /And I agree with him. '","Gen. Eric Shinseki is out after months of controversy and dozens of veterans' deaths .

"Actor Gerard Depardieu is paying tax of just six per cent in his adopted country of Russia after Vladimir Putin gave him a passport last year, it was revealed  earlier today. He quit his native France over the punitive 75 percent wealth tax imposed by the socialist government. The 65-year-old actor filed his tax return on time in the remote region of Mordovia, better known for its prison camps, where he is registered as a self-employed businessman. Actor Gerard Depardieu, pictured, left France for tax purposes after socialist President Francois Hollande imposed a 75 percent wealth tax on incomes above ¿1 million . This enables him to pay a reduced rate of six per cent compared with the standard Russian flat tax rate of 13 per cent, itself well below Western norms. The six-percent rate is for entrepreneurs with an annual income of less than 60 million roubles, roughly £1 million, said newspaper Izvestia yesterday. Depardieu plans to set up a restaurant and arts centre in the dusty  regional capital of Saransk but he has not visited for a year. Mordovia is more than 2,000 miles from Paris and 300 miles further east than Moscow. Local official Valery Maresyev said: 'There were plans and they haven't been dropped. Gerard Depardieu will return to them when he finishes other projects.' The actor, who has become a friend of Putin's, has appeared in a Russian sitcom, an advertisement for a bank, and played Rasputin in a movie. The French actor recently starred in a movie partly shot in Chechnya alongside Elizabeth Hurley, pictured . He has also made a film called 'Viktor' with Elizabeth Hurley, which was partly shot in Chechnya, ravaged by two wars since the collapse of the Soviet Union. In March he launched an new range of watches for Swiss  manufacturer Cvstos under the banner 'Proud to be Russian'. Depardieu initially crossed the border to Belgium after France's President Hollande announced the decision to impose the wealth tax on annual incomes over €1 million. Soon after arriving in the Belgian town of Nechin, the actor held a massive barbecue for local residents where he decribed himself as a 'citizen of the world'. He later explained his reasons for moving to French magazine Le Figaro: 'I never left! I refuse to be shut in by borders, that's completely different. 'I am a free man. I feel at home everywhere in Europe. 'This whole story is a big misunderstanding. I love France as much as ever. It's my country.'

"By . Julian Robinson . Prince William's friend, Guy Pelly, appears at Hammersmith Magistrates Court where he is on trial accused of driving a motor vehicle when his alcohol level was above the limit . A close friend of Prince William refused to puff into a police breathalyser after he 'panicked'  knowing he was close to the drink drive limit, a court heard today. Nightclub owner Guy Pelly was pulled over while driving his £90,000 Audi R8 GT V10 Coupe  through London’s Knightsbridge, in the early hours of May 28 last year, after visiting an exclusive club he owns. At first the 32-year-old refused to give a sample at the roadside before being arrested and taken to Belgravia Police Station to be tested on a more complex machine. At his trial, his defence team claimed radio waves from his iPhone may then have interfered with the station's intoxicometer - and that the machine may have even been faulty. In the dock, Pelly, who recently married Holiday Inn heiress Lizzy Wilson at a ceremony attended by Princes William and Harry, claimed he had drunk two 'large' glasses of red wine with dinner hours before he was stopped and arrested. He insisted to police at the time that he had drunk two beers although today said that he was unsure of what he told them at the time. Wearing a navy suit, white shirt and navy tie, the aristocrat, whose mother Lady Carolyn Herbert was a close of Princess Diana, said: 'I planned to go to a nightclub I own to check on it and see that stuff was OK. 'I had two large glasses of red wine, I don’t remember what [kind] it was.' Mr Pelly said he opened a bottle to himself on the evening of May 27. He then stopped drinking at around 11pm, with wine left in the bottle, but he could not remember how much, the court heard. He continued: 'I then got in my car and drove to the bar I own. I was there talking to staff, checking the customers are ok, I was in the back office, probably were my staff are, spoke to the staff there, that kind of stuff.' Scroll down for video . Guy Pelly pictured next to his luxury Audi. The 32-year-old refused to give a sample at the roadside before being arrested and taken to Belgravia Police Station, the court heard . He denied that he had had any more to drink at the nightclub before climbing back in to his car shortly before 1am. He was pulled over just before 1.10am by police who claimed he had 'accelerated quickly' in his luxury car. Pelly said: 'I noticed the police when they put their lights on and their sirens, and then they obviously wanted me to pull over so I pulled over to the side of the road.' Well connected: Guy Pelly, 32, with Princess Beatrice . When asked why he refused to give a sample he said: 'I knew that I had drunk alcohol that night, that I had drunk near to what the limit was, so I was anxious. 'In a way I panicked a little bit.' Pelly was arrested and taken to Belgravia Police station after refusing to give a sample. An expert . witness for the defence told Hammersmith Magistrates Court that the US . made intoximeter was behaving irregularly while Pelly was tested. Professor . Hugh Makin, an expert witness for the defence, called into question the . reliability of the breathalyser used at Belgravia Police Station to . record Pelly's alcohol levels. He . claimed that there was an 'anomalous' pause of 125 seconds between the . machine recording a baseline reading of zero and the device's switch . being activated and ready to use. Prof Makin added that the breathalyser used by officers may have also had an out of date fuel cell, rendering it defective. Prince William, pictured with his hand on his head, pictured next to his close friend Guy Pelly at a Six Nations rugby match . Quizzed on the machine's readings of Pelly's breath at 52 microgrammes in 100 millilitres, Prof Makin said: 'If something happens with no satisfactory explanation, such as the 125 second delay, I can't use the machine, I can't rely on the output'. But prosecutor Stuart Sampson said: 'There is no evidence that something may take 125 seconds, it does not mean the machine was defective'. Prof Makin replied: 'I don't trust a machine that is anomalous. I can't say it was defective but if I used that argument I'm potentially giving my colleagues a defective answer'. Later, a software expert told the court that signals from the radios worn by officers in the custody area may have interfered with Pelly's breathalyser reading. Dr Peter Thrift said radio waves from Pelly's iPhone may have also affected the machine. 'Radio waves could mean the message between the machine and the reading is corrupted', Dr Thrift added. 'I would query the reading. I can't conclude at all and say it's reliable or unreliable. 'The fact is the reading should not have been done where police radios were, it should have been redone'. Guy Pelly, left, recently married Holiday Inn heiress Lizzy Wilson, right, at a ceremony attended by Princes William and Harry . But Dr Thrift admitted that he is untrained with the intoximeter device used to record Pelly's breath and there was 'no evidence the machine was interfered with'. Mr Sampson said Pelly's evidence that he only drunk two glasses of wine was 'not credible'. 'He says he drunk two large glasses of house red wine - which is an interesting turn of phrase when one is drinking at home. 'He told officers he drank two pints of beer as he said in his police statement which he signed. 'If Mr Pelly is correct then for an hour and a half or so before he was arrested he was in his car. 'He then went to his bar. The Crown say it is not credible he did not have a drink there'. Pelly, . who ran celebrity hotspots Mahiki and Whisky Mist in the past, also . organised Prince William’s stag party in Devon three years ago. His . grandmother, Monica, was a member of the Tate & Lyle sugar dynasty . and his friendship with Harry stems from their participation in the Duke . of Beaufort’s Hunt.

"By . John Hall . Prince William was treated to a royal command performance this evening as he watched England thrash Peru by three goals to nil. The prince was in attendance at Wembley stadium to watch England sail through their World Cup warm-up against the South Americans, with goals from Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge, Chelsea's Gary Cahill and Everton captain Phil Jagielka. There was a party atmosphere inside the stadium, with music, Mexican wave-style dancing, and games with paper aeroplanes keeping the guests amused before captain Steven Gerrard led the England team out for a win which looked far more convincing on paper than it did in actuality.

Daniel Sturridge curled home a stunning opener to put England ahead in their final game on home soil before the World Cup. Phil Jagielka and Gary Cahill then scored from two set-pieces after the break to give the result an encouraging appearance. Yet it was clear from this performance that there is still much work to be done if England are to hit the ground running - as they must - when they land in Brazil to take on Italy in their Group D opener. Wayne Rooney and Sturridge failed to hit it off as had been hoped, while Jean Deza, a 20-year-old debutant, breached the England defence on several occasions. Had it not been for the excellent Joe Hart and some last-ditch defending from Jagielka, Peru would have scored the goal their attacking display perhaps deserved.

"By . Paul Donnelley . The new chairman of the Police Federation has pledged to end the scandals that have plagued the nation’s forces. Inspector Steve White was elected just over a week ago as chairman of the organisation, which represents 125,000 rank-and-file policemen and women. In his first interview since securing the post, Mr White told The Guardian that his priorities were unifying the federation, and ‘rebuild[ing] the level of trust the police has with the public’. A new broom: Steve White (left), the new chairman of the Police Federation, is determined to clean up the organisation, which represents 125,000 rank and file police men and women so that scandals like Plebgate with former chief whip Andrew Mitchell (right) do not happen again . ‘We have been in a fairly dire place for 18 months ... we were quite close to being irrelevant,’ he said. The police’s reputation has been damaged in recent times by allegations of bullying, officials getting ‘bladdered’ on expenses and scandals such as Plebgate, when police claimed that then Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell swore at them when they refused to open the gates of Downing Street for him. Insp White demanded that the government stop attacking police and the federation which was lambasted by Theresa May, the Home Secretary, at its conference the week before last. She fought the Law and the Law lost: Home Secretary Theresa May lambasted the Police Federation at its conference in Bournemouth . Mrs May announced that she was scrapping all Police Federation funding because the organisation sits on 'vast reserves' of cash worth tens of millions of pounds. She also demanded that the organisation reformed itself 'from top to bottom'. Insp White said that the federation was going to reform itself anyway and ‘didn't need the Home Secretary to come and give us a beating’.","Federation represents 125,000 and Steve White new chairman wants to rebuild public trust .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Restrained: Anthony Wells, 31, was given a restraining order and also sectioned at Basildon Crown Court today . A Twitter troll who sent hundreds of abusive messages to Countdown star Rachel Riley has been given a restraining order. Anthony Wells, 31, 'distressed' the 28-year-old presenter by sending her more than 500 messages over social media - some of which included threats on her life. In one tweet he wrote: Please someone execute this fiend of nature.' Wells posted a link to a blog where he wrote songs about the TV presenter. One, entitled God Left Her Alone (A Ode To The Dead Girl Rachel), read: ‘I hope you die forever, I hope you cry forever, I hope you die now. ‘I hope your eyes bleed and your skin dries and your dream dies. I hope you fall to the earth like a child lost at birth... Dedicated to Rachel Annabelle Riley.’ He also called her a ‘dirty b****’ and described her as the ‘worst piece of s*** that ever lived in this horrid little earth’. The trolling began after Miss Riley married Jamie Gilbert, her university sweetheart, in August 2012. The couple split 16 months later. Wells, from Chelmsford, Essex, also targeted Coldplay singer Chris Martin and said that he would shoot his children in a sustained seven-month campaign. Yesterday he was given a five-year restraining order at Basildon Crown Court after admitting a charge of harassment against Miss Riley, while the charge relating to Mr Martin was not pursued. The charge stated that tweets sent from Wells’s Twitter account had 'caused Rachel Riley to fear that violence would be used against her'. One incoherent tweet posted by Wells - whom the court heard has mental health issues - read: 'Helping them might be Rachel and Chris Martin yet again trying to steal the rest of my songs for EMI and Sony. Kill them now'. Jamie Sawyer, prosecuting, told the court: 'Ultimately this case revolves around harassment causing fear of violence by Mr Wells between October 2012 and May 2013. 'Effectively what he did was send a persistent series of abusive Twitter messages. Scroll down for video . Distressed: Countdown star Rachel Riley felt threatened by the stream of more than 500 messages sent by a mentally ill man to her . 'Rachel Riley is something of a celebrity, a TV presenter on Countdown, who is married with children and uses her Twitter account to communicate with fans and advertise where she will be attending. 'Around 500 tweets were sent during the time of the indictment. The nature of these messages was always abusive. 'The messages sent to Rachel Riley of course caused her distress. Her personal statement gives a graphic description of her reaction to the tweets. 'In our observation these two complainants deserve protection and reassurance'. Judge Owen Davies QC told the court the case was a ‘delicate matter’ due to Wells's health problems. Eleanor Scott, mitigating, told the court her client has been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and his abusive tweets had been influenced by ‘psychotic thinking’. She said: 'At the time Mr Wells was significantly influenced by psychotic thinking. He is still a very mentally fragile individual but has pleaded guilty to the charge and understands what he did was wrong. 'He is happy to abide by a restraining order.' Judge Davies QC imposed a restraining order banning Wells from contacting both Rachel Riley and Chris Martin either directly or indirectly. He also sectioned Wells under the Mental Health Act. Sentencing him, the judge said: 'You’re currently in hospital and for the moment that is the right place for you to be. I am going to make a Section 37 hospital order under the Mental Health Act. Also targeted: Wells sent messages to Coldplay member Christ Martin as well . 'That is an order requiring you to remain in hospital until authorities require otherwise'. Punam Malhan, CPS East of England senior district prosecutor said: 'When Anthony Wells admitted harassing Rachel Riley at an earlier hearing we asked for an adjournment so we could seek the views of the other victim in this case, Chris Martin, on continuing with the charge which involved him. 'Mr Martin indicated that a plea to the charge involving Miss Riley would be acceptable to ensure that Mr Wells gets the medical help he needs and that he was content for us to not to proceed in relation to the remaining charge. 'Taking Mr Martin’s view into account we decided it was no longer in the public interest to continue with the second charge of harassment and that charge was today left on file. 'Wells has been sentenced to a hospital order under Section 37 of the Mental Health Act and a restraining order was imposed for a period of five years with a prohibition not to contact Rachel Riley or Chris Martin. 'Everyone should be able to go about their daily lives free from harassment caused by someone deliberately making offensive, violent messages about them on social media. 'We take allegations of this kind very seriously and especially where there is evidence of a course of conduct which causes fear or distress to someone, regardless of whether a victim is in the public eye or not'.","Anthony Wells, 31, 'distressed' Miss Riley with social media messages .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A Washington mother is suing her third-grader daughter's school because teacher makes the girl urinated on herself after running out of the Monopoly money students 'pay' to use the bathroom. Students at Mill Plain Elementary, in Vancouver, are given play money to use on bathroom breaks or snacks. The two girls chose in snacks in each instance but then needed the bathroom and the teacher refused them access, parents said. The two girls ended up in so much pain they have no choice but to just let it happen. Both girls wet their pants while sitting at their desks. Bathroom currency: Nine-year-old Lilly Ortega holds up Monopoly money similar to what she claims her teacher forces her to pay to use the bathroom . Bewildered parents were at a loss to explain why the accidents happened until the children came clean. ‘My daughter finally told me, ‘We have to pay to use the bathroom.’ Nobody should have to pay to use the bathroom,’ an irate Merchon Ortega told KOIN. Nine-year-old Lilly Ortega was traumatized by the incident and avoided going to school for fear of ridicule, her mother told Fox News. ‘I didn't let her go to school the rest of the week because she was scared to go to school,’ Ortega lamented. ‘She's scared to be made fun of.’ A classmate of Ortega’s daughter went home last week with wet pants and told her mother a similar story. Outraged: Merchon Ortega claims her daughter told her she had no choice but to go while sitting at her ask, and that wetting her pants traumatized her to the point she needs to see a therapist . Where it happened: Mill Plain Elementary School, in Vancouver, Washington . Jasmine Alayadhi detailed her daughter’s ordeal to KOIN. ‘I didn’t want to be left out. I wanted to have popcorn with my friends,’ [she said]. And so she tried to hold it. ‘She said it hurt so bad the pain was so bad – I just had to let it go,’ Alayadhi said. A school spokesperson defended the controversial program to KOIN saying it is part of the school’s classroom management strategy. It’s all part of how they manage the classroom and so that was the process decided on,’ said Gail Spolar. Students are afforded multiple bathroom breaks throughout the day and have never been denied using a restroom in an emergency, Spolar insisted. Classroom management: A school spokesperson said the funny money is used to help teachers manage the class during the day, and that no students have ever been refused trips to the toilet . ‘They have to do something. They have to stop. It’s inhumane. It’s sickening,’ Alayadhu told KOIN. The teacher has been removed from the classroom while an investigation is conducted, according to the spokesperson, but Ortega isn’t satisfied. Her daughter has switched classrooms and is doing well, she told Fox News, but a lawsuit against the school is in the works. ‘My next step is hopefully trying to take legal action,’ Ortega told the network. ‘[My daughter] has got to go to counseling because it's really messed with her emotions.’","Lilly Ortega recently wet her pants in class because her teacher refused to let her go to the bathroom .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The Chicago-area home where Ferris Bueller's friend Cameron famously 'killed' his father's prized Ferrari finally has a new owner. The 5,300-square-foot house in Highland Park, Chicago, Illinois, sold on Thursday for $1.06 million after five years on the market and several mark-downs.

Craig Hogan is regional director at Coldwell Banker Previews. He wouldn't say who bought the four-bedroom, steel-and-glass house built on the edge of a wooded ravine. However, Hogan did say that the buyers bought the property, not because of its Hollywood past, but because they love the building. 'At the end of the day, what sold the house was not the notoriety of the property but the architecture. We sold it to a couple who are architecture buffs who want to restore it. Believe me, it was not connected to the movie,' he told Crain's Chicago Business.

Figures reveal that around 30 houses a day are changing hands for seven figure sums – up two-thirds on a year ago. And all regions of the country have seen property prices jump over the past year, according to the latest data from the Land Registry. House prices are rising at 6.7 per cent - the highest rate for four years. But   homes in London went up by 17 per cent in the 12 months to April . So what does £1million buy?

Experts predict the number will soon exceed 1,000. It . is already significantly higher than the 740 homes a month, or 24 a . day, which sold for at least £1million at the peak of the pre-recession . boom in 2007.

All regions . have seen prices jump over the past year, from a 17 per cent rise in . London to a 2.9 per cent increase in the North East. Seven in ten of the . £1million-plus properties sold in February were in London, where the . average price of a house has leapt to £435,034. It rose by 4.2 per cent . in April alone – the biggest one month increase since records began in . 1995. The recent property boom has raised fears of a house price bubble which could derail the economic recovery if it is not controlled . Outside London, the . most expensive areas are Windsor and Maidenhead, where the average house . costs £366,333, and Surrey at £328,328. And after the capital, prices . are rising fastest in Oldham, where they are up 12.1 per cent. But the . average home there still costs just £82,845, the report shows. The . most expensive area of London is the exclusive Royal Borough of . Kensington and Chelsea, where a typical home sells for £1.27million. Meanwhile, prices are rising fastest in Waltham Forest in the north-east . of the capital, where they soared 26.2 per cent to £323,288 in the year . to April. Several areas of . Northern England also saw significant year-on-year price increases, with . a 5.5 per cent rise in Yorkshire and the Humber pushing the average . house price to £120,118. The . North West has seen growth of 3.8 per cent, taking the typical value to . £112,064, and in Wales, prices have increased by 3 per cent over the . past year to reach £117,581 on average. The Government has introduced a Help to Buy scheme to make it easier for youngsters with big enough salaries to afford mortgages but are not able raise deposits to get a loan. But critics say runaway house prices are making homes unaffordable .

David . Newnes, director of estate agents Your Move and Reeds Rains, said: ‘The . housing market recovery has spread  its wings out from London and the . South East.

Not so magical: British families are being charged more than the French for holidays to Disneyland Paris .

However French customers are being offered £2,829, £502 less, for exactly the same deal, which includes meals, park entry and accommodating. Then, if you try to book later in the summer holidays to get a better price, the problem is still the same.

I felt I was . boxing well, but he caught me well I've got to hold my hands up. 'I'll come back stronger. Ultimately, I felt I let myself down, I wish him all the best.

"By . Richard Spillett . A former serviceman has hit out at government bureaucrats who refused his wife of 22 years the right to enter the UK. Mike Bates, his wife, Jieb, and British-born daughter, Jamie, currently live in Saudi Arabia but need to return home after 13-year-old Jamie developed suspected Asperger syndrome. But the family have been left stunned after the Home Office turned down his wife's visa application due to suspicions over their marriage. Mike Bates (right) fears his family, including son Andrew and daughter Jamie, may be split up over a decision not to let his wife of 22 years, Jieb (left) enter Britain . Mr Bates wants to bring his daughter Jamie (left, in red t-shirt) back to his hometown in South Wales, but authorities have questioned his 22-year marriage to his wife (pictured, right, on their wedding day in 1992) Mr Bates, . who served in the RAF and is now a technician trainer for BAE Systems in the Middle East, . married his wife in Hong Kong in 1992 and the couple now have two . children. Their eldest, Andrew, 20, is half way through a construction and civil engineering degree in Newport, and Mr Bates, 50, decided to move back to the UK due to concerns over their daughter's health. He applied for the £1,200 visa, which is non-refundable, for his wife and said he sent off several documents including their marriage certificate. But . the family were horrified when a reply from the Home Office questioned . the couple's marriage and said officials did not believe they intend to . live together permanently in the UK. That . is despite the couple already having a joint mortgage for the house in Mr Bates' hometown of Aberbargoed, South Wales, . which they use for up to two months of the year when visiting family and . friends. Among . the reasons listed for rejecting Mrs Bates' visa application, . officials claimed copies of the children's birth certificates and . passports were not been included in the application. Former RAF airman Mr Bates has been working as a trainer for BAE Systems in Saudi Arabia (pictured) He wants to move his family back to his hometown of Aberbargoed in South Wales, after his contract ends . But Mr Bates said he has the documents and could have sent them if they had contacted him, and if the requirement had been made clear on a government website. He said: 'For my daughter this is already quite a stressful time and the thought of her moving without her mum is even worse. 'Officials said that how much I provided in paperwork was up to me. 'My mother is 85 and she's distraught about this. I'm on blood pressure, stress and heart tablets and this is a phenomenally stressful thing to be going through.' He added: 'I appreciate that there are many foreign nationals moving to the UK but we have been married 22 years with two British children. 'I've been paying National Insurance for the whole time I've been over here and my daughter is British - she is entitled to be treated on the NHS. 'I will have to move with my daughter no matter what'. Border officials questioned whether the couple would continue living together, despite them already having a mortgage on a home in Britain .

He said he . has already made contact with a local school for Jamie to attend from . September so she can started preparing for her two important GCSE years. His wife is already booked in for an English exam on June 5 and he has handed in his notice to his employer BAE Systems. 'I've been . paying National Insurance for the whole time I've been over here and my . daughter is British - she is entitled to be treated on the NHS' - Mike Bates . Residency rules mean he and his family will be unable to continue living in the Middle East after his job ends on July 17. He said this means he and his daughter may have to move to South Wales without his wife if the decision is not overturned and she could be forced to go to her native Thailand. He added: 'Our children do not speak Thai, my youngest possibly has autism. She will now have to start school in the UK without her mother while I try to resolve this.' Mike has set up a petition calling on Home Secretary Theresa May to reverse the decision, which has already garnered more than 1,700 signatures. He was given 28 days to lodge an appeal and is doing so with the help of his MP in south Wales. A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'All applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with the immigration rules.

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . Joe Hart denied that he will be motivated by revenge when England face Italy in the first game of the World Cup after Andrea Pirlo tricked him with a ‘Panenka’ penalty at Euro 2012. The Italian playmaker turned the quarter-final penalty shootout on its head when he stepped up to the spot with his side trailing 2-1 after  Riccardo Montolivo had missed, while Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney had both scored for England. Pirlo claimed that seeing Hart ‘doing all sorts on the line’ encouraged him to dink the ball over Hart and straight into the middle of the net, in the  style originated by Antonin Panenka for Czechoslovakia against West Germany in the final of the 1976  European Championship. Scroll down for videos... In safe hands: Joe Hart is not worried about facing another penalty from Andrea Pirlo at the World Cup . Panenka: Italy's Andrea Pirlo (L) beat Joe Hart with a cheeky chip penalty at Euro 2012 . Hart had been jumping repeatedly on his line and screaming at the penalty-takers in an attempt to make them too flustered to score. ‘I made my decision right at the last second, when I saw Joe Hart, the  England goalie, doing all sorts on his line,’ Pirlo said in his autobiography. ‘As I began my run-up, I still hadn’t decided what I was going to do. And then he moved and my mind was made up. It was all impromptu, not premeditated. ‘The only way I could see pushing my chances of scoring close to 100 per cent. There was absolutely no  showboating about it — that’s not my style.’ Hart will come face to face with Pirlo in Brazil for the first time since that quarter-final in Ukraine which ended in defeat for England.  Although there will be no shootout in England’s first group game in Manaus on June 12, Pirlo may be favoured by Italy to take a spot-kick. Hart claimed it was not weighing heavy in his mind. Italian job: Andrea Pirlo claimed he only tried the Panenka after Joe Hart's histrionics on the line . Shock to the system: Joe Hart learned humility after being dropped at Manchester City earlier this season . ‘He scored,’ said Hart. ‘I don’t think he did it to embarrass me. He just tried to get it in the net and they won the shootout. That’s it.’ Hart said he had learned humility this season after he was dropped at Manchester City in favour of Costel Pantilimon for seven Premier League games and one Champions League match. The 27-year-old reclaimed his place in Manuel  Pellegrini’s first XI but said he had learned a lesson which will benefit him in his England career. ‘I have learned a lot this season, that football definitely does not revolve around myself,’ said Hart. ‘There are other great keepers all over the world. I am at a very good club who have three good keepers. I am part of an England squad that have five or six to choose from. I just know I have to work hard to get to the best level I can be and be the best option for the  manager.’ Hart is Roy Hodgson’s first-choice goalkeeper, ahead of West Brom’s Ben Foster and Celtic’s Fraser Forster. But he said he would not be taking anything for granted, having been in the World Cup squad in South Africa in 2010 when Rob Green lost his place to David James. Green made a howler in the opening group game to gift the USA a 1-1 draw. Take nothing for granted: Rob Green lost his place at the 2010 World Cup after a howler in 1-1 draw with USA . Waiting in line: Ben Foster (L) and Fraser Forster (R) will be England's reserve keepers at the World Cup . ‘I’m not there yet, I’m still pushing hard,’ said Hart. ‘We have two great goalkeepers in the squad. We have some fantastic talent. Ben has had a fantastic season and Fraser has kept clean sheet after clean sheet at Celtic. I’m fully aware of what’s around me and it’s an enjoyable position to be in. I’m just fighting to keep it. ‘In South Africa, we were all there working as a unit and we supported Greeny for the first game. He came out and Jamo went in and we supported Jamo, that is how it is, it is nothing personal, you have to do your best for England. ‘That’s the same for me, whether I am playing or not playing I will be doing my best for England.","Joe Hart is not worried about facing a penalty by Andrea Pirlo at the World Cup in Brazil .

"By . Cindy Garcia-bennett, Press Association . Torino striker Ciro Immobile is on the verge of completing a move to Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund according to reports in Italy. Gazzetta Dello Sport claim that the Italian international will put pen to paper on Saturday after a £15.5million deal was agreed. The 24-year-old will reportedly sign a five-year deal with Jurgen Klopp's side as he has a day away from Cesare Prandelli's World Cup training camp in Florence. Stepping up: Ciro Immobile (centre) earned himself a place in Italy's provisional World Cup squad after 22 goals for Torino last season . Immobile needed a year of transition to Serie A before he could blossom into one of Italy's most lethal strikers. Following a debut campaign in Italy's . top flight in which he scored just five goals in 33 league appearances . for Genoa and, after hearing criticism that he was not ready for the big . time, Immobile proved week-in and week-out last season at Torino that . he does have what it takes. The . 24-year-old finished as the 'capocannoniere', the top scorer in Serie A . with 22 goals in 33 league appearances and his performances helped . Torino finish seventh in the league. He also made his senior debut with Italy in an international friendly against World champions Spain in March. 'Last season he struggled but Ciro has character,' Italy coach Cesare Prandelli said. 'He has a striker's DNA and he has not been affected by negative experiences. 'Many said he wasn't ready for Serie A but now those critics praise him. He is doing very well.' The journey has not been easy. Immobile joined Juventus in 2009 but had loan spells at Siena, Grossetto and Pescara. It was at the latter where his career began to take off. He scored a Serie B record 28 goals to help Pescara finish top in the 2011-12 campaign and gain promotion before he joined Genoa. 'I will always remain a fan of Pescara,' Immobile said. 'My time there was crucial to grow and improve as a player. It was my launchpad to top football.' Immobile's hopes of playing for Juve, the club that had signed him at the age of 18 for 80,000 euros, were dashed when the Italian giants sold part of his rights to cross-town rivals Torino last summer. All smiles: Immobile shares a joke with team-mate Mario Balotelli during training on Wednesday . 'Despite my (Juve) past, I was welcomed in the Torino camp with a lot of enthusiasm, something I didn't expect would happen,' Immobile said. 'I was very touched. '(Torino coach Giampiero) Ventura is similar to (Pescara coach Zdenek) Zeman. 'From a tactical and character standpoint, they have both made me grow as a person and as a player. 'I will never stop thanking Ventura because this has been a great step for me.' Immobile forged a potent attacking partnership with Alessio Cerci at Torino, with his team-mate notching 13 goals and setting up 11 others in Serie A. Prandelli spoke during the season of Cerci's unselfishness and it was no surprise when he, too, made Italy's squad. 'I'm really happy that the national team coach has considered Cerci and I for the squad,' Immobile said. 'On the pitch we understand each other very well.' The year has been so good for Immobile that the Neapolitan has surpassed Torino greats Paolo Pulici and Francesco Graziani with a single season record of goals. Toro's all-time scorer Pulici and Graziani had each scored 21 goals. Wanted man: Immobile is on the verge of joining Borussia Dortmund according to reports in Italy . 'To have overtaken two legends like Pulici and Graziani gives me great pride,' he said. 'I think I am very similar to them in character and also in my mindset to always play my best. 'I have worked so hard to reach this level but I never expected to have such a season and to lead the goalscoring charts. 'Even though we just missed out on qualifying for European football next season, our aim this season was for our fans to enjoy watching us play again and I think we have succeeded in doing so.' 'It will be difficult to turn down an important offer from abroad. But in the future I would love to play for Napoli, my home club.'","Immobile is on the verge of leaving Torino according to Gazzetta Dello Sport .

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . Lady Cecil has not been clothes shopping since Sir Henry died almost a year ago. It was always her husband who would pop down to a local boutique in Newmarket and choose a new dress for Jane, something special for her when he had a fancied runner. He would urge her to try it on. Almost always it was perfect. To go shopping without him would be too painful right now, particularly with Royal Ascot just around the corner. ‘He loved Newmarket, he loved York but he adored Ascot,’ says Lady Cecil. ‘Everything about it, the top-class racing, he loved all the fashion. He just had really great style. I’d go into a shop and say, “Oh no, there’s nothing here” and he’d pick something off the rail… and it’d be just right. ‘A good week before Ascot he’d be laying out his outfit. His tie, his handkerchief, socks and shoes, everything co-ordinated. He just really looked forward to it.’ The best: Sir Henry Cecil died almost a year ago and pictured with Frankel, known to be one of the greatest horses ever to race . Race: Lady Cecil cannot even go shopping because it reminds her too much of Sir Henry . Last year’s Royal Ascot was just a week after Sir Henry’s death on June 11, 2013. ‘It’s going to be just as difficult this year without him. Everyone says time’s a great healer. The strange thing is, I miss him more and more not less and less. ‘I don’t know whether it’s because now the training operation is not as all-consuming as it was. I just miss him more,’ says Lady Cecil, her voice faltering and eyes welling up. ‘I just do.’ In the kitchen at Warren Place, the home Sir Henry had lived in since the Seventies, reminders of him are everywhere. Photographs of him with his grandchildren are displayed on the dresser, books about him and Frankel the wonder horse lay on the table. The fruit bowl bears his name. But there is also evidence of rebirth. Lady Cecil proudly shows me the front page of the Newmarket Journal, her local paper. The main picture is of the  Warren Place team — her team — celebrating the victory of Noble Mission in the Tattersalls Gold Cup at The Curragh last Sunday. It was a first Group One success since Sir Henry’s death. He trained 114 in his 44-year training career. This was Lady Cecil’s first. It was Sir Henry’s habit to fly the Horn of Leys flag, bearing the coat of arms of his Scottish aristocratic family, every time he trained a Group One winner. And so, last Sunday, Lady Cecil’s daughter Carina — a trained solicitor who works as her secretary — proudly hoisted the aged colours up the flagpole at Warren Place. ‘I flew back on Sunday night,’ says Lady Cecil. ‘We all met in the bar upstairs at Dublin airport. Lord Grimthorpe [racing manager for Noble Mission’s owner Prince Khalid], his wife Emma, James [Doyle, jockey] George [Scott, assistant trainer] and I. James showed me his phone and my nephew, Charles, had put a picture of the flag on twitter. ‘That was our main target when I took up the licence last year so it was very special to be able to get the flag up for Henry.’ Trainer: Sir Henry greets Frankel after his victory in the Juddmonte International Stakes in 2012 . When Noble Mission arrived home on Monday, the team assembled under the flagpole with a glass of champagne. Lady Cecil calls them her extended family. There had been scepticism when she took over the training operation after her husband’s death. Some thought the yard would wither away without his magic. Several owners removed their horses. ‘I believe there was [some negativity] but nobody says it to your face, do they?’ she says. ‘I suppose some people thought we were mad and I woke up sometimes myself thinking I was mad but we just had so much going for us here. ‘It would have been so hard for my staff if I’d given up and those horses, their horses, had gone somewhere else. ‘It was also a welcome distraction. When you’ve got 100 horses and 60 staff as we did at the time, you can’t just hide away.’ Crucially, Prince Khalid and the Niarchos family left their horses with her and she has justified their faith, with 35 winners from 156  runners, an enviable 22.45 per cent strike rate. Perhaps it would have been easy to give up but for Lady Cecil, Warren Place equals Sir Henry. The vegetable garden, which he designed in the grounds, remains unaltered. The figs he loved to eat continue to grow and the scent from the pink and yellow roses that he loved tending to hangs thick in the air. It is when she stands on top of the heath watching her third lot of the day walk down the hill and canter back up that Lady Cecil, who married Sir Henry in 2008, feels closest to him. ‘Sometimes I’m on my own and that’s a very special place because I think of all the hundreds and  hundreds of hours that Henry stood out there probably standing on the same spot,’ she says. ‘I’m sure it all seems to the other trainers that it’s not the same without him and I’m sure it will be a long time before everyone gets used to it, really. ‘But the warmth everybody felt from Henry has been partly transferred on to me. Often people are just out on the heath watching the horses and they tell me about meeting Henry 15 years ago, and it’s just so vivid in their memory. Two years ago: Sir Henry at York racecourse in 2012 . ‘He didn’t . know who they were, he just saw that they were up for the day. They . were standing at the fence and he made them come across to him. I still . have people write to me and say he touched their lives. You can never . tell me enough things about Henry.’ Lady . Cecil was granted a temporary licence and did a course at the British . Racing School to get her full licence. Much of it she had already . learned subconsciously from Henry.  ‘George [Scott] must get sick to . death of me saying, “Henry would have done this or Henry would have done . that”. On the whole, we try to keep it as much the same as Henry would . have had it. But, of course, it’s impossible because with him it was . instinct. Lots of people say he was a genius — and he was. You cannot . teach that.’ Even in the week before his death, Sir Henry would be instructing his wife from his hospital bed on pairing riders with horses. ‘He couldn’t contemplate not being around,’ says Lady Cecil. ‘He just wanted to live. It wasn’t something that even occurred to him until the last couple of days and it was so important to him to think that he could have got better. He just did so well for so long that we just thought he was invincible… and he was for so long.’ She keeps Sir Henry’s legacy alive with every winner and she is keen to nurture more horses to the winning post. ‘You always want to build on what you’ve got,’ she says. ‘We went down in numbers but it would be lovely if people saw what we were doing and said, “Oh, they’re doing quite well at Warren Place again”. ‘But I’m just so lucky to be doing something that I love. It’s a huge responsibility but there are these huge rewards and every day, rain or shine, it’s still lovely out there.’ The team: Sir Henry with jockey Tom Queally and Frankel after winning the Qipco 2000 Guineas Stakes .","Lady Cecil cannot even go shopping because it is 'too painful' without Sir Henry .

"Teenage winger Callum Lancaster grabbed two tries as Hull eased back to winning ways with a 50-12 victory over the 12-man Broncos in London. Lancaster, 17, bagged a try in each half on just his second senior appearance as the Black and Whites sentenced the Londoners, who had Scott Moore dismissed just before the break, to their 15th successive Super League defeat. Joe Westerman also added a brace for Hull, who outscored their opponents nine tries to two in a largely one-sided encounter. Starring role: Callum Lancaster, left, scored two tries for Hull as they thrashed London Broncos . Ahead of kick-off, Nesiasi Mataitonga moved from full-back to a first start at stand-off for the hosts, while James Greenwood replaced Olsi Krasniqi at prop. Hull made two changes of their own, Ben Crooks and Chris Tuson coming in for former Bronco Liam Colbon and Dean Hadley respectively. Despite putting London to the sword 40-4 on their own turf five weeks ago, Hull entered the contest on the back of four straight defeats. And they were on the back foot here within six minutes, Greenwood charging down Jordan Rankin's clearing kick and flopping over the line for the opening score. Hull were mightily close to hauling themselves level when Mason Caton-Brown hauled down Crooks as he looked to cross in the corner. But the reprieve proved temporary for the home side as Mataitonga's spill was seized on by Gareth Ellis, who cantered over the line on 12 minutes to help level the scores. Dismissed: Scott Moore (L) of London was red carded for a dangerous arm swinging tackle on Callum Lancaster . It was real end-to-end stuff, with London's Denny Solomona and Hull's Lancaster both having tries chalked off for forward passes. Lancaster was not to be denied on 22 minutes though, taking a pass from Kirk Yeaman to ease in at the corner. Hull were growing in stature, with the Londoners being forced back thanks to a string of penalties. And the Black and Whites cashed in one such infringement for their third try, Westerman stepping inside and out to rumble over the line from close range. Handling errors were continuing to dog the Broncos, and, after the hosts once again knocked on in their own territory, Jamie Shaul raced in at the corner after a flowing handling move involving Crooks and Yeaman to help make it 22-6. Much-needed: The win ended a run of four successive defeats for Hull and continued London Broncos' misery . Things went from bad to worse for London moments later, with hooker Moore seeing red after a hit on Lancaster. To their credit, London emerged fired up for the second half, despite being consistently penalised by referee George Stokes. And the Broncos converted that tempo into points when Caton-Brown powered over after a short pass from George Griffin on 47 minutes. Hull, having really taken their foot off the gas, finally sprang back into life midway through the half, Liam Watts breaking the London defence and offloading for Danny Houghton to cruise over. The visitors were on the front foot again, Lancaster close to claiming his second score when his lunge for the line came up inches short. But a sixth try did come for Hull on 66 minutes, Westerman notching his second when he shrugged off weak Broncos tackling to stride over. By now it was a case of how many tries Hull would run in, and Lancaster got his name on the scoresheet again when Yeaman's pass gave him a free run to the corner. There was still time for Hull to run in two further late tries, Rankin and Fetuli Talanoa crossing after good work from Shaul and Jacob Miller respectively. Rock bottom: That defeat leaves Broncos anchored to the foot of the Super League but Hull move to 10th .","Hull end four-game losing streak in style with thumping win .

"By . Eleanor Crooks . If Maria Sharapova is feeling any pressure from being the title favourite at the French Open then Paula Ormaechea can attest that she is not showing it. As soon as Serena Williams was cleared from her path by Garbine Muguruza, Sharapova was tipped as the player to beat.

"By . Mike Dawes . World number two Henrik Stenson shared the lead with England's world number 346 Eddie Pepperell after the third round at the Nordea Masters in Malmo. Stenson shot the best round of the day, an eight-under-par 64, to move to on 13 under overall and lead the way with Pepperell, who shot a 65. The home favourite racked up seven birdies and an eagle two at the seventh alongside one bogey to put himself in pole position ahead of the final day. Breakthrough: English youngster Eddie Pepperell is joint leader heading into the final day at Malmo . Inexperience: The 23-year-old has just one tour victory to his name to date in a challenger event two years ago .

Pepperell, 23, whose only professional victory to date came on the Challenge Tour two years ago, fired eight birdies and looked set to finish the day with the outright lead, only for a bogey at the 17th to drop him back. Scotland's Stephen Gallacher and Spain's Alvaro Quiros were a shot off the pace. The former shot a 65, also picking up eight birdies and a bogey, while Quiros went round in 66.France's Victor Dubuisson and Welshman Bradley Dredge were also well-placed on 11 under and 10 under respectively. Pepperell was understandably delighted with his day. He told www.europeantour.com: 'I had great fun out there. I felt comfortable out there. 'I'm really happy with myself. The game feels pretty good. 'It was a great start with three birdies in a row. I was flying and I missed good opportunities on four and five. Then I had a sticky spell with my swing, but hung in there. I would like to have finished with a birdie on the last two holes, but I'm not too unhappy about that. 'Henrik is tied with me so it is going to be a great day tomorrow, but I've just keep to keep focused on my game and do what I've been doing. If I do that I'll have a shot come the last and I'll enjoy it. 'Henrik is one of the best players in the world, he's in fine form and it is his home country.

The Swede added: 'The crowds have been great. I haven't played in front of home crowds for a while and with the success I've had I really feel the support. I'm going to enjoy tomorrow and try to be up there tomorrow with nine to go and try to win this tournament for them. 'It would be great to do it. I've not won in Sweden before and obviously I would like to do that in my career. It seems like I'm going to have a chance tomorrow, but there is a long way to go and a lot of good players up there.

"By . Tom Latchem . You'd imagine playing a notorious Coronation Street baddie - and taking all the flak that comes with it - might put you off soap for life. But seven years after his character, domestic abuser Charlie Stubbs, was bumped off, Bill Ward is back in soapland. Bill's joined Emmerdale as respectable farmer James Barton and he's thrilled. 'When I started acting I played lots of upstanding, decent types - doctors, lawyers, soldiers - so it's great to be back in that territory. I like James because he has a strong moral compass, but his principles might slip - so he can get jealous or seek revenge. I'm enjoying that.' Bill Ward is enjoying his character's dramatic return to soapland . Bill, 47, knows all about exploring the dark side of characters after three years playing Charlie - a serial cheat who kept girlfriend Shelley Unwin a virtual prisoner. He finally met his match in Tracy Barlow, who bashed his head in with a statue in 2007. An ambassador for domestic violence charity Women's Aid - which he consulted over the role - Bill says, 'I loved playing Charlie because I got to be very rude and badly behaved. From an acting point of view Charlie was magnificent. He shocked me. Every week I'd get a script, shake my head and think, ""He can't do that!""' There've been shocks for his Emmerdale character too. James, who had a one-night stand with his late brother John's wife Moira Barton two decades ago, has discovered he's the father of her son Adam. Bill says, 'It's a nasty secret that's been bubbling away, and it'll soon explode into the open with devastating consequences for everyone.' Bill with co-star Natalie Robb who plays Moira - his late brother's widow . So how's Bill finding it back in the soap spotlight? 'The reaction I get now from fans compared to when I played Charlie is very different,' he says. 'Some people were horrified at what Charlie got up to, while others enjoyed the fact he went beyond what most normal, decent people would do. They congratulated me for making him so good to watch! 'James is more subdued, so now people say hello and chat about the show. I'm always touched when people come and talk to me, because it means your work's being watched and enjoyed. Long may it continue.' Bill commutes to the Emmerdale set near Leeds from Bristol, where he lives with his partner and two young children. 'I'm shy and like to keep myself to myself, so when I'm not acting I'm miles away from that world.' Bill, who once described himself as a 'jobbing actor', having come into the industry late following a successful career in advertising, is just happy to be in work. 'Making a living through acting is tough, and getting tougher,' he says, 'so I'm delighted whenever I get a new job because it means I'm working. As long as that continues I'll be happy.' Holidays, active or lazy? They're always active - and cold. I've  done plenty of trekking in Iceland. There isn't a lot of lying around  on beaches for me these days! Cinema or restaurant? I haven't watched a movie for ages. As my partner and I have kids, on a night out we'll have some food and chat. Music , jazz or classical? I play clarinet in a jazz band and have done for 25 years, so I listen to a lot of jazz. And 'dad rock', I guess you'd call it! Box sets, Breaking Bad or Mad Men? I love Mad Men; as a former advertising executive, I find it so accurate. The people who made it really did their research. TV, sport or drama? I watch a lot of sport: football, rugby and cricket.","Bill Ward returned to our soap screens this years after seven years away .

"By . Steve Grant, Saintsweb . Southampton and England striker Rickie . Lambert looks poised to join his boyhood club Liverpool, who released . him as a 15-year-old. We asked Steve Grant of fan website SaintsWeb whether the deal represents good business for the south coast club. Is it any wonder that many clubs appear to not actually be trying to achieve genuine success when the end result is either bankruptcy (in the case of our near neighbours Portsmouth) or a circling of vultures from the upper echelons of the league eager to stop you in your tracks and acquire the fruits of your own hard labour? At the time of writing, of course, not a single player has yet been sold, but the writing appears very much on the wall, and a whole host of talent looks likely to be leaving St Mary's this summer, along with manager Mauricio Pochettino. On the move: Southampton striker Rickie Lambert is on the brink of a £4million move to Liverpool . Brazil bound: Lambert is currently training with England ahead of the World Cup next month . While the majority of the fans are disappointed with Pochettino's departure to Spurs, we also realise that we held a broadly similar outlook when he first arrived on these shores. What I don't think any of us were expecting, though, was such a feeding frenzy on the playing squad. As a club we have always tended to drive a hard bargain when pressured into selling players, even when Rupert Lowe was chairman, and the one major sale under Nicola Cortese's reign (Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to Arsenal) was also a deal where everyone believed we'd done pretty well. All of this is in stark contrast to what appears to be a done deal to take Rickie Lambert back to where it all began at Liverpool. Lambert, along with Adam Lallana and Morgan Schneiderlin, represent the progress we have made as a club from being in the doldrums in League One, and his departure may even hurt more than a home-grown talent like Lallana leaving. He embodies all that is good about our club, and yet whoever is in charge of these decisions in the absence of a manager appears to have been played by one of the oldest negotiating tricks in the book, with the club now likely to be taken for a ride. Target: Liverpool are still in talks with Southampton for £30million-rated Adam Lallana . Gone: Mauricio Pochettino left Southampton to take charge at St Mary's this week . £4million plus add-ons (what exactly are they?) for a 32-year-old with no pace may seem like a good deal on the face of it, but he has been the figurehead of the system that has been so widely and rightly showered with praise over the course of this season, and I challenge anybody to find a player who can contribute 10 plus goals and 10 plus assists a season in the top flight for that amount of money. Liverpool have played our board like a fiddle with empty ultimatums to get the deal done before the World Cup. There isn't another player like Lambert, Liverpool aren't suddenly going to run out of money or change their transfer approach over the space of a month, and yet we've danced to their tune. Danger man: Lambert celebrates scoring against West Brom with team-mate Steven Davis . All of that wonders who is actually making the decisions. The chairman stated barely 48 hours ago that no players would be bought or sold until a new manager was appointed, and yet either he or Les Reed, the only club director with any experience in the game, fell for Liverpool's game hook, line and sinker. Somebody needs to let the fans know what's going on. It even sounds like somebody needs to let the players know what's going on as well! While it's never been plain sailing for Southampton Football Club, I don't think we've ever shot ourselves in the foot to this degree before. It's time for answers...

A new  area of up to 800 kilometres long and 70 kilometres wide is expected to be selected for the new search zone. The Chinese survey ship Zhu Kezhen, has already begun mapping the new ocean floor and is expected to continue for the next three months. The data collected by the ship, which is conducting a bathymetric survey, will determine if new search equipment can be safely towed to the area's sea floor to search for the airline which went missing on March 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew. Scroll down for video . The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is expected to continue for at least the next 12 months, with Deputy prime minister Warren Truss declaring Australia is 'committed to the search' It will also help determine water depths, enabling selection of scanning technology that will be needed for a fresh underwater search. The previous two-month-long search for the airline drew doubts from US Navy sources earlier this week when the acoustic 'pings', which were at the centre of the search, were no longer believed to be coming from the aircraft's black box. The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre confirmed that the previous search area was being abandoned on Thursday, and discounted as the resting place of the missing airline. 'The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete and in its professional judgment, the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of MH370,' the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre said. A Chinese survey ship has already begun mapping of the new ocean floor, expected to continue for the next three months . The Cinese ship Haixun 01 (pictured) and a Malaysian vessel, Bunga Mas 6,  are assisting with transporting the survey data for further processing . In an interview with the ABC on Friday however, Deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, confirmed that the search would continue despite the revelations. 'We remain as a nation committed to the search, we remain determined to do everything we possibly can to find this aircraft,' he said. 'It's our responsibility to the families of those who are involved, but also to assure the safety of the flying public into the future.' With the departure of Ocean Shield on Friday, the new search for the aircraft or any debris is anticipated to begin in August and take up to 12 months. Possible rings of location: These areas were determined by measuring the time difference between communication messages sent between MH370 and an Inmarsat satellite . The Ocean Shield departed the previous search area on Friday after it was revealed that the acoustic 'pings' whose data the search was based off, were unlikely to have been coming from the plane's black-box . A contracted survey vessel is set to join the Chinese ship which is currently surveying the area alongside another Chinese ship Haixun 01 and a Malaysian vessel Bunga Mas 6 which are assisting with transporting the survey data for further processing. Satellite, radar and and aircraft performance data also continue to be reviewed separately to determine where the plane was most likely to have hit the water. Seven of the so called 'handshake' signals sent by the plane to an Inmarsat satellite will be reanalyzed, as they are now determined to be the best indication of the planes final location points. The Inmarsat control room. The British satellite firm's data, which contains signals sent by MH370 will be reanalyzed . Australian search authorities narrowed the search for the jet after picking up a series of pings near where analysis of satellite data put the last location of the Boeing 777, some 1,600km off Australia's northwest coast . The discovery of the pings on April 5 and 8 was hailed as a significant breakthrough, leading  Australian search authorities to narrow the search for the jet to some 1,600 km off Australia's northwest coast. But according to Michael Dean, the US Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering, authorities now almost universally believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders. He believes the pings instead came from some other man-made source unrelated to the jetliner which disappeared on March 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew. Speaking to CNN, Mr Dean said: ‘Our best theory at this point is that (the pings were) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the Towed Pinger Locator.’ 850 square kilometres of the ocean floor were scoured in search of the airline, but no sign of wreckage and no debris linked to the plane has ever been picked up despite the most extensive and expensive search effort in aviation history. Authorities have not ruled out mechanical problems as a cause but say the evidence, including the loss of communications, suggests it was deliberately diverted thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.","A new search area, 800 kms long and 70 kms wide, is expected to be confirmed .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A woman who was hired to trawl online dating portals for thin, white, Jewish brunettes for a 'successful entrepreneur', has opened up about her experience. Meredith Haggerty, a New York-based writer, scored her unusual job from the man, known only as Josh, after he posted a Craigslist ad seeking an 'online dating surrogate'. She herself was required to be 'pretty, thin and educated', much like the women he was hoping to date. 'Josh's standards for a potential date were strict', writes Ms Haggerty for The Date Report, remarking that although his feedback on her picks was relatively limited, he did point out the undesirable women who 'just can’t squeeze into the slender category.' Dating surrogate: Meredith Haggerty (pictured) took on the job of finding slim, smart, 'white' women online for a mystery 'successful entrepreneur' who claimed he was too busy to hunt for himself . The true identity of Josh, who paid Ms Haggerty $100 a week for roughly seven hours of work, remains hidden. But based on her research and the man’s address, she suspects him to be a married father and the founder of a small Manhattan company. Ms Haggerty’s role was to scout Match.com for suitable women, and five times a week, to send Josh a carefully curated PDF containing the profile photos of ten women he might like to get in touch with. She created a fake profile, 'JackAndCokeUWS' to kick off her search, describing her fictional creation as a cringe-inducing 'blonde, athletic, never married, cigar aficionado', seeking 'a cook in the kitchen, bro in the bleachers, and freak in the sheets.' Josh's ad: The mystery man posted this ad (pictured) in which he is seeking a 'pretty, thin, educated female in her 20s or 30s' to manage his online dating life, paying $100 a week . To her surprise, the fake profile she created for Josh attracted women in droves: 'The first day I browsed for hours, marveling at how accomplished, pretty and serene the 30-something brunettes of New York appeared to be. 'Their careers, their international vacations, their shiny hair. I found a formidable army of women and stored them away.' 'As unsure as I was about if it was demoralizing to womankind, I was positive it was demoralizing to me' Ms Haggerty, who Josh deigned 'had a good eye', wrestled with her conscience over leading these women into the potential arms of this 'rich a**hole', as she describes him. Ultimately however, she decided that these were evidently smart women who could probably 'look after themselves.' Meredith's response: Ms Haggerty replied to Josh's Craigslist ad with this email (pictured) which scored her the job - a role she ultimately found 'demoralizing' Over time, Ms Haggerty found herself getting jaded. The mystery Josh's brash demeanor was clearly rubbing off on her, and in her emails to him, she went from referring to the women as 'nice ladies' to 'this batch.' Ms Haggerty's one clue as to the true identity of Josh was in the return address on the envelope in which he sent her a check for her work. She Googled the address and floor number and came across a small company run by three 'smiling founders'. One was apparently 'a forty-something man named Josh'. His short bio read that Josh 'valued the happiness of his wife and kids', writes Ms Haggerty, adding that she still 'couldn't be sure' that he had the right man. 'I worried about these women and this rich married man, these unequal relationships burdened by his wealth and secrets' She describes picturing the women she had linked this potentially married man with, writing: 'I saw them on their first date, their second and their third, exchanging little gifts and sharing expensive dinners. I worried about these women and this rich married man, these unequal relationships burdened by his wealth and secrets.' Ms Haggerty never discovers what became of Josh's dating endeavors, except for mentioning one woman who was 'for certain... making herself subject to Josh's fortune.' Ultimately, with her social experiment under her belt, Ms Haggerty quit, citing: 'As unsure as I was about if it was demoralizing to womankind, I was positive it was demoralizing to me.'","Writer Meredith Haggerty was hired by an anonymous 'successful entrepreneur' to be his 'dating surrogate'

"By . Lillian Radulova . Flights to and from Darwin are expected to resume on Sunday afternoon with volcanic plume and ash clouds expected to clear. Despite Indonesia's Sangeang Api volcano currently erupting  continuously, the plume is being released at a much lower level, according to a spokesperson from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in Darwin. The ash is also not reaching as high in the atmosphere as residue from the first explosive eruption. 'The higher level of ash over Australia is dissipating and won't be there much beyond this afternoon,' the spokesperson told MailOnline. Darwin Airport spokeswoman Virginia Sanders has also told the ABC that despite flights remaining grounded on Sunday morning, they are likely to resume later in the day as airlines continue to receive advice from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre. 'Today it looks as though we will have some flights come back online, some more Jetstar flights, Qantas will be meeting this morning to find out when their lunchtime flights will come online, and Air North will be operating some flights as well,' she said. Scroll down for video . The powerful explosion took place at Mount Sangeang Api in the Lesser Sunda Islands - an area that plays host to 129 active volcanoes. The Sunda Islands sit inside Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire'. Since Sangiang Api's first recorded eruption in 1512, it is believed to have erupted a total of 20 times . Qantas has also confirmed that their first flight to Darwin will be landing in the Northern Territory’s capital city at about 1pm on Sunday. The airline issued a brief release which stated: 'All Qantas and Jetstar services in and out of Darwin have resumed today following the eruption of a volcano on the southern Indonesian island of Sangeang. All operations are due to operate as scheduled'. Virgin Australia has also issued a statement saying they expect flights to resume by Sunday afternoon. 'Based on the latest advice we have received and with the forecast expected to clear in affected areas near Darwin and Denpasar, we will resume operations into and out of Darwin later this afternoon. We will also resume operations into and out of Denpasar,' a statement from the airline said. Emile Jansons, manager of the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, said plumes posed no threat to the health of people on the ground and wouldn't even be noticed by the naked eye. 'When you're as far away as Darwin is it's really not noticeable for people,' Mr Jansons said. 'There's no ash falling on the ground, there's no smell of sulphur as the ash is quite high up in the atmosphere. So visibly it looks no different to the standard dry seasons we have here which is a little bit of bushfire smoke and a bit of haze in the air.' The 20km-high ash cloud from the volcanic eruption played havoc with Australia's flight paths on Friday. Australians heading to the popular holiday location of Bali found themselves stranded when their flights were cancelled due to the island's airspace being disrupted by volcanic plume. Darwin was also cut off to all air services and thousands of people were left stranded in the city after the ash cloud blew over the Northern Territory coast line, forcing the airport to close. On Saturday night, all flights from Melbourne to Bali were cancelled, reported The Age. Planes at East Kimberley Regional Airport in West Australia were also grounded due to the plumes. Each shape on the map indicates various levels of ash cloud hanging over areas measured from the surface to flight level (SFC). The lowest ash cloud at 10,000 feet, can be seen to the west of the volcano. The highest cloud above Northern Australia at 20,000-45,000 feet, can only be seen in the first box as the cloud begins to clear . Previous graphs: The ash clouds can clearly be seen engulfing the Northern Territory in reports from Saturday . The volcano, Sangeang Api, in Indonesia's Lesser Sunda Island is currently continuously erupting since the first eruption on Friday afternoon. The first ash cloud, between 20,000 and 50,000 feet high and up to 15km wide, moved in a south-easterly direction over central Australia on Saturday night at about 100 knots before scattering quickly. A second cloud at about 45,000 feet was over Darwin and moving east at about 60 knots, while the third ash cloud, north-east of Bali, avoided Australian airspace. On Saturday morning at least 18 flights were cancelled coming in and out of the airport, The Australian reported. Domestic and international flights run by Virgin, Jetstar, Qantas, Emirates, Malaysia, SilkAir and Airnorth airlines were abandoned. A Jetstar spokesman confirmed 530 passengers were affected by the cancellations. Once moving off the coast, the ash cloud moved south towards Alice Springs and sat between 6km and 13km above the ground. The Sangeang Api volcano is about 1400km away from Darwin and is currently continuously erupting but at a much lower level than the initial eruption . Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said the issue with flying near or through the cloud was not just visibility, but the effect it had on the plane. He said silica contained in the cloud could cause extensive damage to a jet. 'The damage it can do to the aircraft can be abrasive,' Mr Gibson said. 'It can melt and stick to the engine.' The Bureau of Meteorology continues to monitor the situation. After erupting, the volcano sent a distinctive spaceship-shaped ring of pyroclastic smoke high into the air. Pilots in the area reported seeing the cloud rise 20km high, spreading over a 40km area . The volcano sits in Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire' - an area where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur in the basin of the Pacific Ocean. It has 452 volcanoes - 75 per cent of the world's total . The incredible moment Indonesia's huge volcano erupted, sending ash spewing an estimated 20 kilometres into the sky, was captured in pictures. The powerful explosion took place at Mount Sangeang Api in the Lesser Sunda Islands - an area that plays host to 129 active volcanoes - and sent a distinctive spaceship-shaped ring of pyroclastic smoke high into the air.

Flights are set to resume on Sunday at the Darwin Airport after multiple airlines cancelled flights in and out of the city after the volcano's initial eruption . The photographs were taken by professional photographer Sofyan Efendi during a commercial flight from Bali to the fishing town of Labuan Bajo . Scores of farmers who work but do not live on the Indonesian island were ordered to leave and not return until the volcano has finished erupting, said Muhammad Hendrasto, head of Indonesia's National Volcanology Agency. There are not believed to have been any deaths or injuries as a result of the eruption. Authorities have had Mount Sangiang Api on high alert for almost a year, he told China's Xinhua news agency.

"By . Lydia Warren . Startling surveillance footage has revealed the horrifying moment a school security guard punched a wheelchair-bound student before dumping him on to the ground. Francisco Martinez, who has cerebral palsy, said the attack by Marchel Mitchell at Oakland High School on May 19 has left him in pain. Mitchell, 23, has now been arrested for the attack. 'He slapped me,' Martinez, 17, told KTVU after leaving hospital. 'He hit me so hard, it threw me out of my chair. I hit the floor with my chin first.' Photos his mother took after the attack show scratches to his chin and head and bruises on his arms. Scroll down for video . Abuse: Marchell Mitchell is seen on camera lifting his arm to beat 17-year-old Francisco Martinez, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. The security guard has now been arrested . Violent: He then allegedly dumped the boy, who was handcuffed, out of his chair onto the floor . No escape: The boy was unable to move due to the handcuffs and said the security guard cursed at him . Mitchell, a substitute school resource officer who had been employed by the school following a background check last November, was trying to get students to go to class before the May incident. Martinez 'either refused to comply or was slow to do so,' Principal Matin Abdel-Qawi said in a letter to parents seen by the San Francisco Chronicle. Mitchell pushed his chair and, after Martinez objected and tried to push the guard away, Mitchell handcuffed the teenager to the chair, he said. Martinez admitted that he then spit on the guard because he saw he had no other option. 'I was handcuffed, so I didn't have no way to defend myself but my mouth,' Martinez told KTVU. Hurt: 17-year-old Martinez, pictured, said he has suffered pain since the incident two weeks ago . Treatment: He is pictured leaving hospital. He suffered a scraped chin and face and bruised arms . The footage then shows Mitchell repeatedly lifting his arm and punching the teenager as they move along the hallway before dumping him out of his chair. He can be seen standing above the student, who is laid out on the floor, as other students stop to look before walking on. Martinez said that he was also hit and thrown to the floor in the school's elevator before the incident, although this can not be seen on the camera footage. Martinez, who has been undergoing therapy so he can strengthen his legs to be able to walk, added that when he told the guard he was in pain, he swore at him. 'He tells me like that, ""I don't give a ***! I hope you don't walk for two to three weeks"",' Martinez said. Arrest: Mitchell, 23, was fired from the school and faces felony charges of corporal injury to a child . After the incident, Mitchell was fired and arrested by Oakland police. He has been charged with felony corporal injury to a child. 'I'm shocked and deeply hurt by this behavior and apologize on behalf of the staff at Oakland High,' Abdel-Qawi wrote. 'This incident is not reflective of the kind of culture we cherish at our school or how we treat one another.' Francisco said he also wants the district to take action against a second security officer seen in the video, but it is not known what action they have taken, if any. Mitchell will appear in court on June 16 for a pretrial hearing.

"By . Ray Massey . Many have suspected it for years, but now research proves it – driving with your other half sends your stress levels soaring. Motorists feel four times more stressed or anxious if their ‘significant other’ is alongside them in the car. The research released today by Allianz Insurance concludes: ‘Drivers are happier, more confident and focused when driving by themselves.’ Motorists feel four times more stressed or anxious if their ¿significant other¿ is alongside them in the car . By contrast it notes: ‘Partner Pressure’ almost quadruples a driver’s likelihood of feeling stressed or anxious behind the wheel, a potentially dangerous combination. ‘Having their ‘significant other’ in the car alongside them makes drivers feel twice as rushed which reduces the chance of them feeling calm and relaxed by nearly 65 per cent.’ Allianz Insurance says this ‘increases the risk of having an accident’. Drivers told pollsters that the addition of any passenger increases their stress levels but that having one’s wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend or ‘partner’ alongside. But it’s not equally matched between the sexes, with men appearing to wind up women more than the other way round. When driving with their partners in the car, fewer than a third (32per cent) of women feel calm and relaxed, compared to 43per cent of men. And the maternal gene clearly doesn’t help when it comes to off-spring. For  when driving with their own children in the car, only a quarter of women (25per cent) feel calm and relaxed, compared to a third of men (33per cent). Also in the top five in-car  stress-inducers are: other people’s children, your own children. Parents, and other family members. Other top five-stress inducers are other people's children and your own children . When it comes to road  locations where drivers feel most stressed, city centres  top the poll with nearly 1 in 5 (18per cent) citing it, followed by  town areas (8 per cent), motorways (8 per cent) and dual carriageways (5 per cent). Drivers feel most rushed when commuting to and from work (15per cent), driving to appointments such as visiting the doctor (15per cent) and driving children to school (11per cent). By contrast the calmest drivers can be found on Britain’s country roads, cited by more than half of those polled (52per cent). The biggest worry  for drivers on the road are  ‘other drivers’, cited by more than half of respondents (52%), followed by tailgating (45%) and aggressive ‘road rage’ drivers (41%). On motorways some 1 in 6 (16%) of women feel anxious, compared to only  1 in 12  (8%)  men – half the proportion. By contrast fewer than a third ( 29%) of women feel calm and relaxed on a motorway, compared to almost half (46%) men. Driving in town areas, some one in 6 (12%) of women feel anxious, compared to 1 in 12 (8%) of men. And while only  40% women feel calm and relaxed, that rises to almost half again (49%) of men. Women are also bigger worriers. Of respondents who have had a car accident, nearly one in ten (9%) of  women feel more worried as a consequence, compared to just one in 20 (5%) of men. The research was carried out  by Omnibus with 1,000 respondents who drive regularly. Jon Dye, CEO of Allianz Insurance said: ‘The tales of back seat drivers and in-car arguments we’re all so familiar with, cause stress and distraction when drivers should be feeling calm and focused. 'It’s important that motorists and their partners are aware of the risks a stressful environment in a vehicle can create.’","The research was released today by Allianz Insurance .

"By . Freya Noble . and Sally Lee . A teenage boy, 16, has been charged after a 14-year-old girl's birthday party was gatecrashed on Friday night. The night was meant to be a low-key pizza party but this wasn't the case when police attended the wild alcohol-fueled event of about 50 youths, leaving a 17-year-old boy fighting for his life after he was stabbed several times. It is believed that the event turned into a violent brawl after gatecrashers showed up at the Sydney home. Scroll down for video . Two teenagers have ended up in hospital as the result of a backyard brawl at a party in Sydney . One man was treated on the scene before being rushed to RPA with multiple stab wounds to his abdomen . The 16-year-old faces two charges, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray, after he was treated for a minor head injury at Concord Hospital. Last night officers were called to a house on Charles St, Five Dock following reports of a fight in the backyard shortly after 8.40pm. When police arrived, they found one boy with six or seven times stab wounds to his chest and side and he was rushed to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He remains in a critical but stable condition.

Another teenage boy, also 17, had wounds to his head after reportedly being hit in the head with a bottle and was also taken to RPA. He was discharged on Saturday. While Burwood police Inspector Michael Penfold confirmed there was 'drinking at the party' he was unable to clarify whether or not the injured or charged teens were intoxicated. He said no other substances were involved. Multiple officers in several cars responded to the call in Sydney's inner west and part of the street was sectioned off with police tape. Multiple officers responded to the emergency call made from Charles St in Five Dock . Both teenagers were taken to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital though their current condition is unknown . It is understood the 14-year-old girl, who was staying at the dual-level brick home with her grandparents, was having friends over for her birthday. Police said at least one adult was supervising the home function. Her grandmother, Christine Varricchio, wasn't at the event but said she allowed the girl to have half a dozen people over but the gathering was gatecrashed. 'She just tried to have a party with pizza and all she bought was lemon squash and strawberry sarsaparilla,'  she told Fairfax Media. Ms Varricchio said she was returning home from the Blue Mountains when she received a call from her daughter telling her the party had escalated. The grandmother said she reported the incident to police straight away and the birthday girl is now on her way to Canberra with her father. It is believed that most of the party-goers were from Concord High School. A 17-year-old girl, who co-hosted the party, told The Daily Telegraph that she had asked the gatecrasher to leave and went inside to get help from an older boy but when she returned her friends were seriously injured. 'I asked him to leave but he just pushed past me, I went to get help and found my friend lying on the ground bleeding and my other friend had a bottle broken over his head,' she said. 'No one could have prevented it. We just wanted a nice party. 'He's such a nice guy, all I can remember is people running and his mates putting pressure on him with a towel. 'I sat [next to] the boy who was stabbed down and started cleaning him up then the boy who was stabbed started throwing up. 'I think he was stabbed once in the lower chest, three times in the ribs up high an two in the upper chest near his throat.' Burwood police Inspector Michael Penfold said officers faced chaotic scenes when they arrived at the fracas. 'My understanding is a brawl has broken out and that's how these injuries have occurred,' he said. Inspector Penfold said there was at least one adult home on Friday night. Surrounding residents of the usually quiet suburban street heard bottles smashing and people screaming. Jay Nam looked out her window to see young people on the street yelling at each other. 'Some of the residents came out and tried to get them away from the street,' she said. Next door neighbour Ed White said the party-goers were about 15 or 16 years old. 'They were really young,' he said. 'There was just lights flashing, sirens and cops up and down the street.' Inspector Penfold had a warning for parents planning a party for their children. 'One of the main issues is make sure only invited guests attend and adequate security provisions beforehand,' he said. The 16-year-old was granted conditional bail and will appear at Parramatta Children's Court on June 20. Anyone with information about the incident should call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . The Ministry of Justice is investigating how receipts allegedly belonging to serial killer Rosemary West and stolen from the prison where she is serving a life sentence ended up on eBay. The jail receipts were put on the site by convicted rapist George Galloway, 50. The online auction site has said it will remove the items – which contain confidential information such as West’s alleged cell number – after being alerted by The Mail on Sunday. Galloway put the receipts from Low Newton prison, near Durham, on eBay in April with bids starting at £300. Police launched an investigation after receipts believed to be from Rose West, pictured, ended up on eBay . Fred West killed himself while on remand accused of 12 murders. His wife Rose was convicted of 10 murders in 1995 . When an undercover MoS reporter contacted him asking him to prove authenticity, he said: ‘They are genuine ’cos I work in the prison see. I work in the canteen.’ A source from the MoJ said last night: ‘We will be conducting an investigation into how the receipts were obtained.’ Last night, Cleveland Police said: ‘Following an investigation, a 50-year-old man from Middlesbrough has been arrested on suspicion of theft and is in custody. Enquiries are ongoing.’ West, Britain’s most notorious female serial killer, was convicted of ten murders in 1995 after remains of victims were found at the Gloucester home she shared with her partner Fred West. He was accused of 12 murders but committed suicide while on remand in prison.

Oops: Jacob cried out, 'WHAT?!' upon learning he got the spelling wrong by a single letter . S-a-d: The young speller appeared crestfallen as he trudged off the stage after being eliminated . But then the dreaded bell sounded, heralding Jacob's elimination. ‘WHAT?!' a shell-shocked Williamson exclaimed, his mouth agape. Appearing visibly crest-fallen, Jacob made his way off the stage, leaving behind six finalists, among them the two teens who were later crowned co-champions for the first time in 52 years. The video of Williamson's epic fail spread like wildfire online, only adding to his status as Internet’s newest star. The bespectacled coin collector and fantasy football enthusiast has won over the hearts of viewers from coast to coast with his infectious enthusiasm. Not a happy camper: At age 15, Williamson will not be eligible to compete in the spelling bee next year . Fan boy: Maple Leafs player Morgan Rielly tweeted his support for Williamson, calling him a 'hero' Each time he got a word right, Williamson squealed with delight, pumped his fists in the air and jumped up and down on stage. When he was informed by the Scripps judges Thursday afternoon that he was to be in the finals, the overjoyed 15-year-old fell to his knees. ‘My parents have always said I’m probably the least nervous person up here,’ a beaming Williamson said at the time. The Twitter-sphere quickly embraced the world's most eager speller, using the Twilight-inspired hashtag TeamJacob to support the teen.

Like any viral sensation worth his salt, Jacob quickly became a meme, with rapper Lil Jon releasing on YouTube a remix of his memorable elimination. Although Jacob appeared saddened  immediately after his loss, the 15-year-old was graceful in defat. ‘It was a lot of fun, I really enjoyed it,’ he told ESPN later. ‘I thought I knew that word but I guess I didn't.’ At the end of the day, Sriram Hathwar, of Painted Post, New York, and Ansun Sujoe, of Fort Worth, Texas, were crowned spelling bee co-champions after a riveting final-round duel in which they nearly exhausted the 25 designated championship words. After they spelled a dozen words correctly in a row, they both got the title. Earlier, 14-year-old Sriram opened the door to an upset by 13-year-old Ansun after he misspelled 'corpsbruder,' a close comrade. But Ansun was unable to take the title because he got 'antegropelos,' which means waterproof leggings, wrong.

Sriram backed up his status as the favorite by rarely looking flustered on stage, nodding confidently as he outlasted 10 other spellers to set up the one-on-one duel with Ansun. The younger boy was more nervous and demonstrative, no more so than on the word that gave him a share of the title: 'feuilleton,' the features section of a European newspaper or magazine. 'Ah, whatever!' Ansun said before beginning to spell the word as the stage lights turned red, signaling that he had 30 seconds left.

Although they hoisted a single trophy together onstage, each will get one to take home, and each gets the champion's haul of more than $33,000 in cash and prizes. Gokul Venkatachalam of Chesterfield, Missouri, finished third, and Ashwin Veeramani of North Royalton, Ohio, was fourth. Both champions are Indian-American.

"By . Andrew Young . Celebrities and the super-rich have been forced to pay £210 million through a ‘back-door mansion tax’ in the last two years, new figures have revealed. The cash has been raked in by the Government from two new levies on luxury homes worth more than £2 million. The charges apply when the properties are bought or owned by companies, rather than individuals. Tax trap: Celebrities and the super-rich have been forced to pay £210million through a 'back-door mansion tax' in the last two years, new figures have revealed. Anti-poverty campaigner Bob Geldof (pictured, left, with fiancee Jeanne Marine) and Sir Mick Jagger (right) are both thought to have been affected by the charges . Luxury: The Government charges apply when the properties are bought or owned by companies, rather than individuals. Geldof is known to have a home (pictured) in South London, owned by company Quiet Ventures Ltd . Bob Geldof, Sir Mick Jagger and Britain’s richest men the Hinduja Brothers are among those thought to have been affected by the closure of a loophole which enabled wealthy buyers to avoid stamp duty or possible inheritance tax by holding their homes in so-called ‘corporate envelopes’. An annual levy of up to £140,000 a year must now be paid on UK homes which are registered to a company, along with a special stamp duty rate of 15 per cent when a property is sold. The Treasury has reaped much more income than expected from the new fees, in a sign that the wealthy may be happy to pay extra tax on a property in return for privacy or other benefits that come from property ownership through a company. Figures show that the Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (ATED) brought in an extra £140 million to the Government’s coffers in 2013-14, seven times the Treasury’s own forecast. London pad: Meanwhile, Rolling Stones singer Sir Mick has a house (pictured) in Chelsea owned by a British Virgin Islands-registered company called Cazatine Ltd. This is apparently for 'privacy and security reasons' The higher stamp duty rate brought in an additional £70 million in its first year (2012-13). Although HMRC does not comment on individuals’ tax affairs, anti-poverty campaigner Geldof is known to have a home in South London, owned by a company called Quiet Ventures Ltd, and a house in Faversham, Kent, owned by Bandol Holdings Ltd. Both firms are reportedly registered in the British Virgin Islands. Sources close to the Irish singer have previously described the arrangements as ‘perfectly legitimate’ tax planning. Rolling Stones singer Sir Mick has a house in Chelsea owned by a British Virgin Islands-registered company called Cazatine Ltd. Friends say the property is only owned by a nominee company for privacy and security reasons, and not to save tax. It is believed that the Hinduja Brothers must also pay the levy because their property in  Mayfair, Central London, belongs to an offshore firm. Most of the owners of the luxury London homes at One Hyde Park, Britain’s most expensive property development, are owned by offshore companies – as are the £35 million-plus homes in exclusive Cornwall Terrace, overlooking Regent’s Park. Action: George Osborne announced the new taxes in 2012 after saying he wanted to come down 'like a ton of bricks' on stamp duty avoidance schemes . Chancellor George Osborne announced the new taxes in 2012 after saying he wanted to come down ‘like a ton of bricks’ on stamp duty avoidance schemes. The charges are only imposed on homes which are occupied by the beneficiaries of companies. Homes owned by property firms and rented out to tenants are exempt. The lowest ATED charge in 2013-14 was £15,000 for homes worth £2 million to £5 million, but the highest rate was £140,000 for homes worth more than £20  million. The stamp duty rate of 15 per cent was imposed in March 2012 on company purchases of homes worth more than £2 million, compared to seven per cent for individuals buying homes in the same price bracket. The threshold for the tax was reduced to £500,000 in March this year. Previously, such homes would have been virtually exempt from stamp duty if an individual buying the property simply bought the ownership of the company, paying a rate of just 0.5 per cent. Foreigners also had the incentive of registering their homes in the name of offshore companies to avoid paying UK inheritance tax rates of 40 per cent when they died. The windfall for the taxman is set to be boosted further by a third levy imposing a capital gains tax (CGT) rate of 28 per cent on any profits made on  the sale of ‘corporate envelope’ homes worth more than £2 million. The Government has increased ATED tax rates in the current year to £15,400 for homes worth £2 million to £5 million and £143,750 for the top-bracket homes worth more than £20 million. UK's richest men: Srichand (left) and Gopichand Hinduja are also thought to have been affected by the taxes . It also plans to create lower thresholds . over the next two years, with a new ATED rate of £7,000 for . company-owned homes worth £1-2 million from April next year and a £3,500 . rate for homes worth £500,000 to £1 million in April 2016. Paul Emery, a real estate tax partner for accountants PWC, likened the three new tax levies to a ‘back-door’ version of the annual one per cent mansion tax, proposed by Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems for all properties worth more than £2 million. He added: ‘Constant tinkering with the tax rules is a source of concern for foreign investors who want to see stability.’ An HMRC spokesman said: ‘ATED has raised significantly more revenue than originally forecast. ‘However, given this is the first year of returns, the increase could be attributed to a number  of factors and it is too early to draw definitive conclusions.’ He added: ‘We will  continue to monitor receipts closely.’","Celebrities and super-rich forced to pay £210million in the last two years .

"By . Julian Robinson . Malaysian Muslims have called for a holy war against the confectionery giant Cadbury – after pork DNA was found in some of its products. A group of more than 20 Malay-Muslim organisations say they want to declare jihad against the chocolate maker after two batches of chocolate products were recalled. The company has said that it was informed that samples of its Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut and Cadbury Dairy Milk Roast Almond had ‘tested positive for traces of porcine DNA’. Two batches of Cadbury's chocolate were recalled in Malaysia after traces of porcine DNA were found (file picture) According to Malaymailonline, a news conference was held in Kuala Lumpur where the groups claimed Cadbury had ‘crossed the line’ and that quick action was now needed. The website quotes one of the group presidents, Ustaz Masridzi Sat, as blaming social ills in Malaysia on Muslims eating food that was not halal. He told the news conference: ‘Because the person eats pork it is difficult to guide him to the right path. ‘When the day of judgment comes, that person will be wearing a pig-face because of what he has eaten. ‘We need to unite, we must declare jihad.’ Cadbury said it had been informed of porcine traces in some of its products following tests carried out by the Health Ministry in Malaysia (file picture) One group chief, Abu Bakar Yahya, claimed the pork traces were part of a wider attempt to ‘weaken’ the faith. Another . called for a nationwide boycott on the Cadbury’s products saying its . factories should be ‘shut down immediately’, Malaymailonline reports. The organisations involved included the Muslim Consumers Association of Malaysia (PPIM), Perkasa, Pertubuhan Kebajikan Darul Islah Malaysia, Ikatan Muslimin Malaysia and the Halal Muslim Entrepreneurs’ Association. One woman, described as 'hysterical', asked the conference whether Cadbury would now 'wash away the tainted blood in our veins'. The company started in 1824 when John Cadbury opened a grocer's shop at 93 Bull Street in Birmingham selling cocoa and drinking chocolate. By the 1830s the firm was operating on a commercial scale. Cadbury went from one small shop in Birmingham to becoming the second largest confectionery brand in the world after Wrigley's (file picture) Forty years later complete control of the company was handed over to Richard and George Cadbury and by 1875 the first milk chocolate bar was produced followed by the first Easter egg. A new factory was constructed in Bournville in 1879 and by the turn of the century Cadbury Milk Chocolate was launched. The firm adopted its iconic purple and gold wrapping and 'glass and a half' symbol for Dairy Milk in the 1920s. Decades later and following post-war growth, Cadbury merged with Schweppes prompting further expansion. The brand became so popular that by 1990 a designated visitor attraction, Cadbury World, had opened. Ten years ago the joint company bought gum manufacturor Adams to become a world leader in its sector. After Cadbury and Schweppes went their separate ways in 2008, Cadbury became a part of Mondelez International. In 2011 it had revenue of £11,346,002,000. Today it is the second largest confectionery brand in the world after Wrigley's. It has its headquarters in Uxbridge, London, and operates in more than fifty countries worldwide. PPIM president, Datuk Nadzim, said talks were already underway with Malay NGOs over the possibility of taking legal action adding that he wanted Cadbury products to 'go to waste'. The representatives also threatened to lodge a police report against the firm in the near future. The Malaysian Islamic Development Department is already said to have suspended the halal certification of the two Cadbury products involved in the controversy. Cadbury Malaysia said it had been informed of the porcine traces following tests carried out by the Health Ministry. The firm says it has all of its products certified halal to fall in line with Islam's dietary restrictions and that a review of the supply chain is being carried out. Cadbury UK has pointed out that the porcine DNA issue was entirely confined to Malaysia.","Muslim groups in Malaysia call for holy war against chocolate maker .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . The historic Oxford Union debating society is in 'disarray' after another committee member resigned in the wake of its president being arrested over rape allegations. Ben Sullivan, 21, was taken in by Thames Valley police earlier this month over accusations from two female undergraduates. Sullivan, a history and politics student, has face repeated calls to resign from the society, which is seen as a training-ground for politicians and has been led by Boris Johnson and William Hague. Arrested: Ben Sullivan was taken into custody by police earlier this month after being accused of rape by two undergraduates . A number of high-profile speakers have pulled out of engagements at the Union due to concerns over Sullivan, who denies the charges against him. Several officials have also deserted the society due to the scandal - the latest of whom is standing committee member Anna Bazley, 19. Miss Bazley, a history and politics student at St Peter's College, cited 'an irreconcilable conflict in personal loyalties and priorities' in her resignation letter. She the fourth committee member to quit the Union in just under a month. Treasurer Charles Malton stepped down four days after Mr Sullivan's arrest, saying: 'The way in which many within the Union have handled this situation over the past few weeks is not behaviour that I would wish to associate myself with'. Before Sullivan's arrest, the Union's librarian, Kostas Chryssanthopoulos, stood down citing 'repeated and constant attacks, which have been personal from the start', as did another one of its committee members, Katherine Connolly, who said the environment was 'untenable'. The society was already facing criticism for authorising Sullivan to use members' money to gag student newspaper The Tab from reporting his past association with an elitist drinking society. Sullivan, who has not been charged with any offence, maintains he should stay on as president. He is due to answer police bail on June 18. Abandoning ship: Treasurer Charles Malton (left) earlier resigned as Oxford Union . treasurer over the way the union handled the arrest for alleged rape of Sullivan (right) Prior . to the arrest, Mr Malton voted for the Union to pay £1,200 in legal . fees for Sullivan to take action against a student news website. His arrest has cost the society visits from significant speakers, including Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble, who was scheduled to address the chamber yesterday evening but later cancelled. In a statement he said: 'my advice to Ben Sullivan would be either to resign or take a leave of absence until the criminal investigation has been completed'. Other speakers to pull out include David Mepham, UK Director of Human Rights Watch and Julie Meyer, the American entrepreneur and judge on the BBC’s Dragon’s Den. Sullivan said in an interview this week: 'I have every faith in the criminal justice system and I am confident that the truth will come to light'. He had been due to face a vote of no confidence on Thursday, but members decided to abandon the exercise. Historic: The Oxford Union is famous for its high-profile speaker events. Sullivan is pictured presiding at one such event . Meanwhile, disgruntled students have taken to hosting disenchanted union speakers in alternative venues across the university, challenging the historic institution. A number of students, led by Barnaby Raine, 19, arranged for Wadham College to host a debate with speakers originally scheduled to attend the Union. The speakers included Norman Finkelstein, the leading scholar on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Palestinian journalist Mouin Rabbani. Mr Raine, a history and politics undergraduate at Wadham, said: 'Ben Sullivan has to go. The Oxford Union is in disarray - speakers are pulling and so many officials are resigning that events are having to be cancelled. 'The president has said himself that the organisation is falling apart. It's now extreme stubbornness in the face of reality for the president to refuse to resign'. Following Miss Bazley's resignation, Mr Sullivan released a statement which said: 'We are very sad to hear of Anna's resignation. 'She made a great contribution to the Society while on Standing Committee and helped to organise an excellent debate earlier this term. We wish her all the best for the future'. The Oxford Union was approached for further comment but did not respond.

"By . Richard Ingrams . , FOUNDER OF PRIVATE EYE AND THE OLDIE . Disciplinary - at 76: Private Eye founder Richard Ingrams was summoned to the boss's office . Three days ago I announced my resignation as editor of The Oldie, a magazine I had edited since its launch way back in 1992. I had many happy years working with some brilliant people but  in the end I was unable to cope  with the demands of the modern management man, personified  by the magazine’s publisher, one James Pembroke. Let me be fair to the man – Pembroke has done wonders for the magazine, which now boasts a circulation of 45,000. But alarm bells started to ring some time ago when he began to hanker after ‘brainstorming’ sessions and covered the office walls with charts showing blue and yellow days for different members of staff. Things came to a head more recently when I started questioning his application for Arts Council funds to subsidise one of his pet projects, the Soho Literary Festival. There was a noisy board meeting at which I was told to watch my step. A few days later James summoned me to a meeting to discuss the decline in The Oldie’s sales figures on the newsstand and their relationship to the magazine’s covers. I replied that I could see no point in a meeting as the issue had already been gone over at an editorial meeting attended by all the staff. To my amazement I then received a three-page letter from James summoning me to a ‘disciplinary hearing’ and warning me: ‘If you are found guilty of misconduct I may decide to issue you with a written warning or a final written warning.’ (What was the difference?) Misconduct apparently consisted of my failure to attend meetings (the main purpose of most enterprises today). As for my claim that the covers issue had already been raised, James said that he had cut the  discussion short ‘to save the staff further distress’. The letter seemed to have been written in accordance with some manual of modern management. But the trouble with doing this sort of thing by the book, ie not in accordance with the dictates of common sense, is that the rules can turn out to be nasty potholes for the unwary. Thus James, following, I presume, the official guidelines for disciplinary hearings, informed me: ‘If you want to call any relevant witnesses to the hearing please let me have their names as soon as possible and no later than Thursday.’ Publisher: Oldie boss James Pembroke personified the modern management man, says Richard Ingrams . A fatal move from matey’s point of view. For it opened the possibility to call all of my staff who had attended that editorial meeting at which they had been caused ‘distress’, according to his version of events. Now it was open to me, again according to the rules, to cross-examine them as to the truth of this assertion. But this was the very last thing that James wanted. He had been hoping that the staff of The Oldie, working in a small open-plan office in Fitzrovia, Central London, would remain in ignorance of the fact that their editor was being summoned to a disciplinary meeting to answer charges of misconduct – a matter that could seriously affect their future employment. When I told him who my witnesses were . going to be, he was appalled. This was quite unacceptable and would have . only one consequence. It would cause them all yet further distress. How . could I be so heartless? Success: The magazine has a circulation of 45,000 . Yet the only person being caused distress was poor James himself. But it was all his fault for following the regulations laid down for disciplinary hearings. Apart from witnesses I was informed that I was entitled to bring a trade union representative to the meeting. Yet my tormentor was presumably well aware that there was no trade union, no National Union of Oldie Operatives, no shop stewards. Once again he was simply going by the book and making himself look ridiculous in the process. The final absurdity was the following information: ‘If you have any specific needs at the hearing as a result of a disability, please contact me as soon as possible.’ Wasn’t it tempting to play on my extreme old age and invent an only recently diagnosed affliction of Tourette’s, or chronic deafness, which would require my interrogators to supply me with an ear  trumpet? Perhaps a more salient disability from the point of view of the one-man tribunal – his fellow directors were unavailable that day – was a debilitating sense of humour that caused me to break into unquenchable laughter when confronted by such a futile rigmarole. In the end the thought of it was too much for me. At my age the lure of disciplinary hearings, never high on my list of life’s pleasures, is not what it was. I decided to walk and almost immediately felt a great sense of relief. I was walking away not just from James Pembroke but from an absurd management world in which people are tying themselves up  in knots in order to conform to  the rulebook. And the alarming thing about all this is that James is no computer-controlled robot. Ex-Harrow and Cambridge (even a member of the Garrick Club), he is a privileged member of the educated elite, the sort of person who in days gone by the nation looked to for leadership and guidance. What hope is there for Britain if the privileged Pembrokes of  this world feel they have to conform to ludicrous procedures, which make them look like idiots and drive the likes of me to retreat to the  country in the hope of a few final years of peace and quiet with our loved ones?","Legendary founder of Private Eye (b. 1937) gives his side of the story .

The performance lasted three and a half minutes and came from his sold out gig at the London venue. Sam Smith performed at Camden Roundhouse last night, which formed part of the UK's first ever live TV ad . 'It's incredible to be part of a UK first,' Sam said of the live performance. 'Stay With . Me being broadcast live to the nation will be a very special moment for . me. 'I’m . beyond words with happiness right now. My first ever album is finally . here. Thank you to all my incredible fans who have helped me get here. Please listen and love, ‘In The Lonely Hour’,' Sam declared on his web . blog. Google UK's Azi Eftekhari said 'We're so delighted Google Play Music, Sam and his millions of fans could be a part of music and TV history. Google Play's all about connecting music lovers with the tracks and artists they love.' The ad was broadcast on Channel 4 during an ad break of Alan Carr's Chatty Man programme . The idea is thought to have originated from a close collaboration between Channel 4, Google Play, MediaCom, Universal Music label Capitol, BBH and Essence. Sam's album, The Lonely Hour has only just been released already music bosses want him to be looking ahead at writing material for the follow-up. The source said: 'Sam's such a great talent the people around him don't want him to get caught up in that hard partying scene, which is why they've been insistent that he gets back to the studio to carry on working on his music. 'Plus, it has the added bonus of keeping him away from any bad influences that may distract him.' The gig at the London venue was a sell-out but broadcast to millions during a live ad break . Despite his new found fame and busy social life, Sam, who celebrated his birthday last week, previously claimed his record is about being a lonely 21 year old, and thanked fans for changing his life over the past few years. He said: 'I truly hope you love this album. I hope it is the soundtrack to all of those lonely moments. It helped me through mine'. Sam also announced on Tuesday that he will be playing a concert at London's prestigious Hammersmith Apollo in November.","The advert was the first live ad to be broadcast on British TV .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A grandmother living in sheltered housing and who was meant to be checked on every day lay dead for three days before being discovered, it is claimed. Sylvia Jay, 76, was only found dead after concerns were raised for her well being by a friend who hadn't seen her for several days. She was found on her bed in her flat in Beane River View in Hertford, and now accommodation manager Sanctuary Housing are investigating the incident. Sylvia Jay, who it is claimed lay dead in her sheltered accommodation flat for three days before she was discovered . Mrs Jay's daughter, Linda Jay says Sanctuary Housing should have been sending a warden to visit her mother, who lived on her own, every day. The 52-year-old said: ' We are in shock at the moment but we are not leaving it. 'We put my mum in warden-controlled housing so she would get a knock on her door at 9.30am every day. 'She's not been getting that knock and that knock could have saved her life.' The last time Mrs Jay was known to have been seen was on Tuesday last week, three days before she was found. Miss Jay said her mother had been to the doctor a few days before that for a check-up, but the tests had come back normal and there did not appear to be anything wrong with her. The grandmother was only discovered when a friend who hadn't seen her for a few days raised the alarm . The Beane River View sheltered housing complex in Hertford, where Mrs Jay lived . She added: 'Warden-controlled housing should be a safety net for the people who are living alone. They have the responsibility to make sure these people get that knock on the door. 'Most of the people there live alone. They can fall or slip coming out the bath. 'They need that knock on the door.' The grandmother was found by neighbour Jayne Praide, who was worried after not seeing her for some days. Mrs Praide said that she could only access the property when another resident came by who happened to know where the keys to all the flats were. Miss Jay explained: 'Somebody's got to take responsibility for my mum's death. 'Where was that 9.30am call? Sanctuary Housing say they are looking into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs Jay, who was described as vibrant and an active member of the community . 'What I will never know is if they had done that 9.30am call, there may have been a chance that they could have found my mum, taken her to hospital and saved her.' It is understood that some time ago Sanctuary sent out a letter to residents asking them if they wanted to be visited by a warden everyday, with people being given the chance to opt out. Until Mrs Jay died, Miss Jay had not heard of this letter and it is unknown whether her mother signed it. But the daughter said Sanctuary should have contacted her as next of kin, as her mother was not capable of making that decision. She said: 'If they had told me she wasn't going to get the knock, I would have said she does need it. I can't be there everyday at 9.30am. 'I can ring, but she doesn't always pick up the phone.' Sanctuary National services manager Claire Irwin said: ""Our sympathies go to Mrs Jay's family and friends and we will extend them every support and assistance at this very difficult time. 'We are looking into the circumstances and will keep the family fully informed. Mrs Jay was a vibrant and active member of our community and will be greatly missed.'","Sylvia Jay was found dead after a friend hadn't seen her for several days .

"By . Dan Bloom . Hiding cash in a brown envelope was once the preserve of spies, but a lot has changed in the age of Twitter. A mystery businessman has sparked a frenzied treasure hunt by stashing £50 wads in cities across Britain - and revealing their locations on the social networking site. In less than a week, the 25-year-old's 'anonymous social experiment' has gained more than 40,000 followers, many of whom are eagerly awaiting the next drop. Scroll down for video . Jackpot! A mystery benefactor is hiding envelopes filled with £50 each across Britain in a mass treasure hunt . Winner: Twitter user @Leviaxxan, who found the money with a friend in Sheffield, shared the haul between The Donkey Sanctuary in Devon and the Sheffield Rape Crisis counselling service for women . The mystery benefactor told the Daily Telegraph he may make a special delivery tomorrow to London - but with the package containing up to £200, the hunt could turn into a frenzied scramble. 'I have had a few businesses in e-commerce that have done really well for me,' he said. 'It got to a point where there is only so much stuff that money can buy... I get more of a kick out of that than I would spending £50 on myself. 'I have to travel abroad but I’ve called on a group of people to keep it going for me. It will be a little more infrequent but I don’t have any plans to stop. 'There isn’t a limit on how much I’m going to give away. As long as there’s interest in it, I’ll keep doing it.' He added that he was confident George Groves would win tonight's boxing match against Carl Froch, but would hide £200 in the capital if he lost. And he told MailOnline he hopes his project will become a long-running fixture. Brilliant! The latest envelope was found in Brighton today by science teacher Sophie Morris (left), and Linisha Kapur (right) found the stash in Manchester. The donor said he had run out of things to spend his money on . The craze began in the U.S. and . sparked frenzied scenes in Los Angeles on Thursday night as hundreds of . people scoured garden beds and bus stops and caused traffic chaos.

The Sheffield haul was shared between The Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon, and the Sheffield Rape Crisis counselling service. The U.S. founder of the craze, who has amassed some 400,000 Twitter followers, had to issue a safety notice amid fears the scramble was getting out of hand. 'Please walk and drive safely. A young woman ran right in front of my car a few days ago. I will do my best to pick locations that are safe, but please use common sense and caution,' the donor wrote. Inundated: Hundreds of people swarmed the area around the Empire Center in Burbank, Los Angeles on Thursday night in search of hidden money, after a mystery benefactor dropped some location clues on Twitter . 'Please also be respectful to the locations themselves and surrounding businesses. And be kind and happy with each other, as that's what this is all about.' But the unknown donor also tweeted that he or she 'had no plans to stop' and wanted to 'keep getting bigger and better'. The donor added: 'The bigger idea is just to give back, both financially and a sense of fun to the community that has made me wealthy.'","Viral 'social experiment' began in U.S. and has spread around the world .

"By . Margot Peppers . If you've ever compared store-bought eggs in the U.S. with those in the UK, you'll have noticed a few very significant differences in taste, color and quality. This is due to the differing ways the eggs are farmed, stored and treated in the two countries - techniques so contrasting that eggs from the UK would actually be considered illegal if they were sold in America, and vice versa. UK eggs, for instance - which typically have more orange yolks than their American counterparts - are stored at room temperature, while those in the U.S. are required by law to be stored at lower than 45 degrees Fahrenheit in order to prevent the risk of Salmonella spreading. Eggs in different baskets: The differing ways eggs are farmed and stored in the UK vs. the U.S. mean that UK eggs would be considered illegal if they were sold in America, and vice versa . British grocery stores and households do not refrigerate their eggs because 90per cent of store-bought eggs in the UK come from hens that have been vaccinated for salmonella. This practice of farmers vaccinating their hens came about after an outbreak in the Nineties; since then, salmonella in the UK has been virtually wiped out. What's more, British food regulators cite the fact that refrigerating eggs before a consumer buys them leads to a temperature change during transportation that can cause moisture to collect, making the eggs more vulnerable to harmful bacteria. Not only are eggs stored in different ways in the two countries, but they're also handled differently before they're shipped to stores. In America, the USDA requires that farmers clean eggs in water that is at least 90 degrees Fahrenheit, in order get rid of potentially harmful fecal matter. The eggs are then sprayed with a chemical sanitizer before being dried completely, so that there is no moisture left on them which might increase the risk of bacteria forming. Due to the cleaning process, eggs in America lose their natural thin outer layer, called the cuticle, which naturally protects them from contamination. But for the UK, the painstaking process of cleaning eggs so thoroughly is seen as more trouble than it's worth. 'In Europe, it's in the farmers' best interests to produce to clean eggs, as no one is going to buy them if they're dirty' In fact, laws in the UK and the EU egg stipulate that Class A eggs - the ones sold on supermarket shelves - must not be washed or cleaned in any way. The reasoning is that a botched washing job, which can lead to excess moisture and therefore harmful bacteria development, is worse than not cleaning the eggs at all. What's more, since UK eggs aren't cleaned they have their cuticles intact, further protecting them from contamination. Mark Williams, chief executive of the British Egg Industry Council, explained to Forbes in 2012: 'In Europe, the understanding is that this mandate actually encourages good husbandry on farms. 'It's in the farmers' best interests then to produce to cleanest eggs possible, as no one is going to buy their eggs if they're dirty.' While it's unclear exactly why, anyone who has tasted both knows that these differences lead to English eggs usually tasting richer than American ones.","Eggs in the UK would be illegal in the U.S. because they are not cleaned, and American eggs don't comply with UK laws because they are cleaned .
American eggs are kept refrigerated for safety reasons, whereas UK eggs are stored at room temperature ."
"By . Chris Pleasance . Matthew Campbell, 27, has walked free from court despite running over and killing Dr Nicholas Musgrove outside Wolverhampton University . A driver who was distracted by a mass of air fresheners and soft toys hanging from his rear-view mirror when he killed a university lecturer has walked free from court. Matthew Campbell, 27, ran down and killed Dr Nicholas Musgrove as he walked to work at Wolverhampton University on December 20, 2012. Witnesses said the scientist was struck so hard he was sent hurtling through the air 'like a rag doll'. The 64-year-old was rushed to hospital but later died from his injuries following the crash, which happened at 6.15am. A court heard Campbell had eight air fresheners, a pair of 3D glasses, a soft Rhino toy and a key-ring hanging in front of his windscreen which had impaired his view. The black Mazda 2 also had illegally tinted windows which was said to have also contributed to his failure to react in enough time. Campbell, a fork lift truck driver, denied causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving at Wolverhampton Crown Court. But a jury of eight men and four women found him guilty following a three day trial on April 24. Yesterday he appeared at the same court where he was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years. Campbell, from Whitmore Reans, Wolverhampton, was also placed on supervision for 12 months and banned from driving for two years. Sentencing Judge Nicholas Webb said the lapse in concentration by Campbell was only for a matter of seconds but 'tragically it resulted in a fatality.' He said: 'It was unfortunate Dr Musgrove started to cross the road but he was in the road for long enough for you to have taken avoiding action.' The judge added that but for the short lapse of concentration by Campbell there could be no other criticism of his driving. Defending Phillip Morris said Campbell was 'full of remorse' and added: 'He is truly very sorrowful for the outcome of this accident. During the trail, the jury heard that Campbell was distracted by eight air fresheners, a pair of 3D glasses, and a rhino head cuddly toy hanging from his rear-view mirror (pictured) 'There was a period of just three and a half seconds between Dr Musgrove stepping off the kerb and being hit by his vehicle.' After the case West Midlands Police . released a shocking image of the bundle of key rings showing Campbell’s . smashed windscreen in the aftermath of the crash as a warning to other . drivers. Speaking after the . case Martin Lindop, Sector Crown Prosecutor from West Midlands Crown . Prosecution Service, said: 'This prosecution should be a warning to all . drivers that they have a duty of care to other road users at all times. 'It . would also appear that Mr Campbell may have restricted his view by . having illegally tinted windows and items hanging from the rear-view . mirror, which may have contributed to this tragic collision. 'The defendant failed to see Dr Musgrove crossing the road. When he eventually spotted him, he tried to carry out an evasive manoeuvre, but it was too little too late and his car struck the victim.' His trial heard how Dr Musgrove, from Walsall, West Mids., had crossed the road without activating the pedestrian lights or waiting for the traffic signals to turn to red. He crossed the road - one of the busiest in the city - at the same time as Campbell was approaching the junction who failed to take evasive action. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that Campbell had lost concentration for just a few seconds because of the air fresheners, but that those few seconds resulted in a man being killed . Prosecutor Nicholas Tatlow told the court the bundle of objects from his mirror caused a partial obstruction. Campbell said a Rhino head had been a gift from his cousin and when it fell off his key ring he put it on his driving mirror. He said the glasses were 3D ones he had got from a cinema adding: 'I had my car cleaned by my friend every week and he would put an air freshener in there each time.' Staff at the University of Wolverhampton paid tribute to Dr Musgrove - a former scrap man who went on to complete a BSc and a PhD at the university. Dr Derek Walton, associate dean of the school of applied sciences said: 'He genuinely was a terrific bloke, who will be sorely missed by all his colleagues across the university and the many students he helped.' Vice chancellor Professor Geoff Layer added: 'Nick was well known, well liked and passionate about what he did.'","Matthew Campbell handed a six month suspended sentence for the crash .

However, it has come during six months of above-average temperatures. Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: 'The figures show that warm weather doesn’t always mean sunny weather. 'The significant factor this year which has made this spring warmer is that we haven't had many cold nights. 'We have had a lot of cloudy weather - cloudy days but particularly cloudy nights - which acts as a blanket and keeps the warmth in. 'In previous years, it has been clearer and therefore colder.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Anyone with kids tends to get a bit angry when a motorist is speeding through their neighborhood, and in some cases will take matters into their own hands in efforts to get the motorist to slow down. However, in most cases the speedster isn't driving a car that costs nearly a half-a-million dollars - and the method used to get the driver to slow down isn't to pelt the speeding vehicle with a rock. That, however, is exactly what happened to the driver of a Lamborghini Aventador in Playa Vista, California, who was driving a bit too fast for a bystander in what apparently is a residential area. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Slow down: The pedestrian warns the driver of the $400,000 sports car to slow down before he pelted the vehicle with a rock . Speed demon: The driver was revving the car's 6.5-cylinder engine while zipping through a residential area . In a Youtube video that achieved viral status this week, the driver of the Lamborghini - which starts in price at about $400,000 - is revving the car's 6.5-liter engine as the sports car zips through a suburban street. Enter what appears to be an older pedestrian, who apparently was not as impressed with the Lambo's 700 horsepower as the driver of the car. 'Keep racing,' the man taunts the driver as the vehicle came to a stop where the pedestrian was standing. 'Keep doing it.' When the Lamborghini tries to speed past him, the angry pedestrian hurls a rock at the side of the car, which appears to have done some significant damage based on the cracking 'thump' heard on the video. Mystery: Neither the driver of the Lamborghini or the rock-hurling pedestrian have been identified, even as the video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times . Getaway: After throwing the rock at the Lamborghini, the driver took off as the angry pedestrian chased after him . The identity of the driver and the pedestrian is unknown - and attempts to get in touch with the man who posted the video to Youtube were unsuccessful. Finding the driver of the vehicle might be a little easier than tracking down the man who threw the rock - since Lamborghini started making the Aventador in 2011, only about 2,500 of these 'supercars' have been produced. For the driver's sake, hopefully the vehicle's exterior isn't as expensive to fix as the car's price tag might suggest.","The Lamborghini Aventador starts in price at about $400,000, but can cost upwards of $600,000 .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson was backed by Muslim leaders after making a grovelling private apology over controversial remarks about Islam. The DUP leader publicly backed a fundamentalist preacher who attacked Islam as a 'doctrine spawned in hell' and said he did not trust them. Mr Robinson said he would not trust Muslims to give him religious advice - but insisted he would be okay with them 'going down the shops' for him. Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson sparked fury after backing a pastor who said he did not trust Muslims in Britain . He said: 'I wouldn't trust Muslims who are following Sharia Law to the letter and neither would he. 'However, as I have said in many of the normal daily activities of life, I would have no difficulty in trusting Muslims to go down to the shop for me.' The remarks sparked fury in Northern Ireland - but Mr Robinson insisted his words had been 'misinterpreted' and said he would never wish to insult or upset Muslims. Despite refusing to apologise in public, Muslim leaders in Northern Ireland said Mr Robinson did say sorry to them in private. A spokesman for the Belfast Islamic Centre, Dr Raied Al-Wazzan said: 'We accepted the apology in private and for us that was a sincere apology and we accepted it.' A further statement issued by the DUP after the meeting said Mr Robinson was willing to apologise to anyone who had been hurt or distressed by his comments. A party spokesman said the meeting had been 'valuable, friendly and relaxed'. 'Mr Robinson outlined his views and made it clear that there was never any intention on his part to offend or cause distress to anyone. 'He said that if anyone interpreted his remarks in that way that he would apologise to them and that he would welcome the opportunity to continue conversations at the Belfast Islamic Centre. 'The First Minister recalled his previous help and support for the Islamic community and indicated that his support was ongoing. 'Mr Robinson reiterated the important role that the Islamic community has played in Northern Ireland, particularly in businesses, education and medicine.' Pastor James McConnell sparked fury after claiming Islam was 'spawned in hell'. But his right to criticise religion was defended by the First Minister Peter Robinson . Dr Al-Wazzan described the meeting as 'thoughtful, very honest and open'. 'We have told him what we felt,' he said. Mr Robinson sparked a storm of criticism after publicly backing anti-Islamic evangelical preacher Pastor James McConnell. Mr McConnell, who is a fundamentalist Protestant preacher at the Whitewell Metropolitan Tabernacle Church in north Belfast, branded Islam a heathen doctrine during a fiery address to his congregation. 'People say there are good Muslims in Britain - that may be so - but I don’t trust them,' said the pastor. 'Islam is heathen, Islam is satanic, Islam is a doctrine spawned in hell.' Police are currently investigating the contentious sermon made by Mr McConnell to see if its contents constituted a hate crime. Mr Robinson’s subsequent comments in a newspaper interview that he himself would not trust Muslims for spiritual guidance but would trust them to 'go down the shops' sparked fury. The DUP leader, who has attended Pastor McConnell’s church in the past, told the Irish News that claiming not to trust one section of society was not a hate crime, adding: 'If it is then I’m going straight away to the police to ask them to take action against all those who say they don’t trust politicians.' The controversy erupted at a time when race hate attacks in Northern Ireland are on the increase. Under mounting pressure over the issue, Mr Robinson went on the front foot, first issuing his statement of clarification and then embarking on a round of media interviews. The statement said his original remarks had been 'misinterpreted and given a meaning that was never intended'. He again defended Pastor McConnell’s right to free speech, but stressed: 'I would never seek to cause any insult to any section of our community. 'For the avoidance of any doubt, I make it clear that I welcome the contribution made by all communities in Northern Ireland and, in the particular circumstances, the Muslim community.' He added: 'No part of me would want to insult or cause distress to local Muslims.' Later, the First Minister claimed that comments in the original newspaper interview that he would not trust Muslims who followed Sharia law to the letter, alluding to violent punishments, or those involved in terrorism would be supported by the majority of people in the Western world. He said: 'On all the everyday aspects of life (I would trust them), I specifically also mentioned that if I was going in for an operation and the surgeon was Muslim, would I trust him - of course I would. 'The actual comment about going to the shops was very much on the basis of saying that it was absurd that you wouldn’t trust people to do anything.' He added: 'I defend people’s right, whether they are from the Protestant faith, the Catholic faith or Muslim faith, to be able to comment and, if they feel it necessary, to criticise other doctrines. 'It would be a lack of freedoms if we were not allowing people to do so.'","Preacher James McConnell said  Islam was 'spawned in hell'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Hundreds of mourners - some from as far afield as Australia - paid their respects to a Second World War veteran today, answering a plea after he died with no family. George Thompson was a pilot in the Second World War, and flew night missions over the Burmese jungle in the fight against Japanese forces. He died aged 96 earlier this months with no living relatives and few friends remaining. But a plea from the RAF for people to attend the ceremony at Hutcliffe Wood Crematorium in Sheffield received an overhwleming response. Packed: Around 300 mourners turned up to pay their respects to George Thompson, who died aged 96 earlier this month . Full: So many attended that the chapel at Hutcliffe Wood Crematorium in Sheffield could not contain them all . Response: The mourners had seen a plea online from the RAF for attendees . Before the service Wally Walsh, 72, of Australia, said: 'We had come over from Australia on holiday and were staying in Berkshire. 'We saw the appeal for people to come in the news and my wife and I decided we would make the trip to pay our respects. It’s a fabulous to see so many people gathered today.' As the coffin was brought up to the church, servicemen, led by the sound of bagpipes, saluted the Mr Thompson. The coffin was then brought inside and at least 300 people - including servicemen, war veterans and members of the emergency services - packed into the tiny chapel. Pilot: George Thompson, pictured in 1945, flew night missions above Burma towards the end of the war . Squadron: Mr Thompson, third from the right, is pictured above in 1942 alongside his comrades . Procession: Military men and women, as well as members of the emergency services were among the hundreds of mourners . Salute: Mr Thompson's coffin was draped in a Union flag as well as a flag showing the RAF's roundel . So many arrived that the chapel could not accommodate everybody and some waited outside. Civil Funeral Celebrant David Hayes led the service and began by thanking people for the 'phenomenal' attendance and read memories of George’s long life. Mr Hayes then read the poem High Flight, by John Magee, and spoke of the love Mr Thompson had for Millie, his wife of 56 years who died in 2004. One of Mr Thompson's friends Joan Hunter said: 'I am pleased you are all here, I would like to thank all of you individually - I am overwhelmed'. 'Overwhelming': One of Mr Thompson's remaining friends praised the unexpected mourners . 'Incredible': The director of the funeral spoke of his surprise at the huge numbers who came. Pictured is a serviceman . As the mourners left the chapel We’ll Meet Again, by wartime singer Vera Lynn, was played. After the funeral Mr Hayes said: 'It was an incredible achievement that so many people came to pay tribute to an amazing man. 'It was an honour to be a part of it and I am so pleased we gave George the send-off he clearly deserved'. The huge funeral attendance - prompted by Mr Thompson's story being extensively shared online - echoes similar events earlier this year. In April John Campbell, a former major who died aged 92, had around 500 mourners attend his funeral. Harold Jellicoe Percival, who lived to 99, received a similar send-off at his funeral held on Armistice Day last year.","George Thompson flew missions over Burma in the Second World War .

"By . Leon Watson . Madagascar's unique wildlife is under threat from an invasion of toxic toads, scientists have warned. Researchers say the island's native species face an 'ecological disaster' caused by the arrival of Asian common toads. Snakes feeding on the toads are especially at risk of poisoning, as are iconic Madagascan species such as lemurs and endemic birds. Threat: Asian common toads, which are believed to have arrived in Madagascar on shipping containers, are poisonous to reptiles and animals if eaten . It is thought the amphibians were transported to the African island in shipping containers from south-east Asia. Scientists say Madagascar could suffer a repeat of what happened in Australia when a relative of the poisonous amphibian, the cane toad, was introduced to control pests in 1935. They proceeded to devastate native animal populations and have spread across much of the country, defying attempts to eradicate them. The toads now number in their millions there. The World Wildlife Fund says around 95 per cent of Madagascar's reptiles and 92 per cent of its mammals exist nowhere else on Earth. In a letter to Nature magazine, 11 researchers warned that Asian common toads, or Duttaphrynus melanostictus, were spotted near Toamasina, Madagascar's largest seaport. Ring tailed lemurs, which are found only on Madagascar, are already an endangered species, but now face an invasion of toxic frogs . Around 95 per cent of Madagascar's reptiles and 92 per cent of its mammals exist nowhere else on Earth . The females can lay 40,000 eggs a month and it is feared they will take advantage of the 'ideal resources and climate' to establish themselves. Jonathan Kolby, a wildlife health researcher at James Cook University in Australia, and his colleagues wrote: 'Time is short, so we are issuing an urgent call to the conservation community and governments to prevent an ecological disaster.' A relative of the Asian common toad, the cane toad, was introduced to Australia in 1935 and devastated wildlife there . He told Nature that iconic Madagascan species such as the cat-like fossa, lemurs and endemic birds could be threatened, because they are likely to eat the venomous toads. More than 50 species of endemic snake - including the ground boa - are also in jeopardy. The toads could also contaminate drinking water and transmit parasites to humans. The potential catastrophe is not just restricted to Madagascar, said Mr Kolby. 'There is now a high dispersal risk of these toads spreading from Madagascar to other Indian Ocean islands such as the Mascarene Islands, Comoros and Seychelles,' he said. The 11 co-signatories of the letter are calling for an urgent hunting programme to wipe out the toads before they take hold - including draining ponds to stop their breeding.","Scientists fear Asian common toads could decimate island's wildlife .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt has been ticked off after his new history book was found to be riddled with errors - by his Tory rival Michael Gove. Mr Hunt, a professional historian, has boasted of his 'deep and sustained reading' of history compared to the Education Secretary's ‘superficial understanding of the past’. But the Labour MP, whose latest work - Ten Cities that Made an Empire - is set to be published next week, made at least 14 basic errors on dates, names and events according to a review of the book written by Mr Gove. Historian and Labour shadow education spokesman Tristram Hunt has written a new book on the British Empire. But his Tory rival Michael Gove claims it is riddled with errors . The embarrassing errors include calling the Viscount Powerscourt the “Viscount Powerhouse”, and getting the date of the repeal of the Corn Laws wrong . Despite the string of errors in the book - for which Mr Hunt was paid £8,200 for writing according to the Register of Members’ Interests - Mr Gove praises it in a review to be published in The Times tomorrow. He says the book stands comparison with 'works by some of our finest historians' and praises his rival’s writing. 'The author, who is my opposite number in the House of Commons, has produced a work of the very high standard I would have expected.' But Mr Gove adds: 'It is not the case that the Nine Years’ War and the War of the Spanish Succession began in the late 1730s. They began in 1688 and 1701 respectively. 'And the Corn Laws were repealed in 1846 not 1844. It is to be hoped that these, and any other errors, can be corrected for what will no doubt be a highly successful paperback version of this otherwise exemplary read.' Education Secretary Michael Gove praised his opposite number's new work - but picked out 14 errors that could be corrected for the paperback version . Several other mistakes have been spotted by Mr Gove. The book makes a reference to England as 'perfidious Albion' in 1744 - when the phrase did not become current for another 50 years. Mr Hunt also writes of a British general election in 1888, yet there was no election that year. He claims that Lord Rosebery, a Liberal, expressed scepticism about whether the people of London would elect a black man, but this remark should have been attributed to the Conservative Lord Salisbury. The Labour shadow education secretary  joked: 'Once again Michael Gove's sub-editing skills can be put to good use.' According to the publishers, Penguin, Mr Hunt's book details 'the final embers of the British Empire' through the legacy it has left behind 'in the lives and structures of the cities which it shaped'. 'Here Tristram Hunt examines the stories and defining ideas of ten of the most important: Boston; Bridgetown; Dublin; Cape Town; Calcutta; Hong Kong; Bombay; Melbourne; New Delhi; and twentieth-century Liverpool.' Mr Hunt apparently rejects 'standard binary views of the British Empire as ""very good"" or ""very bad"".' Instead he 'describes the complex processes of exchange and adaptation that collectively shaped the colonial experience - and transformed the culture, economy and identity of the British Isles'. But a Tory source warned potential readers not to judge the book by its cover. He said: 'Just like Labour’s education policy, Tristram is all style and no substance. He can boast all he likes about his ""deep and sustained reading"" of history, but none of that matters if he can’t get his facts right. 'Let’s hope his publishers don’t rub salt into his wounds by asking for a refund. It will come as no surprise, except perhaps to Tristram himself, that polling shows he’s the only Labour politician less appealing than Ed Miliband.' ONE . Claim: 'A rolling succession of conflicts, beginning in the late 1730s, variously known as King William’s War (or the Nine Years’ War), Queen Anne’s War (War of the Spanish Succession)…' Fact: It is not the case that the Nine Years’ War and the War of the Spanish Succession began in the late 1730s. They began in 1688 and 1701 respectively. TWO . Claim: 'In March 1744, France had joined Spain in the War of the Austrian Succession against the nation they had come to call perfidious Albion.' Fact: England was not known as Perfidious Albion in 1744 – the phrase became current after 1793. THREE . Claim: 'In 1792, the Dublin-born politician and philosopher Edmund Burke, who would prove such a glittering critic of imperialism in the British Houses of Parliament…' Fact: Edward Burke was well-known as a critic of imperialism well before 1792 – as he showed with his opening speech at the impeachment of Warren Hastings in 1788. FOUR . Claim: 'The eponymous Powerscourt House on South William Street (designed by Richard Cassels for the third Viscount Powerhouse)…' Fact: Richard Cassels was the architect for the third Viscount Powerscourt, not the Viscount Powerhouse. FIVE . Claim: 'In 1844 the Corn Laws would be repealed as a defining symbol of the abandonment of the protectionist past and the triumph of Manchester liberalism,…' Fact: The Corn Laws were repealed in 1846 not 1844. SIX . Claim: 'But before Hong Kong came Singapore – the first of those rays of light dispelling the mercantilist gloom from the British Empire. In 1819 the East India Company writer Stamford Raffles began negotiations with Sultan Hussein Shah to secure the island, which was located in a prime position on the trading route between India and China. Sat between the Malay peninsula and the Indonesian archipelago, Singapore was historically part of the Dutch sphere of influence. Raffles’s achievement was to snatch it from under their nose in 1824, declare it a British possession and then institute a new model of colonialism predicated on the virtuous effects of free trade.' Fact: Sir Stamford Raffles did not just begin negotiations with Sultan Hussein Shah for Singapore in 1819, he concluded them in February of that year and the territory was secure in British hands from then, with its own constitution in 1823 – it was not snatched “from under the nose” of the Dutch in 1824. SEVEN . Claim: 'In 1827, James Matheson, who had ordered the works of Adam Smith and David Ricardo to be sent out to him in China, attempted to change the culture with a weekly paper, the Canton Register, in order to ""disseminate the principles of free trade"".' Fact: The Canton Register was not a weekly paper, it was published every two weeks. EIGHT . Claim: 'Despatched to China as lord superintendent of trade in the aftermath of the abolition of the East India Company monopoly in 1833,…' Fact: The East India Company’s trade monopoly (save for trade in tea and trade with China) was ended in 1813, not 1833. NINE . Claim: 'In Britain, the entrepreneur and inventor Richard Arkwright – who had pioneered cotton production at his Cromford mills along Derbyshire’s Derwent Valley – was the first to use steam-power for the purposes of cotton-spinning in Manchester in the late 1780s.' Fact: Richard Arkwright did not use steam power for the first time for the purposes of cotton spinning in Manchester in the late 1780s but in Derbyshire in 1777. TEN . Claim: 'Dadabhai progressed from the Corporation to the Bombay legislative council, thence to the Indian National Congress, before fighting seats in the British General Elections of 1886 and 1888.' Fact: There was no British General Election in 1888 so Naoroji Dadabhai could not have stood in it. ELEVEN . Claim: 'Spectacularly disproving the future Liberal prime minister Lord Rosebery’s prediction that the people of London would never elect a ‘black man’,…' Fact: It was the Conservative Lord Salisbury not the Liberal Lord Rosebery who expressed scepticism about the electoral fortunes of a “black man”. TWELVE . Claim: '""I believe in this race, the greatest governing race the world has ever seen,"" exclaimed the Liberal MP and colonial secretary Joseph Chamberlain,…' Fact: On the subject of Lord Salisbury, Joseph Chamberlain was not a Liberal MP any more when he was serving as Colonial Secretary in the Marquess’s Unionist administration. THIRTEEN . Claim: 'The roots of Britain’s suburban efflorescence were variously cultural, economic and technological. Its origins could be traced back to the Protestant evangelical revival of the late eighteenth century…' Fact: Britain’s post-Augustan Protestant Evangelical revival did not occur in the “late eighteenth century” – the two principal preachers of the 'Great Awakening' – George Whitefield and John Wesley – established themselves in the 1730s and 1740s. FOURTEEN . Claim: 'Benjamin Disraeli’s Imperial Act of 1876 signaled the new approach in anointing Queen Victoria as empress of India.' Fact: Victoria was made Empress of India by the Royal Titles Act of 1876 not the 'Imperial Act'.","Hunt's book on the British Empire contains at least 14 mistakes .

"By . Mia De Graaf . An elderly man died after he was knocked down by revolving doors at hospital, an inquest heard. Roderick Elliott, 73, was leaving a check up at the clinic after suffering two strokes when he was hit by the entrance. The pensioner was left with a broken thigh bone and died in the same hospital six days later. Tragic: Roderick Elliott, 73, was struck down by this door at South Tyneside District Hospital as he left a check up after suffering two strokes. He suffered a broken thigh bone and died six days later . Incredibly, an inquest revealed he was the second victim to suffer injuries inflicted by the door at South Tyneside District Hospital. Mr Elliott relied on a walking stick after suffering a stroke in 2001 and another in 2006, his widow Jean told the court. She said they were making their way to the exit after an appointment on October 21, 2011, when her husband was struck and sent flying. He was taken into the accident and emergency department and an X-ray revealed he had broken his right femur. Doctors claimed we was on the way to recovery after having a screw fitted into his hip joint the next day. However, days after the operation Mr . Elliott was taken to the toilet in a wheelchair and when staff went back . to collect him 10 minutes later they found him unresponsive. Stroke unit: He had been at an appointment at the stroke unit with his wife Jean. He died six days later . The inquest was told the cause of death was acute bronchial pneumonia - a common development in patients laid up with an injury. He also had an underlying heart and lung condition. Questioning the safety of the door, assistant coroner David Mitford found another patient was struck by it just months before. Mary Adamson, a Sister in the hospitals outpatients unit, told the inquest a report was filed following  a similar incident in May 2011. After hearing about the accident, she decided to stand in the door to test if it would hit her, as sensors should have stopped it, she told the court. She said: 'I stood where I thought Mr Elliott would have been stood and the door did hit me. It didn’t knock me over but it struck me with more force than I thought it would.' Health and safety manager, Derek Gifford, told the coroner that 2011 had seen 11 accidents similar to this reported across the country, followed by 19 in 2012 and 15 in 2013. He added that there are 120 like it in the UK and if each one had 500 users each day, 22 million people would use the doors each year, meaning that the incident was 'very rare'. Assistant coroner, David Mitford, ruled the death had been an accident but added that he was concerned about the doors used in 15 hospitals. Steve Jamieson, South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust’s director of corporate services, said: 'We once again extend our deepest sympathies to Mr Elliott’s family on their sad loss. 'The safety of our patients, visitors and staff is always our first consideration and, following the inquest, we now await the coroner’s letter before making any further decision regarding the doors. 'In the meantime, they will remain in slide mode. 'The coroner did note, however, that the doors at the hospital were operating in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommended standards at the time of the tragic incident.'","Roderick Elliot, 73, was leaving a check up after suffering two strokes .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A drugs gang who made more than £2.3million in a massive country-wide heroin racket have been ordered to pay back just £24. Mark Gale, Ivan Wood, Craig Corrigan, John Pogue, Ryan Morgan and Steven Blundell were all found guilty of conspiracy to supply class A drugs in April last year. But at a proceeds of crime act hearing, a judge at Exeter Crown Court was told the men had 'spent all the money' with the exception of Morgan, who had just £20 in his bank account. A gang of heroin smugglers who made £2.3million have been fined just £24 after a judge was told they had 'spent all their money'. Steven Blundell, 35 (left), was not at the proceeds of crime hearing as he is currently on the run in Spain, while Craig Corrigan (right) was fined a nominal £1 . Drug courier Pogue (pictured) was also fined £1, as were fellow criminals Mark Gale and Ivan Wood. Another gang member, Ryan Morgan, was fined £20 after the court heard that was all he had left in his bank account . As a result, the court reclaimed just £24 after taking Morgan's money, and fining Wood, Corrigan, Gale and Pogue a nominal £1 each. That is despite the fact that the . Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) confiscation proceedings could have cost . the taxpayer £20,000 per defendant, if not more. Fellow criminal Blundell, 35, was not at the hearing as he went went on the run before being sentenced and is now thought to be in Spain. Before his arrest, Blundell lived the high life with luxury cars and designer clothes as he oversaw an operation that channelled heroin from Merseyside to the South West. A damning audit report earlier this year revealed just 26p for every £100 generated by criminals is recovered through POCA legislation. The men were all arrested last year after detectives in Operation Raby established that the heroin was being transported from Liverpool to addresses in Devon before being distributed across the South West. During Blundell's trial at Exeter Crown Court, jurors were told how he lived the high-life with a fleet of expensive cars including a Porsche, and Audi, and a collection of BMWs and 4x4s . Police said Steven Blundell had a fleet of luxury cars including a Porsche Boxster, Audis, BMWs and Volkswagen 4x4s. He also spent £11,000 in cash on foreign travel in a three-month period, but had no obvious income or employment. He involved his cousins Paul Blundell, 24, and Morgan, 29, as well as drug courier Pogue, 24, all of Halewood, Liverpool, in the operation. The gang got sentences ranging from two to nine years. DC Jason Braund from Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'Unfortunately these defendants had no available assets and therefore were ordered to pay nominal amounts of £1 each, with the exception of Morgan who had access to £20. 'It does, however, come with a warning that these individuals can be re-visited in the future should they come into wealth or any assets are later identified, as we can take it from them.' An investigation into the finances of Blundell is likely to be launched when he is traced and  extradited back to Britain. He is set to be sentenced in his absence next month.","Six gangsters jailed for conspiracy to supply class A drugs in April last year .

"By . James Chapman, Daily Mail Political Editor . Labour will launch a bizarre campaign today to make David Cameron issue a formal public apology for Margaret Thatcher’s handling of the miners’ strike in the 1980s. The Opposition will insist that the Government should say sorry for the actions of the late prime minister’s administration, claiming it deliberately sought to escalate the dispute. Shadow Cabinet Office minister, Michael Dugher will raise the issue in the Commons, challenging ministers to set out ‘all details of the interactions between the Government and the police at the time’. Campaign: Labour want to make David Cameron issue a formal public apology for Margaret Thatcher's handling of the miners' strike in the 1980s . He will also suggest that there should be a ‘proper investigation’ into the ugliest confrontation of the strike in 1984, when 10,000 striking miners clashed with 5,000 police officers in what became known as the Battle of Orgreave. Lord Tebbit, who was Baroness Thatcher’s trade and industry secretary during the strike, dismissed Labour’s ‘justice for the coalfields’ campaign as absurd. ‘Next they’ll want an apology for freeing the Falklands,’ the Conservative peer said. ‘I presume Ed Miliband is doing this in order to get some more money from Unite [the union]. ‘My recollection is that the police were principally used to protect miners who wanted to go to work and who had not been granted a ballot, but were being prevented from doing so by [National Union of Mineworkers leader] Arthur Scargill’s hate mob. Confrontation: Police grapple with those on the picket line at Orgreave . ‘Neither Labour nor Scargill has ever apologised for that.’ Lord Tebbit added: ‘I trust the Government will merely laugh at this ridiculous campaign.’ It is likely to cause unease among the dwindling band of Blairite Labour MPs, who will fear that the party risks alienating Middle England by appearing to back Mr Scargill in a 30-year-old argument. The move comes after the release of Cabinet papers earlier this month showing that Lady Thatcher came within days of declaring a state of emergency and calling out the military four months into the miners’ strike. Scathing: Lord Tebbit, who was Baroness Thatcher¿s trade and industry secretary during the strike, dismissed Labour's 'justice for the coalfields' campaign as absurd . Dismissal: Lord Tebbit, pictured with Margaret Thatcher in 1985, said he presumed Labour was campaigning for an apology to get money from union Unite . Ministers secretly discussed recalling Parliament in the summer of 1984 to pass emergency legislation, according to documents released to the National Archives. The files show that plans were drawn up for soldiers to transport food and coal, but the idea was dismissed on the grounds that it would cause panic. Labour says the papers also suggest that the Thatcher government had a secret plan to close 75 pits at the cost of 65,000 jobs and that it sought to influence police tactics to escalate the dispute. Industrial action was triggered in March 1984 by plans to close 20 loss-making pits. Mr Scargill went into battle with the Tories and a year-long war of attrition ensued.

Mr Dugher, MP for the former pit town of Barnsley, where Mr Scargill was born, said: ‘For those of us who lived through the strike and who saw the events and impact they had first hand, what was revealed in the Cabinet papers may not come as a surprise. ‘But it is no less shocking to consider that, far from being neutral, as was claimed at the time, it is clear that the Government took a deliberately calculated political approach guided by a complete hostility to the coalfield communities. ‘That is why I am calling for justice for the coalfields.’ He added: ‘Ministers may want to sweep these events under the carpet, but the scars of the dispute and the subsequent closure programme remain on the memories, communities and landscapes of all coalfield communities. ‘They must now apologise and deliver transparency to begin to foster reconciliation with the coalfield communities.’","Shadow minister, Michael Dugher to raise issue in the Commons .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated Press Reporter . Six climbers have gone missing while ascending Mount Rainier in Washington state, sparking a helicopter search. The missing group includes four clients of Seattle-based Alpine Ascents International and two guides. They were due to return from the mountain Friday. When they did not make it back, the climbing company notified park officials at around 4.30pm, Park Ranger Fawn Bauer said. Search operation: Six climbers, including two guides, have gone missing while ascending Mount Rainier, a dormant volcano in Washington state . 'The last contact with them was at 12,800 feet,' Bauer said. Mount Rainier, southeast of Seattle, stands at 14,410 feet and attracts thousands of climbers trying to reach its summit every year. The search for the missing climbers is focusing on the Liberty Ridge area, near from where they were last heard from, Bauer said. The search includes climber ranger teams on the ground and flyovers with a helicopter. The last contact the group had with the climbing company was at 6pm Wednesday. They were scheduled to reach the summit of Mount Rainier on Thursday, with a day to climb down. The group is equipped with satellite and mobile phones. A small weather front that brought snow flurries and hail to the mountain moved in Wednesday, Bauer said. The weather has been clear since then. Adventurers: The climb was organized by the Seattle-based Alpine Ascents International, some of whose guides are pictured here earlier this week on Mount Rainier . The search for the missing climbers (not pictured) is focusing on the Liberty Ridge area, near from where they were last heard from . Alpine Ascents' director of programs, Gordon Janow, said he wasn't ready to release information about the climbers. 'Let's hope they're found and that it goes well,' he said. Details — such as ages, gender or hometowns — for the climbers were not immediately available, Bauer said. Saturday afternoon, rescuers spotted camping and climbing equipment at 9,500 feet on Carbon Glacier, but there is no word at this time if the gear belongs to the missing party. Last month, Alpine Ascents International lost five of the 16 Sherpa guides killed in an avalanche on Mount Everest.","Missing group includes four clients of Seattle-based Alpine Ascents International .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The notorious underwear bomber who tried to bring down a jumbo jet on Christmas Day had a dirty little secret - he'd been wearing the explosive skivvies for weeks. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab wore them for three weeks to be exact, and it may have been the reason why he was unsuccessful in his 2009 terrorist plans aboard a Detroit-bound airliner. The new details were revealed by two FBI agents who played a role in securing a confession from Abdulmutallab, shortly after the bungled plot. Scroll down for video . Bomber shorts: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab wore this underwear outfitted with explosives for three weeks before the failed bomb attempt on Christmas Day 2009 . Notorious: Abdulmutallab was focused on his mission to crash the plane over Detroit, because it was 'God's call' Agent Ted Peissig told WXYZ-TV: 'So basically for three weeks he wore this garment, these underwear with this device in it. ‘We think ultimately that is probably what caused the disruption in the sequence of events in the explosion.' Terror strike: Abdulmutallab, pictured in his 2009 mugshot, was sentenced to three life terms after pleading guilty . Peissig, along with fellow agent Mike Connelly, told the network that Abdulmutallab wore the explosives-rigged underwear for three weeks in an effort to get accustomed to it, only taking it off when he showered. Connelly added that Abdulmutallab was focused on his mission to crash the plane, because it was 'God's call.' The agents admitted that Abdulmutallab did not look like a terrorist, but he spoke freely about how he was working for al-Qaeda and that had acted alone. The explosives failed to fully detonate aboard the flight, which was carrying nearly 300 people, but caused a brief fire that badly burned his groin. Passengers pounced on Abdulmutallab and forced him to the front of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 where he was held until the plane landed minutes later. Abdulmutallab talked freely to the FBI about his desire to commit martyrdom for his Islamic faith. In 2009, months before the attack, he said he travelled to Yemen to see Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric and one of the best-known al-Qaeda figures. He told investigators that his mission was approved after a three-day visit with his mentor. Al-Awlaki and the bomb maker were killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen last year, just days before Abdulmutallab's trial. Agents: Ted Peissig, left, and Mike Connelly are the two FBI agents who were able to secure a confession from Abdulmutallab after the failed bomb plot . At the time, President Obama publicly blamed al-Awlaki for the terrorism plot. For their role in the Abdulmutallab investigation, Peissig and Connelly were recently given the Attorney General's award, the highest honour an FBI agent can get, according to WXYZ-TV.

"By . Hayley Peterson . Colin Powell has admitted to exchanging 'very personal' emails with a Romanian diplomat who sent him photos of herself - one in a bikini - and confessed to loving him but he denies having an affair with the much younger woman. The 76-year-old retired general told the Smoking Gun that he met Corina Cretu, 45, roughly ten years ago when she was working as an assistant to the president of Romania. She is now a member of the European Parliament. Married Powell admitted to the exchange after a hacker released details from their intimate messages. In one email, dated November 14, 2011, Miss Cretu wrote: 'I have loved you too much, too many years. YOU were my greatest love of my life...'. In another she urges Powell, 'Sip a . glass of wine with me, as you used to tell me - advising me to lie neck . [naked] on tha sofa.' She also sent him pictures of herself, including one in a hot tub and a bikini shot. However, the affection seems not to have been returned. 'After I left the Department of State in January 2005 we stayed in touch via email,' he told TSG. 'Over time the emails became of a very personal nature, but did not result in an affair. Those type of emails ended a few years ago. There was no affair then and there is not one now.' Colin Powell (right) and Corina Cretu (left) are pictured at a conference in Washington in July 2011. She posted this photo to her blog . Colin Powell (center) and Corina Cretu (left) are pictured in 2002 outside the Cotroceni Palace in Bucharest awaiting the arrival of then-President George W. Bush. Cretu has posted this photo to her blog . Corina Cretu emailed Colin Powell this photo of herself at a pool. In her emails, she calls Powell the love of her life . In response to questions about multiple . photos included in some of the emails, he said, 'She sent photos on a . regular basis. Lots of family photos with her nieces, who she adores, . family reunions, formal business sessions, her wedding and some bathing . suit photos ... Never anything improper.' Powell has been married for 50 years to his wife, Alma, and Cretu was married last year. He was forced to address his relationship with Cretu on Thursday after the notorious hacker 'Guccifer' posted a link to a Google document on Powell's Facebook wall that contained some of the emails. The post was promptly removed from his wall. In the emails, 'Cretu calls [Powell] the love of her life and describes a . relationship that spanned more than a decade,' according to TSG. 'The 2010-2011 e-mails . would leave most readers with the clear impression that the forlorn . Cretu is writing about the twilight of a romance.' In one email dated Christmas Eve 2010, she wrote: 'I did not believe that at 43 I can cry more for a man like a teenager.' She added: 'Have you such a heart to leave me here alone, [thinking] of you, without enjoying your gifts... your small gestures or gifts, which once was very powerful, without your words every day?' Another, from 2011, said: 'Nobody is saying to go to bed. I just want to see you, nothing more.' Powell spokeswoman Peggy Cifrino confirmed The Smoking Gun’s report. 'Yes, the article accurately reflects the situation and that is General Powell’s statement,' Cifrino said in an email to Politico. Cretu has not responded to a request for comment from MailOnline.

Months . ago, Guccifer successfully accessed email accounts belonging to Powell . and a number of other high-ranking officials, including former President . George W. Bush and his family. The emails between Powell and Cretu were . not released at the time. Powell said he asked Cretu earlier this week - after the link to the emails was posted - to delete all the messages between them. That email was also accessed by the hacker and posted online. Powell explained to the Smoking Gun: 'In light of what was happening it seems obvious to ask Ms. Cretu to delete emails.' He said the two 'remain friends and . are in touch,' but have only seen each other 'once or twice' over the . past eight years at 'group conferences' in Washington, D.C. 'I am pleased that she is having a successful career,' Powell said. 'I am pleased that she is recently and happily married.' Cretu holds a press conference in 2009 on responding to violence against women in conflict. She is a member of the European Parliament . Cretu was elected to the European Parliament in 2007. She is the is vice-chair of Parliament’s 'Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats,' which traveled to Washington in July 2011 for a conference. Cretu posted a blog about the conference and included a photo of herself and Colin Powell. 'Commander of U.S. troops in the first Gulf War and Secretary of State from 2001 to 2005, General Colin Powell is one of the most avid observers of global developments and also an old and good friend of Romania,' she wrote, according to an English translation of her blog, which was written in Romanian.

"By . Ruth Dudley Edwards . In custody: The arrest of Gerry Adams in connection with the murder of Jean McConville provoked a wide range of responses . The arrest of Gerry Adams in connection with the murder of Jean McConville provoked a wide range of responses. There was rejoicing among those who have longed to see justice meted out to this terrible man. There was fury from his supporters, who claimed there was ‘a political agenda’ behind the arrest designed to damage Sinn Fein on the eve of the EU parliamentary elections. And from veteran Northern Ireland watchers, gloomy predictions that this was a false dawn, that yet again nothing would stick to Teflon Gerry, a man who was a leader of the IRA for more than three decades, who still insists he wasn’t even a member of the terrorist organisation and who polls say is the most popular party leader in the Republic of Ireland. Many people in Britain and Ireland are mystified and shocked that anyone votes for Adams, who won a seat in the Irish parliament in 2011 and took over as Sinn Fein party leader. The IRA which he defends murdered 2,000 men, women and children, ruined the lives of tens of thousands more who were injured, bereaved or traumatised, and wrecked Northern Ireland. Yet unrepentant terrorists and their apologists are elected both north and south of the border. Tribal loyalty and generations of brainwashing account for much of their support, but there is also ignorance and gullibility. Close on a quarter of the population in the Republic weren’t even born when in 1998 the Good Friday Agreement signalled that the IRA were going out of business. They simply don’t know of the stench that surrounds Gerry Adams and his organisation. Killed: Jean McConville (pictured with three of her children) was abducted, murdered and buried by an IRA mob . Adams is an accomplished liar who spouts the language of peace, social justice and equality and steadfastly insists that vested interests are behind all the allegations about his past. All he has ever been is a peace-maker, he says, and people who don’t know much about politics believe him. He has adopted a cuddly, folksy persona and tweets whimsically (and often weirdly) about his teddy bears, his dogs and his love of music and poetry. Far from damaging their support, Sinn Fein hope that Adams’ arrest will actually earn their candidates sympathy votes, and that is entirely possible if their skilful propaganda succeeds. Yet having the awful tragedy of Jean McConville once again reported in all its horrific detail all over the media is a potent reminder of the sheer brutality of the organisation Adams refuses to disassociate himself from. Search: Irish police excavate the beach in Louth, Ireland, where the body of Jean McConville was found in 2003 . Removing her body: The mother of ten's body is removed from an area near Templetown beach in County Louth . Only . the hardest heart could have been unmoved by hearing Michael McConville . on Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday morning, describing what . happened to him after his mother was dragged from her screaming children . by an IRA mob to be shot dead. Aged 11, he was kidnapped, beaten and threatened with terrible consequences if he identified the neighbours who did it. Those . threats were made more than 40 years ago, yet he fears his children . might be killed if even now he breaches the IRA’s code of silence by . naming names. Still, ever since the IRA’s evil grip on republican areas . began to loosen in the 1990s, he and some of his siblings have at least . been prepared to tell his story and demand justice. Son: Michael McConville described yesterday what happened to him after his mother was dragged from her children by an IRA mob to be shot dead. He was threatened with terrible consequences if he revealed who did it . Jean . McConville may have been secretly buried and her reputation trashed, . just as several other IRA victims were. But the McConvilles and other . families of those known as the Disappeared were not prepared to remain . quiet. They doggedly waged a campaign that forced the IRA to co-operate with the search for bodies. After Jean’s was found in 2003, an inquest ruled she had been unlawfully killed, the Police Ombudsman declared categorically that she had never been a British agent – as the IRA had claimed after she comforted a British soldier wounded outside her home – and the police are pursuing her murderers. Liar: Adams is an accomplished liar who spouts the language of peace, social justice and equality . But Jean McConville’s case is not the only one. To the horror of ex-paramilitaries, more and more ordinary people are demanding justice for their loved ones. With the help of Daily Mail readers, for instance, families of Omagh bomb victims took and won a civil case against four of the perpetrators. The sisters of Robert McCartney – stabbed to death in 2005 outside a bar by people associated with Sinn Fein – are keeping their brother’s murder in the public eye despite the fact they have been intimidated by IRA thugs out of their jobs and home. Ann Travers, whose sister Mary was shot dead by gunmen trying to murder their magistrate father, refused to remain silent after a woman who had served time for her role in the murder was appointed as a special adviser to a Sinn Fein minister. In the teeth of vociferous Sinn Fein opposition, the Northern Irish assembly has now blocked the appointment to such jobs of anyone with a serious conviction. Sinn Fein have always made a point of supporting families who protest against killings by loyalists or state forces – think of Bloody Sunday, or Adams’ campaign for an inquiry into several killings in 1971 in Belfast’s Ballymurphy by members of the Parachute Regiment. Yet when the boot is on the other foot, when there are calls for justice for those murdered by the IRA, Sinn Fein’s response is to howl with complaint and utter dark threats about the unravelling of the peace. In the past, this has made the police nervous about pursuing high-profile republicans. It is widely believed, for instance, that political interference prevented the charging of Martin McGuinness in 1993 after Central TV’s The Cook Report had produced a two-part documentary accusing him of being ‘Britain’s No 1 terrorist’, and featuring witnesses who claimed he had enticed an informer called Frank Hegarty back to Londonderry where he was murdered. Determined: The sisters (right) of Robert McCartney (left), who was stabbed to death outside a bar in 2005 by people associated with Sinn Fein, are keeping their brother’s murder in the public eye despite being intimidated . But this kid-gloves approach is changing. The IRA’s victims are bolder today and have been putting pressure on the police to pursue anyone against whom there is evidence. This has rattled the Sinn Fein leadership which has been seeking some kind of amnesty for those found guilty. In a deal negotiated by representatives of loyalist and republican paramilitaries, no one convicted of any pre-1998 Troubles-related crime has to serve more than two years in jail – and, ironically, this would apply to Adams if he were found guilty. But although there are politicians such as Peter Hain who support the amnesty, victims and those who believe in the rule of law are fighting it. The bereaved don’t want deals and trade-offs. They want justice. Jean McConville’s children will never get over their mother’s cruel death. Yet they have been given heart to see the police are taking her murder so seriously they are prepared to interrogate even that celebrity terrorist-turned-peacemaker, Gerry Adams. Because whatever happens to him, his arrest is a victory for ordinary people which sends out a signal that no one is above the law.

"Nicola Payne, who disappeared aged 18 while walking home from her boyfriend's house in 1991 . Police investigating the disappearance of teenager Nicola Payne in Coventry 21 years ago said today they have arrested two men aged 74 and 45 on suspicion of conspiracy to prevent the lawful and decent burial of a body. Officers yesterday launched a major search for the body of a teenage mother who went missing more than two decades ago after a tip-off that she could be buried in scrub land. Detectives hunting for Nicola Payne - who vanished on a five-minute walk home from a boyfriend's house - are using X-ray ground scanners and dogs trained to sniff out bodies as they scour the site in her hometown of Coventry. The mother-of-one was just 18 when she went missing after cutting across foggy waste land in the suburb of Courthouse Green on December 14, 1991. She lived with her parents and her seven-month-old son Owen - who never got to know his mother. Miss Payne's relatives spoke of 'fresh hope' that they may finally be able to lay her to rest after years of misery. The dig is taking place just a few hundred metres away from where she was last seen 21 years ago. Home Office forensic scientists will be joined by experts using X-ray equipment and cadaver dogs during the search, which is expected to last several days. DCI Matt Markham, of West Midlands Police CID, said: 'This activity is as a direct result of new information which has been developed by detectives working on the case. 'The investigation into Nicola's disappearance has always remained open and any new information has been examined. 'We are today continuing to appeal for new information and would urge the local community to think back as to whether they saw anything suspicious on or around the 14 December 1991, either at this location or where Nicola was last sighted, to come forward if they have not previously done so.' Since Miss Payne's disappearance her family have campaigned tirelessly to find out what happened. Speaking from her parent's home, Miss Payne's brother said the family had gathered together to support each other while the hunt for her body resumed. Officers walk past police tents in parkland in Coventry as the search gets underway today . Police clear the area before forensic investigators move in with X-ray equipment and sniffer dogs . An aerial view of the parkland in Coventry where police believe the missing woman may be buried . Nigel Payne, 48, said: 'We've been here once or twice before, hopefully this will put an end to it. 'We've all come together, what my mum . and dad are going through is difficult enough at the best of times but . when these things come up it really, really affects them. 'If nothing comes of it, it's an awfully long time to try and pick them back up again. 'You just wish that ""this is it"" and . we can have a bit of closure, that's all we need at the moment, then my . mum and dad can go and put my sister to rest. 'It's hard enough being her brother but what my mum and dad are going through, that's something different.' He added that police had only revealed minimal details of the search to the family, who were today nervously awaiting news. He said: 'They've said there's new information and they wanted to go searching this area and that's all they've told us. 'We'd love to know a bit more but we're just sitting here. 'It's frustrating - it's a waiting game.' Left, Miss Payne, pictured 10 weeks before her disappearance, holds her son Owen, who in 2007 spoke of his regret over never having known his mother. Right, at her brother's wedding in 1990 . Today forensic tents were erected and specialist teams with police dogs could be seen searching the area. Officers equipped with . state-of-the-art ground scanning equipment could be seen scouring the . area and a loud drilling could be heard. Family friend David Williams, 76, who lives opposite the park land, said: 'I remember the night that it happened well. 'It was ever so misty. You could not see a thing. It was real thick fog so nobody would have seen anything untoward. 'She went walking across the path and never made it. 'Half an hour later her dad went out looking for her and phoned the police. 'The family have never given up looking for her but they do think she is dead. 'It is the biggest mystery in Coventry. It has never gone away.' DCI Markham added: 'We are extremely . hopeful that we will find something. We owe it to the family to try get . them a bit of closure to this 20 year mystery. 'Nicola's family have suffered . tremendously over the last 20 years. Nicola would have been 40 this . January so it is a real key milestone for them. Parents John and Marilyn Payne (left) told how they are hoping for closure as police seek to find out the fate of their daughter. Right, a picture released after the disappearance shows how Miss Payne might have looked . 'It is very much the view of the . investigation team that someone out there does know what happened to . Nicola and holds the key to unraveling the mystery of the disappearance. 'We are clearing overgrowth and . making the area suitable for more scientific investigation to try an . establish further areas of interest. 'It is a direct result of new . information coming to light which we assessed and deemed worthy of . further investigation, which might offer up new clues in terms of what . happened to Nicola Payne all those years ago.' Miss Payne was 5ft 3in tall, of medium build, with brown hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a brown leather jacket, purple T-shirt and fawn trousers. The investigation into her . disappearance was never closed and in the last 20 years a number of . Coventry locations have been dug up in the hunt for her. In November 2007 a 37-year-old from . Derbyshire was arrested but, after spending five months on bail, he was . released without charge. DCI Markham added: 'We are committed to investigating any new information with the aim of bringing closure to Nicola’s family, who have endured a painful and traumatic 21 years since her disappearance.' In 2007, Miss Payne's son Owen - who is now 21 - described how he had missed out on memories with his mother. He said: 'I was seven months old when my lovely mum Nickie went missing. 'Nan and granddad always say that she had a loving bond with me, which was noticeable to all. 'Sadly I have no memories of her and I . envy my older cousins who remember her well, and they tell me what a . fun-loving girl she was. 'During my early years at school I . wished that my mum could meet me at the school gates after school to . collect me, as other mums did with my friends. 'School plays, sports days and open days - there was no mum there to spoil me. 'My dad and all the family were always loving and caring, but it wasn't the same. 'My . one wish would be to have my mum found and to be able to understand the . confusion, mystery and heartbreak of the past 16 years.' Miss Payne's son spoke of how relatives had comforted him with memories of his 'fun-loving' mother, pictured centre in fancy dress aged 17 . Two police officers stand amid thick undergrowth, which detectives believe may be concealing the remains of Nicola Payne . Her mother Marilyn, along with father John, has fought since her disappearance to find out her daughter's fate. She said the family had given up hope that Miss Payne was still alive, but hoped one day her body would be found. Marilyn . said: 'John, myself and all the family do not believe Nickie is still . alive, but we will never give up hope that one day our daughter will be . found and we will have some kind of closure. 'On Saturday, December 14, 1991, our lives were shattered and since then life has never been the same. 'We all support each other on our bad days of which there are many, as we are still a very close-knit family. 'In the beginning, the police responded immediately and they have kept in touch and supported us over the years. 'There have been numerous enquiries . all over the country, but we are still in the dark wanting answers as to . the whereabouts of our only daughter Nicola.' The . missing woman's family said in a statement: 'It has been nearly 21 . years since our daughter Nicola went missing. For many years we have . suffered not knowing what has happened to her. 'This demonstrates that there are people still providing vital and important information to the price around her disappearance. 'If . there is anyone who has information that will assist the police around . this new site or witnessed anything around this location back in . December 1991 please make contact with the officers.

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple boss Tim Cook has hit back at claims Apple is losing its cool by saying the tech giant has 'some incredible plans' which are likely to include both a TV and a wearable computer. The Apple boss took part in a rare interview at the D11 conference in California. 'Televisions have not been brought up to date for a decade', he said, . whilst wearable technology is 'profoundly interesting'. Tim Cook at the D11 conference: The Apple boss has hit back at claims Apple is losing its cool by saying the tech giant has 'some incredible plans' which are likely to include both a TV and a wearable computer . 'There is a very grand vision of this,'' Cook claimed when asked about plans for a TV service. 'When you look at the TV experience, it’s not an experience that I think very many people love. 'It’s not one that has been brought up to date for this decade. 'It’s still an experience much like 10 years ago or 20 years ago. 'It continues to be an area of great interest to us.” Mr Cook said wearable technology such as Google's Glass was 'an area that's ripe for exploration.' 'it's ripe for us to get excited about. 'Lots of companies will play in this space. 'I see wearables as a very important branch of the tree.' Apple has been rumored to be working on a curved glass watch, dubbed the iWatch, which is expected to run on the same iOS software as the iPad and iPhone. It has been claimed a team led by Apple's British born designer Sir Jonathan Ive with over 100 . engineers, is working on the project, and that it is expected to be . released later this year. Mr Cook also revealed he think's Google Glass is not the right approach for a wearable computer. 'People that do wear them generally want them to be light, to be . unobtrusive. 'They probably want them to reflect their fashion,' he said. 'There are some positives in the product, it's probably . likely to appeal to certain markets - but the likelihood that it has broad . appeal is hard to see.' Cook said. 'To convince people that they have to wear something, it has to be . incredible,' Cook said. Another example of wearable technology is smart watches. This mockup of the much-rumoured iWatch was created by MacUser magazine. It is expected to link to an iPhone, and compete with Google's Glass in the wearable computer market . 'If we asked a room of 20-year olds to stand up . if they're wearing a watch, I don't think anyone would stand up.' Although he refused to confirm the firm was working on a watch, Mr . Cook said that Nike 'did a great job' with the Fuelband, a wrist based . sensor that tracks a user's movement. 'There are lots of gadgets in the space,' Cook said. 'I would say that . the ones that are doing more than one thing, there's nothing great out . there that I've seen. 'Nothing that's going to convince a kid that's never worn glasses or a band or a watch or whatever to wear one.' Cook also hinted at Apple's TV plans. 'There is a very grand vision of this,' Cook claimed when asked about plans for a TV service. 'When you look at the TV experience, it’s not an experience that I think very many people love. 'It’s not one that has been brought up to date for this decade. 'It’s still an experience much like 10 years ago or 20 years ago.' However, he refused to reveal any details of the plans, telling interviewer Kara Swisher: 'I’m going to leave that alone - but it continues to be an area of great interest to us.' Cook also addressed Apple's stock price, saying 'The stock price has been frustrating. It¿s been frustrating for investors and all of us.' Apple’s new products are also set to include the newest version of . its operating system, iOS7, which is due to be unveiled at its annual . developers’ conference in just over two weeks, and will be overseen by Sir Jonathan Ive, known to his colleagues as Jony. 'Jony is really key,' Mr Cook said.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Apple founder Steve Jobs reacted to news that he had got a Google employee sacked by sending a simple - but brutal - 'smiley face' in an e-mail, new documents show. Jobs had taken issue with an attempt by the web giant to poach one of his engineers, apparently in violation of an alleged anti-competition agreement by the firms not to hire each other's staff. According to a cache of e-mails between the late Apple CEO and Google chairman Eric Schmidt in 2007, Jobs was furious after discovering that a Google recruiter had contacted one of his employees. Scroll down for the full e-mail exchanges . Simple, but brutal: Apple founder Steve Jobs reacted to news that he had got a Google employee sacked by sending a 'smiley face' in an e-mail, newly unearthed documents show . He told Schmidt: 'I would be very pleased if your recruiting department would stop doing this.' When Schmidt demanded an explanation from his HR department, he was told the culprit would be fired 'within the hour'. Schmidt relayed this to Jobs, who replied with ':) Steve'. The e-mails, published by PandoDaily, relate to the alleged illegal agreement that Google and Apple entered into not to compete for each other's employees. The two firms are currently defending a class action lawsuit relating to the scheme, which was said to have been designed to drive down wages. Last week, a U.S. judge rejected a request from the companies and two others to avoid a trial, which has been scheduled to begin in May. 'Stop doing this': Steve Jobs (left) e-mailed Google chairman Eric Schmidt (right) after learning of the approach by a Google recruiter in 2007 . Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe asked for a judgment in their favor without a trial, arguing that any no-hire agreements between the companies were reached independently and were not part of an overarching conspiracy. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, Calif., however, rejected that argument. 'That the agreements were entered into and enforced by a small group of intertwining high level executives bolsters the inference that the agreements were not independent,' wrote Koh. A representative for Adobe could not immediately be reached for comment. An Intel spokesman said the company is studying the ruling, and representatives for Google and Apple declined to comment. The case began in 2011 when five software engineers sued Apple, Google, Adobe Systems Inc, Intel Corp and others, alleging a conspiracy to suppress pay by agreeing not to recruit or hire each other's employees. These defendants were accused of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act anti-trust laws by conspiring to eliminate competition for labour, depriving workers of job mobility and hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation. Below is the e-mail exchange between Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt . Jobs Smiley Face Efiled Exhibit 250 . Exhibit 192 . The case has been closely watched in Silicon Valley, with much of it built on e-mails among top executives, including the late Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs and former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt. In the order on Friday, Koh wrote that the companies shared confidential compensation information with each other, despite the fact they considered each other competitors. For instance, Intel chief executive Paul Otellini circulated information about competitors' bonus plans that he 'lifted from Google.' 'A reasonable jury could infer that this confidential information could be shared safely by competitors only because the anti-solicitation agreements squelched true competition,' Koh wrote. Other companies refused to enter into non-solicitation agreements at all. Bill Campbell, who served on Apple's board and also advised Google, discussed attempting to broker a 'cease fire' between Google and Facebook, Koh wrote. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg ultimately refused Google's entreaties to join a no-hire agreement, according to court documents. 'These expansions and attempted expansions of the anti- solicitation agreements suggest that the agreements were not isolated, independent bilateral agreements, but rather were part of a broader conspiracy,' Koh wrote. Walt Disney Co's Pixar and Lucasfilm units and Intuit Inc have already agreed to a settlement, with Disney paying about $9 million and Intuit paying $11 million. At a hearing this week, attorneys for Google and the plaintiffs said they were 'making progress' in settlement talks.

"By . Martin Robinson . and Larisa Brown . One Direction fans and their parents are selling on tickets for upcoming gigs for half their face value because of the band's drugs scandal, it was revealed today. £30 seats at Sunday's show in Manchester are being offered for £15 after a video first broken by MailOnline showed Louis . Tomlinson and Zayn Malik sharing a 'joint'. Viagogo, the world's largest ticket marketplace, says that it has seen a 79 per cent spike in One Direction sales in the 24 hours since the footage was published. Half price tickets for a number of gigs are also available on sites like Gumtree. Parents who fear the clean-cut group are now a bad influence on their children are thought to be the main reason why tickets are being sold on. More woes: Seats for the upcoming One Direction gigs are selling for as little as £15 - half the face value - after the now infamous 'joint' video was published, ticket giant viagogo has said . Struggling: Experts told MailOnline there are now 'many' cut price tickets available for shows, including this Gumtree advert for half price Wembley tickets . Damaging: Zayn lights up a 'joint' as he and Louis . Tomlinson are driven to their gig in Lima, Peru last month . Fans have also decided to burn or rip up gig tickets over the film where Zayn blows smoke into a camera and Louis laughs about having an 'illegal substance' on their tour bus in Lima, Peru, last month. A Viagogo spokesman said: 'One Direction are a global . phenomenon and in the past Directioners have been some of the most . dedicated fans in the world. 'The boys are considered role models, but . the question is whether this latest controversy will affect the . boyband’s squeaky clean image, as fans – and their parents alike– turn . to reselling their tickets'. He added many 'bargain' tickets are now on sale at 'half the box office price'. The . band has just returned from South America and played the . Stadium of Light in Sunderland last night. The tour then heads to Manchester for three dates starting tomorrow at the Etihad stadium before a night at Murrayfield in Edinburgh. It will culminate in three-nights at Wembley Stadium in early June. They are then . scheduled to head back over the Atlantic to Canada and North America in . August, although with allegations of illegal drug taking, they could be . banned from entering. The 'joint' video is said to have upset band mate Harry Styles, who has hit out at Zayn and Louis for their ‘reckless and stupid’ behaviour. He is said to fear the consequences for the band if the pair are blocked at the U.S. border because 'Everything is about America. It would be a disaster if Zayn and Louis had problems', an insider told The Sun. Bandmembers Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson last night as they joined the rest of the group for a gig in Sunderland, but parents outside admitted their clean-cut image was now tarnished . Upset: Some One Direction fans have said they have destroyed or sold tickets because they are angry about the video . Message: This tweet reflects some of the anger online at the 'irresponsible' actions of Zayn and Louis in Peru . Emotional: Fans who 'love the band' have been left disappointed by the 'joint' incident . It has also emerged Harry has chosen to . fly in a different private jet to Zayn because he does not like his . smoking, a source said, amid long-running rumours he would also like a solo career. Parents of fans outside their SUnderland gig last night said they 'could kill' the pair for their actions and accused them of abandoning responsibility as role models to millions of children. Drugs charities said they feared the film would encourage young people to try illegal substances. In the shocking film Louis . Tomlinson, 22, narrates from behind the camera, laughingly announcing, . ‘So here we are, leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days!’ ‘What . do you think about that kind of content?’ he asks bandmate Zayn Malik, . 21, who is alongside him in the SUV ferrying them to Peru’s Estadio . Nacional in Lima where One Direction performed to a 40,000 capacity . crowd on April 27 as part of their 'Where We Are' tour. ‘Very controversial,’ Zayn responds. During the . 15-minute journey Louis and Zayn joke with each other and the three . members of their team travelling with them. Liam Payne, Harry Styles and . Niall Horan, all 20, are not in the car but presumably elsewhere in the . band’s convoy making its way through the streets. Louis . starts filming while the team prepare to leave. Overhearing discussions . between what appears to be a member of the band’s security and the . driver he says with delight, ‘It’s about the joint. What a great thing . to capture in a different language. They were just asking if it’s okay.’ A member of the team asks about the filming: ‘Are we allowed to talk contraband in this?’ Louis replies: 'Yes, that's what it is about.' Taking . in the sights and smells: At one point, Louis pans to the streets and . says he's capturing the local culture. He then focuses back on the roll . up cigarette and asks 'How's that kind of culture?' 'Stubbsy!' Louis exclaims happily when passed the roll up cigarette as he holds it very close to the camera . Passed around: Zayn gives the cigarette to one of his minders in the SUV, who later passes it to Louis . Driving . into the sunlight from an underground parking lot, Louis says, ‘I want . to light up,’ and a member of the team hands him a lighter and the . flicker of a roll up being lit is caught on camera. The sight . of a police officer on a motorbike escorting them, is met with great . excitement. Louis notes: ‘That’s the police. That’s the po po. One-nil.’ He coughs and a cloud of smoke, floats across the camera lens and Louis . yells, ‘Smokescreen baby!’ Later in the video, Louis pans to a police motorcyclist just yards away. Louis giggles, ‘One nil b***h! Look at this b***h! He’s . having a look. He’s thinking, “I’m sure I can smell an illegal . substance in there.” And he’s hit the nail on the head. One Direction faced mounting pressure to apologise today after it emerged they had inspired young fans to experiment with drugs. Children as young as 11 vowed on social networking sites to try cannabis for the first time, saying one of the band members looked ‘hot’ while doing so. Drug campaigners reacted with fury after the boy band still refused to say sorry, despite facing an almighty backlash from fans, parents and politicians. One drug charity branded the boys ‘stupid young men dicing with death’ and said it was ‘horrendous’ they had not yet apologised or showed any remorse for their actions. Anger: Critics have urged One Direction's two members to apologise because they fear the 'joint' video will encourage children and teenagers to try drugs . Admission: Young people have taken to Twitter to admit they now want to try 'weed' Just hours after MailOnline published footage of Louis Tomlinson, 22, and Zayn Malik, 21, smoking a ‘joint’ before performing on tour in South America last month, they were back on stage in the UK. On Wednesday the band played at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland, on the first leg of their two-week tour across the country. Although Tomlinson appeared tired and weary on stage– having allegedly struggled to sleep since the fallout – he showed no signs of regret to the thousands of screaming young girls in the crowd. Malik barely said a word during the 90-minute performance. After seeing the footage, fans began tweeting using the hashtag #zouispassmethatblunt – an amalgamation of the boys’ names followed by another term for a ‘joint’. One fan wrote: ‘I just turned 11 and idk (I don’t know) what a blunt is but I wanna (sic) smoke it #zouispassmethatblunt.’ Another tweeted: ‘I know that marijuana isn't good for us specifically to us teenagers but damn I want to try smoking weed with them.’ Concerns: Children as young as 11 have said online that they also want to smoke . Warning: Experts said today: 'They have a very young fan base, and these young people just don’t know the damage smoking cannabis can cause' Anthika wrote: ‘Zayn smoking weed is hot. I wana try weed one day.’ A girl named Tina added: ‘I want to try smoking weed with the boys i wanna know what it feels to be high.’ But despite the Mail today making the band aware of the potentially harmful effect their actions have had on their young fans, they remained silent. A One Direction spokesman said their only comment was still: ‘This matter is in the hands of our lawyers.’ Lucy Dawe, a spokesman for charity Skunk Sense, told the Mail: ‘It is horrendous that One Direction have not said they are sorry for their behaviour. ‘They have a very young fan base, and these young people just don’t know the damage smoking cannabis can cause. ‘They should certainly apologise, they are in a position where they could be a really good role model for young people. ‘They’ve got these young people that are hanging onto every word they say and instead of showing them how to behave, they are being the worst role models they could possibly be and encouraging young people to do something that could seriously damage their health. ‘It is absolutely devastating. The young girls have absolutely no clue of the dangers of cannabis. They are stupid young men, dicing with death.’ One girl, who had never tried weed, said she believed the band were ‘old enough’ to know what was good for them. She wrote on Twitter:  ‘all d s*** going over abt @Louis_Tomlinson n @zaynmalik smoking weed...I ve never done it tho I think dey r old enough to think wats gud.’ Another wrote:  ‘but i actually want to try smoking weed i wanna know how it feels’ One girl added: ‘so my parents just told me if i want to try weed because one direction do weed that i should do it in front of them HAHAHAHAHA.’","Seats for upcoming Manchester gig now changing hands for just £15 .

"By . Sam Dunn . Revenue inspectors are using Google maps to spy on homes and trap suspected tax dodgers. Images from Google Earth, which allows users to zoom in on satellite views of properties, give the taxman clues about lifestyles and wealth, such as cars and home improvements. Officials at HM Revenue & Customs will feed the data into a supercomputer to try to decide whether to investigate homeowners already believed to be paying too little tax. Zooming in on tax evasion: Images from Google Earth, which allows users to zoom in on satellite views of properties, give the taxman clues about lifestyles and wealth, such as cars and home improvements . Google Earth is the latest weapon in HMRC’s battle to close a £35billion gap between what it believes individuals and companies owe and the tax that is actually collected. It says tax evasion and the hidden economy – customers not paying VAT on home repairs, for example – cost the UK taxpayer £9billion a year. HMRC has spent nearly £1billion over the past three years trying to enforce the rules. Over the past 18 months, it has set up dozens of taskforces to probe the tax receipts and business practices of industries as diverse as restaurants, private cab firms, hairdressers, outdoor markets, car dealerships and even Avon Ladies. It has also spent £50million on the supercomputer, which is called Connect. Created by defence giant BAE Systems three years ago, it now holds more than a billion pieces of information about any taxpayers it suspects of not declaring everything that they owe. It includes tax payment records, interest on bank accounts, details of any properties owned, loans, job history and electoral records. Paul Aplin, tax partner at accountants AC Mole, said: ‘The Revenue can use Google Earth to look for clues. This could include for your lifestyle, such as cars outside your home, or to look at the state of renovations or repairs to check they’re as described on tax forms. ‘We’ve even seen cases where tax inspectors zoom in on aerial images of a caravan park belonging to a businessman – to check the number of properties against the amount of income being declared. ‘The sheer amount of digital information the taxman can now have on you is nothing short of phenomenal.’ Tax officials also add in extra details from searches on social media sites such as Facebook. Bragging about a brand new car or exotic holiday can flag up a warning – and trigger an inquiry. As well as Google Earth, Revenue inspectors are using a kerbside view of homes and businesses known as Google Street View to track cheats. Be careful what you share: Tax officials also add in extra details from searches on social media sites such as Facebook. Bragging about a brand new car or exotic holiday can flag up a warning ¿ and trigger an inquiry . Elaine Clark, of Cheapaccounting.co.uk, said: ‘In fragile economic times, closing in on those suspected of not paying what they owe is an efficient way of boosting tax revenues. ‘But some may worry it is overly intrusive, and it only works as long as they don’t wrongly pick on those self-employed who are innocent.’ An HMRC spokesman said: ‘The vast majority of people and businesses play by the rules and on their behalf we are coming down hard on cheats.’ Offenders can be made to pay what they owe, with interest and a big fine. Jail is also an option.","Officials will feed data into a supercomputer to investigate taxpayers .

"By . Martha Cliff . A hospital worker has shed three stone in just three months in a bid to look like her favourite soap star, Jennifer Ellison. Jade Gibbs, 25, who had always struggled with her weight, was inspired towards a svelte figure after seeing Jennifer Ellison's success in fighting her flab. Gibbs, from Brighton, said she was a self-confessed Diet Coke fan and would guzzle three litres of the drink a day - as well as eating junk food - and ballooned to a size 16. Jennifer (left) and Jade (right) have both shrunk down to a healthy size ten following their matching diets . Jade Gibbs was inspired to lose a hefty three stone after seeing her favourite soap star's success . Her weight soared to 12 stone 6lbs, which was overweight for her 5ft 1in frame. Jade said: 'I’ve . always thought Jennifer Ellison was gorgeous and when she lost weight I . thought I could only ever dream of looking like that.' After seeing the Brookside star's weight loss success using the Cambridge Weight Plan, Jade was determined to make it work. 'I was inspired by Jennifer Ellison. I thought if she has managed to lose all that weight, I can too.' Jade's weight struggle began when she was working night shifts at the Royal Sussex County Hospital. She would scoff on convenient yet calorific sandwiches, crisps and chocolate and would even tuck into food brought in as a thank you by patients' families. Before her dramatic weight loss Jade, pictured with fiance Tom, weighed more than 12 stone . Jade always admired the way Jennifer Ellison (right) looked and hoped she could look as good as the actress . Rather than face up to her unhealthy habits, Jade, then a size 16, lived in denial and avoided the subject completely. 'Deep down I knew I was putting on weight but I couldn’t bear the thought of it so I banned the scales and didn’t weigh myself,' she said. 'As my clothes got tighter I went into denial. I used every excuse possible to justify my weight gain, from the shop sizing being wrong, to saying I was a size 12 - even though deep down I knew I was nearer a 16. 'The more I told people the more I believed it.' In denial: Jade said she would squeeze into smaller dress sizes rather than admit she was a size 16 . Jade noticed her weight gain once her clothes began to get tighter and she began to wear baggier outfits . Jade became more and more self concious about her weight and began to worry about what other people may think. 'I wasn’t confident at all and I used to be paranoid that people were staring at me and saying things about my weight in the street. 'I used to hide myself under unflatterly black and baggy clothes which is not what a young woman in her 20s wants to be wearing.' Jade did attempt to lose weight but admits that she was a yo-yo dieter and would start a crash diet before getting bored and bingeing on her favourite food. 'It was a vicious cycle and I was always using the classic excuse ""the diet starting on Monday"".' But it was Jennifer Ellison who finally motivated Jade to lose a three stone in just three months. Before she lost weight: Jennifer Ellison followed the Cambridge plan help her drop to a size 10 . 'I had no idea how I was going to try and lose the weight until I came across some pictures of Jennifer Ellison. 'I followed her on Twitter and think she is gorgeous. I saw she posted lots of pictures about her weight loss and it really inspired me.' Instead of her regular diet of high fat and salty foods, Jade took after Jennifer and gave the Cambridge Weight Plan a go. She swapped crisps, sandwiches and chocolate for three soups, shakes, and porridge meals a day as well as swapping her beloved diet coke for three litres of water. Jade is now a slender 9 stone 5lb, having dropped three dress sizes and now fitting comfortably into a size 10, which matches Ellison's size. Since reaching her goal weight Jade and fiance Tom (pictured) have started planning their wedding in Mexico . 'I cannot . express what an amazing journey Cambridge has been,' says Jade, 'since the age of 15 . I've never been below 10st 5lbs so to be in the 9 stone bracket is a . dream come true. 'I am delighted to be a size 10 in my favourite stores and I finally feel confident and comfortable in myself.' For Jade her weight loss has been life changing and has even encouraged her to finally make plans to get married. 'I am so much happier now. I have been planning my wedding with my fiance.' Jade who is engaged to 26-year-old Tom Lawson, will get married in Mexico in September. 'Tom has been so supportive and is so pleased that I am happier with my weight. 'I didn’t want to be a fat bride and now I don’t have to be.I can now look forward to feeling and hopefully looking amazing in my dream wedding dress. 'I . can’t wait to wear a bikini on the beach and feel body confident for . the first time in my life, without covering up with the usual sarong or . kaftan.'","12-stone Jade Gibbs was inspired by Brookside star Jennifer Ellison .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ministers are wasting £25million a year keeping foreign prisoners locked up after they have served their prison sentences, the Government has admitted. Almost 1,000 overseas offenders who have served their time are still behind bars because they cannot be deported, new figures have revealed. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said the average length of time these foreign criminals stay in the UK after serving their sentence is almost nine months. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has attacked human rights laws for blocking the government's ability to deport foreign criminals and has suggested that the Tory manifesto will promise to scrap the human rights act . Officials are often unable to deport the offenders - who include rapists, paedophiles and murderers - because of human rights laws protecting their right to a family life. Ten of the offenders have been able to stay in Britain for more than five years, Mr Harper said. The failure to deport foreign criminals immediately after their sentence is costing taxpayers £30,000 a year for every offender - or £25million a year in total. The revelation sparked anger among Tory backbenchers, while Labour accused David Cameron of 'incompetence'. Overall, the number of foreign offenders awaiting deportation has risen by two thirds under the Coalition, from 491 to 850 . Tory MP Dominic Raab attacked the revelation. He said: 'We need to get rid of them, it is crazy. What you are effectively seeing is a huge increase in risk because we are failing to remove people who are obviously dangerous. 'It is a perversion of the law and frankly to the average person it looks like a total lack of common sense.' The figures emerged in parliamentary answer to Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan. Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan accused the Government of incompetence after it emerged David Cameron had overseen a huge rise in the number of foreign criminals languishing in jail awaiting deportation . A total of 35 foreign prisoners have remained in jail for between two and five years, 100 for between one and two years and 705 for a year or less. Mr Khan said: 'British jails are seriously overcrowded and rammed to overflowing. Yet data I’ve uncovered shows 850 foreign criminals who could be deported are clogging up prisons because of this Government’s incompetence. 'That’s the equivalent of two decent sized prisons just to hold criminals who should have been deported. The Government are offering words where there should be action and appear to have thrown the towel in on this. It will be left to Labour to act and deport these foreign criminals.' Ministers are introducing legislation which will mean that criminals are deported first and that their appeals are then heard abroad to end the 'never-ending game of snakes and ladders' under the current immigration system. The Conservatives are also expected to pledge to scrap the Human Rights Act as in the party's manifesto for the 2015 election and replace it with a British bill of rights. Offenders from the European Union can be deported if they are sentenced to two year jail sentences unless they have committed drugs offences or sexual crimes, in which case they can be deported if they are jailed for one year. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Those who come to the UK must abide by our laws and where they do not, we will take the necessary steps to deport them. 'We make every effort to ensure that an offender’s removal coincides with the completion of their sentence. Detention may be prolonged if an individual refuses to co-operate with the removal process or raises last minute challenges or there are difficulties obtaining the necessary travel documentation. 'Through the Immigration Act we are making it harder for those with no right to be here to avoid removal from the UK. It will cut the number of appeal rights from 17 to four and allow us to remove people while their appeals are ongoing.'","Hundreds of overseas offenders still in British jails despite serving sentence .

"Documents are reported to have been obtained that prove that a former member of FIFA's executive committee made payments totalling £3million to senior football officials in return for support for Qatar's successful bid for the 2022 World Cup. Under a front-page headline of 'Plot to buy the World Cup,' The Sunday Times alleges that Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari who used to be a FIFA vice president, was lobbying on his country's behalf ahead of the vote in December 2010. Claims: The Sunday Times claims to have documents that prove Mohamed bin Hammam made payments to officials to get support for Qatar's successful World Cup bid . Hosts: Qatar held off competition from Australia to win the rights to host the 2022 World Cup . Rivals: Bin Hammam (right) tried to run against Sepp Blatter (left) for FIFA president but withdrew following allegations of bribery . The newspaper alleges that Bin Hammam made dozens of payments to top football officials in Africa as well as Jack Warner and Reynald Temarii, former FIFA executive committee members for CONCACAF and Oceania. The allegations come less than two weeks before the start of the World Cup in Brazil and bring fresh scrutiny on the 2010 vote, which awarded football's biggest tournament to the tiny desert state and currently is under investigation by FIFA's independent ethics prosecutor. The Sunday Times said that Bin Hamman declined to respond to the allegations and that members of Qatar's bid committee denied any link to the former FIFA official, saying he played no secret role in their campaign. Qatari organizers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bin Hammam, one of the most controversial figures in FIFA's recent history, is no longer a committee member of world football's governing body after being caught up in a corruption scandal surrounding his failed campaign for its presidency in 2011. Bribes: Former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner (left) and Bin Hamman (right) faced allegations of bribery surrounding the 2011 FIFA presidential elections . FIFA: Bin Hammam (left) and Blatter (right) at Doha airport in 2010 . Pressure: FIFA has come under scrutiny since awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar . The Sunday Times is alleging, however, that he exploited his position at the heart of FIFA when he was an executive committee member to help to secure votes from key members of its 24-man ruling committee that helped Qatar win the right to host the World Cup. Qatar defeated bids from the United States, Japan, South Korea and Australia. According to the newspaper, Bin Hammam used 10 slush funds controlled by his private company and cash handouts to make dozens of payments of up to $200,000 into accounts controlled by the presidents of 30 African football associations who influenced how the continent's four executive members would vote. He also allegedly hosted lavish junkets for these African officials at which he handed out almost $400,000 in cash. Sepp Blatter at the Messe Conference Centre in Zurich where he announced Qatar would host the World Cup . World Cup? There have been suggestions that a re-vote will be required after these new allegations . The newspaper says the documents show that Bin Hammam paid out at least 305,000 euros ($415,000) in legal and private detective fees for Temarii after he was suspended for telling undercover reporters that he had been offered $12 million for his vote. Bin Hammam's help allowed him to appeal the suspension and prevent his planned replacement from voting for Australia in the vote, the Sunday Times claimed. Bin Hammam is also accused of funneling more than $1.6 million directly into bank accounts controlled by Warner, including $450,000 before the vote. Warner resigned from football duties, including his 28-year membership of FIFA's committee, in June 2011 to avoid investigation in a bribery scandal linked to Bin Hammam's campaign for FIFA president. The Sunday Times also said Bin Hammam paid $800,000 to the Ivory Coast FA, whose executive committee member Jacques Anouma agreed to ""push very hard the bid of Qatar,"" and signed off on two payments of $400,000 each to the federations of two other voters.

The patrols began in the city just hours earlier after Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man, urged . steelworkers at his factories to help police 'restore order' - giving . residents hope that the latest wave of anarchy was over. Akhmetov's company, Metinvest, agreed with steel plant directors, police and community leaders to help improve security in Mariupol - which is one of two regions that has declared independence from the central government - and get insurgents to vacate the buildings. A representative of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, which had declared independence, was also a party to the deal. German . Mandrakov, once the commander of Mariupol's occupied government . building, said his associates fled while he was ‘forced’ to leave the . building they had controlled for weeks. ‘Everyone . ran away,’ he said. ‘Someone is trying to sow discord among us, someone . has signed something, but we will continue our fight.’ Several . dozen Metinvest workers, wearing overalls and helmets, cleared out . barricades of rubbish and tyres outside the city hall building before . trucks carried it away.

Several dozen Metinvest workers, wearing overalls and helmets, cleared out barricades made of rubbish and tyres outside the City Hall building before trucks carried it away . The White House approved of today's move with spokesman Jay Carney describing it as a 'welcome development'. The move is a setback to forces that have . established footholds in eastern Ukraine and are opposed to the interim . Ukrainian government in Kiev. Carney said a halt to destabilising . activities, such as the seizure of buildings, was a good development in . the tense situation between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine police spokesman Yulia Lafazan said there were now 100 groups of . men consisting of two policemen and six to eight steelworkers . patrolling Mariupol. Lafazan credited the patrols for a ‘drastic improvement’ in the city's crime rate.

The White House approved of today's move with spokesman Jay Carney describing it as a 'welcome development' The city has seen heavy fighting in the last few weeks, including a shoot-out outside a police station that left one policeman and several insurgents dead. Steelworker Alexander Zhigula said he volunteered to help because ‘someone has to bring order back to the streets.’ ‘The city is sick of crime and chaos,’ he said. ‘People can finally see that they've got someone to rely on.’ Valentyna Tochilina, a 47-year-old resident, said she was relieved to see the insurgents disappear from the streets. ‘For the first time (in weeks), I can go out shopping without fear,’ she said.

Local patrols by steelworkers have forced pro-Russia insurgents to retreat from the government buildings they had seized in eastern Ukraine . In other areas in eastern Ukraine, however, the pro-Russia insurgents continue to fortify their territories. Outside the strategic city of Slovyansk, an insurgent stronghold for more than a month now, armed separatists installed a new checkpoint on the eastern approaches to the city. The checkpoint blocks a major highway that links Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city - with the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don across the border. Mariupol is the second-largest city in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region,  one of two regions that declared independence Monday from the central government in Kiev . Workers of the Ukrainian company Metinvest are helping police restore order to the streets of the city . Earlier, Ukraine's acting President . Oleksandr Turchynov urged residents of the eastern regions to stop . helping the separatists and support the central government. ‘You've . got to support the anti-terrorist operation so that we could defeat . terrorists and separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk regions together,’ he . told parliament. ‘The actions of the terrorists are threatening lives and welfare of the people.’ BY WILL STEWART . Europe is ‘sleepwalking’ into war with Russia over Ukraine, Germany’s elder statesman has warned. Former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, 95, said the Ukraine crisis is ‘increasingly comparable’ to the period leading up to the First World War and blamed the European Commission and NATO for misreading the worst east-west tension since the end of the Cold War. Mr Schmidt, who led West Germany from 1974 until 1982, said ‘the situation to me seems increasingly comparable’ to the eve of war exactly a century ago. Workers of the Metinvest clear away debris in a government building in the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol . ‘I think very little of talking up the threat of World War III, and especially of demands for more money to arm NATO,’ he told Bild daily. ‘But the danger that the situation gets ever more tense, as it did in August 1914, is growing day by day. ‘Europe, the Americans and also the Russians are acting the way author Christopher Clark describes the start of World War I in his book, like “sleepwalkers”.’ The best-selling novel The Sleepwalkers, by the Australian historian, re-evaluates the eve of the First World War, focusing on how clueless the leaders of Europe’s great powers were about the carnage of the industrialised war that would follow. Warning that EU commissioners ‘understand very little’, he stated: ‘The latest example is the attempt of the European Commission to annex Ukraine, and also to try to draw in Georgia. ‘Just a reminder: Georgia lies outside of Europe. This is megalomania, we have no business being there.’ Ukraine police spokesman Yulia Lafazan said there were now 100 groups of men patrolling Mariupol, including two policemen and six to eight steelworkers . In Brussels, officials had blundered by ‘confronting Ukraine with the apparent choice of having to choose between West and East’, he said. He called on MEPs to grab back power from the commissioners. The statesman’s blast came as the United Nations warned of an ‘alarming deterioration' of human rights in eastern Ukraine. A report warned of a litany of ‘targeted killings, torture and beatings, abductions, intimidation and some cases of sexual harassment’, carried out by anti-government groups in the east. The devastating report comes ahead of the May 25 presidential election in Ukraine, which pro-Russians are seeking to disrupt, according to the West and the Kiev government. In a clear reference to Moscow, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, called on those with influence on armed groups in the east ‘to do their utmost to rein in these men who seem bent on tearing the country apart’. Residents have spoken of their relief to see the insurgents disappear from the streets . She also voiced deep concern about ‘serious problems’ of harassment and intimidation facing the Tatar community in Crimea, which was taken over by Russia in the face of international outrage. Vladimir Putin has acted to ‘rehabilitate’ the Muslim population for the repression under Stalin and said yesterday it would lead to improvements for this group in Crimea, annexed by Russia. However, Moscow castigated the UN report for ‘total absence of objectivity, the flagrant irregularities and the double standards leave no doubt that the authors have carried out a political order on whitewashing the self-declared authorities in Kiev’. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said it was ‘deeply regrettable’ that the UN report ‘justifies the criminal punitive operation in southeastern Ukraine’ while ignoring pro-Russian victims in the spiralling conflict.","Pro-Russian insurgents flee city hall building in Mariupol, Ukraine .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . One in three hospital consultants is now trained overseas, a report reveals. The figure, a record high, is up from about one in four a decade ago and exposes the continual reliance of foreign medical staff in the NHS. Senior medics in UK hospitals come from at least 108 countries – and the figure may be even higher, according to a House of Lords report. The revelation comes amid warnings that patients are being put at risk because of language problems, poor training and a lack of understanding of British culture. Senior medics in UK hospitals come from at least 108 countries - and the figure may be even higher, according to a House of Lords report . In September 2002, some 6,213 of the NHS’s 26,408 consultants came from overseas – a proportion of 23.5 per cent. Ten years on, 13,208 of the 39,409 consultants in state-run hospitals are trained abroad – a new high of 33.5 per cent. It means the number of foreign consultants has now soared by 112.3 per cent, while the numbers of their UK-trained colleagues has risen by just 29.7 per cent. The figures, revealed in a  parliamentary question answered by health minister Earl Howe, also showed how NHS consultants were trained in at least 108 different countries. The highest number come from India, with 5,122 – one in eight – trained on the sub-continent. Pakistan is next with 904 consultants, followed by Ireland on 848. South Africa provides 765 consultants, Nigeria 576, Egypt 556 and Germany 506. There are now 408 Iraqi consultants working in the health service, 353 from Sri Lanka and 246 from Australia. More . and more doctors from debt-hit southern European countries still . reeling from the euro crisis have also started working in the NHS. Some 238 are from Italy, 205 from Spain and 189 from Greece. Another 186 were trained in Poland. A total of 204 consultants do not have their country of origin recorded, meaning the total number of countries could be higher than 108. What is it about the Government that they can't train enough doctors here? - Douglas Carswell . There are also 133 consultants from what is described as ‘West Indies associated states’, which includes a group of independent countries such as Antigua, Dominica, Grenada and Saint Lucia. Leading cancer surgeon J Meirion Thomas recently condemned the ‘scandal’ of high numbers of foreign consultants when hundreds of eligible British students are turned down at over-subscribed UK medical schools. Far too many had poor language skills, knew nothing about British culture and had not received rigorous and up-to-date training in their own country, he said. He quoted a General Medical Council survey that said foreign-trained doctors were up to four times more likely to be suspended or struck off than their UK colleagues. Last night Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘I’d rather be treated by a doctor born overseas than no doctor at all. But there is a chronic shortage of doctors in this country, so what is it about the Government that they can’t train enough here?’ A Labour source said recruiting from overseas is ‘incredibly expensive and often short-sighted’. The Department for Health said the new training body, Health Education England, would ensure more UK-trained doctors to ensure a more ‘self-sufficient NHS’.","Senior medics in UK hospitals now come from at least 108 countries .

"By . Dan Bloom . A monster female Great White who is so notorious she has been nicknamed Joan of Shark has forced the closure of a popular beach. The beast - the largest ever tagged in Australia - is more than 16ft long, weighs around 1.6 tonnes and is believed to have made more than a dozen appearances in the last month. A photo taken by scientists reveals the moment they won a two-hour struggle to roll Joan onto her back and insert a sophisticated electronic tagging device into her gut. Scroll down for video . Just when you thought it was safe: 'Joan of Shark', who has been tagged once before, has reappeared off the coast of Albany, Western Australia, prompting a popular beach to be closed. She is more than 16ft long . Only some of the enormous animal was visible as a looming figure underneath the boat - and one of her giant fins was almost as large as the scientist tagging her. Mark Kleeman from the Department of Fisheries told ABC Great Southern: 'The shark [was] upside down, which induces a state called tonic immobility. In a sense, the shark basically goes to sleep.' Once she was rolled back over, he said, 'the shark came almost instantaneously back to life so she was quickly released, and she swam off very strongly.' The shark believed to be Joan was then registered multiple times off the coast of Albany, Western Australia, including nine times on Saturday alone. Popular Middleton beach had to be closed after the string of sightings, which were believed to have been prompted by a dying whale calf which had washed up on the sand. Scientists said the whale calf's distress signals and later, smells and blood, would have attracted Joan - who has been tagged once before - to the scene. Sighting: The shark has made several appearances at Ellen Cove on the coast of Western Australia . Ellen Cove, a popular part of Middleton beach, had to be closed after the string of sightings, which were believed to have been prompted by a dying whale calf which had washed up on the sand . Since then Joan has been spotted . again as recently as today, when she triggered receivers at Albany's . Ellen Cove just before 6am. A . Department of Fisheries spokesman said on Saturday: '​After nine . detections of a tagged white shark early today, the Department of . Fisheries is advising water users at Middleton beach to exercise . additional caution. Middleton beach has been closed by the City of . Albany. 'The detections . occurred over the period from 3.55am to 7.22am.  The shark was detected . by a receiver that forms part of the State Government’s Shark Monitoring . Network. 'Water users should adhere to any beach closures advised by your local government rangers or Surf Life Saving WA. 'They . should also exercise caution when entering the water at South Coast . beaches and we encourage them to use patrolled beaches at all times.' Fisherman were reportedly the source of the nickname Joan of Shark, given in tribute to the 1400s French fighter Joan of Arc. Danger: Authorities said swimmers should be cautious and only use patrolled beaches (file photo) She was just 19 when she was burned at the stake by the English during the Hundred Years' War after helping lift the siege of Orléans in just nine days. She was later made a saint. Her shark namesake, meanwhile, is one of several being tracked by Western Australia's Department of Fisheries using satellite data and hundreds of monitors on the sea bed. Updates are sent live via Twitter to swimmers and surfers, who have every reason to be cautious. A series of maulings, some of which were fatal, prompted authorities in Western Australia to set up a shark cull and spend almost $4million improving their warning systems. A Shark Response Unit was formed in 2012 and last week authorities asked to extend their culling programme for another three years. The rules allow officials to kill and dump the bodies of any Great White, tiger or bull shark more than 10ft long after catching them using baited lines out to sea.","Female measuring more than 16ft long was tagged in Albany last month .

"By . Bianca London . A hilarious new video showing what life would be like if we employed Tinder's tactics in the real world has gone viral. The short film, made by Danish filmmaker Rolf Glumsoe Nielson, conveys a world where a simple swipe can knock people out of sight based on their appearance - just like the app. Tinder, which helps users browse all the single people in one area, has become one of the most downloaded apps of the year. Real life Tinder: A new short film shows a woman employing the dating app's tactics in real life . Swiping to the left means not interested, swiping to . the right is a yes. If two people swipe to the right on . each other's profiles, they are automatically connected to a private chatroom where further information can be exchanged. This is portrayed in the new video, which sees a young blonde woman sauntering around a public place scouting for potential men. But as she passes them and realises she isn't interested, she quickly swipes them left as the words 'nope' appear on the screen - just like they do on the app. Some of the men can be seen flying across the room as the lyrics 'to the left, to the left' from Beyonce's song Irreplaceable can be heard. Imagine if...The film shows a man checking out a woman but clearly not interested, she simply swipes him out of sight . Unlucky! Just as the woman finds a man she likes the look of and swipes right, he sends her flying left; an accurate depiction of Tinder .

Founder and CEO Sean Rad claims the apps success is down to it being 'like the real world but better'. He also told users that the profile picture was key - and that 'headshots don't work' on the site. Speaking at Upfront Summit in Los . Angeles, Rad said Tinder started about a year and half ago because . friends realized they were having trouble meeting people. He told the conference 'In the real world we send out signals subconsciously to people if we're interested or not,' Success: Dating app Tinder is now matching 5 million . people per day, and users are swiping through 750 million profiles a . day, its founder has revealed.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A dramatic rescue successfully pulled two men off a maintenance scaffold 45 stories above Manhattan that folded in half, trapping them. For about an hour and a half, two maintenance workers dangled nearly 600 feet in the air, pinned to the side of the iconic Hearst Tower when their rigging bent in a a v-shape around 2:40pm Wednesday. New York Fire Department officials were on the scene immediately, securing the men with safety rope. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Daring rescue: Two men hung from window washing scaffolding after their equipment bent in two while working on Midtown Manhattan's Hearst Tower. Rescue workers look down at them from the roof 46 stories up . A day's work: The men remained calm throughout the ordeal, though it lasted an hour and a half. Here, they can be seen on either side of the buckled platform . The quick-thinking rescue lasted for under two hours. At which point the men, named Victor and Steve, were pulled from the rig through windows that were cut open by rescue workers 44 floors up at around 4:15pm. A four foot by four foot section of the thick glass was cut through using special tools. 'Once we secured them from the roof, we cut the glass, other members lowered me out onto the scaffolding,' said FDNY firefighter Tom Gayron at a press conference. 'I assisted the members back into the building.' One on each side of the bent scaffold, the two men remained impressively calm throughout the ordeal. Not surprisingly, since they routinely dangle from hundreds of feet up as part of their everyday job. Brave: New York Fire Department officials responded immediately after the scaffold failed at 2:40pm. They immediately secured each maintenance worker and remained at the top of the building throughout he ordeal . Blocked: Officials closed the streets and sidewalks below the tower as a safety precaution. Here, passersby get as close as possible to gawk at the action . Spectacle: Down below, people watch and pray as the scaffold folded and hung there for an hour and a half as two men waited to be rescued . Midtown Manhattan: The drama occurred at the Hearst Tower in over the bustling streets of Midtown Manhattan . One spoke on a cell phone while he . stood. The other appeared to remain in a more seated position . for most of the ordeal. Rescue workers later said the men were even smiling once first responders arrived, believing from that moment everything was going to be fine. The scaffolding is designed to fold in the middle, but may have failed to lock properly at the time it was lowered. The men, a 26-year-old from the Bronx and a 49-year-old Brooklyn man, were nearly at the top of the 46 floor high tower. Old hat: Rescuers trained in 'high angle rescues,' situations they called 'just like this,' were on the scene and helped pull the two men inside . From up above, workers secured the men as they try to rescue them from the snapped scaffold 45 floors above the streets of Manhattan . Precipitous: The men were pulled from the rig after rescuers cut holes into windows some 45 floors up . Meanwhile, the scaffolding itself remained hanging dangerously from the side of the tower. Asst. Fire Chief William Seelig said the men were in no danger of falling once they were secured with safety ropes. The men were immediately examined by EMS inside the building and appeared to be in good condition. 'They were all smiles, thankfully,' said FDNY paramedic Moses Nelson. 'No major injuries, no complaints.' High up: Hearst Tower clocks in at around 600 feet, with 46 floors. The men hung right at the 45th . Communication: The men were standing and one spoke on a cellphone during the rescue - they remained impressively calm .

"He scored the goal that decided the £134million play-off final at Wembley, but Bobby Zamora is set to be placed on the scrapheap by QPR. The striker, 33, scored the dramatic late winner against Derby at Wembley last weekend, but Sportsmail has learned that QPR are planning life without him in the top flight. Zamora had scored only three goals all season for QPR after another injury-ravaged campaign, when he was involved in only 21 games in all competitions. On his way: Bobby Zamora is set to leave QPR despite sealing their return to the Premier League . Golden goal: The former England international scored to seal a 1-0 win against Derby in the Championship play-off final at Wembley . With Rangers looking to reduce their wage bill – Zamora is thought to be earning around £60,000-a-week – they have decided he is surplus to requirements. This is expected to be confirmed in Friday’s transfer planning meeting when their budget and strategy for the new season will be confirmed. Former Brighton, Tottenham, West Ham and Fulham striker Zamora has cost more than £12million in transfer fees in his career. The Barking-born forward was also picked twice for England. After scoring against Derby on Saturday, he said: ‘My contract is up so we’ll see what happens. It would be nice to stay. 'I’ve been good enough to play for England. Fabio Capello does not pick idiots. I still believe I am a Premier League player.’ Planning ahead: News of Zamora's future will be confirmed when QPR chiefs finalise their transfer plans on Friday . QPR have since decided that his future is destined to be elsewhere. A source close to the striker said: ‘Bobby feels he can still do a job in the top flight and will be interested to see who else comes in for him. He is keeping his options open.’ Scoring the winner for QPR is the second time Zamora has decided a play-off final, having scored the winner for West Ham against Preston in 2004. ‘Bobby scores important goals,’ said the source. ‘When he is fit, he will deliver in the box, as he showed at Wembley.’ Options: The former Tottenham, West Ham and Fulham forward believes he can still do a job in the Premier League .

While you may not have heard of author Lois Duncan or the tragic and unsolved murder of her 18-year-old daughter in 1989, you definitely know the 1997 cult movie, I Know What You Did Last Summer. Written by Duncan, 80, in 1973, the hit, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar, spawned sequels and spoofs as the 90s most memorable horror film, along with Scream. Despite the success of her fiction, in reality, Duncan has been battling for the past 25-years to discover the truth behind her girl, Kaitlyn's death in Albuquerque, New Mexico - a journey which has taken her to the doors of organized crime and a possible police cover-up. Indeed, as . life began to imitate art, Duncan's dogged pursuit of the truth of her . daughter's murder began on the night of July 16th, 1989. Her . teenage daughter had just graduated high school and left a girlfriend's . house in her 1984 Ford Tempo at 10.45pm. after watching Valley Girl. Kaitlyn, . who had just been accepted into the University of New Mexico to study . medicine braked as she approached a railway crossing in Albuquerque at . around 10.45pm. Suddenly . she was shot twice, once through the temple and once through the cheek . by a shooter who opened fire on the driver's side of the vehicle. She was rushed to hospital, placed on life support and put into a medically induced coma. Sadly, she died the next day and for the past quarter century, Duncan has used all her amateur sleuth skills to decipher any possible suspects and motives related to the act. The official police investigation determined that the lethal assault was a random act of violence, perpetrated by drive-by shooters. Duncan however, found evidence that suggested otherwise. Murdered: Kaitlyn Arquette was shot dead at a railway crossing while she was sitting on the drivers side. Two bullets hit her in the head . Capable student Kaitlyn was seeing Dung Nguyen, a Vietnamese immigrant at the time of her murder. Ten years her older, Nguyen was one of his nation's boat people - who fled the war torn nation after the United States pulled out in 1975. He was dismissed as a suspect in the killing because his fingers tested negative for any gun residue. Furthermore, the police found a letter from Kaitlyn in the apartment she lived in with Nguyen that said, 'Hon, where are you? I know you're still mad. I'm so sorry OK! I miss you today. I went to the mom's house to return these books. I'll see ya. Love.' Because of this note the police ruled out fighting between the couple as a motive for her murder. But, five days later, Nguyen was discovered to have stabbed himself in the stomach in the middle of the night, in what he claimed was a suicide attempt. This raised the suspicions of Duncan, who wondered why anyone would try and kill themselves so painfully by stabbing themselves in the midriff? Digging deeper, Duncan found that Nguyen was part of a multi-million dollar insurance fraud in Southern California. The scam was to stage a car accidents with both parties involved to claim fraudulent insurance money. This was a burgeoning business among Vietnamese immigrants in Southern California and Nguyen would sometimes take Kaitlyn along with him when he carried out the fraud. Promising student: Kaitlyn Arquette was preparing to study medicine at the University of New Mexico before her murder in 1989 . This set her mind racing and she rushed to visit Nguyen in hospital, where he was recovering from his self-inflicted stabbing. Duncan told Buzzfeed's Tim Stelloh that while heavily sedated, Nguyen told her that he didn't kill Kaitlyn, but he was 'deciding' whether he loved he enough to tell police who did. Hiring private investigators and even psychic detectives to aid in her search, Duncan then discovered that Albuquerque police knew that Nguyen was involved in fraud and had decided not to investigate his association with Vietnamese gangs. Things became even more skewed when Duncan was finally shown the note that Kaitlyn had written for Nguyen. She was adamant that this was not her daughter's handwriting and then, staggeringly, the case became even murkier. A close friend of Kaitlyn's told Duncam that Nguyen phoned her on the night of the shooting screaming 'Kait's dead!'. However, police did not travel to notify Nguyen of his girlfriend's death until 3am - several hours after that panicked phone call. Then, the case twisted even further when two men, Miguel Garcia and Juvenal 'Juve' Escobedo, 18 and 21-years-old, were arrested and charged with the killing. Police told Duncan that the two men had randomly killed her daughter after one of the men bet the other to shoot Kaitlyn - and he did. I Know What You Did Last Summer: The hit 1997 movie starred Freddie Prinze Jr, (left)  Jennifer Love Hewitt (center left),  Sarah Michelle Gellar (center right),  Ryan Phillippe (right) and was based on Lois Duncan's 1973 bestseller . However, despite the insistence of district attorney Robert Schwartz that the two men were guilty, there was no evidence and no motive aside from random violence. A jury agreed and dismissed the charges against Garcia and Escobedo. Duncan now feels that the police were inept and willfully incompetent in the case and missed a key detail discovered by private investigator, Pat Caristro years later. On the night of Kaitlyn's murder, the first detective to respond to the scene found a man called Paul Apodaca standing by the car, who claimed to be just walking by. According to Caristo, 'standard procedure would have required police to run Apodaca's name,' which they did not. If they had they would have discovered that Apodaca had been charged with 'committing multiple violent attacks against women, including robbery and beating a young girl with a baseball bat.' His car matched the make and model, although not the color, of what eye-witnesses said was a car which dashed away from the scene. Duncan became obsessed by the crime and returned frequently to psychics and private investigators to solve the murder of her daughter. She wrote two books, Who Killed my Daughter? and One to the Wolves, about the killing. Tragically there is no answer for Duncan. Stelloh asks, 'Was there a relationship between Apodaca, the 'Vietnamese connection' and Escobedo and Garcia? Had the crime scene been derailed by incompetence or by a cover-up? Had Kait stumbled onto something even more sinister than insurance fraud?' Duncan herself believes that her daughter was targeted and police tried to cover their tracks after they discovered that Apodaca had not been stopped at the time. For their part, the Albuquerque Police believe that Duncan is becoming a hindrance to the still unsolved murder. 'When she puts out stuff that’s not factual, it’s not helping the case,' Major Anthony Montano said to Stelloh at Buzzfeed. 'Montano would not say which details were not factual, nor how they had 'compromised” APD’s investigation, as he put it.'","Author Lois Duncan, 80, lost her daughter, Kaitlyn, on July 17, 1989 in Albuquerque, New Mexico .

"By . Associated Press . The biggest box-office debut of Angelina Jolie's career propelled Disney's twisted fairy tale Maleficent, with $70 million in ticket sales, to win the North American weekend box office stakes. The PG-rated fantasy beat forecasts to easily top all films over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Though Maleficent was early on considered a risky endeavor for Disney that might turn away family audiences by retelling Sleeping Beauty from the villain's perspective, the film emerged as a hit largely because of the draw of Jolie. Top of the list: Maleficent Walt Disney's special-effects laden take on Sleeping Beauty's wicked fairy godmother, captivated moviegoers, collecting $70 million in ticket sales to win the North American weekend box office stakes . The movie starring Angelina Jolie as the black-robed villain finished far ahead of last week's winner, X-Men: Days of Future Past, which took $32.6 million at U.S. and Canadian theaters . Star power has been increasingly elusive in modern Hollywood, where name-brand concepts often rule the box-office. But Jolie, in her first live-action starring role in years, drove interest for 'Maleficent' despite lackluster reviews from critics. 'It's a unique thing,' said Dave Hollis, head of distribution for Disney. 'Her star power transcends borders and genre.' Seth MacFarlane's Western comedy 'A Million Ways to Die in the West' was out-gunned by 'Maleficent.' The R-rated Universal release opened in third place with a tepid $17.1 million despite a starry cast of Liam Neeson, Charlize Theron and Amanda Seyfried. By contrast, MacFarlane's 'Ted' (for which he's making a sequel) opened with $54.4 million in 2012. Last weekend's top film, Fox's big-budget mutant sequel 'X-Men: Days of Future Past,' dropped to second with $32.6 million. It's a somewhat steep decline for 'Days of Future Past,' but the film made $95.6 million internationally in its second week, good enough to push its global cumulative total past $500 million already. But . 'Maleficent' dominated the marketplace, which has seen female-leading . films continually challenge the much-disputed but still prevalent notion . that male stars fuel the box office. 'The . whole movie kind of rises and sets on her performance,' said Paul . Dergarabedian, senior analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak. 'The . concept is the character. The character is completely linked to the . person playing that role.' The film was a balancing act for Disney, which is used to churning out brighter tales. Hollis credited the company's marketing department for 'walking the fine line' of selling the movie to families (which made up 45 percent of the audience, according to Disney) and suggesting an edginess that would appeal to a broader audience. 'Maleficent' earned about $100 million internationally. 'If you go to Disney, the longest lines are for the scariest rides,' Dergarabedian said. 'We're going to see more of this, where the villains are the new heroes.' Disney has had success reimagining fairy tales in recent years with 'Alice in Wonderland' ($116 million in 2010) and 'Oz the Great and Powerful' ($79.1 million debut in 2013). Another winner: X-Men: Days of Future Past, with Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the seventh installment based on the Marvel Comic series, has collected more than $162 million in sales . Top five: Blended, a romantic comedy pairing Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in their third film, was fifth with $8.4 million. They play single parents stuck at a resort in Africa . 'Maleficent' fell short of those releases, but it was made in the same lineage. Robert Stromberg, the production designer for both earlier movies, makes his directorial debut with 'Maleficent.' Next weekend will bring a battle between Shailene Woodley in the young adult novel adaptation 'The Fault in Our Stars' and Tom Cruise in the sci-fi thriller 'Edge of Tomorrow.' ''Edge of Tomorrow' got a jump on its North America release, taking in $20 million in 28 countries over the weekend. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, latest international numbers are also included. Final domestic figures will be released on Monday.","Produced for $180 million, Maleficent received mixed reviews but opened strongly .
The film is the latest in a line of reimagined classics, following Alice in Wonderland in 2010 and Oz the Great and Powerful in 2013 ."
"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . National Security Adviser Susan Rice defended the Obama White House's Taliban prisoner exchange on Sunday morning, telling CNN and ABC audiences that releasing five high-level terror targets to the nation of Qatar in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl won't put American national security at risk. 'We felt that as the war is winding . down, it was our sacred obligation, given the opportunity to get him . back, that we do so,' Rice told CNN's Candy Crowley on the 'State of the Union' program. 'We did so in a way that . resulted in the Taliban prisoners being monitored and kept in a secure . way in Qatar.' And addressing the thorny question of whether negotiating with terrorists might lead to more kidnappers' demands for more detainee releases from Guantanamo Bay, Rice insisted that the military detention center is still slated for closure. 'The terrorists are intent on doing what they want to do,' she said, 'But Candy, we have a commitment to close Guantanamo Bay. The president's been very clear about that.' 'The existence of Guantanamo Bay is itself a detriment to our national security, which is why the president has prioritized closing it, and why we intend to get that done.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Gitmo is still slated for closure, Susan Rice insisted on Sunday, saying that mothballing the military detention center would remove the incentive for terror groups to demand hostage exchanges . Obama has been accused of violating U.S. laws by approving a prisoner exchange of five Guantanamo detainees for the release of America's only prisoner of war. The five Afghans are among the most senior members of the Taliban being held at the controversial camp, and include one who had direct ties to Osama bin Laden . Obama wasn't required to notify Congress before letting five Taliban fighters out of Guantanamo Bay, Rice said, because Sgt. Bergdahl's reportedly deteriorating health gave the president an emergency exception to a law he signed a year ago -- but Obama has written in the past that the notification requirement itself was unconstitutional . Rice also said President Barack Obama had spoken personally with Qatari Amir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani on Tuesday 'when this looked like it was a real possibility.' The amir, she said, promised Obama 'directly and personally' that there would be restrictions on the five released Taliban fighters – 'that these prisoners will be carefully watched, that their ability to move will be constrained.' 'We believe that this is in the national security interest of the United States,'she said. The only condition of their release that has been made public is a promise that they will not be permitted to leave Qatar for one year. 'Are they free to be in the country, free to communicate with whoever they want?' Crowley asked, 'or are they in detention in Qatar?' Rice pledged that 'there are restrictions on their movement and behavior. I'm not at liberty to get into detail about the precise nature of those restrictions.' 'But suffice it to say that we are satisfied,' she added, 'that that substantially mitigates the risk to the United States and to our national security and we feel confident that the assurances given to us will be upheld.' Rice's choice of words – 'substantially mitigates' – will be a crucial element in the Obama administration's defense of its decision. On ABC's 'This Week' program, host George Stephanopoulos cited a federal law that 'requires assurances that they're not going to be able to return to the battlefield' and harm American interests. Rice leapt in to correct him. 'The law says that we need to have sufficient confidence that the risk can be substantially mitigated,' she protested. 'And we do have ... that confidence based on a detailed understanding with the government of Qatar based on President Obama's personal communication with the emir of Qatar on Tuesday.' Rice also dismissed public concerns about the nature of Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance from his U.S. Army unit. President Barack Obama joined Jani and Bob Bergdahl, the parents of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, in the Rose Garden of the White House on Saturday to announce that their son had been released to U.S. Special Forces after five years in captivity . Rice dismissed concerns about how Bergdahl came to be captured five years ago, saying that 'the point is that he is back' Sgt. Bergdahl's capture was first announced to the world in a July 2009 video in which one of his captors displayed his dog tags . 'There are a lot of questions about how he originally was captured and whether or not he had deserted, had left his post,' said Stephanopoulos. 'Is that going to be investigated? And if it's found that he did indeed leave his post, will he be disciplined – or has he already paid the price?' Rice downplayed concerns about any part Bergdahl may have played in his own capture. 'Certainly anybody who has been held in those conditions, in captivity, for five years has paid an extraordinary price. But that is really not the point,' she replied. 'The point is that he is back.' Some Republicans in Congress are complaining that Obama broke a federal law that he himself signed in 2013, by failing to notify lawmakers before transferring anyone out of the island detention center. The law also requires Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to explain why prisoners are being released, and to assure Congress that the freed terror suspects won't be able to reengage in any activities that might harm the U.S. or its global interests. The Washington Post reported Saturday night that Obama added a 'signing statement' when he inked the bill into law, 'contending that the notification requirement was an unconstitutional infringement on his powers as commander-in-chief and that he therefore could override it.' Obama's national security adviser said Qatar's emir had given the White House 'sufficient assurances' that the released detainees won't be able to harm the United States or its interests . Bowe Bergdahl's release was celebrated in his hometown of Hailey, Idaho, but unconfirmed reports have circulated since Saturday describing a different Army sergeant -- one who deserted his post and went off in search of Taliban fighters to join, not to fight . While campaigning for president in 2008, Obama habitually excoriated President George W. Bush for issuing signing statements, calling them an unconstitutional ""end-run' around Congress. “Congress’ job is to pass legislation,' then-Senator Obama explained during a May 19, 2008 campaign stop in Billings, Montana. 'The president can veto it or he can sign it. But what George Bush has been trying to do as part of his effort to accumulate more power in the presidency.' 'He’s been saying, ""Well, I can basically change what Congress passed by attaching a letter saying I don’t agree with this part or I don’t agree with that part, [and] I’m going to choose to interpret it this way or that way."" That's not part of his power, but this is part of the whole theory of George Bush that he can make laws as he goes along.' Susan Rice has been an infrequent guest on Sunday morning political talk shows since September 2012 when she told five separate audiences on a single Sunday that a terror attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya was the result of an anti-Muslim YouTube video. That explanation was later debunked, and evidence shows that the Obama administration knew almost immediately that an al-Qaeda-linked terror group called Ansar al-Shariah had launched a premeditated attack. Four Americans, including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, died in the military-style assault. But Obama was weeks away from re-election, and insisting that his foreign policy had taken al-Qaeda off the battlefield.","Obama's national security adviser told CNN that the president pulled the trigger on a hostage exchange after Qatar's emir promised that the five Taliban the US released would not be able to reenter the terror battlefield .
She also rearticulated Obama's pledge to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, saying its existence attracts kidnappers who want a bargaining chip to free their comrades .
Rice refused to discuss the circumstances of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's capture, and didn't address reports that he was AWOL and looking to join the Taliban .
She was careful to use talking-point language on ABC, saying that Obama was only required to determine that Qatar's promises about the Taliban fighters' restrictions 'substantially mitigates' the risk to the US ."
"By . Joshua Gardner . A tiny town in the northern reaches of Maine is in shock as authorities swarm to find a local elementary school bus driver who allegedly gunned down his longtime girlfriend before fleeing into the woods at the Canada border. Maine State Police, Aroostook County Sheriff's Office, U.S. Border Patrol and U.S. Customs and Border protection are in search of 38-year-old Jesse Marquis, who they believe killed mother of two Amy Theriault, 31, in her St. Francis home early Saturday. Life in the town of fewer than 600 people, where both suspect and victim were known by all, ground to a halt as the only road in or out was shut down and the school where Marquis worked as a custodian was closed to students for Monday. Manhunt: State and local agencies swarmed a tiny Maine town on the border of Canada on Saturday after local school bus driver and elementary school janitor Jesse Marquis (right) allegedly gunned down his longtime girlfriend Amy Theriault (left) before fleeing into the woods while carrying a rifle . A community shattered: Theriault leaves behind two young daughters and a distraught community in tiny St. Francis, population less than 600, where both she and the suspect were well liked . Armed and dangerous: Jesse Marquis, seen here in an undated mugshot from the Maine State Police, fled the scene early Saturday. Authorities fanned out along the Canadian border and even searched the local elementary school, for which the 38-year-old has keys . To allay the fears of parents in the jolted bordertown, schoolchildren will be bussed to a school in an adjoining district until the manhunt comes to an end. 'This is probably the safest route,' schoolboard member and St. Francis resident Keith Jandreau Jr. told Bangor Daily News Sunday night. 'Jesse may still have keys to the building and might have access there.' The community's unthinkable nightmare began with a 911 domestic violence call placed at 5:45am on Saturday when witnesses claimed they saw Marquis flee Theriault's home on foot. Dozens of law enforcement officials gathered in search of the suspect, who is considered armed and dangerous. Police say Theriault's two young daughters were not present in the home at the time of their mother's murder. 'There have been no sightings of him in St. Francis throughout the night,' Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the Maine State Police, told BDN early Sunday. 'We remain there today and have searched a number of [areas in the] woods and camps and cabins in the area.' At one point, the grade school where the suspect works was even searched. While the two-mile stretch of Route 161 was reopened late Saturday, authorities had reported finding no sign of Marquis as evening turned to night on Sunday, which prompted the school closure. Now, the tiny town has begun the arduous task of regaining its sense of stability while the suspect in its worst ever crime remains at large. 'A lot of the parents have had a chance to talk to their kids,' said Jandreau. 'We are trying to explain as simply as possible that a trusted adult in their life has done this.' Locals were in shock as the manhunt stretched into Sunday night for the school bus driver who was reportedly well liked by children and parents alike .","Multiple law enforcement agencies around St. Francis, Maine (population 577) are searching for Jesse Marquis, 38 .

"By . Wills Robinson . Hospital patients should avoid undergoing surgery at the weekend if they want the best chance of surviving, a global study has revealed. Researchers from Tohoku University, Japan, using statistics of more than 55million patients, found that patients are 17 per cent more likely to die on a Saturday afternoon because of the 'weekend effect'. A different publication presented at this year's Euroanaesthesia congress in Stockholm added that the highest risk of death following surgery came if it was performed during the afternoon or in February. Shocking: A global study has revealed that patients are 17 per cent more likely to die if admitted to hospital at the weekend . In . this study, the researchers investigated the daily, weekly, and . seasonal variability of hospital mortality in patients after surgery. A . retrospective analysis was carried out on patients who underwent surgery . between 2006 and 2011 at the two University Hospital Campuses of Charité . Tertiary Care University Center, Berlin. In . this first analysis of the data, a total of 218,758 patients were . included. Hospital mortality showed variability over the course of the . day, during different weekdays, and different months. Surgery conducted . in the afternoon was associated with 21 per cent increased risk of death . compared with surgery conducted at other times of day. Surgery at the . weekend was associated with a 22 per cent increased risk of death . compared with surgery on weekdays. February was the highest risk month . for surgery, with surgery in February associated with a 16 per cent . increased risk of death compared with surgery in all other months. Further work on the data will be carried out in the coming months, . including looking at the possible reasons behind the variations. The . authors say: 'Several factors may have influenced this outcome. 'For . example, it may be that standard of care differs throughout the day and . between weekdays and weekends. 'Although we controlled for risk factors . including emergency surgery in our study, it may very well be that the . patients treated in the afternoon and on the weekends were more severely . ill. 'We need more data to draw conclusions regarding seasonal variation . in postoperative outcome.' They . add: 'Despite having an accredited quality management system in place . in our hospitals, as well as having the European Society of . Anaesthesiology's Helsinki Declaration of Patient Safety in . Anaesthesiology implemented, this study shows that we should seek to . further improve patient safety.' Concern: Scientists from Imperial College, London, said the statistics proved there was a growing global healthcare problem . In Britain patients are . usually left under the care of junior doctors at the weekends who may only have a few . months’ experience with one or two consultants ‘on-call’ answering their . mobile phones from home. Dr Paul Aylin from Imperial College said the studies showed 'powerful' evidence of a global problem in healthcare. He told the Independent: . 'Both studies acknowledge the differences could reflect poorer care or . simply that patients admitted at these times were more severely ill. 'More . research is needed to find out exactly what contributes to higher . mortality at weekends. Is it lack of clinical staff, nursing staff, . diagnostic services, other hospital resources?' Last October, the NHS confirmed it was moving to a seven-day operation, despite months of opposition. The British Medical Association also agreed the . quality of care provided in hospitals at the weekend needs to be . improved. Only a fifth of hospitals have specialist palliative care staff on duty on Saturdays and Sundays according to experts, despite official guidance demanding seven-day care ten years ago. Around three-quarters offer face-to-face . palliative care on weekdays only. However, the report found one in four . fail to provide a decent quality of service at any time.

"By . Hugo Gye . The sister of a pregnant woman who was stoned to death in the street in Pakistan this week has accused the victim's husband of killing her. After Farzana Parveen was murdered in broad daylight on Tuesday, her father and four other relatives were arrested on suspicion of carrying out an honour killing in revenge for her marrying Mohammad Iqbal. However, her sister Khalida Bibi insisted that her family is innocent, and instead pinned the blame on Iqbal and his 'accomplices'. Warning: graphic content . Claim: Farzana Parveen, left, was killed by her husband Mohammad Iqbal, right, according to her sister . Family: Khalida Bibi denied earlier reports that her sister was killed by her own relatives . The claim is the latest bizarre twist in the tragic tale of Farzana's death, which has thrown the spotlight on the barbaric practice of honour killings. It emerged earlier this week that Iqbal, 45, had killed his own wife in order to marry Farzana, 25, whose family wanted her to marry a cousin. Now Ms Bibi claims that he was also responsible for her sister's murder after she tried to flee him and return to her relatives. 'Mohammad Iqbal and his accomplices killed Farzana, and her father and the rest of her family were wrongly accused of murder,' she said. 'I was present at the scene and when she came out of the lawyer's chamber and as soon as she saw us standing on the other side of the road, she rushed towards us. Iqbal and his accomplices chased her and hit her with bricks.' Twist: Ms Bibi's claims contradict what was previously thought about the circumstances of Farzana's death . Horror: Farzana was stoned to death in the street of Lahore in broad daylight on Tuesday . She added that last month, Farzana fled to a women's shelter in a bid to escape from her husband. 'She told me that Iqbal had kidnapped her and forced her into marriage,' Ms Bibi said. 'She feared that Iqbal might kill her like his previous wife, Ayesha.' Ms Bibi's allegations directly contradict all previous reports of how Farzana died. Iqbal claims that the pair married in January after falling in love with each other, but Farzana's family were angry that she had snubbed the man they chose for her. Her relatives filed a legal claim against Iqbal - but when the couple left the Lahore high court following a hearing in the case on Tuesday, Farzana's father and brothers set upon her. Mourning: Iqbal praying at Farzana's grave after she was killed this week . Protest: The case has prompted worldwide condemnation of the practice of so-called honour killings . According to Iqbal, they began pelting her with batons and bricks as witnesses simply looked on, then left her to die in the street. Two days after Farzana was killed, Iqbal admitted that he had murdered his first wife in order to marry his second. 'I was in love with Farzana and killed my first wife because of this love,' he said. He also claimed that Farzana's older sister Rehana had been the victim of an honour killing after she likewise tried to marry a man for love. The case has prompted worldwide outrage, after it emerged that no one had tried to help Farzana while she was being killed in the centre of Lahore, one of Pakistan's most cosmopolitan cities.","Farzana Parveen, 25, was killed outside the Lahore high court on Tuesday .

"By . Jennifer Newton . It is hoped the new instrument will allow surgery to be carried out on unborn babies . Scroll down for video . Researchers are hoping to develop a minuscule device that could treat conditions such as spina bifida in unborn children. The £10million project aims to create a surgical robot hand which could allow a foetus with a congenital condition to have surgery while still in the womb. The project is being funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, with the research being carried out by engineers at University College London and KU Leuven in Belgium. Figures show that one in every 1,000 babies are born with myelomeningocele spina bifida, which is caused when the spine does not form properly. Researchers hope to develop a pincer, with a miniature camera, which could be inserted into the mother's womb. They hope it would then be able to insert patches over the gaps in the spine to treat the condition. The instrument they aim to create will have 3D endoscopic imaging, which will give surgeons accurate detail of the foetus. It will also have small tissue manipulators, which will have maximum precision and dexterity. A graphic showing how a robot probe could work by photographing the foetus, allowing surgeons to operate . Surgery could be carried on the foetus, while still in the womb if researchers can develop the tool . Professor Sebastien Ourselin told the Observer: 'It will be like a plaster. If we can do that, there will massive gain for the foetus while there will be little risk to the mother. 'We are still in the design stage, so we could end up with a device with four or five arms in the end. Nor would it be used merely to put in patches. It could carry out delicate surgery or deliver stem cells to damaged organs.' The condition spina bifida is caused during the first month of the embryo's development. Symptoms of the condition can include learning difficulties, paralysis of the lower limbs and incontinence.","Project aims to create a robot hand that could operate on a foetus in womb .

The unidentified teen was riding in a pick-up truck with her father and sister, age unknown, when a vehicle in front of them stopped suddenly to let a bear cross the road. The father swerved to avoid the stalled car and crashed into swollen Boulder Creek where his daughter was dragged six miles before emergency crews could get to her. Scroll down for video . Fatality: A 13-year-old girl in Boulder, Colorado died Saturday after her father crashed into a creek . More than 50 emergency responders assisted in the rescue efforts, but it took more than an hour to reach her due to the creek's fast-moving waters. 'We were in contact virtually the whole way. We had eyes on her,' Lt. Bruce Fenfold of Boulder Fire and Rescue told the Daily Camera. However, because of the water levels, Fenfold said 'it wasn't as simple as just jumping into the creek to find her.' Boulder Fire and Rescue diver Brad Lupher told the paper that she was not breathing when pulled from the water. Crews performed CPR. She was later pronounced dead at Boulder Community Hospital. Her father and sister were able to climb out of the car and to safety. No names were released. The office said the coroner will determine the cause of death. The paper said that circumstances surrounding the rescue were made extremely difficult by the unusually high rate at which Boulder Creek has been flowing. Just two days prior to this incident, tubing had been banned on parts of the creek, as water was flowing as much as eight times the typical rate .

Self-proclaimed superhero Phoenix Jones, the trained fighter who patrols the streets of Seattle preventing crime, has disbanded his Avengers-style posse of fellow crime fighters because too many of them weren’t up to the task and were carrying illegal weapons. Jones announced that he was disbanding the 20-strong Rain City Superhero Movement (RCSM) via Facebook on Thursday with a statement in which he admitted he had lent his civilian crime-fighting training and trust to some of the wrong people. Phoenix Jones - real name Ben Fodor – first gained attention in 2010 after witnesses spotted him intervening in various crimes throughout the city in his gold and black costume. Self-proclaimed superhero Phoenix Jones has disbanded his Avengers-style posse of fellow crime fighters because too many of them weren't up to the task and were carrying illegal weapons . His band of costumed vigilantes started to grow and early recruits had to have military or mixed martial arts experience. They carried Tasers, night sticks and pepper spray, but strictly no firearms or illegal weapons. Seattle police didn’t approve of them, but they gained the cops’ seemingly reluctant tolerance. Last year Phoenix Jones announced he was hiring, but according to Thursday’s statement his efforts to grow the Superhero Movement has since gone awry. ‘I started fighting crime years ago and inspired a lot of people to do the same. 'I really thought that having a large group of civilian crime fighters was a good idea,' wrote Jones. Last year Phoenix Jones announced he was hiring, but according to Thursday's statement his efforts to grow the Superhero Movement has since gone awry . 'I was wrong, it takes a certain type of person to do this job correctly and unfortunately I have inspired, worked with, and even taught some of the wrong kinds of people.' He went on to explain that several members couldn’t meet minimum fitness requirements or medical training, while others still lacked professionalism such as refusing to give police their identity. ‘Yea, the team's over,’ Jones told KING5. ‘The fact that we're being less unified, that sucks.’ ‘Illegal knives, pepper grenades, smoke bombs, really crazy stuff,' said Jones. 'A lot of things we do are non-negotiable.' Jones has decided that it is too risky for their brand to have associations with groups that don't adhere to those standards. Phoenix Jones - real name Ben Fodor – first gained attention in 2010 after witnesses spotted him intervening in various crimes throughout the city in his gold and black costume . ‘Anytime any superhero does anything wrong, my name gets mentioned,' Jones added. Only four superheroes have been allowed to stay with Jones as he rebuilds RCSM with an updated logo. 'If you don't see us, it's not official. It's not us,' Jones said. Jones says isn't opposed to welcoming old members back into the fold, but they must meet his requirements for superhero activism, like five pull-ups and 25 sit-ups in two minutes and run 2.5 miles in 30 minutes.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The New Jersey woman who narrowly escaped death after her boyfriend's former partner put a hit out on her life says she still lives in fear. Even after Nicole Faccenda, 45, was jailed in 2013 for 10 years for plotting her death, Jennifer, the girlfriend of Faccenda's ex-boyfriend, Howie, still cannot believe the lengths she was willing to go to. Faccenda was arrested after a week-long ATF operation, in which she told federal agents posing as hitmen exactly what she wanted. Victim: Nicole Faccenda tried to have Jennifer, who is pictured but hasn't revealed her surname, killed by hitmen . Apologized: Nicole Faccenda, 45, of New Jersey, has publicly said sorry to the woman she tried to have murdered, after being caught in an undercover sting in 2011 . 'Everywhere I go, I have to be worried or concerned that somebody is going to drive me off the road, or somebody is going to come to my door with a silencer, as she said she wanted to,' Jennifer told ABC News' 20/20 exclusively. 'I'm scared every day.' Incredibly Jennifer and Howie are trying to salvage their relationship after the terrifying revelations. Nicole Faccenda interaction with the officer was all recorded and makes chilling viewing, . 'I've played every scenario through . my head a million times. Do I want the car to go off the highway? Do I . want someone to just come up and take her out? Do I want me to just go . into the house with my silencer and take them all out?' she was recorded . telling the agents. 'I wouldn't care if she was in a horrible, horrible, horrible car accident and mangled up,' said the suburban soccer mom. Jennifer became aware of the heinous plot when she was pulled over by federal agents. 'He . shows me the badge, and he says to me, ""Jennifer there’s been a hit put . on your life."" And immediately I said to him, ""Nicole Faccenda,""' Jennifer told ABC News. 'And he said, ""Yes.""' The . agent told her that she was scheduled to die that morning, and that . they needed to make it appear as if Faccenda had succeeded. Terrifying: Faccenda said that if Jennifer's children got in the way, 'Oh well, I'm sorry' 'I never thought that she would go to . the extent as she did... to try to find somebody to murder me and my . family,' Jennifer told 20/20. 'Every . day I live in fear because of her, and that’s not the way I wanted to . live. She chose that for me.' Indeed, Faccenda didn't mince words. 'I . want to go to her funeral and spit in the casket. I will be happiest . when this woman is dead and buried and six-feet-under,' she told agents, . in effect digging her own grave. She was introduced to a man she thought was a killer in the parking lot of a . Mahwah, New Jersey, supermarket, however the man was an undercover officer . with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- the ATF. Stung: This is the moment Nicole Faccenda first met with whom she believed to be a hit man, in the carpark of a supermarket in Manwah. The man was an undercover officer and the meeting was being filmed and recorded . Suspcious: This footage, taken inside the car by an undercover cop, shows Nicole Faccenda looking directly at the camera that was secretly filming her. She also refused to discuss the murder-for-hire explicity, saying: 'I want to wear black.' While all there meetings were being . secretly recorded, Faccenda was suspicious the man may have been an . agent, refusing to explicitly say she wanted the woman dead, saying she . has 'watched too many Lifetime movies'. She . used turns of phrase like she 'wants to be dressed in black', referring . to a funeral, and wanted the new girlfriend 'gone to the moon'. However, . after a few phone conversations Faccenda inevitably let her guard down, . and she soon handed over a $2,000 down payment with the promise of . another $18,000 when the woman was dead and she could go to her funeral . and 'p--- on her grave'. She also provided a picture of the intended target, along with her address. As . for her ex-boyfriend, she said she didn't want him killed, but it would . be all right for the hit man to shoot him in the foot. She had less concern for the other woman's children. If they got in the way, she said: 'Oh well, I'm sorry.' Faccenda was arrested after the week-long ATF operation. This photo shows Nicole Faccenda with her ex-boyfriend. She was attempting to have his new girlfriend killed . She later pleaded guilty and, in December 2013, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. She spoke openly about her crime and sent a series of emails to ABC about why she did it. Faccenda hopes that, by speaking out, she may be able to help other women from landing in the same position. 'My . message to any woman who has had her heart broken and has felt the pain . of loss in every bone in her body ... is to take a deep breath and . think before speaking,' she said via email. 'Your words are powerful weapons and you will be held accountable for them and it is definitely not worth it. 'I . know in my heart that if it were not for the persistence and constant . pressure from the CI (Confidential Informant) and the ATF agents wanting . to make their case, I would not be here today. 'I was at an emotional low point in my life and they took advantage of that. However Faccenda goes on to say she takes responsibility for her actions. 'I thank God every day that no one got hurt from my careless actions,' she wrote. 'I will be indebted to my family and friends for their support. I would like to apologize to the victim and her family. 'I am not  - and have never been - a violent person. I was a woman destroyed by emotions and I am paying for it dearly.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Louisiana man is lucky to be alive after driving his pickup truck into Lake Ponchartrain as he crossed the 24-mile-long bridge. The accident occurred just after 3 p.m. on Saturday afternoon on the southbound side of the span when the driver was reaching for his cellphone, about 2 miles from the south shore, and lost control of the truck. The vehicle hit a curb and rode a railing along the bridge for about 80 feet before tumbling over the side of the Causeway bridge. Rescuer: A driver whose pickup truck went over the railing of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway was rescued by several other motorists who stopped on the bridge to come to his aid Saturday afternoon . Helping hand: The pickup driven by a 26-year-old River Ridge man plunged into the lake from the southbound span a couple miles from the south shore, authorities said. Rescuers on the bridge helped to pull both the driver and his rescuer to safety . The 26-year-old driver, a River Ridge man whose name was not immediately available, was able to escape the vehicle. Incredibly, in an act of heroism, a passing motorist who had a life preserver jumped into the water and threw the vest over the driver. Other drivers then managed to stop and assist ended up hoisting both men to safety after throwing them a rope. David Grunfeld, a photographer for NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune was driving by at the time of the accident and witnessed a man being pulled out of the water. Shock: The 26-year-old driver was reaching for his cell-phone when his car careered over the side of the bridge . Lucky to be alive: A 26 year-old River Ridge man is pulled from Lake Pontchartrain by citizens after the truck he was driving went off the west side of the southbound causeway bridge near the two mile marker. On the far right of the picture youc an see his rescuer, Alvin Pike, being hauled back onto the bridge . 'It was incredible,'' Grunfeld said of the scene and the calmness of the rescuers. Grunfeld said he came upon the accident scene probably just minutes after it occurred. He said a man in a white t-shirt jumped from the bridge into the water to help the motorist whose vehicle had gone over the side. Tanner Brignac, 21, also witnessed the accident and saw the truck go flying over the side of the bridge. 'It was like a flash and then it was in the water. It all happened so fast, it was like half of a second,' Brignac recalled to the The Times-Picayune. One man who was fully dressed in a suit, peeled off some of his clothes and jumped into the water. 'He just jumped in, like it was nothing.' Photographer Grunfeld said the rescue was one of the most extraordinary things he's ever witnessed. 'A lot of people stopped to help,' Grunfeld said. Long crossing: The pickup driven by a 26-year-old River Ridge man plunged into the lake from the southbound span a couple miles from the south shore . Long stretch: The four-lane, 5,189-pile concrete trestle bridge north of New Orleans is the world's longest bridge over water and was built in 1956 . The driver of the vehicle pulled from the water did not appear to have life-threatening injuries. Nor did the man who jumped over the railing to help save him. Several other people on the bridge helped to pull both men to safety using a rope to haul them using a rope. The man who was driving the truck was taken to a hospital to be treated for minor cuts. His rescuer was names as Alvin Pike, 45, who works in a New Orleans restaurant. 'It was pretty surreal, to tell you the truth,' Pike told Nola.com. Mr Pike said he got out of his car, waved for traffic to stop and looked into the water to see the fallen driver floating near his sinking truck. Despite not having any kind of rescue or lifeguard training, Mr Pike said, his instinct was to jump into the water after the driver. 'I didn't think,' he said. 'I just did it.' The southbound bridge was closed for about 40 minutes during the rescue. The four-lane, 5,189-pile concrete trestle bridge north of New Orleans is the world's longest bridge over water and was built in 1956. It is something of a pulse-quickening half-hour drive in order to cross the span of which 40,000 cars cross each weekday. In recent years, the southbound span has seen a handful of serious wrecks where vehicles have gone over the railing and into the lake below. In the last week alone there have been four other accidents on the bridge which connects Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans with Mandeville on the northern shore.","26-year-old driver was on his cellphone when he lost control and drove into the lake .

Iwan, 32, said: These tree lizards are only about 10cm long but their tails are almost twice as long. 'They appeared to enjoy playing together and there was no confrontation when the lizard jumped up to join its friend. 'When it jumped, it grabbed the other lizard's tail and didn't let go for a little while - although it was just a metre off the ground. 'They are a very impressive species to watch and my favourite photo is the one where the lizard is hanging off the other's tail. 'Although I work in IT, I love photography and, in particular, taking photos of animals when they play together like this.'

"By . Kirk Maltais . Photographs dating back to as early as 1970 of astronauts training on a barren Hawaiian island in preparation for their historic missions to the moon were released by NASA on Saturday. The photos show the crews of Apollo 14, 15 and 17 training on Hawaii's Big Island, a volcanic landscape which sports an environment remarkably similar to the one found on the moon. The astronauts practiced with equipment such as the moon buggy in area with recent volcanic activity, also rehearsing activities such as taking soil samples. The earliest photograph dates back to 1970, which shows astronauts Alan Shepard, Edgard Mitchell and Stuart Roost of Apollo 14 training with a Modularized Equipment Transporter. This image from 1970 shows Apollo 14 astronauts Alan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell, and Stuart Roost training with a Modular Equipment Transporter along with another unidentified individual. This photo was among a set recently unearthed by NASA showing astronauts training in preparation for their historic moon missions. This photo, taken in 1971, shows Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison 'Jack' Schmitt (pictured left) training in a lunar roving vehicle on the Big Island of Hawaii. Apollo 17, which launched on December 7, 1972, was the last manned lunar mission undertaken by the United States, making this photo the latest in the set recently unearthed by NASA. According to NASA, the photographs were found by Rob Kelso, executive director of The Pacific International Space Center for Exploration Systems, a Hawaii state agency. Kelso reportedly found the photos while visiting the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, Texas. Kelso said that crews from Apollo missions 13 through 17 trained on the island for their lunar missions. The island is still used by NASA to test robots for missions to the moon and to Mars. This picture, dated December 1970, shows members of the crew of Apollo 15 training with gear on. The area was picked for it's remarkable similarity to the terrain of the moon. Apollo 15 members Dave Scott (pictured left) and Jim Irwin (pictured right) digging soil on the Big Island of Hawaii in December 1970. According to Kelso, robots are being tested on 'lava tubes', areas formed after lava solidifies and becomes a solid sheet. Formations similar to lava tubes have been found on satellite imaging of planets such as Mercury, Venus, and Mars. In recent years, NASA has also begun to use the island to test new technology that can pull oxygen out of the area's dirt, which is volcanic basalt much like the soil commonly found on both the moon and Mars. The technology could allow future missions to simply extract oxygen from the planet's soil instead of bringing it on the trip. The technology could also be applied to make fuel for the missions.","Never-before seen photos show crews of Apollo 14, 15, and 17 lunar missions training in conditions similar to the moon .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A Brooklyn drug dealer with ties to a well-known hip hop artist accused of running a murderous drug gang has admitted to cross dressing in order to more easily kill a rival. Saquan Wallace, 28, told a federal jury hearing the racketeering trial for Ronald ‘Ra Diggs’ Herron that the rapper advised him to don a wig, lipstick and makeup to track and then kill the target. ‘I put on a wig, lipstick, makeup and I went looking for him,’ Wallace testified Thursday in court, according to the New York Daily News. Accused kingpin: Ronald 'Ra Diggs' Herron is accused of running a violent drug gang in Brooklyn's Gowanus Houses . The six-foot-two Wallace weighs upwards of 200 pounds, but said he looked passable in a shirt long enough to be a dress while skulking in the hallways of the Wyckoff Gardens housing projects looking for Jabari Foster in early 2006. Herron, 32, wanted Foster, a one-time protégé, dead because he continued to sell drugs in Wyckoff Gardens in open defiance of the hip hop artist. The rapper’s violent gang ran the drug trade, mainly crack cocaine, in the nearby Gowanus Houses, authorities contend.  They ran him into court on a racketeering count and three murder charges. The idea to dress like a woman came from Herron, who Wallace said gave him the idea after doing it himself. Wallace claimed he lurked in the grim project’s halls until finding an apartment with a loud music.He then waited in the hopes Foster would emerge from the party. Wyckoff Gardens: The housing project where Saquan Wallace claims he cross dressed in order to kill a rival . ‘Someone walked out and I was around the wall waiting,’ the man already serving 30 years on murder, racketeering and drug charges testified. ‘When the person came in the open it was him [Foster] and I opened fire on him repeatedly and killed him.’ He then replied ‘yes’ when asked during cross-examination if he looked like a woman. ‘So it was a good disguise for you?’ Defense Lawyer James Neuman asked. ‘It was good enough,’ the admitted killer said, adding that he burned the getup after the killing. Wallace admitted he is looking to cut a deal with officials for a shorter sentence in exchange for his testimony. His identical twin brother was also locked up for 20 years on drug charges. Authorities are using Herron’s performances and songs as Ra Digg, which portray a gang banging, drug dealing and murderous lifestyle, against him in court. None of the murders he is accused of involve cross dressing.","Convicted drug dealer Saquan Wallace claims Ronald 'Ra Diggs' Herron suggested he dress like a woman to kill a rival drug dealer .

Ukraine will push on with its military offensive against rebels in the east of the country until peace and order have been restored there, according to the country’s acting defence minister. Speaking after 14 servicemen, including a general, were killed on Thursday when rebels shot down an army helicopter, Mykhilo Koval, said that Ukrainian forces would continue with military operations in border areas 'until these regions begin to live normally, until there is peace'. He spoke after reports emerged claiming . Russia has withdrawn thousands of troops from the Ukraine border, just . hours after the helicopter attack. A Ukrainian soldier controls a road on the outskirts of Izyum in the east. Ukraine's acting defense minister said troops had ousted separatists from parts of Donetsk . US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel didn't provide any details following news of the withdrawal but described it as promising.

An insurgent leader in the Donetsk region confirmed that members of the first group were in their custody. The rebels said that they would ‘deal with this and then release them’, but did not elaborate or give a specific timeframe. Ukraine has waged an intensifying campaign against the pro-Moscow rebels, who have seized government and police buildings and want the region to join Russia. President-elect Petro Poroshenko, who will be sworn in to office on June 7, has promised that the campaign against the rebels, who he compared to Somali pirates, would last ‘hours’ rather than months. On Thursday, rebels shot down a helicopter carrying Ukrainian troops, killing soldiers and a general who was in charge of combat training.

"By . Margot Peppers . A dancer who had to have both her legs and arms amputated as a child is the star of a fascinating and inspirational new documentary. Portland, Oregon native Kiera Brinkley, 20, was just two years old when she contracted pneumococcal sepsis, a bacterial infection that cut off her blood streams and forced doctors to amputate her limbs. But instead of living a sedentary life, she took a different route. 'I was never the type of quote-unquote ""disabled person"" to stay in my wheelchair the entire day and have everybody wait on me,' she says in a clip from Soar. Scroll down for video . Inspiring: Portland, Oregon native Kiera Brinkley (pictured), a dancer who had to have both her legs and arms amputated as a child, is the star of a fascinating and inspirational new documentary . Courageous: 'I was never the type of quote-unquote ""disabled person"" to stay in my wheelchair the entire day and have everybody wait on me,' says the 20-year-old (pictured) 'I wanted to go out and do everything I had learned how to do with my arms and legs, and adapt to how to do it without them.' Now, she and her half-sister Uriah Boyd - who was born just a month before Kiera got sick - are the stars of Soar, which follows their lives as they endeavor to make it big in the dancing world. 'Dance is my escape and my home away from home,' says Kiera. She told ABC News that when she's choreographing a dance, 'I picture myself with arms and legs. When I come to the class, I forget don't have any. I'm like, ""Oh, I'm sorry about that,"" to the other dancers.' Childhood trauma: When she was just two, Kiera (pictured) contracted pneumococcal sepsis, a bacterial infection that cut off her blood streams and forced doctors to amputate her limbs . Support system: She and her younger half-sister Uriah Boyd (pictured together as babies) - are the stars of a documentary called Soar, which follows their lives as sisters and dancers . Connection: The sisters are so close that when Uriah (left) first learned to crawl, she did it by dragging her diaper on the ground like she had watched Kiera do, instead of on all fours . The documentary will not only delve into Kiera's unique movements as a dancer, but it will also explore her one-of-a-kind bond with Uriah. 'Dance is my escape and my home away from home' The sisters are so close, in fact, that when Uriah first learned to crawl as a baby, she did it by dragging her diaper on the ground like she had watched Kiera do, instead of on all fours. 'She just grew up knowing how to help me . and when to help me and when to push me away because she knew I could do it myself,' explains Kiera in the clip. Encouraging: 'She is just like my mom - they don't give me any sympathy, but they make me work for what I want to do and what I have to do,' Kiera (right, as a child) says of Uriah . Partners: As they got older, Kiera and Uriah discovered a mutual passion for dance, and found that they could communicate through movement in their synchronized routines . 'She is just like my mom - they don't give me any . sympathy, but they make me work for what I want to do and what I have to . do.' As they got older, Kiera and Uriah . discovered a mutual passion for dance, and found that they could . communicate through movement in their synchronized routines. Jaimen . McMillan, the founder of Spacial Dynamics Institute, shares his first . hand experience of witnessing the sisters dance together in a video on . Soar's Kickstarter page. One-of-a-kind: Jaimen McMillan, the founder of Spacial Dynamics Institute, says that their performances together create 'a rhythm and a synchronicity that is breathtaking to behold' Triumphant: Kiera (left, dancing with her sister, right) is currently a fully-fledged member of Portland's Polaris Dance Theatre dance company, where she performs and choreographs . 'Kiera had to . begin her motions peripherally,' he says of their physical differences. 'I wanted to do everything I had learned with my arms and legs, and adapt to do it without them' 'Uriah was given the gift of learning . that from the very beginning from her sister, who didn't have the . physical limbs, but had mastered the spatial limbs. 'So when you see them . dancing at the same time it's not merely synchronized, it's the spatial . limbs preceding their physical [ones] in a rhythm and a synchronicity that is . breathtaking to behold.' Obstacle: Kiera's dance career will likely be short-lived because it affects the bones in her legs, so she has to have surgeries to reshape them. But it hasn't stopped her from pursuing her passion . Deeper meaning: 'When I got serious about dance, it was an expression,' she explains. '[It's] my voice without speaking' Kiera, who considered being a medical assistant before resolving to pursue a career in dance, is currently a fully-fledged member of Portland's Polaris Dance Theatre dance company, where she performs and choreographs. Her disability means that she will likely have a short-lived dance career; her movements onstage affect the bones in her legs, which means she has to have periodic surgeries to reshape them. But for now, she's focused on pursuing her passion, whatever it takes. 'When I got serious about dance, it was an expression,' she explains.

"By . Louise Cheer . and Ryan Lipman . The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has confirmed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is not in the southern Indian Ocean search zone where pings were detected in early April. A statement from the Joint Agency Co-ordination Center search team said on Thursday: 'The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete. 'And in its professional judgment, the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of MH370.' The US Navy said there was no evidence to suggest the four detected pings, which were used to base the search area, were from the plane's black boxes. And no debris from MH370 has been found during the extensive search. Families of the passengers and crew on board the flight, including the New Zealand wife of passenger Paul Weeks, have been left shattered by the news. 'It is just another slap in the face. It's just another long road for us and look, I'm just shattered by the news. I'm absolutely shattered,' Danica Weeks told Sydney Morning Herald from her Perth home. Scroll down for video . Authorities agree the four pings found in early April are not from the MH370's black box . US Navy ocean engineering deputy director Michael Dean, said it was most likely the pings came from another man-made object such as one of the ships that were looking for the plane, reported CNN. 'Our best theory at this point is that (the pings were) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the Towed Pinger Locator,' Mr Dean told CNN. 'Always your fear any time you put electronic equipment in the water is that if any water gets in and grounds or shorts something out, that you could start producing sound.' Those looking for the plane used the pinger locator to listen for underwater signals. The MH370 flight and its 239 passengers disappeared on March 8, while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Mr Dean said searchers would have discovered the black boxes if the pings had been coming from them. He also indicated other countries involved in the search had come to the same conclusion - that the pings found seven weeks ago were not from the flight's data or cockpit voice recorders. The Bluefin-21, pictured here with Able Seaman Matthew Tranter-Edwards, was used to search the southern Indian Ocean for signs of the plane . But he said he could not completely rule out that the noises came from the black boxes. The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre announced on April 7 that a pinger locator towed from the Australian navy vessel Ocean Shield had picked up two acoustic signals, with one held for more than two hours. The signals were described as consistent with flight data or cockpit voice recorders and at the time became the most solid lead and likely from a man-made source. The man charged with finding the plane, Angus Houston, said it was 'the most promising lead' to date. Two days later, two more signals were detected and held for about five and seven minutes. Australia ended its initial stage of the underwater search on Wednesday, finishing its scan of large areas surrounding the four ping sites. The Bluefin-21 mission came to an end after the underwater drone did not detect any aircraft debris from the time it began scanning the sea floor off the West Australian coast on April 14. The drone scoured more than 850 square kilometres of ocean floor in its search for signs of the missing aircraft. The Bluefin-21, an underwater vehicle, was unable to look in the area where the most northern ping was located because of deep waters. Australian navy fleets, including the HMAS Stirling (pictured), have been assisting in the search, which will not ramp up again for at least two months while new equipment is moved to a new search area . With the pings used to determine the search area almost ruled out, the JACC will now expand its search while also reviewing all existing radar, satellite and aircraft performance data. This will help define a search zone of up to 60,000 square kilometres in the southern Indian Ocean, which still follows an arc defined by British company Inmarsat based on the final 'handshakes' between the Boeing 777 and satellites. Relatives of the 239 passengers and crew were recently successful in demanding Inmarsat publicly release its data, after loosing faith that searchers were looking in the right area. JACC said the findings of the data review would be made public in due course. As well as sea floor mapping in the defined search area, more vessels will be added to the survey, expected to take about three months. A new and potentially deeper underwater search taking up to 12 months will follow in August, with a formal request for tender to undertake the search to soon be released, according to JACC. 'A single prime contractor will be chosen to bring together and manage the expertise, equipment and vessels to carry out the search,' the centre said. Australian Transportation Safety Board's Martin Dolan said it would take more time to move new equipment within the search area, which is about 60,000 square kilometres. Squadron Leader Brett Kenzie of the Royal New Zealand Airforce was one of the officers who helped look for the plane after four pings were found on April 5 and 8 . Danica Weeks, pictured with sons Jack, 13 months old and Lincoln, 3, is struggling with news searchers have given up on the area where pings were detected . The New Zealand wife of a passenger on ill-fated Malaysia Airlines flight 370 said she is having trouble coming to terms with news that searchers have given up on an area of the Indian Ocean where acoustic pings were detected. Danica Weeks' husband Paul, a mechanical engineer, boarded MH370 on his way to start a new job in Mongolia. Mrs Weeks lives is in Perth, where the family moved after the Christchurch earthquakes in 2011. 'When your child cries for their father, it just breaks your heart and I can't tell them the truth because I don't know,' she told the Seven Network. 'I still haven't reconciled that he's not coming back, because I've had nothing. 'When you don't have anything - not even a piece of the plane, just nothing, and so many different stories - how can you not have a little piece of hope?' 'It is just another slap in the face. It's just another long road for us and look, I'm just shattered by the news. I'm absolutely shattered,' she told Sydney Morning Herald. The couple have two boys, Lincoln, 3, and 13-month-old Jack. Transport Minister Warren Truss has told federal parliament the search is moving into a new phase and Australia was committed to doing everything it can to find the plane. 'We are still very confident that the resting place of the aircraft is in the Southern Ocean,' he said. 'Unfortunately this is a painstaking effort in a very large ocean.' Mr Truss said the next search area could be 800 kilometres long and 70km wide. Manager of opposition business Tony Burke said families of the those on the missing plane had been left hanging after the most recent search failed to the plane. 'Once again we offer our condolences and words of comfort to the families and friends of the passengers on MH370 who still await more news,' he said.","Australian Transport Safety Bureau confirms MH370 is not in the Indian Ocean search zone where pings were detected in early April .

"By . Julian Robinson . and Corey Charlton . Women in Kuwait could be banned from wearing bikinis after plans were approved to outlaw 'nudity' in public places. Tourists and residents would be barred from wearing the two-piece swim suit under proposals for a ban at swimming pools and hotels. The crackdown was approved by the head of the Kuwaiti National Assembly committee, MP Hamdam Al-Azemi. Tourists visiting Kuwait could be banned from wearing bikinis amid proposals for a crackdown on 'nudity' in public places in a country where many women wear traditional clothes covering their bodies (file pictures) Al Arabiya News reports that the Islamist lawmaker has not given a definition for the term ‘nudity’ but, according to the Kuwait Times, issued a statement ‘strongly criticising women dressed in bikinis at some swimming pools, on beaches and in hotels’ adding that the term ‘also includes revealing or improper dress’. The newspaper added that any proposal must be accepted by the government as well as by the Assembly. A separate proposal to ban bikinis was thrown out by a parliamentary committee as unconstitutional in 2011, the newspaper reports. It would have meant a ban on revealing bathing suits and clothes with ‘deep cleavage’ at the beach and suggested fines and jail terms of up to a year for offenders. It comes a day after reports that Qatar has issued a decree advising tourists that leggings are not considered pants and are not modest enough to wear in public. Leggings have been singled out in pamphlets distributed by the Gulf state as inappropriate attire for tourists in the notoriously strict Islamic country. The Reflect Your Respect campaign, launched by the Qatar Islamic Cultural Center, has listed some advice and tips for tourists on how to dress modestly in preparation for the 2022 Football World Cup it is hosting. LEGGINGS ARE NOT PANTS: The Gulf state has issued its stance on leggings as part of its modesty drive . The pamphlets ask visitors to help preserve Qatar's culture and values. They state: 'If you are in Qatar, you are one of us. Please dress modestly in public places.' It then adds: 'Leggings are not pants.' The campaign uses social media to help get its message across, including the use of its own Twitter account. There are a range of other recommendations included in the campaign that visitors need to be wary of if planning to travel to Qatar. Public displays of intimacy and affection are strongly discouraged in Qatar . The campaign has received a mixed reaction online. One person responded: 'If this campaign ran in the UK it would be blasted for being ""racist"". Why is it suddenly acceptable elsewhere, regardless of religious or cultural beliefs? Basic human rights should be accepted globally, not just where some see fit.'","Kuwait considering ban on bikinis in public places in 'nudity' crackdown .

"By . Hugo Duncan . Tesco is expected to post its worst results in 20 years on Wednesday as shoppers continue to desert the chain for budget rivals. It is thought that Britain’s biggest grocer will reveal sales fell more than 4 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 – far worse than the 2.9 per cent drop in the previous three months. Despite spending £200million on cutting the price of basic items, analysts say Tesco is still perceived as ‘too expensive’ compared to the likes of Aldi and Lidl. Every little helps: Despite spending £200million on cutting the price of basic items, analysts say Tesco is still perceived as 'too expensive' compared to the likes of budget rivals such as Aldi and Lidl . Tesco’s woes have stunned the industry with one expert saying such a poor performance would have been ‘almost unfathomable in times past’. Clive Back, an analyst at stockbrokers Shore Capital, said he had ‘never been so gloomy about Tesco’s prospects in 20 years’. He said: ‘We believe Tesco UK is increasingly perceived by customers as simply too expensive versus the discounters, Asda and potentially Morrisons. That is a dangerous and frankly untenable place for a mass-market leader to be.’ The grim figures, due on Wednesday, will pile further pressure on chief executive Phil Clarke, who has struggled since he took over from Sir Terry Leahy in 2011. Analysts at JP Morgan said the figures will be ‘the worst published by the company we can recall in 15 to 20 years’. ‘If our forecast proves accurate, it will cast doubt on any suggestion by management that the strategy is working and that the company is in better shape than it was two or three years ago,’ said JP Morgan’s Jaime Vazquez. Tesco shocked the stock market with its first profits warning in a generation in 2012 but it is feared that more will follow unless it halts the collapse in sales. Profits at the once-mighty chain slumped 6.9 per cent last year after a 1.3 per cent slide in sales in the UK. Big shoes to fill: The grim figures, due on Wednesday, will pile further pressure on chief executive Phil Clarke, who has struggled since he took over from Sir Terry Leahy in 2011 . Mr Clarke who has been struggling to come up with initiatives to boost market share and kick start growth since taking over the supermarket chain. As well as cutting prices, Tesco has recruited more staff and spruced up its stores in a bid to revive its fortunes. The Big Four supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – have all suffered at the hands of the discounters as well as premium range rivals Waitrose and Whole Foods. The popularity of Aldi and Lidl has increased significantly since the start of the recession with the stigma felt by some at being seen in one of their stores wearing off. Industry experts say that shopping habits have changed, with the weekly shop giving way to more frequent smaller trips as families hunt out the best deals and reduce waste.","Analyst says he's 'never been so gloomy about Tesco's prospects'

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Nigel Farage has revealed the first outlines of UKIP's general election manifesto, including plans to target up to 36 seats next year . Nigel Farage this morning revealed the first outlines of UKIP’s general election manifesto, as he revealed the party would target up to 36 seats next year. The UKIP leader said the party would promise to scrap tax on the minimum wage. This would mean the 20p starting rate of income tax would only kick in on earnings over £12,675 a year. He also revealed that the party would fight to scrap the 45p top rate of tax on those earning over £150,000 a year, bring back grammar schools ‘in every town’ and take an axe to public sector middle managers. Mr Farage suggested these policies would form the centre piece of the party’s manifesto, which will be revealed at a special conference held in Labour leader Ed Miliband’s Doncaster constituency next September. He hopes the policies will propel his party into Westminster after last week’s European and local elections triumph. Mr Farage has previously listed as potential targets seats in Grimsby and Boston in Lincolnshire, Folkestone and Thanet in Kent, Portsmouth, Eastleigh, Plymouth, Aylesbury and parts of Cambridgeshire in the south, as well as Rotherham in the north. Mr Farage refused to reveal which seat he will choose to fight – but said there was a ‘distinct possibility’ that it would be Thanet South in Kent. He did however rule out challenging Nick Clegg in Sheffield. He said: ‘I’m going to stand in the South East of England because that’s where I am from.’ Mr Farage,  pictured with his PR Alexandra Phillips as he arrived at BBC studios in London to film The Andrew Marr Show, hopes the policies laid out today will propel his party into Westminster . The . seat is currently held with a comfortable 8,000 majority by Tory MP . Laura Sandys. But she has already announced that will be stepping down . at the next election. Even though it has been targeted by Mr . Farage it would require a huge swing to UKIP for him to win – after the . party scooped barely five per cent of the vote in the last general . election in 2010. But Mr Farage insisted the party would win seats in next year’s poll. Mr Farage, pictured meeting a passing fan today, refused to reveal which seat he will choose to fight - but said there was a 'distinct possibility' that it would be Thanet South in Kent . He . said: ‘Yes I am. I think the European election results caught the news, . but actually the more significant result for next year was the in the . areas where we succeeded last year - the county council seats where . there were district council elections again this year, we are seeing . areas where we are building up a really good representation of UKIP in . local government and that changes the whole perception in a . constituency. ‘That’s . exactly what Paddy Ashdown did in the 1990s – they built on local . strength. Our strategy for the general election next year is we will . pick power the course of this summer our target seats and we will throw . the kitchen sink at them. ‘It’ll be two dozen, three dozen – something of that order.’ ‘We topped the polls in the Europeans, we are winning council seats, we are on the up.’ He . said the party had ditched its controversial pledge to introduce a flat . rate of tax for everyone of 31 per cent, replacing the three bands of . 20p, 40p and 45p today. Mr Farage has promised tax cuts and a grammar school 'in every town' as he appeared on The Andrew Marr show . The politician said his party would  reveal its full manifesto in September at its annual conference in Ed Miliband's Doncaster constituency . But Mr Farage said: ‘We are going to rethink the tax thing. ‘What I can tell you for certain is that our biggest tax objective in that next manifesto will be not tax on the minimum wage. We’ve got to incentivise people on benefit and to get back to work. ‘I think a top rate of tax in this country of around about 40 per cent is the one that will bring the most revenue into the exchequer. ‘I think that’s what we will conclude yes. Anything over 40 and you start seeing people going overseas.’ He was also asked if he still wanted a grammar school in every town? He replied: ‘Absolutely.’ Mr Farage said the party would reveal its full manifesto in September. He said: ‘We are going to have our annual conference this year in Doncaster in Ed Miliband’s constituency – that is where we will lay out our manifesto for the 2015 general election. ‘I want us to give millions of ordinary families and people in this country the opportunity to live a better life and to do that.’","UKIP leader reveals key manifesto pledges ahead of September party conference in Doncaster .
