"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . If your walls are covered in your child’s drawings, they may be worth a closer look. Because artistic talent early in life provides an indicator of intelligence later on, scientists have found. Children who can accurately depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years, according to a paper published today. Psychologists at King’s College London studied pictures drawn by more than 15,000 four-year-olds. Those who drew with the most skill were likely to do better in intelligence tests a decade later. Scroll down for video . Children who can depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years, a study by King's College London has found. Drawings of more than 15,000 children were graded for the study . Each drawing was given a grade between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head, nose, ears, hair, body and arms. The scoring system ignored features such as proportion for the study . The research, conducted on 7,750 pairs of identical and non-identical twins, also found a strong link between genetics and artistic talent. Identical twins were much more likely to draw pictures of a similar quality than non-identical twins. Dr Rosalind Arden, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London, said: ‘Our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life. ‘Through drawing, we are attempting to show someone else what’s in our mind. 'This capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability, in a similar way to writing, which transformed the human species’ ability to store information and build a civilisation.’ However, she added: ‘But this does not mean parents need to worry. It is really important that parents do not think, “Oh no, my child is terrible at drawing, they will be flipping burgers for the rest of their life.” Each drawing was given a mark out of ten. The one on the left was given a four while the one on the right a ten . More than 15,000 children, all aged four, were asked to draw a picture of a child for the King's College study . There are countless factors, both genetic and environmental, which affect intelligence in later life. ‘Drawing ability does not determine intelligence. The findings show there is a link, but it is only a moderate link.’ The children were asked at the age of four to draw a picture of a child. Each figure was scored between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head, nose, ears, hair, body and arms. The scoring system ignored features such as proportion, but the children were given a point for including clothing. The children were given verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests at the time they completed the drawing, and again at the age of 14. The researchers found a definite correlation between the drawing scores and the two sets of intelligence scores. While some drawings received a 0 (left), others were marked up because of their knowledge of features (right) Dr Rosalind Arden, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London (pictured), said of the study: ‘Our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life' Dr Arden added: ‘There is no evidence that drawing makes you more intelligent. But I think drawing will make a child more observant and able to pay attention to what is around them. ‘Children love drawing; give them a crayon and let them get on with it.’ Her team also tested the link between genes and artistic talent, using twins because each pair has a similar background, allowing the scientists to disregard outside influences. 'Overall, drawings from identical twin pairs were more similar to one another than drawings from non-identical twin pairs. Dr Arden said: ‘This does not mean there is a drawing gene – a child’s ability to draw stems from many other abilities, such as observing. 'We are a long way off understanding how genes influence all these different types of behaviour.’ The research is published in the journal Psychological Science.","Children who can depict human form at age of four more likely to be brighter .

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . Over 1.8 million images of Earth have been taken from space - and Nasa hopes internet users can help it pinpoint exactly what they show. A new online sites hopes user's will be able to spot their city in the images. They will then form part of  a huge online database of space pictures. Scroll down for video . Can you spot your hometown? Nasa hopes the public will help identify the areas captured by astronauts aboard the ISS . Users can download an app to help. The ISS image will be loaded in the left panel and a map on the right one. The aim is try to identify the city. Users have some simple tools, including zooming in and out, dragging, and even rotating the image (click on Shift and the left mouse button). When you identify a picture, just click on the map to identify its position. The longitude and latitude coordinates will appear on the list. The Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth, Nasa is making available images ranging from the Mercury missions of the 1960s to photos recently snapped from the International Space Station. The hope, Nasa says, is that the images 'could help save energy, contribute to better human health and safety and improve our understanding of atmospheric chemistry.' The catalog contains more than 1.8 million photos, about 1.3 million of them from the space station and roughly 30% of them taken at night. The Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) is leading a project called Cities at Night to catalog the images. It includes three citizen science components: Dark Skies of ISS, Night Cities, and Lost at Night. Dark Skies asks people to sort images into those of cities, stars and other objects. 'Anyone can help,' says Alejandro Sanchez, a Ph.D. student at UCM. 'In fact, without the help of citizens, it is almost impossible to use these images scientifically. 'Algorithms cannot distinguish between stars, cities, and other objects, such as the moon. Humans are much more efficient for complex image analysis.' For Night Cities, citizen scientists use their knowledge of local geography to identify points in night images and match them to positions on maps. As Sanchez explains, a resident of a city can likely identify its features more easily than someone who does not live there. This geo-referenced data will be used to generate light maps of cities. Lost at Night requires the most skill, seeking to identify cities in images encompassing a circle 310 miles around. The images include major cities such as this one - which Nasa admits it cannot identify itself. Volunteers use a special online app to pinpoint exactly where the image is from . 'We don't know which direction the astronaut pointed the camera, only where the station was at the time the image was taken,' explains Sanchez. 'Some images are bright cities but others are small towns. 'It is like a puzzle with 300,000 pieces.' So far, hundreds of volunteers have classified nearly 20,000 images, but to ensure accuracy, each one should be classified by multiple individuals. One of the outcomes of the project will be determining the optimum number of people needed to inspect each image, but its primary goal is producing an open atlas of night time images available any time for use by the media, public, and scientists. Scientists can, for example, use colors in images to estimate the types of light sources and, thus, the energy efficiency of a particular city. Researchers could use the data to compare the lighting and the economic health of a city as well. 'A clear example is comparison of Madrid and Berlin,' Sanchez says. 'Madrid is the capital of Spain, a country facing a major economic crisis. 'It is much brighter in astronaut images than Berlin, the capital of Germany, the country with the healthiest economy in Europe. This geo-referenced data will be used to generate light maps of cities. 'Perhaps that is an indication that Germany more efficiently manages its resources. 'The images can provide evidence and data to verify that.' Other potential applications include evaluating lighting for road and public safety and correlating light pollution with effects on human health and biodiversity. 'But scientists need your help to make that happen.' NASA says the images 'could help save energy, contribute to better human health and safety and improve our understanding of atmospheric chemistry.' Hundreds of volunteers have stepped up so far, classifying almost 20,000 photos, but NASA says multiple individuals should review each image to ensure accuracy. Before 2003, night images from the space station could be blurry, even with high-speed film and manual tracking, because the station moves at about 17,500 mph. In 2003, enterprising astronaut Don Pettit used a drill and assorted parts he found on the station to cobble together a 'barn-door tracker,' a lower-tech predecessor to the European Space Agency's NightPod, which was installed at the space station nine years later. NightPod's motorized tripod compensates for the space station's speed, providing what NASA scientist William Stefanov says are the highest-resolution night images from orbit. Satellites collect data more regularly, but the photos tend to be lower resolution. 'Now the pictures are clear, but their location may not be, which limits their usefulness. 'That's where citizen science comes in,' the NASA news release says. Hundreds of volunteers have stepped up so far, classifying almost 20,000 photos, but NASA says multiple individuals should review each image to ensure accuracy. The Complutense University of Madrid is spearheading efforts to catalog the photos and corral citizen input. It has created three projects: . 1. Dark skies. This is the easiest project, as it requires no scientific expertise. 'Anyone can help' by sorting the images into the categories: cities, stars or other objects, said Alejandro Sanchez, doctoral student at Complutense. 'Without the help of citizens, it is almost impossible to use these images scientifically. Algorithms cannot distinguish between stars, cities and other objects, such as the moon. Humans are much more efficient for complex image analysis,' he said. 2. Night cities. Looking at night images, citizen scientists can tap their knowledge of local geography to match photos with positions on maps. Residents of a city can more easily identify a city's features than those who don't live there, Sanchez said. The data will be used to generate light maps of cities. 3. Lost at night. This is the trickiest, as it aims to identify cities in photos with 310-mile circumferences. 'We don't know which direction the astronaut pointed the camera, only where the station was at the time the image was taken,' Sanchez said. 'Some images are bright cities, but others are small towns. It is like a puzzle with 300,000 pieces.'","Nasa database includes over 1.8 million pictures of Earth .

"Labour has suspended Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins after the CPS launched a criminal investigation into leaked details of a death in custody . Labour has suspended its police and crime commissioner in Bedfordshire after the CPS considers criminal charges over the leaked details of a death in custody. Olly Martins now faces the prospect of criminal charges after the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced in February that it would investigate unauthorised disclosures about the death in custody of Leon Briggs. Mr Briggs, 39, died on November 4 last . year after he was restrained and detained by Bedfordshire Police . officers and taken to Luton police station. His death is being probed by . the IPCC in a separate investigation. The IPCC said today that its completed investigation had been passed to prosecutors. A Labour Party spokesman said: 'Olly Martins has been suspended from the Labour Party.' The IPCC said in a statement: 'The Independent Police Complaints Commission has completed its investigation into the police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Bedfordshire, Olly Martins, and has passed its report to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). 'The CPS will determine whether there is evidence to warrant criminal charges.' On February 13 this year, the IPCC said it would examine the unauthorised disclosure of information about the circumstances surrounding the death, adding that Mr Martins had admitted sharing information about the case with a third party, who then disclosed it to others. Bedfordshire Police referred the leak to the IPCC in December last year after it was raised by a member of the public. An initial probe by Bedfordshire's Police and Crime Panel resulted in a written warning to Mr Martins, issued at a private meeting in January. Leon Briggs, 39, died on November 4 last year after he was restrained and detained by Bedfordshire Police officers and taken to Luton police station. His death is being probed by the IPCC in a separate investigation . The IPCC decided to launch an independent investigation in February, overseen by IPCC Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone. Suspension from the Labour Party means Mr Martins is not allowed to participate in meetings or other party activities and he will be subject to a disciplinary proceeding run by the party's national executive committee. The CPS will now look at the file and determine whether there is evidence to warrant criminal charges against Mr Martins. Mr Briggs was arrested by officers after members of the public reported concerns about his behaviour. He reportedly fell ill and was taken from the station to Luton and Dunstable Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The IPCC was alerted to the matter by Bedfordshire Police on December 1 following information from a member of the public.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . A cargo spacecraft purposefully sent to burn up in Earth's atmosphere has been captured in an amazing image from a resident ISS astronaut. Last Friday the vehicle called Cygnus left the station full of rubbish to be disposed of when it re-entered Earth’s atmosphere yesterday. And the stunning spectacle of fire was spotted from above in a rare photo of its kind by Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst. Scroll down for video showing the moment Cygnus departed the ISS . Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst captured this stunning image of the Cygnus spacecraft burning up below the ISS last Friday. The cargo spacecraft is purposefully sent to burn up with trash on board . The commercial cargo ship ended its month-long space station visit last week. Cygnus is a free-flying spacecraft developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation under NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation programme. The spacecraft consists of a Pressurised Cargo Module (PCM) and a Service Module (SM). The PCM carries pressurised cargo and experiments to the space station and pressurised disposal cargo away from the station for destructive reentry at the end of the mission. The SM provides power, propulsion, guidance, computation, and communications for Cygnus. Astronauts aboard the ISS released the Cygnus supply ship full of trash for disposal. They parted company 260 miles (420km) above Africa's southwest coast. And Gerst, by training his camera down towards Earth, was able to spot the moment the spacecraft was torn apart above the Pacific Ocean by the intense force of re-entering our planet's atmosphere. 'In 84 days [Reid Weisman], [Макс Сураев] and I will ride home inside such an amazing fireball!' Gerst wrote on Twitter, referring to their return to Earth in November this year on a Soyuz spacecraft, albeit with a less destructive descent. The automated Cygnus craft is used to take cargo to the ISS but unlike other vehicles like SpaceX's Dragon capsule or the Russian Soyuz, it is not able to return to Earth. Instead, like Esa's own Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), it is designed to burn up in Earth's atmosphere after leaving the station. And astronauts use this opportunity to fill the vehicle with waste from the ISS to be disposed of. The automated Cygnus spacecraft departed the ISS last Friday having brought more than 3,000 pounds (1,400 kilograms) of crucial cargo to the station last month . Cygnus is designed and operated by Virginia-based Orbital Science Corporation, with this particular vehicle launching from Virginia in mid-July under a Nasa contract. The unmanned craft hauled more than 3,000 pounds (1,400 kilograms) of crucial cargo to the orbiting outpost. When it left it was loaded with 3,500 pounds (1,600 kilograms) worth of rubbish. 'All the best wishes,'  Gerst radioed to the company's flight controllers. Cygnus does not have a heat shield that can survive re-entry so when it hits the atmosphere it is torn apart, with the intense heat setting fire to the various components. Re-entry is targeted over unpopulated areas of Earth such as the Pacific Ocean in this instance . Cygnus (shown) is designed and operated by Virginia-based Orbital Science Corporation, with this particular vehicle launching from Virginia in mid-July under a Nasa contract . On Sunday Orbital Sciences steered the craft down through the atmosphere to burn up, with the six space station astronauts recording the fiery re-entry for engineering analysis. The same documentation will be done when a European ATV supply ship departs early next year. That ship, launched from French Guiana, delivered its shipment a few days before Cygnus left. Nasa and its international partners - Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada - want to learn as much about atmospheric re-entry as possible to prepare for the space station's eventual demise in the decade or two ahead. Orbital Sciences is one of two US companies hired by Nasa to deliver space station goods. The other, California-based SpaceX, will make its next supply run on 19 September.","German Alexander Gerst has captured a stunning photo on the ISS .

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . Pitt Town Public School student Bridget Wright was killed by a seven-metre branch that dropped onto her from a gum tree during lunchtime in February . More than 5000 trees have been cut down in public school across NSW since an eight-year-old schoolgirl was killed by a falling branch in February. The Hawkesbury community in northwest Sydney was left devastated when Pitt Town Public School student Bridget Wright was killed by a seven-metre branch that dropped onto her from a gum tree during lunchtime. The NSW Department of Education said arborists had since removed 5042 trees after conducting assessments at 1960 public schools across the state, at a cost of more than $13 million. 'These arborist assessments recommended tree safety works, including lopping and removal of trees at 1587 school sites,' the department said in a statement. Arborist Mark Hartley - who inspected the tree that killed Bridget and injured two other children and a teacher - said the move was a 'knee-jerk reaction'. 'It's a huge amount of expenditure,' Mr Hartley told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'If it was aimed at trying to prevent another fatality it is entirely ineffective.' Mr Hartley said it was necessary to do maintenance on trees that were unsafe, but said cutting down thousands would not lower the mortality rate from trees at schools. Scroll down for video .

"By . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . There's always been suspicion that police had quotas to meet when it came to speeding fines, but now there's proof. Emails seen by an Adelaide newspaper have revealed that South Australian police are in fact being pushed to hit their traffic fine benchmarks, pressured to 'hammer' drivers instead of letting them off with a caution. South Australian police have adamantly denied the claims saying there are 'no quotas' only a benchmark model to ensure officers always maintained the ability to apply discretion. Emails seen by an Adelaide newspaper have revealed that South Australian police are being pushed to hit their traffic fine benchmarks, pressured to 'hammer' drivers instead of letting them off with a caution. South Australian police have denied there are quotas for traffic fines saying only a benchmark model to ensure officers always maintained the ability to apply discretion. The Advertiser discovered that a sergeant from the Sturt police station told staff in February this year that he's expecting the senior sergeant to have some words. The emails read, 'we fell below our expected returns for traffic contacts for the last reporting period. We’ll hammer those poor people who choose to drive when we’re night shift.' Again another email in May, from a different sergeant, showed police still had concerns with the figures they were seeing, acknowledging he was aware of the 'high caution rate'. 'I understand it is the officers discrepancy, but for any of the ‘fatal five’ (road safety issues) ... strict enforcement should occur.' 'Currently, Sturt LSA (local service area) is running at over 30 per cent cautioning.' An email to SA police officer read, 'we fell below our expected returns for traffic contacts for the last reporting period. We’ll hammer those poor people who choose to drive when we’re night shift.' 'There are NO quotas. I make no secret of the fact that we have broad road safety benchmarks.' said SA police commissioner Gary Burns . In response to claims that police were given quotas, SA Police Commissioner Gary Burns released a statement saying he wanted to outline the facts regarding his letter to all staff in May about his expectations for road safety. 'I want to take the opportunity to put on the record again - very clearly - that there are NO quotas. However, I, and the Executive, make no secret of the fact that we have broad road safety benchmarks.' Mr Burns said. 'These are NOT quotas. Benchmarks are allocated to an LSA, Branch or area to ensure they achieve a set number of traffic contacts, they are not allocated to individual officers.' 'Preventing injury and fatalities on our roads through education and enforcement is a core function for SAPOL and must be addressed by all members as seriously as the prevention of crime and other core functions.' The Commissioner said a benchmark model was key to ensuring members always maintain the ability to apply discretion. 'For example, a driver committing a minor traffic breach could be issued with a caution or an Expiation Notice. Either is acceptable and is recorded as a ""contact"" and counted towards the benchmarks set for your area.' he said. Emails seen by an Adelaide newspaper have revealed that South Australian police are being pushed to hit their traffic fine benchmarks, pressured to 'hammer' drivers instead of letting them off with a caution. 'I repeat - the benchmark process was deliberately designed to allow all members to use discretion.' 'The most important issue is that a driver who has done the wrong thing is spoken to and dealt with in some manner - documented caution, TIN, report or arrest.' 'The benchmarks are not onerous and are regularly reviewed. It is particularly unhelpful when members remain misinformed or are deliberately mischievous in the public domain.' 'I expect every operational member to enforce laws which influence driver behaviour and reduce the trauma on our roads - and I make no apology for it.' said Mr Burns. Deputy Opposition Leader Vickie Chapman told The Advertiser, Police Minister Tony Piccolo must confirm whether the benchmarks that police were being required to meet were actually quotas. 'If this is the case and officers are being required to meet quotas for traffic infringements, I am sure South Australians will be rightfully annoyed and disappointed with the Weatherill Labor Government,' she said. 'Police officers want to be out doing their job and protecting the community. They don’t want to be spending time filling quotas.'","Emails reveal South Australian police are being pushed to hit traffic fine benchmarks .

Good times: Jack Davies flew 6,000 miles from his hometown in western Wales to the tropical islands off the coast of Thailand in order to spend three years partying and exploring with dozens of Western holidaymakers . Mr Davies had always dreamed of traveling, and so after finishing school in Llanelli he saved up as much money as he could in order to have what he described as 'the adventure of a lifetime'. The only child admitted to having wanderlust - a word meaning the strong desire to travel, which he even had tattooed across his torso. It was only after watching the Leonardo DiCaprio film adaptation of Alex Garland's famous novel 'The Beach' that he realised he was particularly drawn to the concept of a deserted tropical island paradise which he could explore by himself. While many speak of the idea but never act upon it, Mr Davies travelled as quickly as he could to Phi Phi -  the island chain where the film, which also starred Robert Carlyle and Tilda Swinton, was shot. He spent the next three years living and working on the island of Ko Phi Phi. Active: While living in Thailand, Jack Davies took part in all manner of watersports and outdoor activities .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . A Catholic priest and a former children's home boss have appeared in court accused of indecently assaulting young boys. Father Anthony McSweeney, 67, and John Stingemore, 72, are charged with abusing young boys in their care during the 1980s. Both men are accused of together indecently assaulting a boy under 16 between November 1980 and July 1981 at Grafton Close children's home in Hounslow, west London. Father Anthony McSweeney, 67, pictured left, and John Stingemore, 73, pictured right are accused of indecently assaulting young boys in the 1980s . The home is at the centre of Operation Fernbridge, a Met probe launched last February looking into claims of a paedophile ring operating out of the Elm Guest House in Barnes, South West London. As part of the probe investigators are looking into claims that children were taken from the home to the Elm Guest House to be sexually abused. Detectives are examining allegations that several high profile figures including the late MP Cyril Smith, abused children from Grafton Close at the guest house. McSweeney, from Pease Pottage, West Sussex, was a trainee priest at the time of the alleged attacks. He was leading the congregation at St George's Church in north Norwich when the claims against him emerged. Stingemore, from St-Leonards-on-Sea, was in charge of the Richmond Council-run home between February 1980 and July 1981. He is also charged with two further counts of the same offence, one count of taking indecent photos of the child, one count of conspiring to bugger and one count of buggery. Both men appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today for a brief hearing. Dressed in a black suit, red patterned tie and red pocket square, McSweeney spoke only to confirm his name, age and address. Stingemore, wearing a blue anorak, sat hunched in his wheelchair throughout the hearing and only sat up when asked to confirm his identity. The two defendants appeared today at Westminster Magistrates Court. McSweeney pleaded not guilty to the charge, while Stingemore did not enter any pleas . McSweeney indicated a not guilty plea to the charge while no indication was made on behalf of Stingemore. Both men are already due to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court in February  charged with a string of similar offences. McSweeney is due to stand trial accused of taking an indecent photograph of a child and two counts of indecent assault on a male person in the 1980s. He also faces three counts of making indecent photographs of a child and a further count of possessing indecent images. He will stand trial alongside Stingemore, who denies five counts of indecent assault on a male person, indecency with a child and taking an indecent photograph of a child. The home was run as an adolescent unit where children were assessed before being placed into foster care or more permanent homes. Stingemore and McSweeney, who were released on unconditional bail, are due to next appear at Southwark Crown Court on September 9 when it is thought an application will be made for the two cases against them to be joined.

The six-year-old was found on the streets of London and had become the home's longest-staying resident after staff believed a lack of interest was down to her permanently sad expression. But now the Rottweiler-cross has been re-homed with Geoff and Sylvia Shoesmith from Chelmsford in Essex, who were drawn to her loving personality and calm temperament. Scroll down for video . Bless, 6, (centre) has been rehomed with Sylvia (left) and Geoff Shoesmith (right) from Chelmsford in Essex . Mr Shoesmith said: ‘She's fantastic, I can't fault her. ‘She's got that sort of face that never gives much away - but as soon as you put your coat on and it's time to take her out, then she positively bounces!’ Bless had spent five months being overlooked by visitors at the charity’s south London Home before staff published an article on their website about the ‘permanently sad dog’. It was after seeing the media coverage that Mr and Mrs Shoesmith leapt at the chance to take the doleful dog home. Rob Young, head of Dog Rehoming, described her as having a ‘heart of gold’ and a ‘gentle giant’. Staff had hoped that Bless would attract as much interest as the mournful kitten, who became an internet sensation earlier this year.

The town of Bradian in Canada's British Columbia was abandoned in the 1970s when the local gold mine closed, and now it's for sale at just $995,000. That includes all 50 acres of the mountain hamlet, including 22 empty homes that will need a lot of attention to make habitable again. The town was established in the 1930s, in the middle of Canada's gold rush, by families who came to work at the nearby Bralorne mine. Ghost town: The abandoned town of Bradian in Canada's British Columbia has hit the market with an asking price of about $907,000 U.S. dollars . Abandoned: The small town was established in the 1930s, in the middle of Canada's gold rush, when families flocked to Bradian to work at the nearby Bralorne mine. Above, a 1960s newspaper found on the 50-acre property . Shut down: The town was abandoned in the 1970s when the mine closed and there was no longer any work for the locals . Rural: Bradian is located four hours from Vancouver and two hours from ski-resort Whistler. It includes 50 acres of property and 22 abandoned homes . For 40 years, the mine was one of the biggest gold producers in Canada, turning out $4million ounces of the precious metal. But the mine closed in 1971 when the price of gold dropped and the operators couldn't turn a profit. By the end of the 70s, the town was completely abandoned and the homes fell into disrepair. In 1997, Vancouver couple Tom and Katherine Gutenberg, senior flight attendants for Air Canada, bought the town as a fun project for their family. Gold in the hills: For 40 years, Bralorne mine was one of the biggest producers of gold in Canada, turning out $4million in the previous metal . Investment: Current owners Tom and Katherine Gutenberg, senior flight attendants for Air Canada, bought Bradian in 1997 . Bonding: The Gutenbergs spent vacations and holidays at the property, working to fix it up with their two young children . 'When he saw the town was falling apart, Tom thought, ""Wouldn’t it be great for the family to save the town?""' listing agent John Lovelace told FoxNews.com. Now that their two children are grown up though, the Gutenbergs rarely visit the town, and decided to put it up for sale. Bradian was originally listed in 2010 with an asking price of $1.3million. They recently dropped the price to $995,000 - or $907,0000 in U.S. dollars - and have seen a flurry of interest in the unique property. Moving on: Now that their children have grown, the Gutenbergs don't visit Bradian often and decided to put it up for sale . Discount: Bradian was initially listed in 2010 for $1.3million, but the owners bumped that price down recently . Excitement: The real estate agent says he's received more than 30 calls from people interested in the property - some even as far away as Australia . Promising: Lovelace says the property will take a lot of work to make habitable again, but it could prove a cash cow for whoever invests the money into it . Potential: Lovelace thinks Bradian would be a great place to start a snowmobiling company . Lovelace says he's received more than 30 calls, emails and texts from people interested in the property - with some as far away as Australia. However, Lovelace has not been shy about how much work the property needs. 'If somebody went in there with some money and they got the services up to speed and created those (vacant) lots, they’d make a crap load of money. But that’s a five to 10-year process,' he said. Lovelace hopes another young couple will take interest in the property in the same way the Gutenbergs did. He says it would also make a great location for a snowmobiling company. Bradian is located a four-hour drive from Vancouver and two hours from ski-resort Whistler. However, for nine months of the year, the road to Whistler is impassable, making it a four-hour drive as well. Bradian isn't the only town to hit the real estate market in recent months. Back in June, the town of Swett, South Dakota was listed for $400,000.","The town of Bradian, in British Columbia, Canada, is for sale at $995,000 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Historian Mary Beard who was horrifically abused by internet trolls last night revealed she has befriended one of the worst offenders and even gave him a job reference. The academic and broadcaster has fought a public battle against online abuse - known as trolling - after receiving a torrent of abuse on social media site Twitter. In July last year, she named and shamed former public schoolboy Oliver Rawlings, 20, for calling her a ‘filthy old slut’ and adding a revolting sexual comment. Scroll down for video. Historian Mary Beard, left,  befriended Oliver Rawlings, right,  who called her a 'filthy old slut' on the internet. Rawlings later apologised to Miss Beard over lunch and thanked her for showing him  the 'error of his ways' At the time, the Cambridge classicist whose approach caused the university student to apologise, offered to take the student ‘out for a drink and smack his bottom’. And it has now emerged that following the furore over his comments she did exactly that. Speaking in an interview with the New Yorker magazine, Beard, 59, revealed the pair had remained in touch after he took her to lunch to apologise. ‘He is going to find it hard to get a job, because as soon as you Google his name that is what comes up,’ she said. ‘And although he was a very silly, injudicious, and at that moment not very pleasant young guy, I don’t actually think one tweet should ruin your job prospects.’ She added: ‘In general, I am more concerned to be sure that people don’t use the internet in this way (or don’t do so again) than to seek “punishment”.’ Professor Beard retweeted Rawlings’ original comment to her 47,000 followers to out her abuser, but said she didn’t want him to suffer in the long term for ‘one moment of idiocy’. At the time, her actions prompted him to write: ‘I sincerely apologise for my trolling. I was wrong and very rude. Hope this can be forgotten and forgiven. I feel this had been a good lesson for me. Thanks 4 showing me the error of my ways.’ Mary Beard said it was not the first time she had intervened to help someone who abused her on the internet . Professor Beard has been one of the most outspoken voices on trolls, condemning their behaviour as ‘vile playground bullying’ and ‘generic, violent misogyny’ after an appearance on BBC Question Time last year led to a torrent of vile sexual taunts and abuse directed at her on social media. Beard told the New Yorker it was not the first time she had stepped in to help someone who had abused her online. In fact, she revealed she had taken a similarly benevolent approach with another internet abuser who called her evil following her Question Time appearance. Following an exchange of emails, she discovered the troll was in fact upset about a problem with his healthcare. Beard then stepped in to lend assistance to him. She said: ‘It took two minutes on Google to discover the reciprocal healthcare agreement, so I sent it to him. Now when I have a bit of internet trouble, I get an email from him saying: “Mary, are you all right? I was worried about you”.’ Professor Beard said she had also received an apology for another man who had doctored an image of her with genitalia on her face. He revealed himself to be a married father-of-two and had sent her a letter that described ‘how he should never have done it’. Describing her constructive approach, Professor Beard said she did not simply want to be perceived as a ‘long-suffering female parent’ scolding her errant teenager, adding: ‘If being a decent soul is being maternal, then fine. I’ll call it human.’ On her personal blog, A Don’s Life, which she has kept since 2006, Beard has voiced concerns on the destructive nature of internet trolling, adding: ‘It would be quite enough to put many women off appearing in public, contributing to political debate.’","Mary Beard received significant online abuse after appearing on television .

"By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . There are at least 10 serious threats at Australian airports reported each day and many of them are terror-related alerts, as our Border Protection and Customs officials react to government directives to heightened national security measures. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has made the claims this morning, as he outlined more details of the Border Protection anti-terror units being deployed across the country. Mr Morrison confirmed to Sky News that there are 80 additional officers being placed into shift arrangements across Australia's capital city airports. Scroll down for video . Federal Police patrol Melbourne Airport as the Immigration Minister admits there are '10 serious threats at Australian airports every day' including terror alerts . Scott Morrison says counter-terrorism units are being deployed to Australian airports to stop 'the risk of foreign fighters' 'They are there to do one job - and that is to address this particular threat, which is proposed through counter-terrorism and particularly the risk of foreign fighters,' Mr Morrison said. 'What's more important is the strength that is already there needs to keep doing the job they do every day on the broad range of threats that already exist. 'We get 10 serious alerts every day at our airports all round the country and so that means we need that force to focus fairly on that and squarely on that and this additional force to come in and supplement so that we can ensure that the issues in the past don't reoccur, like the Khaled Sharrouf case.' Up to 80 Border Protection team members will supplement the likes of Federal Police and Customs officials across international airports in Australia . Airline passengers make their way through Melbourne Airport where government officials have confirmed there's been at least one arrest of a terror suspect in the past week . A pro Islamic State fighter waves the ISIL flag, similar to one allegedly found in a man's luggage at Melbourne Airport when he was arrested by anti-terror officers . Sharrouf was able to flee Australia last December on his brother's passport, despite having been convicted of a terrorist conspiracy in 2005. Mr Morrison's revelations follow the arrest of a suspected terrorist bound for Syria at Melbourne Airport after Customs officials allegedly found him carrying images of beheadings and the ISIL flag. The man, who is believed to be an Australian citizen, was allegedly also carrying $30,000 and was with three family members, when he was detained on a flight travelling to Beirut. Another man was arrested at Sydney Airport on Sunday after material related to the Islamic State was found in his luggage. 'We've had one, we've had others as well over the course of the past few months,' Mr Morrison admitted. It's been confirmed at least five people have now been arrested by the counter-terrorism units for carrying either 'large sums of cash or objectional material,' according to Mr Morrison.","10 serious threats to Australia airports every day .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . These incredible kaleidoscopic-style photographs capture England's churches and cathedrals in all their glory. The series of vertical panoramas, taken in churches all over the country by travel photographer Richard Silver, showcase the buildings' stunning patterns and designs. The 52-year-old, from New York, began his panoramic project in 2012 and has since travelled across England including Wells, London, Salisbury, Brighton, Bristol, Bath and Glastonbury to document the architecture of churches. Richard Silver has spent the last two years taking photographs inside England's churches and cathedrals. Pictured: Southwark Cathedral (left) and Salisbury Cathedral . Despite looking rather different on the outside, Southwark Cathedral (left) and Salisbury Cathedral (right) have remarkable similarities on the inside (top pictures) He has created the vertical panoramas to showcase the buildings' architecture and ornate ceilings. He was inspired to start the project after taking a vertical panorama in New York but chose to focus the project in England. Pictured: Farm Street Church in Mayfair, London (left) and Our Lady and St. Philip Neri, also in London (right) Farm Street Church in Mayfair, London (left) and Our Lady and St. Philip Neri, also in London (right) are two of the dozen churches in the capital to be documented .

Pictured: The interior of Bath Abbey (left) and All Hallows by the Tower in London (right) are just two of the several buildings captured on camera by Mr Silver as part of his two-year long project . Mr Silver visited the iconic Bath Abbey (left) in the South West and All Hallows by the Tower, London (right) as part of the two-year long photography project . Mr Silver has travelled across the country including the Priory Church of St Bartholomew in West Smithfield, London (left) and St Thomas Church in Salisbury (right) The Priory Church of St Bartholomew in West Smithfield, London (left) and St Thomas Church in Salisbury (right) were the dozens of churches visited by Mr Silver . Mr Silver said he hoped the images 'make people look at look at things in a new way.' Pictured: St. Sepulchres, London (left) and St Paul's Church, Brighton (right) As well as looking different from the inside, St. Sepulchres in London (left) and St Paul's Church in Brighton (right) also look rather different from the outside too . He said he embarked on the project to show-off the often 'overlooked ceiling of a church' in the hope of making 'people look at look at things in a new way.' He said: 'Much of the beauty in churches is above you. 'It made sense to start with England, since the country has such a deep history with religion and churches.' The photography technique involves taking multiple photographs which are digitally stitched together to create one seamless image. Once a shoot is complete, Mr Silver pieces his photographs together in Photoshop and the finished panorama consists of between five and nine images.

'I planned my daily walks around the locations of the churches I wanted to photographs. 'I'm not a very religious man, but I still find the absolute beauty in the architectural design of these structures.' 'Many times people cannot figure out exactly what they are seeing.

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . A New York father was charged with child endangerment after police say he left his toddler daughter alone in a hot car to go shopping. The incident took place in the parking lot of a TJ Maxx store in Selden, Long Island, Wednesday afternoon. Suffolk County police officers responded to the shopping center at Selden Plaza at around 2pm after getting a 911 call about a child locked inside a car. Father doesn't know best: Juan Pablo Aguilar Varela, 32, has been charged with endangering the welfare of a child after police say he left his 4-year-old asleep in the backseat of a hot car to go shopping . The 4-year-old girl was discovered sleeping in the backseat of her father's Mercedes Benz, which was locked and had its windows lowered only about half an inch. Temperatures in Selden were in the mid-80s at the time of the incident. It is believed that the toddler was left alone in the car for about 15 minutes. A Good Samaritan initially flagged down Dave Panebianco, with the Selden Fire Department, in the parking lot and informed him of the little girl in the backseat of a Mercedes. ‘I could see a little girl in the backseat, covered by what looked to be like a sun visor of some sort that you kind of put in the front window,’ Panebianco told CBS New York. ‘And I could see that she was breathing. And I could also see that she was kind of covered in sweat.’ First responders who were summoned to the scene were able to unlock the vehicle and remove the toddler from the backseat. Shopping trip gone awry: The little girl was spotted covered in sweat inside her father's Mercedes Benz parked outside this TJ Maxx store in Selden, NY, with its windows rolled down half an inch . Panebianco carried the child into his air-conditioned car and administered first aid for a heat emergency. She was later taken to Stony Brook University Hospital for a check-up. Police officers then entered the TJ Maxx and tracked down the child's father, identified as 32-year-old Juan Pablo Aguilar Varela. The man was arrested on a charge of endangering the welfare of a child. He is expected to be arraigned Thursday.","Juan Pablo Aguilar Varela, 32, arrested for leaving his daughter alone in a car for 15 minutes .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . With Britain's economic recovery fast outstripping the rest of Europe, we may like to think of ourselves as a well-off nation. But new data shows that, when compared to American states, Britain would actually rank as the second poorest if we were to join the US tomorrow. Based on GDP per capita - the amount of wealth this country generates each year divided between everyone who lives here - the UK would rank below Alabama and just above Mississippi. New data  shows that if the UK were to join the US it would rank as the second poorest state by GDP, behind Alabama and in front of Mississippi. It would also languish behind Germany, the poorest EU country . However the data, produced for The Spectator, also showed that without London the UK would rank far below even the most deprived state in the US. When all the wealth generated in Britain each year is divided out equally among the population, it comes to just $36,202 each, compared to Alabama at $36,356 and Mississippi on $35,157. All three are behind Missouri, where riots have been taking place, on $45,721, and far removed from the most well-off state, Alaska, which generates $80,741 dollars per person per year. Fraser Nelson, editor of The Spectator, said: 'If Britain were to somehow leave the European Union and become the 51st state of America, we would actually be one of the poor states. 'If you take our economic output, adjust for living costs and slot it into the US league table then the United Kingdom emerges as the second-poorest state in the union. Without London, which accounts for roughly 22 per cent of the UK's GDP, this country would come in last place with $10,000 per person per year less than Mississippi . 'We’re poorer than much-maligned Kansas and Alabama and well below Missouri, the scene of all the unrest in recent weeks.' The Mirror also calculated that without London, which accounts for around 22 per cent of the UK's GDP, we would have a GDP per capita of $25,224 - almost $10,000 per year worse off than Mississippi. The figures were also adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity, meaning researchers took into account how much you can buy for your money in each country, ensuring the fairest result.","If England joined U.S. tomorrow it would rank as the second poorest state .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A former public schoolboy tried to rape an ex-classmate after she let him stay the night at her university halls, the Old Bailey heard. Archie Reed, 20, pulled off the woman’s pyjama bottoms and knickers and pounced on her while she was asleep next to him, it is said. When she woke up, she allegedly felt Reed groping her and screamed for him to get out of her bedroom. Former public schoolboy Archie Reed, 20, denies attempting to rape and the assault by penetration of his former class mate after they met at a pub in Warren Street in London where they drank a bottle of wine . She had met Reed after a drinks reception hosted by top law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, and they spent the rest of the evening drinking wine at a pub in Warren Street . The woman, who was studying in London at the time, invited currency consultant Reed to stay the night as the Tube had stopped running, said prosecutor Dianne Chan. She said Reed pulled off her clothes, molested her and tried to rape her after she had gone to sleep. ‘She awoke to find Mr Reed on top of her and facing her’, she said. ‘She said she immediately told him to get off her and get out - she didn’t want to see him again. ‘He grabbed his things and he left. ‘She then noticed how her knickers and her pyjama shorts were off her and on the floor.’ Reed then deluged the woman with texts messages and calls, trying to apologise for what had happened, jurors were told. He sent a message after leaving her flat, saying: ‘I’m so sorry. I owe you everything, I’m so sorry. ‘Just give me a phone call to explain myself. I wasn’t doing it all I promise.’ The Old Bailey heard that the alleged victim invited Reed, pictured, back to her university accommodation as the Tube had stopped running . Reed and his alleged victim had gone to school together, at a top independent school that cannot be identified for legal reasons. ‘They met up because they wanted to catch up on their news’, said Ms Chan. ‘Their friendship was platonic, they were only friends.’ They agreed to meet on October 8 last year at the Northumberland Arms near Tottenham Court Road, and shared two bottles of wine until the early hours of the next morning. ‘She said he could stay the night, and this was not an unusual offer because she said in the past they had topped and tailed - slept together - on a sofa’, said Ms Chan. They held hands on the 20-minute walk home, something she said was usual for her with male friends, and they stopped off for a bite to eat along the way. At her halls of residence, she offered Reed a duvet and a pillow, but said he could get into bed with her instead of sleeping on the floor. After the alleged attack, she called her boyfriend in ‘hysterics’ and woke up a flatmate to tell her what had happened, said Ms Chan. ‘She said I’ve just been raped by Archie’, she said. ‘She woke up to find Archie on top of her having sex with her.’ The alleged attack was reported the following day, when she went with her boyfriend to a chemist to get the morning-after pill. Reed, after his arrest, told detectives they had kissed and ‘spooned’ in bed, and said she had encouraged him to stay for an extra bottle of wine at the pub. He said he offered to sleep on the floor, but she said he should lie next to her . Reed also said they had got undressed in front of each other before getting into bed. ‘She moved her bottom closer to him, so he thought - to use his words - he would go for it’, said Ms Chan. ‘The Crown say it was without her consent because she was asleep when he saw the opportunity to sexually abuse her. ‘He also removed her pyjama bottoms - that was just short of him going to have sexual intercourse with her.’ The alleged victim told police of the moment she woke up to find Reed on top of her in bed. In a statement she said: ‘I went to sleep, I think I went to sleep pretty quickly as I’d had a bit of wine. ‘I didn’t know how long I was asleep for. ‘I don’t know how much longer it was later, but I woke up and he was on top of me. ‘It was pitch black and I didn’t know what was actually happening. ‘I just panicked and said just get off me.’ The alleged victim told police that she awoke to find Reed, pictured, on top of her . She said Reed immediately moved away, as she told him to leave her bedroom. ‘He just jumped off the bed, grabbed everything on the floor, and as he was getting his stuff I said just don’t ever speak to me again’, she said. ‘Straight away I called my boyfriend, and I was trying to explain what was happening. ‘After a while on the phone, he said go and see your flatmate and make sure you are OK.’ She said she spoke to her flatmate then called her best friend from school. She then arranged to meet her boyfriend the next day at his house. She met Reed in the Northumberland Arms at around 9.10pm that night, having attended a drinks reception earlier in the evening. ‘He was sitting in the window’, she told the police officer, in a recorded interview played to the court. ‘I got there and he was having a pint. ‘He bought us a bottle of wine to share, and I was like get another bottle of wine and he also had a spirit and mixer. The Old Bailey heard that the alleged victim and Reed met up for the first time in a year following a school reunion in mid-September and agreed to meet again however, the alleged victim denies flirting with Reed . ‘We shared that bottle and that’s when the pub closed.’ Reed and the woman had shared a sofa after a New Year party, the court heard, but had ‘never’ been romantically linked, she told the court. Asked if they had exchanged flirty texts prior to meeting at the pub, she replied: ‘No, not at all.’ They agreed to meet up to share stories of their gap years, having attended a school reunion a couple of weeks earlier. She also agreed to go to a football match with Reed later in the week, but cancelled after the alleged attack. The woman, who cannot be identified, is in the witness box screened off from Reed in the dock. She denied flirting with Reed by text message in the weeks running up to the alleged attack. They had met up for the first time in a year in mid-September last year at a school reunion, and agree to meet again soon. Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC, defending Reed, suggested the messages may have been misinterpreted by him. ‘There was flirting between the two of you’, she suggested. ‘”It was great to see you, call me let’s meet up”, and you would end communications with a number of crosses and kisses. Sallie Bennett-Jenkins defending Reed said the content of the alleged victims' text messages 'could have been misinterpreted' by her client as she would end her communications with a number of crosses and kisses . ‘Do you agree that maybe taken to be somewhat flirtatious?’ The woman replied firmly: ‘No.’ ‘You were now single’, contributed Ms Bennett-Jenkins. ‘Do you think there’s a possibility your communication could have been misinterpreted?’ But she replied: ‘No they have always been like that.’ The woman told the court her boyfriend had known that Reed was allowed into her bed that night before she went to sleep. However, in her call to police, she suggested that Reed had not been in her bed before she fell asleep. She and Reed had slept on a sofa together when they were 14 or 15, at a house party for New Year with other friends sleeping in the same room. She told the court she had not given any romantic signals to Reed during the evening, or on the walk back to halls of residence. ‘We walked back, it was completely normal and we were laughing and joking and stuff’, she said. ‘We were holding hands - it sounds stupid but I had always done that with lots of guy friends, holding their hands.’ She said she was woken up by ‘the feeling of something inside me’ and could see Reed’s silhouette over her. Archie Reed, right, tried to call and text his alleged victim after the incident to explain what had happened . After kicking Reed out, she said she phoned her boyfriend then called Reed, as he had texted her begging for a chance to explain. ‘When I was on the phone, I was trying to ask what had happened and I couldn’t get a straight answer’, she said. ‘I got the impression something happened before I woke up. ‘I didn’t know how long it was between going to sleep and the time I woke up. ‘I just panicked quite a bit and started crying immediately. ‘I still had my vest on but my shorts and my knickers were both on the floor.’ She took a train to her boyfriend’s house the same day, and went to the pharmacy in the afternoon to get the morning-after pill. ‘I went to the Tesco pharmacy to get the emergency pill, and they obviously knew what had happened’, she said. ‘They obviously didn’t force me to, but they said you have the choice to call the police.’ She said her boyfriend was ‘angry’ at what had happened, but added that he was ‘really good about it’.

"By . James Salmon for the Daily Mail . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . Royal Bank of Scotland was accused of ‘learning nothing’ from the financial crisis after being fined £14.5million for giving unsuitable mortgage advice to tens of thousands of its customers. The City watchdog said the sales processes of RBS and subsidiary NatWest were not ‘fit for purpose’ and listed a series of astonishing failings that lasted until March 2013. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that about 30,000 customers were exposed to unsuitable advice. RBS has agreed to contact them to ask them if they have any concerns. The Royal Bank of Scotland has been fined £14.5 million after the City regulator found 'serious failings' in its advice to mortgage customers . In one case an adviser told a customer interest rates could hit 5.5 per cent and recommended they lock into a more expensive fixed-rate loan for five years. Advisers also routinely failed to check whether households could afford to repay their loans. This included older customers who were set to retire before the end of the term of the mortgage. Just two of a sample of 164 sales reviewed by the FCA were deemed to be suitable. The problems were flagged up to RBS by the regulator in November 2011, but were not rectified until March 2013. Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement and financial crime at the FCA, said: ‘Taking out a mortgage is one of the most important financial decisions we can make. ‘Poor advice could cost someone their home so it’s vital that the advice process is fit for purpose. Both firms failed to ensure that their customers were getting the best advice for them.’ John Mann, a Labour member of the influential Treasury Select Committee, said the sanction was not tough enough. ‘This fine is peanuts for RBS,’ he said. ‘We need a criminal investigation. Ross McEwan, who ran the RBS retail unit from August 2012 until his promotion to group chief executive in October last year, said the mortgage advice failings were 'unacceptable and should never have happened' ‘This bank obviously hasn’t learned its lessons from the financial crisis and no one has had the decency to take responsibility for wrongdoing.' It is the sixth time in four years that the state-backed lender has been fined, having already been penalised for rigging Libor interest rates and breaching rules against money laundering. RBS has said in response to the findings at the end of 2012, it overhauled its mortgage sales process and re-trained all mortgage advisers (file picture) But the catalogue of failings in its mortgage advice is arguably the most damaging for the high street giant, which is currently on a mission to boost its mortgage lending and win back the public’s trust. Banks, including RBS, were blamed for triggering the financial crisis, in part by lending recklessly to households and businesses that could not afford to pay back the money. In its report, the FCA revealed this reckless approach had continued, with sales staff at RBS and NatWest failing to go through basic checks to determine whether customers could afford a mortgage. Instead of checking a customer’s income and outgoings, RBS sales staff relied heavily on generic information on household spending published by the Office for National Statistics. They also lent money to customers in financial difficulty who were seeking to consolidate their debts into their mortgage. In one case, a salesman committed 16 ‘professional standards failings’ of which ten were considered to be ‘detrimental’ to the customer. Despite this the salesman was given ‘back-to-basics coaching’ and allowed to continue to sell to the public. The bank said yesterday it had ‘completely overhauled’ its sales process and in November 2012 put around 350 mortgage advisers on an intensive four-month training course during which time they were not allowed to provide advice. Chief executive Ross McEwan admitted that the service had been ‘unacceptable and should never have happened’.","City regulator reviewed 164 sales between June 2011 and March 2013 .

"By . Associated Press . and Chris Spargo For Mailonline . A woman accused of using a pound of bacon to start a fire in her ex-boyfriend's house will stand trial on arson charges. Cameo Crispi, a 32 year-old mother from Uintah County, Utah, was arrested on March 14 after her ex contacted police to say that she had been harassing him and he wanted her to stop -- and leave his home. She had repeatedly called and texted her former flame, who was not home at the time, while at his residence, where she left the bacon over a lit burner. Cameo Crispi in her mug shot (pictured left) and on Facebook (pictured right) has been charged with setting her ex's home on fire by leaving a pound of bacon on the stove and scattering hot coals on the floor . When officers arrived on the scene, they saw smoke flowing out the front door, and noted that Crispi was drunk, the Deseret News reported. Inside, they found hot coals on the floor around an open wood stove and the burned bacon. Crispi's blood-alcohol level was 0.346, four times the legal limit, according to charging documents. 'I asked to come in and observed a wood stove left open with a fire burning inside and hot coals on the floor around the stove,' the responding officer wrote in his report.. 'I observed the burner to be on the setting ""High"" and the bacon to be severely burned and smoking badly.' After containing the fire, the officer arrested Crispi. Crispi appears at her preliminary hearing in Vernal, Utah earlier today . According to the initial charges, when asked by a doctor following the incident what had happened, Crispi stated she was 'attempting to start a fire in the house to get back at (her ex-boyfriend).' She is due back in court in October to face arson, burglary and other charges. Her attorney, Clint E. Hendricks, declined to comment.","Cameo Crispi was arrested in March after putting out a fire she started with bacon at her ex-boyfriend's house .

Michael Lucarelli was arrested Tuesday morning at his apartment on the Upper East Side and immediately faced Manhattan Federal Courthouse. The 51-year-old director of market intelligence at Lippert/Heilshorn & Associates allegedly used non-public information from draft press releases to cash in on the stock market. He has been hit with with 13 counts of security fraud charges, according to The New York Daily News.

However, after posting a $500,000 bond and pleading not guilty, Lucarelli attempted to exit without being seen. After noticing photographers, he put his hands up over his face and started to run. And he after losing one of his shoes, he kept on going, leaving the Brown sandal on Worth St. Lippert/Heilshorn founding partner Keith Lippert described Lucarelli as a 'rogue employee' and 'selfish' following his arrest. 'It’s very disconcerting, when you run a company for 30 years that prides itself on its honesty and integrity, and of its employees in dealing with clients’ non-public information, to have to deal with a rogue employee who, despite the firewalls in place and the rules and regulations, obviously completely ignored it for his own selfish gain,' Lippert told The New York Business Journal. Lucarelli, who was hired by the firm in August 2012, is facing 20 years prison and up to $1 million in fines. The 13 charges date back to August 2013. 'Despite the well-known parade of convicted insider trading perpetrators over the past several years, Michael Lucarelli was not deterred and violated both his company's policies and his responsibility to its clients,' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a release. George Venizelos, head of the New York FBI office, said that rather than doing his job, Lucarelli 'spent his days setting up brokerage accounts to make illegal trades using inside information from unwitting clients'.

"By . Damien Gayle for MailOnline . and Rex Features . At just 4ft 6in tall, Xiong Chaogui has faced his share of discrimination. In 1983 he was denied a chance to go to university because of his height. He was stuck apparently without prospects in his impoverished village of Yaolong, in Maguang, a county of south-west China's Yunnan Province. But he did not allow the knock-back to make him bitter. Mr Xiong has instead dedicated his life to helping others whose small size has rendered them second-class citizens in China's ruthless economic boom: the children left behind. Pint-sized: Chinese headteacher Xiong Chaogui is, at 4ft 6in tall, shorter than many of his young charges. Because of a shortage of teachers in his local area, he also teaches mathematics at his school . Mr Xiong at home with his wife and son: He is headmaster for a school of children whose parents have left them in their impoverished village while they travel to the city to earn enough money to make ends meet . Mr Xiong with his father: He was refused a place at university in 1985 because of his height so, denied a chance to escape the grinding poverty of his home town, he instead decided to help the children there . The issue of left-behind children is a massive and growing problem in China. With the country's urbanisation, millions of farmers have been forced to take up jobs in the city to survive, leaving their children at home. According to a report released by All China Women's Federation in 2013, the number of left-behind children in China had reached more than 60million. Two years after he was refused a place at university, in 1985, Mr Xiong started his first class for left-behind children. In 1989, he was hired for a teaching job by a local elementary school, and in 2007 he was elected the headmaster of Yao Long Elementary School. Mr Xiong is not only the headmaster but, due to a lack of teaching staff, also teaches maths at the school. Yaolong village has a population of 3,357, most of them are ethnic minorities. The village is famous for its poverty and remoteness. Most of its adults have left home to find work in cities, leaving behind only old people and children. Student Wang Yuan in class wearing traditional clothes: Yaolong village has a population of 3,357, most of them are ethnic minorities. The village is famous for its poverty and remoteness . Left behind: Hou Guoyan hasn't seen his parents for years. He has no stationery but pencil stubs . Little man, big heart: Mr Xiong takes graduation pictures for 6th graders who tower over him . Innocent happiness: Luo Chaogui cartwheeling down a road with other pupils . Making his own fun: Wang Chenggong plays with pebbles in the school yard . Big dreams: Six-year-old Han Rongqi with a careworn basketball . The school now has a total of 279 students, with 169 boarders who live more than 45 minutes' walk away. Among the boarding students, there are also 50 pre-school age students, whose parents left them to Mr Xiong's care. Mr Xiong said: 'The school has 279 students, most of whom are left-behind children. Each student has a sad story and many of whom even can't remember the appearance of their parents.' Mr Xiong gets up every day at 5.30am. Before doing anything else, he checks to make sure there is hot and cold water for his young charges. At 6am, he rings the first bell, breaking the quiet on the campus. The lights in the dorms light up one by one. Pupils dress and line up before water taps, waiting for the morning wash to start the day. At 6:40am, all pupils go into classrooms. But not Mr Xiong. He instead walks through each dormitory. He needs to know if any student was too sick to get up, or whether there's students missing from the dorms, then he'll contact the children's guardians. One of the school's dormitories: Mr Xiong rings the bell for the new day every morning at 6am . Pupils waiting for a meal: The school now has a total of 279 students, 50 of whom are pre-school age .

Jiao's father called Mr Xiong a 'great person' These pictures show Mr Xiong taking pupils Huang Jiao and Lu Jifang to the town to buy some necessities, including trousers and shoes. Many parents stay in the city all year round, so Mr Xiong must use the money they send him to look after their children's needs. At Mr Xiong's office, he has a chart which contains all the contact information of the guardians of the students. He also keeps dozens of accounting books, recording clearly the remittance amounts and expenses details. Each semester Mr Xiong scans the books and emails their contents to each guardian for their records. Huang Zhengrong's child is a fourth-grader in the school. Mr Huang entrusted the guardian rights to Mr Xiong, sending money regularly for him to look after his daughter. 'Headmaster Xiong is a great person. He records each expenses clearly with my daughter's signature. I owe him lots of gratitudes,' he said. The village has no clinic, so Mr Xiong has also taught himself some basic medical knowledge. He administers medicine to sick students and, if they become severely ill, takes them to a clinic dozens of miles away in the neighbouring village. Mr Xiong said: 'I received tons of discriminations since childhood, but there are more people who are helpful, which pulls me out of self-pity and helps me go through the difficult times. 'I know how important it is having help from others. 'If I don't care about the children, who would do it?'","Xiong Chaogui teaches children left behind by parents who move to cities .

Scroll down for video . How many three-seater sofas can you fit into a tiny Skoda? This family has gone viral trying to figure out the answer to that question . The three family members were seen trying to negotiate the sofa into the back of their mid-90s Skoda - but appeared to have a lot of difficulty . No matter what angle they tried, the sofa just didn't want to squeeze into the back of the car . The hilarious footage - which has gone viral - was filmed by Graeme Longden, who saw the scene . unfold as he peered out of his bedroom window in Sheffield . At one point during the hopeless attempt, one of the group even removed the cushions from the sofa - but it didn't make the blindest bit of difference. The footage was filmed by Graeme Longden, 44, who recorded the scene from his bedroom window in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. After filming for a few minutes, he raced downstairs to try and get a closer look. But, by the time he got downstairs, the family - consisting of two women, the driver and two children - had gone. He said: 'I can only think that they drove off with the sofa wedged in the back.' Mr Longden posted the clip on Facebook and, within days, it went viral. It now has more than 62,000 shares. After several failed attempts, one of the group had a brainwave - to remove the cushions from the sofa .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . Nobody likes to part with their money to pay a dreaded parking fine but a trainee paramedic did just that for a complete stranger who was visiting her dying mother. After spending sleepless nights in a palliative care home in Melbourne by her mother’s side, Rosemary Morgan was slapped with a parking fine and put it in her handbag to deal with at a later date. But just a few days later Mrs Morgan was astonished to receive a handwritten note in the post from paramedic Marc Primrose, who had helped transport Mrs Morgan’s mother to her house to spend her final days, saying he paid the $29 fine which he had found in the ambulance. ‘Most people would’ve picked that up and thrown that in the bin and not have given it a second thought,’ Mrs Morgan told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We just couldn’t believe that a stranger would bother to do that for someone.’ Trainee paramedic Marc Primrose found the $29 fine in his ambulance and decided to pay the fee as a kind gesture to Rosemary Morgan who was dealing with her mother's final days . Mr Primrose sent the receipt for the paid infringement and a post-it note explaining why he had decided to pay the fine. ‘I also wanted to pay the fine for you given the difficult time you and your family are going through,’ the note said. Once getting over the passing of her mother, Mrs Morgan began to ring around a few weeks ago to find out where Mr Primrose worked to thank him for his kind gesture. ‘Everyone I spoke to said “that’s him - he’s just genuinely nice person – he’s like that all of the time”,’ she said. ‘He’s in his second year in paramedics at uni so he’s perfect for the job – it’s nice to know there are people out there like him looking after others.’ Rosemary (right) and her sister Karen Morgan with a photo of their mother, Doreen, who passed away in July . She was able to meet up with Mr Primrose recently to express her gratitude in person. ‘He takes it all in his stride – he doesn’t think he’s done anything too fantastic but we are the opposite we think it’s extremely kind,’ she said. ‘So we wanted him to get some sort of recognition because every time you turn on the TV somebody is ripping somebody off all of the time and this just so the opposite.’ Mrs Morgan said although the cost of the fine was only $29 – it meant so much more to her and the rest of her family. ‘To us it didn’t matter how much it was - it may as well have been $1,000,’ she said. ‘He’s going to uni so I’m sure he’s got uni fees so for him to do that is fantastic.’","Rosemary Morgan received a parking fine after visiting her dying mother in hospital in Melbourne .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Rory McIlroy allowed himself a two-day celebration after winning The Open at Hoylake. After winning his first World Golf Championship title on Sunday, it was more like two hours. Monday lunchtime and the Northern Irishman was back at work, on a scouting trip for the season’s final major, the US PGA Championship at Valhalla this week. Greatness waits for no man. VIDEO Scroll down to watch The Open & World Golf Championship highlights . Champion: McIlroy with his trophy after winning the WGC-Bridgestone invitational at Firestone Country club . Duel: McIlroy and Ryder Cup team-mate Sergio Garcia finished first and second at the Open and at the WGC . Form: The Northern Irishman said he was proud to follow up his Open victory with a similar performance . VIDEO WGC Bridgestone Invitational - Final Round highlights . We have seen wondrous golf from him before, and stretches of rare brilliance. But what we are seeing right now is on another level. It is not what very good or even top-class golfers do. It is what men who define eras do. ‘I just want to see how many titles I can win and then enjoy them at the end of the year,’ he said. ‘I know I’ve have had some success this season but I do feel I’ve a few more left in me.’ There has only been one golfer in my working lifetime for whom Open Championships were not enough or WGCs, and so the symmetry at the Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday was perfect, if somewhat poignant. As poor Tiger Woods was being led from the scene crocked, his days of thinking like this shattered forever, his successor strode into the arena looking the epitome of athleticism. Not since Woods was in his prime have we seen a mood descend like the one over the back nine at Firestone on Sunday. The margin between McIlroy and the luckless Sergio Garcia was only a stroke for much of the time, yet the final outcome did not feel in doubt. ‘I’ve never felt so comfortable trying to close out a tournament,’ said McIlroy. ‘It felt like the first or second round rather than the fourth.’ When a player reaches that stage, he is in the happiest place of all. And when you combine it with McIlroy’s gifts and single-minded pursuit of maximising them, we are back in Tiger territory, where the opposition feel intimidated before they begin. Garcia is playing as well as he has for a decade and began with a three-stroke lead. But never did you sense a player who felt he could truly win. The Spaniard has been one of the best drivers of the ball for 15 years but looked positively cowed next to the awesome McIlroy. Watching on television, Tony Jacklin, no mean driver of the ball himself in his heyday, came to a momentous conclusion: ‘In all my time in the game, I’ve never seen anyone drive the ball like Rory did last week.’ Jack Nicklaus defined his era by dominating the opposition with the elixir of power and accuracy from the tee, and when he managed to putt well into the bargain, he won. No 1: After victories at the Open and WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, McIlroy is now top of the world rankings . Sealed with a kiss: Rory McIlroy finally gets his hands - and lips - on the Claret Jug at Hoylake in July . VIDEO The Open Championship - Final Round highlights . That is how McIlroy will do it as well. OK, the fairways at Firestone last week were soft, and the ball was not rolling into the rough. That will certainly improve a man’s driving-accuracy stats. Against that they were narrow targets, particularly if you are flying the ball more than 325 yards through the air. Yet McIlroy missed just two fairways per round, and not one all week by a sizeable margin. It was stunning to behold. Why has it all gone right for McIlroy? The bottom line is he has fallen head over heels back in love with his sport. He has ditched all the baggage and re-dedicated himself. Winner: Rory McIlroy has won his third Grand Slam at the age of 25, becoming only the third to do so . Rory McIlroy's success at the Bridgestone Invitational owed a lot to his driving. The 25-year-old led the field in driving distance with an average of 334.8 yards, and, remarkably maintained a high level of accuracy at 60.71 per cent (tied 12th) missing just nine out of 56 fairways. Typically, someone who hits it as far as McIlroy ranks low down in terms of accuracy. Bubba Watson is No 1 for distance this season with an average of 314.8 yards but 98th for accuracy. Was his former fiancee Caroline Wozniacki’s remark in April that she would like children a turning point? McIlroy was not ready for children. He is 25 and wants trophies, not babies. ‘I never wanted to be a normal person growing up,’ he said last week. ‘I wanted to be the golfer who wins majors.’ After Caroline went, the next thing was the Olympic question that had been hanging over him, and who he would represent at Rio. Then he had a long sitdown with Nicklaus, the man who has come to look upon Rory with the same affection as one of his many grandchildren. Do not underestimate that 90-minute conversation the pair had at the end of May in all we are seeing now. Nicklaus always recognised that McIlroy was a once-in-a-generation talent. He was only too happy to dwell on the fine details to help bring it out. I know I have banged on about McIlroy ad nauseam over the years, to the annoyance of some readers. ‘Why do you keep writing about him? He is not that good,’ was the gist. But the point always was that he is that good. Lead from the front: McIlroy now only needs to win The Masters to complete a career Grand Slam . Now, with everything pointing in the right direction, there is every chance the next few years will be the most exciting in the history of European golf. No, he will not dominate to the extent Tiger did. He will not end up with 79 PGA Tour victories. But if he can keep all the melodrama at bay — a big if, admittedly, on the evidence of the past few years — he should be winning five times or more each season and quite a few of them should be majors. Back in March, McIlroy sat down with a few golf writers and made a comment that now carries particular resonance. ‘I think the game is crying out for someone to take it by the scruff of the neck and dominate and, of course, I’d like that golfer to be me,’ he said. Now someone has and, yes, it is him. So settle back. Rory has got the aura and when a golfer acquires that, an era surely follows.","Northern Irishman followed up his Open victory with a win at Firestone in the WGC Bridgestone Invitational .

Finally a man scrambles up to the top of an archway and batters a cross down into the courtyard below. Scroll down for video . Torched: The attackers set fire to cars within the church compound . More gang members then surround the fallen cross and pulverise it with sticks. The six-minute video, obtained by MidEast Christian news, was shot on August 14. On the same day in Cairo, pro-Morsi street camps erupted into protest and security forces shot dead more than 600 people, sparking yet more violence and bloodshed across Egypt. The news site claims that the crowd - apparently made up of men and some children - had become enraged by the eviction of pro-Morsi supporters from the Cairo camps. The video begins from a vantage point outside the church walls. Subtitles explain that the attackers entered the church and chanted 'We sacrifice our souls and blood to save Islam'. The view then moves inside the church, where, according to subtitles, 'One of the attackers ordered his partner to break the cross.' Amid billowing black smoke, one man helps another to climb to the cross at the top of an arch. 'They chant ""God is great"" as the cross is broken,' read the subtitles, as the man tears the cross down and throws it to the crowd below. Coptic Christians say dozens of their churches have been attacked by members and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood following the ousting of Morsi on July 3. Critics say the former president was aiming to turn Egypt into an Islamist state. Christians make up about ten percent of Egypt’s population of 80 million, but Morsi supporters have blamed them for his downfall, according to Coptic leaders. Bishop Makarios, a Coptic leader from Minya, accused Muslim Brotherhood leaders of planning attacks on Christian churches, homes and businesses in an effort to further divide the nation.

The cross is pushed off the top of the arch into the courtyard below . The waiting crowd surrounds the cross and breaks it into pieces with shouts of 'God is great' 'We were expecting this scenario weeks before sit-ins were broken up, as it was evident of the incitement being made by Brotherhood leaders against Copts,' Makarious told MidEast Christian News. 'We were then surprised by the systematic attacks on churches and Copts’ properties, many of them occurring at the same time in different places, in a series of attacks made under a plan they called ""Plan B"", which targeted all churches to be burned and destroyed.' The provisional military government has pledged to rebuild Christian churches destroyed by mobs.","New video shows attack on church in Sohag diocese, southern Egypt .

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . An elderly woman suffering from dementia made the heartbreaking decision to take her own life before the crippling disease did. Gillian Bennett, born in Christchurch, New Zealand, but who lived in Bowen Island, in British Columbia in Canada with her husband Jonathan Bennett, penned a heartbreaking letter explaining her decision before her death last week. 'I will take my life today around noon. It is time. Dementia is taking its toll and I have nearly lost myself. I have nearly lost me. Jonathan, the straightest and brightest of men, will be at my side as a loving witness,' the letter began. Scroll down for video . Gillian Bennett (right) pictured with her loving husband Jonathan (left) made the decision to take her own life last week before she succumbed to Dementia . The touching piece which spanned almost 2000 words, described in detail the crippling and deteriorative toll that dementia had already had on Mrs Bennett's life. The woman also made a passionate case for one's right to end their own life. The 85-year-old great-grandmother is survived by her husband, their two children, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. In the letter she detailed the impact her suffering would inevitably have on her family and friends, but also the healthcare system in Canada. 'Understand that I am giving up nothing that I want by committing suicide. All I lose is an indefinite number of years of being a vegetable in a hospital setting, eating up the country's money but having not the faintest idea of who I am,' Mrs Bennett wrote. The couple had been married nearly six decades but it was illegal for Jonathan  to assist his wife, so he simply stayed by her side as she slipped away . Speaking to the NZ Herald on Wednesday, Gillian's loving husband told of the moment his wife slipped away from him, laying on a mattress at the back of their Bowen Island home in one of her favourite spots. 'It happened amazingly quickly. After about half an hour her eyes were open but I couldn't see her, her chest was not moving. It looked like she was gone. I waited another half hour and then I called our doctor and then the police were called,' Mr Bennett told the publication. He also revealed the difficulty he faced in not being able to assist her, as it is illegal to do so in Canada and many other parts of the world. Mr Bennett said he took comfort in the fact he could be by his wife of almost six decades' side. Eighteen years ago Mr and Mrs Bennett retired to their home they call The Ruin in Bowen Island, Canada . 'I knew all along what she was going to do, and that is legal. She was extremely anxious not to get anyone in any legal or criminal trouble', he said, . In the letter Mrs Bennett opened up about her internal battle with the disease, and the feeling of each day losing parts of herself heading towards an inevitable end of not knowing who she was anymore. 'I know as I write these words that within six months or nine months or twelve months, I, Gillian, will no longer be here. What is to be done with my carcass? It will be physically alive but there will be no one inside,' Mrs Bennett wrote. She passed away at the back of her home overlooking one of her favourite spots, and Mrs Bennett's letter has reignited the debate about the right to die with dignity . The moving piece ended with a peaceful sentiment, and an urge for people to reconsider the laws which surround assisted deaths. 'Today, now, I go cheerfully and so thankfully into that good night. Jonathan, the courageous, the faithful, the true and the gentle, surrounds me with company. I need no more.' Since its publication last week, the letter has opened up widespread debate about whether the world needs to reconsider its tough constraints on people assisting their loved ones to make the decision to end their own lives pass away in peace.

"By . Arthur Martin for the Daily Mail . and Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . Created: . 17:02 EST, 27 August 2014 . Rotherham's crime tsar quit the Labour Party last night following a day of calls for him to resign from his £85,000-a-year post in the wake of the child exploitation scandal. Shaun Wright pre-empted attempts to sack him by resigning from the party – but vowed to remain in his role as an independent Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire. He shrugged off any blame for the scandal, despite having been the Labour councillor responsible for children’s services in Rotherham from 2005 to 2010 when the abuse of vulnerable girls by Asian men was at its worst. Scroll down for video . Rotherham's crime tsar Shaun Wright was yesterday urged to quit his £85,000-a-year post by his own party over the child exploitation scandal . In a statement on his website, he wrote: ‘I entered into public service over 20 years ago to make a positive difference. ‘Protecting vulnerable people has been my number one priority as Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire. ‘I . have had to make the difficult decision to stand down from the Labour . Party and it’s with deep regret that I’ve come to that decision.’ Mr . Wright sparked incredulity yesterday by claiming the damning report . highlighting the abuse of at least 1,400 girls over 16 years came as ‘a . huge surprise’. In an astonishing interview, he said: ‘I don’t think any of this was my direct fault.’ Earlier, Labour had warned it would suspend him from the party if he had not resigned by this morning. Mr Wright insisted he had taken action to prevent the sickening attacks . and was ‘proud of the progress South Yorkshire Police has made’ – even . though it has brought few abusers to justice. He . went on to claim he had not received the three key official reports . that described growing child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. Mr Wright shrugged off any blame for the scandal, despite having been the Labour councillor responsible for children's services in the town from 2005 to 2010 when the abuse of vulnerable girls by Asian men was at its worst . Asked by Sky News whether he had seen them, he said: ‘It was not escalated to senior management level. ‘I didn’t see any of the reports in 2002 or 2003. The report in 2006 didn’t come to me.’ But . the investigation into the scandal, commissioned by the council from . Professor Alexis Jay, says he received a report entitled Protection Of . Young People From Sexual Assault In Rotherham in June 2007. He also received two further reports on sexual exploitation in 2008 and a further one in 2009, according to Professor Jay. She . said that when he took over responsibility for the protection of . vulnerable young people in 2005, councillors and senior officials at the . authority were fully aware of the sexual exploitation in the town.Seminars for senior managers at the council presented the abuse ‘in the most explicit terms’, Professor Jay added. He claimed he had not seen the previous three official reports, published in 2002, 2003 and 2006, which described growing child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. But the investigation into the scandal, commissioned by the council from Professor Alexis Jay, says he received a report . After . council leader Roger Stone quit on Tuesday, senior Labour and Tory . politicians yesterday called on Mr Wright to resign, too. A Labour Party . spokesman said: ‘The report into child abuse in Rotherham was . devastating in its findings. ‘Vulnerable . children were repeatedly abused and then let down. In the light of this . report, it is appropriate that South Yorkshire police and crime . commissioner Shaun Wright should step down.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed . Balls, who was children’s secretary in the last Labour government, . admitted the party could not force Mr Wright to quit. He . told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: ‘The Labour Party has no power to . compel somebody who has been elected as a police and crime commissioner . to stand down. ‘But it is absolutely our view that he should do so. That . is something which has been communicated to him today. We need to show . that we, not just in Rotherham but across the country, can command . public confidence to keep children safe. ‘Lessons . have got to be learned. But when you have a failure of this magnitude . and catastrophe, people have to take responsibility.' Children as young as 11 were doused in petrol and threatened with fire and told not to speak out in the town (pictured) the report revealed . Shadow . Home Secretary Yvette Cooper added: ‘We have said we think the police . and crime commissioner should stand down, just as the leader of the . council has done, because 1,400 children were abused  and they were let . down badly by the authorities.’ Home . Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Shaun Wright obviously has had involvement . in this, both as his role as a councillor and obviously he’s now the . police and crime commissioner. ‘It’s . not my job as Home Secretary to hire and fire police and crime . commissioners ... I believe he has real questions to answer and I think . in the circumstances he should heed those calls.’ During . a series of interviews with broadcasters yesterday, Mr Wright said he . quit his role on Rotherham Council in 2010 when the scale of sexual . abuse began to emerge. He said there was no need for him to resign again . over the same issue. Mr . Wright said: ‘I take my share of the responsibility. There was systemic . failure and I only wish that I knew more at the time. ‘If . I knew then what I know now, then clearly more could have been done. I . think I took appropriate actions where that was available. I’m . completely astonished by the scale of the issue that has been . identified. ‘I’m just as disgusted as any other right-thinking person in Rotherham and across the country to the scale of this problem. 'I . have sought to do everything in my power during any role that I have . held, both as a council cabinet member and now as South Yorkshire PCC to . make that difference and to protect and safeguard more children.’ Mr . Wright, who lives in Rotherham, wrote about himself on his website: . ‘People who know me describe me as a man of integrity with a strong . track record in championing ordinary people.’ He also promised to ‘protect the most vulnerable in our society’. Denis Macshane said he did not look further into . the town's child abuse sex scandal because he is a 'true Guardian reader . and liberal leftie' and 'did not want to rock the multi-cultural boat' Political correctness stopped left-wing politicians and council officials from doing more to expose the abuse scandal, Rotherham’s former MP said yesterday. Denis MacShane accepted he should have done more but said his own ‘liberal leftie’ background made him reluctant to speak out over abuse allegations against Muslim men. The shamed former Labour politician, who was jailed over the expenses scandal and is no longer a member of the party, said: ‘I should have burrowed into this. Perhaps, yes, as a true Guardian reader and a liberal leftie I suppose, I didn’t want to raise that too hard.’ Mr MacShane blamed a ‘culture of not wanting to rock the multi-cultural unity boat’ for the failure by numerous agencies and individuals to expose the child exploitation. He has previously admitted that he, like other politicians, had feared losing Muslim votes if he aired ‘the dirty secrets about bad practices in the Kashmiri Muslim community’. The damning report into the scandal said council staff feared they would be branded racist if they discussed the allegations with the Pakistani community – even though the victims had described the majority of the men involved as Asian. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, yesterday said it could ‘definitely not’ have been considered racist to investigate the abuse. Muhbeen Hussain, founder of British Muslim Youth, told the BBC the ethnicity of the majority of the abusers did not mean the scandal should have been kept quiet. Children’s Commissioner for England Maggie Atkinson said she considered it racist for the issue not to have been raised within the community. She told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: ‘It’s actually racist for anybody to consider that – were you to approach that community – it wouldn’t take seriously what you were raising.’ Mr MacShane, who was jailed for six months after he admitted submitting fake invoices in his expenses, told World At One the abuse was never raised with him personally in his 18 years as Rotherham MP from 1994 to 2012. He admitted he was aware of the allegations from Press reports. In his book Prison Diaries, published earlier this year after his release from Brixton, Mr MacShane said he was one of many politicians who chose not to speak out about ‘dirty secrets’ because of the fear of losing Muslim votes. He wrote: ‘I feel ashamed that I too, like so many MPs, preferred to keep silent on some of the dirty secrets about bad practices in the Kashmiri Muslim community.’ Claims were made last night that some Labour councillors may have turned a blind eye to child sex abuse because they needed the Asian vote. Former Labour sources described a culture where councillors acted as ‘Mafia bosses’ and told their constituents that they could ‘do anything for them’ to keep them on side. They told the Mail: ‘Rotherham Council is horrendously corrupt. There is a large Asian contingency and a strong Labour vote among the ethnic community so they may have turned a blind eye to things to keep their votes.’","Shaun Wright responsible for .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Space junk is a growing problem in Earth orbit, with hundreds of thousands of pieces of debris thought to be a threat to satellites. To track some of these hazardous objects Lockheed Martin has announced it will partner with Electro Optic Systems. And using technology found in modern telescopes they will monitor as much debris as possible. A new space debris tracking site is to be build in Western Australia to tackle the ground problem of junk in orbit (illustration shown). The site will be built by Lockheed Martin and Electro Optic Systems. It will compliment existing sites like the US Air Force's Space Fence . The space debris tracking site will be based in Western Australia and will compliment an existing service run by the US Air Force known as the Space Fence, which tracks over 200,000 objects. Since the first object, Sputnik 1, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of hundreds of thousands of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites. One major source of debris in the past was a Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere. Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a U.S. communications satellite and a defunct Russian military probe over Siberia. The new site will use a combination of lasers and sensitive optical systems like those found in telescopes to detect, track and characterise man-made debris objects. It will focus on specific objects to determine how fast they’re moving, what direction they’re spinning and what they’re made of. ‘Ground-based space situational awareness is a growing priority for government and commercial organisations around the world that need to protect their investments in space,’ said Rick Ambrose, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin Space Systems. ‘Through this agreement with Electro Optic Systems, we’ll offer customers a clearer picture of the objects that could endanger their satellites, and do so with great precision and cost-effectiveness.’ Most will be familiar with Lockheed Martin, headquartered in Maryland, who are one of the largest defense and aerospace companies in the world. But Electro Optic Systems might be more unknown; they’re an Australian company that develops and produces a wide range of space-related technologies including telescopes and beam directors. They are among the largest producers of major optical telescopes in the world, and currently operate the Space Research Centre, a satellite laser ranging and debris tracking facility, at Mount Stromlo in the Australian Capital Territory. Space debris can be a problem, as seen in this picture of a hole caused by orbital debris that was found in Nasa's Solar Maximum Mission when it was serviced aboard Space Shuttle Challenger in 1984. Hundreds of thousands of pieces of debris are thought to be in orbit . 'The partnership with Lockheed Martin will help both organisations establish a global network of space sensors, while simultaneously increasing the market reach of the partners’ data and services,' said Electro Optic Systems Chief Executive Officer Ben Greene. 'We consider the strategic partnership with Lockheed Martin a major step towards the achievement of critical mass of sensors, data and services, all of which are critical in providing detailed yet easily usable information on space debris.' According to Nasa more than 500,000 pieces of debris are orbiting Earth at speeds of more than 17,500 miles (28,000 kilometres) per hour. At this speed a piece as small as a golf ball could smash a satellite to pieces. Some have even suggested we may be heading towards a ‘Kessler syndrome’-type event. This was envisaged in the 2013 movie Gravity, which portrayed a satellite collision that sparked a chain reaction where debris increasingly impacted other satellites, creating more debris in the process. This has led many companies and agencies to draw up plans to reduce the amount of space debris in Earth orbit, such as proposals to drag debris down with magnetic nets or lasers.","A new space debris tracking site is to be build in Western Australia to tackle the ground problem of junk in orbit .

"By . Chris Lawrence . It is the dead of night on the edge of the Arctic Circle, and the sun is about to kiss the horizon. Much of Iceland may be sleeping, but 20 minutes past midnight represents the limit of the sun’s descent on this clear June night. In an hour, the sky’s amber glow will be supplanted by beams of white light which last for nearly 24 hours in summertime. The villages are silent and the roads dead – except for a faint, rolling mass of mist, which drifts over from the wetlands, across the tarmac and down the hill towards the cliffs and the north Atlantic. On the road to the end of the earth: Iceland bathes in an ethereal light in high summer . I am in a minibus, having taken a 40-minute flight from Reykjavik to the tiny city of Akureyri on Iceland’s northern shore. My stomach is swimming with coffee – an insurance policy against the lateness of the moment. For I am here to explore Iceland’s wonders while the rest of the world sleeps – to see what the witching hour looks like when the sun never sets. Welcome to the white nights of northern Iceland: the land of the midnight sun. Road to somewhere: The Route 1 'Ring Road' runs around Iceland, linking the remote north to Reykjavik . First, a little science: . Our planet’s 23-degree tilt robs the polar extremities of that which most of the world takes for granted: the continuous, inevitable oscillation of night and day. For those countries at the northernmost and southernmost edges of the globe, summer is a season of unremitting exposure to the sun. At the North Pole, it does not set for six months. Instead, it steadily spirals higher above the earth, before eventually beginning its descent and disappearing for the rest of the year. And even though Akureyri lies 60 miles below the Arctic Circle, it too experiences one near-endless day that stretches from the earliest minutes of June to the dying embers of July. Anton Freyr Birgisson – the son of a generation of farmers from nearby Lake Myvatn, and my guide through this twilight realm – is accustomed to the unbroken light. A place lost in its own little realm: The fishing town of Akureyri sits on Iceland's northern shore . ‘It is no problem for me,’ he says, as he steers the minibus out of Akureyri, and across the dam that bridges the noiseless fjord. ‘I sleep with the curtains open – but I bet you will find it strange. My wife is from Estonia and she can’t sleep.’ It is 10pm, and we are driving east. The road climbs above the fjord’s eastern shore, passing a steaming stream of hot water. Then, through lengthening purple shadows, it crosses lava fields towards the cloud of spray on the horizon. This is Goðafoss. It is among the most spectacular of Iceland’s waterfalls. Today, it is raging. In the depths of winter, its 12-metre-high torrents are frozen solid. But beneath the midnight sun, the snow atop the mountains is finally melting – rolling down the valley in a tumult of sound and spray. In-mid June, the waters are at their most ferocious. Halting above the horizon: During June and July, the sun does not set on Iceland . It was in this maelstrom, in around 1000AD, that modern Iceland was born. Until 700AD the island had been an empty rock at the top of the world, uninhabited for 17million years. Explorers knew it was there, but believed it to be the domain of diabolical dog-headed people. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the rest of the planet stayed away. When the first settlers eventually arrived, they brought arguments about power, wealth and religion – and, by the turn of the 11th century, civil war between pagans and Christians looked inevitable. Only when the chief ‘law-speaker’ Þorgeir – a pagan – converted, was conflict averted. On his way home from the parliament of elders which passed for rule in Iceland at the time, he neared the waterfall – and cast his abandoned idols into its depths. Thus the name: Goðafoss, the Waterfall of the Gods. We leave the road at Goðafoss, and turn north to race the sun towards the horizon. Taking a shine to the surroundings: Chris glimpsed the midnight sun from the very northern edge of Iceland . Anton takes us over lava fields where astronauts once trained for the moon landings, through the fishing town of Husavik – now sleeping in the midnight gloom. Then we reach the cliffs at Tjörnes, just in time to see the sun lower its brow to meet the ocean. It is twenty past midnight. Puffins nesting in the rocks sleep without murmur, and the only movement is the bobbing head of a seal, emerging intermittently at the foot of the cliffs. From the edge of the sheer drop to the black sand at the water’s edge, there is a near-unimpeded view to the Arctic Circle. The only distraction is the faint blur of the island of Grímsey on the horizon. This lost outcrop is Iceland’s most northerly point – home to just 100 people and a million sea birds. Roar: Legend has it the Godafoss waterfall was created when an Icelandic leader cast away his pagan idols . Legend insists that it was created by three nocturnal trolls who were trying to split Iceland in two. They were (for reasons that remain unclear) cutting a trench between the mainland and the northwest peninsula, but were so focused on the job that they forgot about the rising sun – and, as dawn turned red, were turned to stone. The female troll, realising too late their mistake, flung her shovel in anger, and it landed in the ocean, becoming this new island at the world’s end. An appealing story. There are many of them up here. Iceland is a country of myths and legends, of giant trolls, ghosts and Huldufólk (secret people) who are believed to live in the lava fields – mischievous souls who dislike crosses, churches and electricity, and who can wreck construction projects if their homes are disturbed. The more scientific narrative of Iceland’s formation is only a little less fantastical. It sits on the junction of two tectonic plates – the Mid-Atlantic ridge – meaning that at certain points you can stand across continents, with one foot in North America and one in Europe. Geysers snort from beneath the surface, steam belches from the earth, and, in the hills above Lake Myvatn, the eggy smell of sulphur hangs in the air. Caught in an unusual light: During high summer, the Icelandic sunshine plays tricks on the camera . Volcanoes, extinct and idle, dominate the landscape, and the scars of their fury are everywhere. We drive east past huge tears in the soil – fractures of earthquakes past – and then, after 30 minutes, approach the horseshoe-shaped, 1km-wide canyon of Ásbyrgi, the product of a catastrophic glacial flood just 3,000 years ago. Or if you prefer the legend, from the hoofprint of Odin’s eight-legged horse. Ásbyrgi is the capital of the Huldufólk – who supposedly live in the cracks in the 100m-high cliffs. Their Queen dwells in the rocks at the canyon’s head, but only emerges when its waterfall flows. This early morning, it is bathed in sunlight. But there is no water. From the peaceful emptiness of Ásbyrgi, we turn to the roar of Dettifoss. The biggest waterfall in Europe, it is often cast as ‘The Beast’ to Goðafoss’s ‘Beauty’. Fire in the sky: In such light, it is easy to believe in the idea of Iceland as home of the mischievous 'Huldufólk' It is easy to see why. This is a monster waterfall. It is approaching 5am when Anton pulls the minibus up the dirt track to the car park. We are cold and tired. But we drag ourselves across black rocks and look down on an almost impossible volume of milky-white water, which plunges 50 metres into a burst of spray. There are no handrails, and you can stand scarily close to the torrents – almost dizzy at the power of the water. We linger, staring, until we feel the sun returning to full-strength. Then it is back to the bus for another shot of caffeine and the long drive home. Across the island, everyone is just waking up. They missed quite a show.

Office manager Ms Rey said: 'I can't be 100 per cent sure that I was struck by lightning it all happened so fast. 'All I know is that my body got super hot and it hurt like hell - my arms and legs were tingling for around six hours.

"Artefacts: A half-smoked cigar belonging to Isambard Kingdom Brunel is to go on public display for the first time, along with the case the celebrated British engineer used for his 40-a-day habit . A half-smoked cigar belonging to Isambard Kingdom Brunel is to go on public display for the first time, along with the case the celebrated British engineer used for his 40-a-day habit. One of the most ingenious and prolific engineers in history, Brunel oversaw the building of 25 railway lines, more than 100 bridges and three ships - and was rarely seen without a cigar between his lips. Now his famous cigar case, containing one last half-smoked cigar, will go on show at the new Being Brunel museum, due to open in 2016 at the Brunel-designed ss Great Britain in Bristol. Both items are part of a large collection of nearly 1,000 Brunel objects which have been donated to the ss Great Britain Trust by collector Clive Richards, along with Brunel's personalised pen knife and school reports. They will join more than 14,000 artefacts, including the University of Bristol Brunel Collection and the ss Great Britain Trust Collection, which will go on show at the new £7million museum. The case, which is stamped I.K.B. Athenaeum Club Pall Mall, reflects Brunel's passion for cigars and fine things. A member of the Athenaeum since 1830, Brunel wrote of his membership and visits to the club in his diaries. The case could hold 48 cigars in two separate compartments, along with a small document wallet for stamps and business cards, all of great use for members of the club. As well as being a personal possession, the cigar case is also a prompt to the famous photograph of Brunel in front of the chains of the ss Great Eastern, smoking a cigar in his muddy trousers and boots, depicting a man of action and determination. The well-worn penknife is engraved with the initials I.K.B. and was manufactured by George Butler and Co. of Sheffield, around 1840. On show: The famous cigar case, containing one last half-smoked cigar, will go on show at the new Being Brunel museum, due to open in 2016 at the Brunel-designed ss Great Britain in Bristol . Donation: The cigar is part of a large collection of nearly 1,000 Brunel objects which have been donated to the ss Great Britain Trust by collector Clive Richards . It has a horn handle and an array of useful tools such as a tin opener, blade, saw, hook, spike, drill, corkscrew, metal toothpick, tweezers and a device for removing stones from horses' hooves. Brunel was known for his hands on approach and enterprising nature and would have found the penknife a very useful companion, especially in the days of surveying the route of the Great Western Railway (GWR) on horseback. Also going on display will be an example of the Thames Tunnel peep show - a memento of a visit to the world famous tunnel, where Brunel was employed alongside his father Sir Marc.

Iconic: One of the most famous photograph of Brunel shows him in front of the chains of the ss Great Eastern, smoking a cigar . Peep show souvenirs became increasingly popular not only in England but also in the continent, and this highly-decorative example, published in Germany, depicts two scenes within a series of hand coloured concertina lithographs. On the top is a view of the activity on the Thames while the bottom scenes feature delicate hand cut figures of men, women and carriages travelling through the completed tunnel. As each panel unfolds the viewer's gaze is invited deep into this engineering marvel, which was to open up a world of opportunities for a young Brunel. 'I have always admired the work that the ss Great Britain Trust does to conserve the ss Great Britain and protect Brunel's legacy,' said Mr Richards. 'Being Brunel will secure the Brunel Collections for the whole nation and I'm proud to be a part of that.' Mr Richards and his wife Sylvia have also pledged £500,000 to the Being Brunel project to commemorate the engineer who died of a stroke at 53 in 1859, after suffering with kidney problems for several years. Brunel had launched the ss Great Britain in Bristol in 1843 as the world's first great ocean liner. The iron-hulled steamship was most experimental steam ship of her time and revolutionised travel and set new standards in engineering, reliability and speed. After being left to rust in the Falkland Islands she was rescued and returned to Bristol in 1970, where she has been painstakingly restored and transformed into a popular tourist attraction. It will be joined by the new museum in 2016, where visitors can enjoy interactive displays and  experiences such as walking into Brunel's brain, and going back in time to visit the restored Grade II* listed Brunel Drawing Office. The Heritage Lottery Fund has awarded £4.75 million to the project, while the ss Great Britain Trust has contributed £350,000 towards the £7million target, and is fundraising another £1.4 million. Matthew Tanner, chief executive of the ss Great Britain Trust, said: 'Being Brunel will engage people of all ages by looking into the mind of a genius who was also a very human and interesting person. 'Clive Richards' magnificent Brunel Collection is particularly rich in telling the human side of the Brunel story, and will inspire visitors to understand him, and be excited by what he achieved, and perhaps what they themselves might be able to achieve too.'

Design feat: On the top is a view of the activity on the Thames while the bottom scenes feature delicate hand cut figures of men, women and carriages travelling through the completed tunnel . Brunel's famous Clifton Suspension Bridge . Over the course of his relatively short life, from 1806 to 1859, Brunel was responsible for building over 25 railway lines, more than 100 bridges, eight piers and docks, and three enormous steamships. He was a stand-out even in a field which included greats like George Stevenson - so-called father of the railways - and Thomas Cubitt - who helped build large parts of London, including Finsbury, Islington and Belgravia. He constructed the Great Western Railway, linking London to Bristol, built the famous Bristol Meads Station, and designed five revolutionary suspension bridges including the Clifton Suspension Bridge over the River Avon. While he is best known for his work on the railways, he was also an accomplished ship builder. He built the the 'Great Western', which launched in 1837 and was the first steamship to ferry regular passenger journies across the Atlantic Ocean. The 'Great Britain', launched in 1843, was the world's first iron-hulled, steam-powered passenger liner to use a screw-propellar, which made it far more efficient. The 'Great Eastern', launched in 1859, was designed in cooperation with John Scott Russell, and was by far the biggest ship ever built, but was so expensive it drove its owner into bankruptcy.

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's sister has been arrested for allegedly threatening to bomb a New York City woman. Police say Ailina Tsarnaeva, 24, made the threat via telephone Monday and turned herself in earlier today. She is charged with aggravated harassment targeting her boyfriend's former girlfriend who lives in Harlem. Police say the North Bergen, New Jersey, resident is due in court September 30. Scroll down for video . Bomb scare: Ailina Tsarnaeva, pictured in this October 2013  file photo, has been arrested in New York City for allegedly threatening to bomb a Harlem woman . According to the New York City Police Department, Ms Tsarnaeva called her boyfriend’s ex and told her: 'I know people who can go over there and put a bomb on you.' Police say Ailina's boyfriend, identified by the New York Post and George Briones, has been locked in a dispute with his former lover over the custody of their three children. After the threatening phone call, the unnamed 23-year-old Harlem resident contacted police, prompting Ms Tsarnaeva to turn herself in at around 2.30pm Wednesday, reported CBS Boston. The 24-year-old North Bergen woman has been required to check in with Massachusetts probation officers since last October after prosecutors say she did not cooperate with a counterfeiting investigation. Tsarnaeva's arrest comes just days after it was revealed in the media that her sister-in-law, slain bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev's widow Katherine Russell, has moved in with Ailina and her sibling, Bella. The women were found by the news station WCVB two weeks ago living in a nondescript blue house in the New Jersey township of North Bergen - population 58,000 - located about 10 miles west of Manhattan. Widow: Katherine Russell, 25, is pictured on the porch of the North Bergen, New Jersey, home she now shares with the two Tsarnaev sisters . New home: The Tsarnaevs, Tamerlan's widow, and her young daughter have settled in this blue house in the town of 58,000 located about 10 miles west of Manhattan . Family ties: Ailina Tsarnaev (left), and her sister Bella (right), have visited their brother Dzhokhar in jail . Ailina and Bella's 20-year-old brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is currently awaiting federal trial for his role in the April 15, 2013, bombing that killed three people and left 260 others wounded. The two ethnic Chechen brothers from southern Russia were accused of planting two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon finish line. Tamerlan was killed in a getaway attempt after a gun battle with police. Dzhokhar, who was captured hiding in a tarp-covered boat outside a house in a Boston suburb and is hospitalized, was later charged with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. A combination of handout pictures released through the FBI website on April 18, 2013 show Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev (L), suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15 . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, who is set to go on trial next week for his role in the deadly attack, is pictured with his sister Bella . The Tsarnaev sisters have had legal problems of their own in recent years. Ailina is expected to go on trial next month on charges of misleading police in a counterfeit money probe, while Bella stands accused of marijuana possession with intent to distribute. Both women have visited their younger brother in jail. Dzhokhar is set to face trial in November. Over the weekend, Ailina Tsarnaeva declared to a news crew from WHDH outside her home that her brothers had been framed.","Ailina Tsarnaeva, 24, charged with aggravated harassment targeting a 23-year-old Harlem resident .

"By . Amanda Williams for MailOnline . Jordan Dunn, 22, from Dover in Kent, at Thames Magistrates' Court where he was fined after storming the pitch to take a free kick during a Premier League match . A judge joked as he fined a football fan who stormed the pitch to take a free kick during a Premier League match, telling him he 'bent it like Beckham... just a lot slower.' Footage of Jordan Dunn, 22, from Dover in Kent, went viral on YouTube after he kicked the ball towards the goal West Ham United were defending at Upton Park against Tottenham Hotspur on August 16. The 'free kick' was saved by West Ham’s Spanish goalkeeper Adrian San Miguel del Castillo  and Dunn was chased from the pitch by a steward as the crowd cheered. Today, he was fined a total of £305 but spared a ban from attending future matches. Passing sentence at Thames . Magistrates’ Court in East London, District Judge Gareth Branston said: 'On the afternoon of August 16 about 35,000 football fans sat down at . Upton Park to watch 22 men in shorts and football boots kick a football . around for 90 minutes. 'Those 22 men were paid for that, to entertain. 'Some time into that game a young man ... ran onto the pitch. That was you. You weren’t paid to do that.' The . judge said he proceeded to run 'some 70 yards' across the pitch, chased . by stewards - one of whom fell over - before arriving at the spot where . Tottenham were lining up a free kick. The judge said: 'You took it for them. To be frank you were probably a little tired by the time you got to the ball. 'It was a longer run than was strictly necessary. 'You had consumed alcohol and your stride pattern was a bit out of kilter but to borrow a phrase you did bend it like Beckham. Regrettably it was about 30mph slower than Beckham.' The . judge said the effort was 'easily' saved by the West Ham goalkeeper but . referred to Christian Eriksen’s subsequent effort after play restarted, . saying: 'I understand that the professional footballer who followed you . did not do any better.' Judge Branston said the shot drew 'the cheers of the crowd' before he was tackled 'in the customary manner' by stewards. Today . Dunn apologised for a 'moment of madness' as he pleaded guilty to a . charge under Section 4 of the Football Offences Act 1991, which states . that it is an offence to go onto the playing area without lawful . authority or excuse. The judge said he had seen footage of the incident on YouTube and asked: 'Were you intending to take the free kick?' Scroll down for video . Dunn, 22, from Dover in Kent, became a YouTube sensation after he kicked the ball towards the goal West Ham United were defending at Upton Park against Tottenham Hotspur on August 16 . Judge Gareth Branston said the shot drew 'the cheers of the crowd' before he was tackled 'in the customary manner' by steward . Dunn . replied: 'No. All I was going to do was run and as I was running I just . saw the ball there so I thought I would just kick it.' Dunn, who works as a receptionist at a hotel, said he has a ten-month old little boy. Referring . to the prospect of a banning order, he said: 'I was a bit concerned . that when my little boy grows up I want to take him to watch the . football.' The judge asked if his mother had 'expressed disapproval'. Dunn, . who represented himself, said: 'At first she was concerned because she . didn’t know the consequences but when she saw the YouTube video she saw . the funny side but she has had a go at me, as a mother would.' Today Dunn apologised for a 'moment of madness' as he pleaded guilty to a charge under Section 4 of the Football Offences Act 1991, which states that it is an offence to go onto the playing area without lawful authority or excuse . The 'free kick' was saved by West Ham's Spanish goalkeeper Adrian San Miguel del Castillo  and Dunn was chased from the pitch by a steward as the crowd cheered.

Ben Edwards, prosecuting, told Thames Magistrates’ Court in east London: 'At around 4pm in the afternoon the defendant was seen to jump the barrier separating football fans from the pitch and run along the pitch towards the goal. 'He was then seen to kick the football being placed on the ground for a free kick.' Dunn told police in interview after he was arrested that he had been a West Ham fan since he was a little boy and it had always been one of his dreams to “run on the pitch and kick the ball”, the court heard. Mr Edwards added: 'Now he could say he had done it. He also said now he had done what he wanted to do he is not going to do it again.' Dunn declined to comment after the hearing. The . pitch invasion provoked amusement on social media, with one fan saying . the effort was better than Spurs star Eriksen’s free kick once play had . resumed. He wrote on .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A year's supply of fruit cake, a book of stamps and a free meerkat adoption are some of the forms of compensation offered by UK companies, a survey has found. A book of vouchers only redeemable in the US, £2.48 in return for loss of the internet for a month and a free meal at a restaurant where the diner caught food poisoning are some of the other 'goodwill' gestures suffered by consumers, the poll for the online complaints service resolver.co.uk revealed. Repentant companies have also offered a bottle of orange juice that was out of date and fermenting, 60p in return for not switching mobile providers, and a box of condoms after a customer submitted a bad review when one broke. One unnamed company said an angry customer could adopt a meerkat because they received poor service . Another firm offered a free Cadbury Creme Egg as compensation to another customer who made a complaint . Asked to name what they considered to be the most bizarre or strange compensation offered by a company after making a complaint, others surveyed reported receiving a voucher for a new tyre from a scrapyard and a Cadbury creme egg. Resolver founder James Walker said: 'What this shows is that companies are not taking the consumer seriously. 'Complaining should be more prevalent and I urge consumers to seek redress if they experience poor customer service. 'We want companies to take compensation more seriously and hope that our service will highlight the good and the bad practices that are out there. 'Our plan is to work with these companies to show them the value of complaints - hopefully illustrating to them how they are valuable sources of feedback and essential information for helping them to provide a better service to the customer.'

"By . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . Climate change.... its complex, intimidating and the source of many heated debates. The topic is a controversial one, that has created a barrage of skepticism, but Why? It's because the impacts are often not immediately noticeable, nor are the benefits of acting against it. A group of passionate individuals have dedicated their life to studying climate change, but they too have become frustrated with the powerful issue and have now revealed how they actually feel and what their concerns are. Scientists from around Australia have put pen to paper in handwritten letters as part of an independent project and they have unleashed their anger over inaction and ignorance, which they warn will cause severe water shortages and even war. Climate change effects (pictured) : farmers watering hole on a farm near Shepperton, Victoria, Australia, almost dried up due to the drought . Wild seas lashing the Esplanade and the public swimming pool in Cairns, north Queensland, Australia. Climate change? Australian National University student Joe Duggan and science commentator has talked to scientists and asked them to write the letters about how they felt about climate change. The results have been eye opening and have all been published on the, Is This How You Feel website for all to see. The letters are personal, some with a little humour, while others disclose their frustration and inner feelings about what they have been studying for years. Dr Elvira Poloczanska seemed frustrated by how unfazed people are by the issue. 'It amazes me that people still question whether we, as a species, are having an impact on our planet and climate. There are seven billion of us on the planet.' Associate Professor Kevin Walsh was very open about his views, saying he wished that climate change wasn't real. 'This seems like a strange thing for a climate scientist to say, but it’s true. If climate change were not real, we would not have to be concerned about it.' Dr Allie Gallant was definitely frustrated saying, 'I hate feeling helpless. I’m ashamed to say that, sometimes, my frustration leads to apathy. I hate feeling apathetic.' Others resorted to a bit of humour to express their point of view. 'Dear Earth, Just a quick note to say thanks so much for the last 4 billion years or so. It's been great! I’m really sorry about the last couple of 100 years – we’ve really stuffed things up haven’t we! I thought we climate scientist might be able to save the day but alas no one really took as seriously.' wrote Professor Brendan MacKey.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Disgraced former New York governor Eliot Spitzer just got a lot richer - after selling 144 rental units at the Corinthian building in New York for $147m. The huge deal suggests that Spitzer, who resigned as governor in 2008 in the wake of a prostitution scandal, will now take on a bigger role in his father Bernard's real estate company. He rejoined the company last year after running unsuccessfully for city comptroller. Eliot Spitzer and new girlfriend Lis Smith attend a basketball game together in New York back in February . The East 38th Street building was built by Spitzer's father in the 1980s, and was sold to Gaia Real Estate, reports Page Six. The company says it plans to 'renovate, rebrand and sell the units'. Crain's New York Business reports that Spitzer is also in talks to buy a near three-acre development site in Brooklyn - on Kent Avenue along the south Williamsburg waterfront - for $165m. It is expected some of the proceeds from the Corinthian sale will go towards the deal. Shamed: Spitzer resigning as New York governor at a news conference in New York on March 10, 2008 . The former governor and attorney general, 55, was spotted in Paris with his new girlfriend Lis Smith, 31, at the weekend. They stayed at the exclusive Pavillon de la Reine - a four-star hotel where the cheapest rooms cost $500 per night. Ms Smith is Spitzer's former publicist, and was behind his failed city comptroller campaign. She then joined Bill de Blasio's team and was widely considered to be the likely candidate for the mayor's press secretary. But just as the final staffing decision was due to be made, photos were released that showed Spitzer sneaking in and out of her Soho apartment last December. Ashley Alexandra Dupre, or 'Kristen' - one of the escorts Spitzer was revealed to have liaised with . Spitzer became state Attorney General in 1998 and found fame as the 'Sheriff of Wall Street' - going after corrupt financiers. His moral authority and intellect helped catapult him into the governor's office in 2007 - however he resigned in disgrace just a year later after being revealed to have used prostitutes. He reportedly had at least seven meetings with high-end prostitutes over a six-month period, and is also believed to have spent up to $80,000 on them over many years, starting when he was attorney general. Infamous as Client 9 of the Emporers Club VIP call-girl ring, he resigned at a public press conference with his then-wife Silda Wall Spitzer by his side. The pair finalised a very public and bitter divorce in February. After his resignation, Spitzer attempted to rehabilitate his public image with a stint presenting a CNN news show which failed and then eventually made his way back to work for his father.","Eliot Spitzer, 55, sold 144 rental units at the Corinthian building in New York .

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . An eight-year-old boy could have survived his fatal asthma attack if an ambulance call-handler hadn't marked the case as 'less serious', a coroner has ruled. Clayton Barker died after paramedics were delayed because his grandmother's 999 call was put in a low-priority category. If the 'correct response' had been taken, the ambulance would have arrived before Clayton collapsed and his chances of survival would probably have been 'enhanced', an inquest heard. Tragic: The ambulance did not arrive for 23 minutes when Clayton Barker, eight, fell into a fatal asthma attack . Devastated: His mother Gemma Barker (pictured) heard he could have had a chance of survival if the 999 operator had correctly noted down the call. The call-handler marked the case as 'less serious' Clayton had been staying at his grandmother's house when he collapsed, unable to breathe. But when his grandmother Elaine Barker phoned 999, the operator thought the emergency was less serious than it was. It meant the next waiting ambulance was sent to another emergency instead - and Clayton was not reached by paramedics until 23 minutes after the call. The young boy was eventually taken to hospital by ambulance staff, but was pronounced dead on arrival. Tests showed he died of an acute asthmatic attack. The tragedy - described as a 'subconscious and isolated mistake' - unfolded when the call handler asked a scripted question, but took the wrong answer, the inquest at Heywood Coroner's Court was told. The call operator - who had taken nearly 80 calls during the 12-hour shift - asked Clayton's grandmother: 'Is he having any difficulty speaking through breaths?'. But when the operator heard Clayton mutter something in the background, she wrongly registered the answer as 'no' instead of 'yes'. It meant Clayton's situation was thought to be less urgent than it was - leading to a 13-minute delay in the ambulance arriving. Simon Nelson, senior coroner for Manchester North, said: 'Clayton Barker died following an acute asthmatic attack. 'The evidence at the inquest confirmed that the first of two emergency 999 calls was not processed in line with best practise. 'Full of energy': Clayton was diagnosed with asthma at the age of five, he was described him as 'mischievous' Apology: The Trust apologised to Clayton's mother, grandmother and two brothers for the delay . 'Had the correct response been generated, then the ambulance would have arrived before rather than after Clayton collapsed, in which case, on the balance of probabilities, his chances of survival would have been enhanced.' Gemma Barker described her son, one of three brothers, as 'mischievous' and 'full of energy', despite being diagnosed with asthma from the age of five. Angela Lee, assistant service manager at the emergency centre of North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) told the inquest the call handler had been using a series of scripted questions as part of a 'medical priority dispatch system' that was used nationally and internationally. Mrs Lee said all staff had been reminded of the importance of recording information accurately. She added: 'It was an individual error, I don't believe there needs to be a change in procedure.' Gemma Barker is understood to be taking legal action against NWAS through criminal negligence lawyers at Slater & Gordon. Solicitor Zak Golombeck said: 'Gemma and her family would like to thank the coroner for his full and thorough investigation. 'The evidence was unambiguous that had the initial 999 call been categorised correctly and attended Clayton in a timely manner, Clayton's chance of survival would have been enhanced. 'Gemma's loss is not something words can describe. 'Clayton was a happy and lively young boy who will be deeply missed by his family, especially his two brothers. 'Unambiguous': The coroner ruled Clayton's chance of survival would certainly have been enhanced had he been reached sooner . 'I will now be advising Gemma in relation to pursuing legal action against the ambulance service.' Derek Cartwright, director of operations for NWAS, said: 'The Trust would like to offer our apologies and express our sincere condolences to Clayton's family.

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . Free performance: David Blaine did not charge the Department of Correction for the show on July 26 . He is the world's most prominent illusionist, magician and escape artist. So it's no wonder there were anxious faces when David Blaine teasingly showed dangerous criminals how to break out of prison during an intimate performance at the Manhattan Detention Complex. The daredevil, who usually charges around $100 for tickets, performed some of his most famous tricks in front of a crowd of prisoners including rival Bloods and Crips members, according to the New York Post. One inmate is said to have asked the 41-year-old illusionist to autograph copies of his court papers while another requested he use his powers to make the bars from his cell disappear. Sworn enemies from the Bloods and Crips gangs are said to have temporarily put differences aside as they cheered loudly - with some even acting as assistants to the magician. The hour-long show, organised by the Department of Correction, took place on the notorious sixth floor of the Manhattan Detention Complex, known as 'The Tombs'. One source, who preferred not to be named, asked: 'How the hell does a killer get to watch a rabbit get pulled out of a hat?' One of the prison guards added: 'He was levitating and teasing inmates with tricks on how to break out of here. You know that isn't happening. 'I wish David Blaine would perform for us. I think we deserve it more than them. It costs hundreds of dollars to see him live.' Sixty inmates attended the show on July 26, which Blaine performed for free, a Department of Correction spokesman confirmed. London stunt: David Blaine knows how it feels to be locked up having famously enclosed himself in a perspex box without food while suspended in London for 44 days (above) They added: 'The Department of Correction uses positive reinforcement as one of many strategies to reduce inmate idleness and improve facility safety. 'Inmates who attended this event were being rewarded for good behavior.' The rowdy crowd of convicts who saw Blaine in action are said to have not included the 'worst of the worst' from the 9 South unit at The Tombs.","Hour-long gig for 60 inmates took place at Manhattan Detention Complex .

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A young woman is set to lose her sight in her left eye after she was hit with a stiletto heel on a pub dancefloor. The victim was at the crowded pub in Farnworth near Bolton, Greater Manchester, on Sunday night when witnesses said a row broke out between a group of drinkers at around 11.30pm. One woman involved aimed a high kick which sent her stiletto shoe heel-first into the left eye of the victim, named locally as 27-year-old Katrina Coucill. Hospitalised: The victim, named locally as Katrina Coucill (pictured), is set to lose her sight in her left eye . Paramedics attended the pub, Ye Olde Three Crowns, as fellow drinkers rushed to the young woman's aid. She was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital where doctors are treating her for a serious eye injury on Wednesday. Police confirmed that doctors have now told the victim she will lose her sight in her left eye. Witnesses said two women and a man involved in the altercation left the pub, where Ms Coucill was meeting her mother, and police have since appealed for witnesses. Crowded: Police said Ye Olde Three Crowns in Farnworth near Bolton, Greater Manchester, was packed . One local, who asked not to be named, said: 'She was screaming in agony. People went to her aid - by all accounts it was a terrible scene.' A friend of Ms Coucill said: 'We were in the pub because it was Bank Holiday. Ms Coucill, pictured, was still being treated in hospital three days after the incident . 'I was coming out of a toilet when I heard a scream and realised Katrina had been hurt. 'Everyone was crowded around her and an ambulance came straight away, to take her to hospital. It was awful.' On Facebook, Ms Coucill's sister Sian  posted a message saying: 'Some ******* evil vicious people in this world. 'Hope they ******* catch you, you lowlife scumbags!!!!!' Police confirmed the victim suffered a serious eye injury when one woman kicked out with a high heel. Officers added the offenders then left and the injured woman was taken to hospital. They initially believed the shoe had flown off the woman's foot and hit the victim in the eye in a freak accident. However, after viewing CCTV from the pub, officers have since said they believe Ms Coucill was kicked directly in the face. Det Sgt Patrick Wood said: 'From what we have been told, we believe a woman was part of this group and she kicked out at the victim. 'She was wearing high heeled shoes and it looks like the point of the heel has made contact with her eye. 'She is currently in hospital being treated for her injury. 'With it being a Bank Holiday, the pub was very busy and it is likely someone would have seen what happened. 'I would appeal to anyone who was there and saw what happened or indeed those involved to contact police.' Greater Manchester Police have arrested two women, aged 21 and 28, and a 28-year-old man on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. They were questioned over the incident in police custody and later bailed until October 22 while enquiries continue.","Victim named locally as Katrina Coucill, 27, caught up in incident at pub .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Lake District is to be nominated for World Heritage status. England's largest national park will be able to submit a bid to UN heritage body Unesco in 2016 to become a World Heritage site, Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said. If it secures World Heritage status, it will join the likes of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the Great Wall of China and the Grand Canyon in the US as sites with outstanding value to the world. Natural beauty: England's largest national park will be able to apply for the status in 2016 . The UK already has almost 30 cultural and natural sites on the World Heritage List, ranging from the Tower of London to the Giant's Causeway and Stonehenge. Globally, almost 1,000 sites are listed for their heritage value. Mr Vaizey said: 'The UK's heritage is world-renowned and the Lake District, England's largest national park, is one of our heritage jewels. 'The Unesco nomination process can be very demanding and success is not guaranteed but I believe the Lake District deserves to be recognised and inscribed as a World Heritage Site and I wish all involved the very best. The Lake District was one of six sites which came forward for consideration for nomination by an independent expert group. The others were Chatham Dockyard and its defences, the Flow Country, Jodrell Bank observatory, the Zenith of Iron Age Shetland and the twin monastery of Wearmouth-Jarrow. Landscape: It will join 30 other locations in the UK already on Unesco's list . The Lake District joins the Forth Bridge near Edinburgh and Gorham's Cave complex in Gibraltar on the UK's tentative list of potential future World Heritage nominations. The Forth Bridge is being put forward this year, and Gorham's Cave complex in 2015. Mike Innerdale, assistant director of operation for National Trust (North West), which looks after a fifth of the countryside, hills and rivers in the Lake District, welcomed confirmation the national park would be the next nomination. 'The National Trust has cared for the natural heritage of the Lake District for 100 years and this is a brilliant opportunity to share these special spaces with an international audience,' he said. The long-running bid to secure World Heritage status for the Lake District stretches back to the 1980s. Efforts: The long-running bid to secure World Heritage status for the Lake District stretches back to the 1980s . Chief executive of the Lake District National Park Richard Leafe said: 'World Heritage inscription will boost the international profile of the Lake District's unique awe-inspiring landscape, which has evolved over thousands of years. 'We believe it is possible to strike the balance between conserving our historical cultural roots at the same time as encouraging regeneration to meet the needs of a thriving, modern region. 'World Heritage designation can help us meet this tough challenge - attracting valuable international cultural tourism will also be a catalyst for increased investment in heritage, culture and farming to help us make the most of our greatest asset, the spectacular cultural landscape.' The nomination will go through an 18-month process of scrutiny and evaluation by Unesco and its advisory body, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, with a decision expected in July 2017.","England's largest national park able to submit a bid to Unesco in 2016 .

"By . Candace Sutton for Daily Mail Australia . Wearing a picture of his twin brother pinned to a red rose and draped over his heart, Bradley Morcombe married his schoolgirl sweetheart Anna Martin in a church ceremony before family and friends. Bradley's twin brother, Daniel Morcombe was abducted and murdered on Queensland's Sunshine Coast ten years ago in what became Australia's highest profile missing child case which was only resolved  earlier this year. Bradley, 24, and his older brother, Dean, who took on the role of best man in place of the honour that would have gone to Daniel, both wore roses in their lapels and pictures of Daniel. Scroll down for video . Happy day: Anna Martin carries red roses on her wedding day to Bradley Morcombe on the Sunshine Coast in south-east Queensland. The red theme was a nod to the campaign to find Bradley's twin brother, Daniel, who was missing for eight years after he was abducted and murdered in December 2003. Bradley, who is wearing  a picture of Daniel pinned over his heart, said before the wedding that Daniel would be 'looking down from heaven' on the lucky couple . Watching over them: With a photograph of his late twin brother pinned below a red rose over his heart, Bradley Morcombe smiles for for the camera with a friend, centre, and his bride, Anna Martin (left) following their wedding in Queensland. Bradley's family campaigned for years to find Daniel, whose remains were uncovered in 2011, laid to rest in 2012 and his murderer convicted and jailed for life in March this year . Where's the twin: Bride-to-be Anna Martin approaches the altar for her marriage to sweetheart Bradley Morcombe on the Sunshine Coast. While Bruce Morcombe, father of Bradley and his slain twin brother, Daniel, said in people's minds they would be asking 'where's the twin', he said it would be a happy family occasions and ""Brad and Anna's day' to be celebrated by family and friends . She's his misssus: A radiant bride Anna Martin and her new husband, Bradley Morcombe, walk back down the aisle after saying their wedding vows.  Prior to the wedding, the new Mrs Morcombe paid tribute on Facebook to Bradley - whose twin brother, Daniel was the victim of one of Australia's most high profile child abduction and murder cases. She wrote, 'Love isn't always rosy, but true love is never giving up on the tougher times. 6 years together and we have definitely had our fair share of biff ups, disagreements and tears. On the upper hand, we have given each other the best times, helped each other and grown together. He is a once in a life time kinda boy and I'm gonna be his Mrs in a week' Cheeky boys: Bradley Morcombe (left) and twin brother Daniel as young boys. In 2003 at the age of 13, Daniel, was abducted and murdered although his family did not know what had happened to him until his remains were uncovered in 2011 after a long police investigation and the family was able to lay him to rest. Bradley said of his twin this year, there had not been a day since that he hadn't thought of him . The colour red - which came to symbolise Daniel, because of the last t-shirt he wore before he was abducted and in the long years while parents, Denise and Bruce, searched for their boy - was the theme of the wedding. Bride Anna Martin carried a bouquet of red roses and her bridesmaids wore long red strapless dresses and also carried red flowers. Ms Martin, 25, wore a slim-fitting white dress with a lace bodice and peplum, floor length train and veil. Bradley Morcombe had paid tribute in the lead-up to his wedding to Ms Martin, saying Daniel would 'looking down from heaven' on the ceremony. Success story: The hands of newly wedded couple Anna Martin and Bradley Morcombe are pictured. Bradley's father, Bruce Morcombe, said that in the years following the disappearance and abduction murder of Bradley's twin brother, Daniel, it had been of utmost importance both to find Daniel's remains and to keep his family together. He said he has watched on proudly as older son Dean and  Bradley have passed their life milestones. 'They both have good jobs, a steady girlfriend and they've purchased houses,' he said . Always in his heart: Bradley Morcombe (right) pictured on his wedding day, wearing a photograph of his beloved late twin brother Daniel (pictured, left above) pinned to a red rose over his heart. 'He is with us all the time, every single day,' Bradley said earlier this year. 'He's still part of the family. He'll always be my brother and I'll always miss him, no matter what happens in the future' Beautiful tribute: In a card to his new wife Anna Martin, Bradley Morcombe wrote a touching tribute. In a photograph of the card posted on Facebook by the new Mrs Morcombe can be seen his words, 'I've always dreamt of having you as my wife. Today my dream comes true. You're the most beautiful girl' Bradley, Daniel and Ms Martin all attended Siena Catholic College in south-east Queensland before Daniel disappeared while waiting for a bus at Woombye on the Sunshine Coast as he planned to go Christmas shopping,  on December 7, 2003. His remains were only discovered in August 2011, after years of searching in which the Morcombes refused to give up searching for their son and 'bringing him home'. Bruce Morcombe told Daily Mail Australia earlier this month that as important as it had been 'bringing Daniel home, he had been determined over the last decade not to let the tragedy tear his family apart, as well as helping his other two sons to live productive and happy lives. A week before the wedding, Ms Martin posted a tribute to her husband-to-be Bradley, saying, 'Love isn't always rosy, but true love is never giving up on the tougher times. 6 years together and we have definitely had our fair share of biff ups, disagreements and tears. On the upper hand, we have given each other the best times, helped each other and grown together. He is a once in a life time kinda boy and I'm gonna be his Mrs in a week'. Driving force: Denies and Bruce Morcombe (pictured with their book earlier this month) said as well as finding the remains of their lost son Daniel, it had been of paramount importance to keep their family together under the  strains and pressures , which he hoped to impart to other families suffering tragedy and loss. Their book 'Where is Daniel? The Family's Story' written with Lindsay Simpson and published by Pan MacMillan, is available from bookshops . The wedding was officiated by celebrant and the former policewoman Julie Elliott who acted as the special family liaison officer for the Morcombes in the years while Daniel was missing. The ceremony has come after a tumultuous year for the family, with the trial and conviction of Brett Peter Cowan for Daniel's abduction and murder; Cowan was jailed for life in March this year. On August 2, Denise and Bruce Morcombe launched their book,  'Where is Daniel? The Family's story', published by Pan MacMillan, which Mr Mrocombe said was part inside story and partly a guide for families who had experienced traumatic life events. 'If the Morcombes can stay together, well so can others,' he said. 'The book ... is very much a survival of the Morcombe family, so that out experience will benefit other families.'It was very much a concerted decision [for us] to be strong. You are very much aware through media reports how a significant life event almost always results in the family exploding.'The wedding we hope will be a very positive and happy family event. 'In the back of everyone's minds, there is where is Daniel, where is the twin? But it is Brad and Anna's day.' On her wedding day, the bride posted the following message on her Facebook page, 'Bradley Morcombe you amaze me every single day. I love you, I can't wait much longer to see your cute little possum face xxx', followed after the ceremony by a photo of the groom with the words, 'Proud as punch to have me as his mrs'. The couple has gone on honeymoon to French Polynesia, posting happy messages about their time away. Earlier this year, Bradley Morcombe told Australian Women's Weekly there had not been a day since that he hadn't thought of his brother. 'He is with us all the time, every single day,' Bradley said. 'He's still part of the family. He'll always be my brother and I'll always miss him, no matter what happens in the future.' In a card to his new wife, a photo of which is posted on Facebook, Brad Morcombe writes, 'I've always dreamt of having you as my wife. Today my dream comes true.

"By . Corey Charlton . A wealthy businessman is fuming at Morrisons after he claims his brand new £75,000 BMW was crushed by the supermarket’s car wash. David Elliott was inside his 6 Series Gran Coupe when the back window shattered just seconds after paying £6.99 for a wash and wax. The 48-year-old quickly realised part of the supermarket’s car wash in Evesham, Worcestershire, had snagged on the lower edge of his BMW’s boot. But instead of the safety mechanism cutting off the machine, the roller continued to rise - pushing the boot up into the back window. David Elliot's £75,000 BMW pictured after it went through the Morrisons car wash in Evesham . Mr Elliot had just parked inside the car wash when he said he suddenly heard a loud 'splintering' sound . He quickly turned on the engine and drove out of the car wash to check the damage to his pride and joy - which he had bought only two months earlier. He has since been quoted £4,000 to fix the damage but has been forced to put the BMW in a garage and cycle 16 miles to work while he waits for the car to get repaired. Today the dad-of-two blasted the supermarket giant which he claims is refusing to accept liability. This however, has been disputed by a Morrisons spokesperson, who said the company had not yet finished its investigation into the incident. He said: 'I was typing away an email on my phone and heard a splintering sound and thought ""that sounds expensive"". 'I looked in the mirror and nothing happened and then I heard this crunching noise as the boot was somehow forced open and lifted up. 'Then as the car wash came over it, it thrust it forward through the back window. At this point I looked up and there was this almighty noise. 'I fired up the car and drove outside the car wash. Once I drove out, the remains of the window fell out. The boot was completely knackered too. Mr Elliot said the car window smashed only seconds after he had paid the £6.99 for a wash and wax . The BMW - a 6 Series Gran Coupe - cost £75,000 and was only two months old when the incident occurred . 'I called Morrisons customer services immediately telling them what had happened and within a week they had basically denied liability. 'They didn’t even send somebody to look at my car. The car wash was broken by the incident. 'But they got an engineer in who presumably just pushed the reset button and said the car wash was fine. 'Morrisons said to me they didn’t deny that the incident took place but because the car wash was fine beforehand and now the engineer said it’s working, it’s not their liability. 'They are completely washing their hands of it.' Mr Elliot - who is the managing director of a fitness equipment company - spoke to the car wash manager immediately after the incident at 8.15am on July 30. He then phoned Morrisons customer services who told him an engineer who they sent to check the car wash had reported no faults. Mr Elliot outside the Evesham, Worcester car wash which he claims severely damaged his BMW . Mr Elliot, who lives with his wife Grizzie, 48, and two children Oskar, 15, and Georgina, 13, in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, added: 'It makes you think what would have happened if my kids were in the back of the car. 'A lot of kids put their faces against the back window to watch the roomers. All sorts of horrible things could have happened. 'They should have reported it to the health and safety executive and done a proper investigation. 'I want to take it to the small claims court but it is me against Morrisons’ legal team. 'When wanton destruction is wreaked upon your car, they should surely just pay up. 'I am waiting for the repair to be approved. The boot can’t shut and the back window isn’t present so I can’t drive at all. 'I have been quoted £4,000 but that could go up if they find the force has caused something else to be damaged once they remove the boot. 'I am cycling 25km to go to work every day. I had only had the car two months, it has only got 2,000 miles on the clock. 'This was my latest and greatest purchase. It was my pride and joy, the whole experience has been utterly horrific.' A Morrisons spokesperson declined to comment other than to say its investigation had not been completed.","Businessman furious after his new BMW damaged in Morrisons carwash .

"By . Michael Seamark . Publishers met yesterday to sign contracts for the tough new Press watchdog to be launched shortly by the industry. More than 90 per cent of national newspapers and the vast majority of the regional press, along with major magazine publishers, have signed up to the regulator. The Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) is now expected to be up and running by May 1 next year. Paul Vickers, chairman of the industry implementation group, said the response for an ‘independent, tough and effective regulator’ was ‘overwhelmingly positive’. The Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) is now expected to be up and running by May 1 next year . ‘This is an important milestone in the process of setting up the UK’s new self-regulatory system,’ he said. However, publishers say Ipso will not apply for recognition under the Royal Charter drafted by politicians and approved by the Privy Council last month. That amounted to state licensing of the Press and would lead to taxpayers’ money being wasted, MPs were told in a debate on regulation at Westminster Hall on Wednesday. South Dorset MP Richard Drax, who led the debate, said: ‘For all its faults I am proud and fortunate to live in a country with a free and often irreverent Press. Free speech organisations around the world are asking us to rethink. They fear these changes set a dangerous precedent for non-democratic regimes. Our Foreign Secretary William Hague agrees. ‘So why are we going down this road? True democracies erect a barrier between the Government and the Press for lots of good reasons and there is no excuse to dismantle it,’ he said. ‘Those in favour of a Royal Charter say it will not impinge on a free Press. I would disagree.’ Far from being toothless, Mr Drax said Ipso will bring ‘swift and fair redress’ to complainants. ‘Lord Justice Leveson called for a system that all sides could agree to – all sides, please note that word,’ he said. ‘Self-evidently, the Royal Charter fails in this regard and it seems that the Government has seen this for itself.’ Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said the Government is ‘delighted’ with the industry’s progress to establish Ipso.","More than 90% of national and majority of regional press have signed up .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The British poinsettia could be in short supply this Christmas because growers have been hit by soaring energy costs and competition from cheaper, inferior foreign plants. For millions of families, the distinctive plant – Britain’s second most popular pot plant after the orchid – is a festive staple. But delicate poinsettias need carefully controlled temperatures of between 15C (59F) and 20C (68F) and rocketing fuel bills have driven some UK growers out of business. Christmas favourites: For millions of families, the distinctive plant - Britain¿s second most popular pot plant after the orchid - is a festive staple. But many UK growers have pulled out of producing the delicate crop . They are now producing around a . million fewer than five years ago and shoppers are increasingly having . to buy imports from Holland. Many Dutch nurseries are backed by . subsidies to help install energy-efficient heating. Horticultural experts say Dutch poinsettias have weaker stems, fewer branches and are less hardy. British . growers devote 18 to 20 weeks to cultivating the plant while the Dutch . spend only 12 to 15 - and transporting it by lorry from Holland takes . its toll too. Roundstone . Nurseries, of Almodington, West Sussex, had been growing 200,000 . poinsettias a year for Sainsbury’s and Marks & Spencer. But bosses have decided to stop after the energy bill to grow its plants last year was more than £50,000. Roundstone managing director Peter Cook said that they are now growing cyclamen instead. 'Energy . use for poinsettia is very intensive for a number of months,' he said. 'Heating costs were £50,000-plus - a big investment - because they’re a . tropical plant and you have to have them at 20C to make them feel comfy. 'Poinsettia . turned out to be a risky crop. It is highly unlikely we will revisit . that crop as the cyclamen programme we replaced it with is more . profitable. 'With cyclamen, we’re not looking at huge gas bill. 'We’re sorry because so many customers want to buy British poinsettias but we have made the right decision for our business.' Thing of the past: The poinsettia Christmas crop at Roundstone nurseries last year. The firm has now decided to pull out of growing the plants after rising energy costs made it too difficult to make a profit . Ian Riggs, chairman of the British Protected Ornamentals Association, a trade body for British growers, said that poinsettia production among members has slumped. Temperamental poinsettias need specific conditions – but treat yours well and it could bloom again next Christmas. He said: 'Poinsettias have become one of those things on the Christmas shopping list that people expect like turkey and a Christmas tree. 'But there will be fewer British poinsettias available this year and garden centres and supermarkets can always go to Holland. 'We are talking about diminishing choice and people may end up buying Dutch and Belgian poinsettias. 'Poinsettias are a heat hungry crop. You cannot compromise on the temperature if you are going to grow a quality crop. 'And if growers see that last year’s fuel bill was high, that is what they base their decision on. 'A lot of growers have switched to cyclamen.' Mr Riggs said that British growers lavish much more attention on their crops than their Dutch counterparts. 'The British start growing earlier in June or July and have a lower density of crop - around nine plants per square metre compared to 15 in Holland,' he said. 'It means that they have more branches than Dutch poinsettias, which are more upright. 'And any British grower will tell you that theirs is a better plant because it spends less time in a lorry and is less tightly packed in boxes than the Dutch, who are mindful of their transport costs.' It is a very similar tale of woe nationwide for British poinsettia growers. Pinewood Nurseries, of Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, has halved production this year from 50,000 to 25,000 after poring over fuel bills. Coletta & Tyson, near Hull, used to be one of the country’s biggest growers that supplied 500,000 poinsettias to Sainsbury’s and Asda. But it gave up production in 2011 with director Paul Tyson citing 'spiralling energy costs'. Waddesdon Plant Centre, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, also grew the plant for many years but stopped because it was no longer viable. Poinsettias originate from Mexico and were once tall, fragile and mostly seen only in the houses of the wealthy. But hardier dwarf strains appeared in the Sixties and their popularity has soared since the Eighties. They are also a festive favourite in the US, Australia and Europe but Germans like cream, purple and oranges as well as red.","UK firms now growing around a million fewer poinsettias than five years ago .

Strummer, born John Mellor, died from an undiagnosed congenital heart defect in 2002 after a career spanning 26 years. He most famously spent ten years as The Clash's frontman and rhythm guitarist, releasing hits such as 'London Calling', 'White Riot' and 'Should I Stay Or Should I Go?'. The explosive band were overtly political, singing about issues such as unemployment and racism, and were also notorious for getting in trouble with the law. In 1977, he was arrested along with bandmate Nicky Headon for spray painting the band's name on a hotel room wall, and again in 1980 when he hit a member of the audience who was acting violently during a show in Hamburg, Germany. After the failure of their 1985 album 'Cut the Crap', Strummer disbanded The Clash, and spent 13 years working on a solo career which also included appearances in films such as 'Sid and Nancy'.","The 1963 Chalfont Blue Ford Thunderbird has already been bid on 70 times .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Federal police blocked access Friday . to a central Mexico hospital where six people were reported to have been . admitted with radiation exposure. An . official familiar with the case confirmed Mexican media reports that . the six have been admitted to the general hospital in the city of . Pachuca and may have been exposed to a stolen source of cobalt-60. The . official, who spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because she was . not authorized to speak to the media, said only one person was dizzy and . vomiting, which are symptoms of radiation poisoning. Scroll down for video . Found: A firefighter takes photographs of the radiation head that was part of a radiation therapy machine, on the patio of the family who found the abandoned radiation head in a nearby field . Who did it? The container went missing on Tuesday while en route to a waste facility. It was recovered the next day, but opened which means that whoever opened is probably suffering from radiation poisoning . Packed: The above photo shows the box containing the teletherapy equipment . The atomic energy agency said the . cobalt has an activity of 3,000 curries, or Category 1, meaning 'it . would probably be fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded . radioactive material for a period in the range of a few minutes to an . hour.' The missing shipment of radioactive cobalt-60 was found . Wednesday about 40 kilometers (24 miles) from where it had been stolen . early Monday. It's not clear if those hospitalized are responsible for the theft. The cargo truck hauling the cobalt-60 was taken from a . gas station in the central state of Hidalgo, where Pachuca is located. The material had been removed from obsolete radiation therapy equipment . at a hospital in the northern city of Tijuana and was being transported . to nuclear waste facility in the state of Mexico, which borders Mexico . City. The . highly radioactive material was found in an empty parking lot about a . kilometer from Hueypoxtla, a small farming town of about 4,000 people - . close to where it was originally stolen. Officials . say the radioactive source had been removed from its container but say . whoever had opened could die 'because the source's intensity is very . high'. 'They will eventually have to go to a hospital, and we'll be waiting for them,' NNSC official Mardonio Jimenez said. Dangerous situation: Representatives of the National Commission of Nuclear Safety and the Mexican Federal Police stand guard near the radiation container in a field near the village of Hueypoxtla . Cleaning up: The stolen container was found in a field in a rural town in central Mexico. Authorities are now working at containing the radioactive material . Cordoned off: Authorities are restricting access to the area surrounding the container so no one is accidentally exposed to the radioactive material . According to Juan Eibenschutz, . director general of the National Commission of Nuclear Safety and . Safeguards, the shipment of Cobalt-60 was Category 1 meaning 'it would . probably be fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded radioactive . material for a period in the range of a few minutes to an hour.' Authorities . are now in the process of containing the material in order to transport . it to a waste site, which they estimate will take about two days. 'It's . a very delicate operation. What's important is that the material has . been located and the place is being watched to guarantee no one gets . close,' Juan Eibenschutz, director of the National Commission of Nuclear . Safety and Safeguards, told the Associated Press. The container was discovered by a family, who were promptly put under medical observation, but according to Hueypoxtla's mayor, Javier Santillan, they suffered no harm. The truck marked 'Transportes Ortiz' left Tijuana on November 28 and was on its way to a nuclear waste facility when the driver stopped to rest at a gas station in Tepojaco, in Hidalgo state north of Mexico City. The driver, Valentin Escamilla Ortiz, told authorities he was sleeping in the truck when two men with a gun approached about 1:30am Tuesday. They made him get out, tied his hands and feet and left him in a vacant lot nearby. Safe: The family who discovered the stolen container were taken to a hospital for medical observation, but were not harmed. Above, a picture of other residents looking at the container from a distance . Watching: Policemen patrol atop a vehicle as residents look on near the perimeter where dangerous radioactive medical material was found . When he was able to free himself, he ran back to the gas station to get help. Police and military quickly joined the hunt to find the missing cobalt-60 because it could be used by terrorists to create a 'dirty bomb'. But authorities don't believe that the thieves who stole the truck did it to intentionally steal the cobalt-60. Eibenschutz said that the thieves were mostly likely after the white 2007 Volkswagon cargo vehicle. On average, a half dozen thefts of radioactive materials are reported in Mexico each year and none have proven to be aimed at the cargo, Eibenschutz said. He said that in all the cases the thieves were after shipping containers or the vehicles. Unintentional thefts of radioactive materials are not uncommon, said an official familiar with cases reported by International Atomic Energy Agency member states, who was not authorized to comment on the case. In some cases, radioactive sources have ended up being sold as scrap, causing serious harm to people who unknowingly come into contact with it. Exposure: None of the locals were harmed when the container was opened. Above, residents talk with each other as they wait for news on the radioactive material . In a Mexican case in the 1970s, one thief died and the other was injured when they opened a container holding radioactive material, he said. The container was junked and sold to a foundry, where it contaminated some steel reinforcement bars made there. Eibenschutz said all foundries in Mexico now have equipment to detect radioactive material. On the lookout: Mexican authorities scrambled Wednesday to find a truck containing 'extremely dangerous' radioactive material used in medical treatment. The truck and its contents have now been found seperately .","Police have blocked access to a hospital in Pachuca after six were admitted for radiation exposure .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Just as Rapunzel used her hair to help her prince up to her castle, a woman from China is using her own long locks for good - by auctioning them off to raise money for a run-down school. Xiao Yeh, from the city of Shenzhen in the northern province of Shandong, lives thousands of miles from the school she is trying to help - but that has not stopped her from feeling inspired to chop off her locks, which drop to a full two metres (6ft).

Ms Yeh has been growing her hair for more than 15 years, but is not scared to cut it . Ms Yeh added: 'I didn't grow my hair long until I entered university, since female students weren't allowed to grow long hair in high school. 'My hair grew very quickly and I remember once when I got up to use the bathroom, my waist-long hair seemed to scare other students. 'I got a bit self conscious about it and later didn't like to walk on the street with it down in case it got too much attention.' Her beauty regime included no chemical products and just the occasional trim to get rid of split ends. 'It takes an hour to wash, ten minutes to comb through and a whole day to dry' she said. 'The hairdresser used to tell me, ""Whenever I cut your hair I have to crawl around the floor"". 'I'm sure I'll miss it and I know my husband will but it's for a good cause and I can always grow it back.'

"By . Associated Press . and Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . A former hitman for Pablo Escobar, who confessed to hundreds of murders as head of the drug kingpin's army of assassins, was freed from prison on Tuesday after having his sentence reduced for studying and good behavior. However, his release was met by angry protests by his many alleged victims. John Jairo Velasquez, better known by his nickname Popeye, was released in the evening under heavy police surveillance from a maximum security prison northeast of Bogota. He had served 22 years of a 30-year sentence for plotting the murder of a former presidential candidate. Witness: John Jairo Velasquez gives his testimony while holding a book titled The True Pablo, Blood, Treason, and Death, during the 2006 trial against Alberto Santofimio Botero in Bogota. He has been released from prison for 'good behaviour' Velasquez was one of Escobar's most-trusted lieutenants during the campaign of terror, joining the capo's Medellin cocaine cartel before he turned 18. This picture was taken last year in Combita prison, where Velasquez served his time . Trafficker: Pablo Escobar . Born in 1949, Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria started his criminal career on the streets of Medellin in Colombia as a teenager, selling contraband cigarettes and stealing cars. When he was gunned down by Colombian National Police on December 2 1993 he was one of the wealthiest criminals in history, worth a staggering $30billion. After working for a short time as a bodyguard in the early 1970s Escobar moved on to cocaine trafficking. His operation became so successful that he was able to buy 15 planes and six helicopters to help smuggle the drugs, mainly to the United States. Escobar amassed so much cash that he had to spend around $2500 a month on rubber bands to keep the piles of notes neatly stacked. His Medellin Cartel inevitably attracted the attention of the authorities, but Escobar dealt with them mercilessly. He either bribed them or had them assassinated, which is where the likes of John Jairo Velasquez came in. Escobar was eventually gunned down in 1993 by Colombian police, who found him in a middle-class home in Medellin, with the help of U.S special forces, after a 15-month-long investigation. He was shot while trying to escape across nearby roofs with his bodyguard, Alvaro de Jesus Agudelo, who was also shot and killed. The slaying of the cartel-fighting politician Luis Carlos Galan during the 1990 presidential campaign he was heavily favored to win marked the apex of drug violence that engulfed Colombia two decades ago. In a bid to fight extradition to the United States, Escobar ordered scores of assassinations - of judges, cabinet ministers and journalists. The cartel waged a bombing campaign across Bogota, Medellin and Cali, with many of the explosive devices planted by Velasquez. Escobar even downed an Avianca commercial jetliner in 1989, killing all 107 on board, because he believed Galan's political heir, then President Cesar Gaviria, was aboard. Families of some of the Avianca flight victims have complained that Velasquez has not shared all he knows about the crime and say that his release could mean vital facts never come to light. Velasquez was one of Escobar's most-trusted lieutenants during the campaign of terror, joining the capo's Medellin cocaine cartel before he turned 18. As Colombia's bloody cocaine turf wars faded from memory, Velasquez liked to boast in frequent interviews from prison that he killed 300 people with his own hands, including his own wife, and helped plan another 3,000 hits. But the only murder for which he was convicted was Galan's. The family members of his many other alleged victims, as well as legal experts, grasped for an explanation when a judge last week determined he was eligible for parole. 'It's really sad that an assassin who committed so many homicides was sentenced for a single murder,' said Gen. Carlos Mena, the head of Colombia's highway police who as a young officer helped US authorities hunt down Escobar, who was killed by police in 1993. Velasquez, 52, took advantage of his time behind bars to obtain a number of academic degrees and to seek forgiveness from his victims. He also provided prosecutors with testimony that led to the conviction of a former justice minister close to Escobar for involvement in Galan's murder. In a string of interviews anticipating his early release, Velasquez confided that he had about an 80 per cent chance of being killed by former rivals after he's freed.  With the threat of a revenge killing lurking, he said he was considering relocating abroad. He also wants to sell to Hollywood the rights to an autobiography he wrote about his life alongside Escobar. But even while expressing regret about his crimes, he continued to demonstrate admiration for his former boss. 'If Pablo Escobar were to be reborn I'd go with him without thinking,' he told El Tiempo newspaper last year.

"By . Harriet Arkell For Mailonline . The striped 'Sheriff' shirt has been removed from sale by Zara, which apologised after customers said it looked like concentration camp uniforms . Clothing chain Zara was under fire today after it unveiled a new children’s T-shirt that bears a strong resemblance to concentration camp uniforms worn by Holocaust victims. The ‘sheriff’ t-shirt – featuring blue stripes and a six-pointed yellow ‘badge’ - sparked anger as online commentators drew comparisons with the Star of David badges used by Nazis to denounce their Jewish victims. Twitter users wrote 'What were the designers thinking?' alongside links to the shirt sold by Zara, which is part of Inditex, the world's biggest clothing retailer. Others wrote: 'I never saw a blue-white striped shirt in a Wetern movie' and 'Why the stripes? 'Sheriffs wore stripes?  NO.  Jews did during WWII.' Today the retail chain apologised for selling the t-shirts and said they had been withdrawn from sale. A spokesman for Zara said: 'The item in question has now been removed from all Zara stores and Zara.com. 'The garment was inspired by the classic Western films, but we now recognize that the design could be seen as insensitive and apologize sincerely for any offence caused to our customers.' A link to the page where the shirts were for sale was quickly taken down, and those who clicked on it were redirected to the homepage instead. The shirts, which were for sale in the children's section online in countries said to include the UK, Israel, Germany, France, Albania and Sweden, features horizontal rather than vertical stripes, and a six-pointed star. But the piece of clothing bore a strong resemblance to those worn by Jews in concentration camps during the Second World War.  Meanwhile the six-pointed yellow star recalled the Star of David that Nazis forced all Jews in the Reich to wear to mark them out. The Nazis ordered all Jews to wear a yellow six-pointed Star of David, while concentration camp inmates were forced to wear striped outfits, pictured, which share a strong resemblance with the Zara range of clothes .

'Jews wore stripes': The firm was picked up on the suggestion that sheriffs wore stripes on their shirts .

'We honestly apologise': A spokesman for the firm was quick to say sorry to those who complained online . Merchandise that offends: Bags with swastikas and trainers with slaves' shackles . In 2007, Zara had to remove a line of handbags from sale after they were revealed to have swastikas on them. Teenager Rachel Hatton, from Ashford, Kent, bought one of the £39 embroidered bags but took it back to the shop and asked for a refund after she noticed the Nazi symbol on the bag's fabric. A spokesman for the firm said the bags had been removed and added: 'We did not realise swastikas appeared on some of these bags, the swastika was not on the bag which was sourced by us after being supplied by an external producer.'

The shark is now at Fremantle beach, just off North Mole Drive, and is continuing to swim south. 9NEWS reporter Tracey Vo told local radio that one surfer remained in the water despite the closure of the beach. There's been several fatal shark attacks near Perth in recent years, including a 64-year-old Perth man who disappeared while swimming off Cottesloe Beach in October 2011. His shredded swimming costume was later found. The shark sighting comes after the West Australian Government's catch and kill trial program ended earlier this year. Drum lines were set off five Perth beaches and another two in the South West following a spate of fatal shark attacks in WA, attributed mostly to great whites. Sharks larger than three metres were destroyed as part of the program. Surf Lifesaving is trailing the shark around Perth's coast .

"By . Emily Crane for Daily Mail Australia . Surgeons in China have successfully implanted an artificial 3D-printed vertebra into a 12-year-old bone cancer patient to help him walk again. Doctors at Peking University Hospital in Beijing first removed a tumour located in the second vertebra of the boy's neck before replacing it with the 3D-printed implant between the first and third vertebrae to allow him to lift his head. The five-hour surgery was a world first and will enable the boy named Minghao to walk again after spending two months confined to a hospital bed. Surgeons in China successfully implanted this artificial 3D-printed vertebra into a 12-year-old bone cancer patient to help him walk again . Dr Liu Zhongjun, who carried out the surgery at Peking University Hospital in Beijing, first had to remove a tumor from the young boy's vertebra . 'This is the first use of a 3D-printed vertebra as an implant for orthopedic spine surgery in the world,' Dr Liu Zhongjun, who performed the surgery, told Chinese media CCTV. Before the surgery, Minghao had been lying flat in the orthopedics ward - he could only occasionally stand up but just for a few minutes at a time. Minghao had injured his back playing football and doctors later diagnosed him with bone cancer after locating the tumour. The 3D-printed implant between the first and third vertebrae will allow the boy to lift his head . Using existing technology like a traditional titanium tube (centre) would require the boy to have pins in his head. The 3D version (right) simulates the exact shape of a vertebra . Doctors replaced the tumor-ridden second vertebra with the 3D-printed implant . 'Using existing technology, the patient's head needs to be framed with pins after surgery. The patient's head cannot touch the bed when he is resting. This lasts for at least three months,' Dr Liu said. 'But with 3D printing technology, we can simulate the shape of the vertebra, which is much stronger and more convenient than traditional methods.' Minghao is now in recovery and Dr Liu said he was in good condition and expects him to make a strong recovery.

"By . Ap . and Reuters . A man in custody is a serial killer who is suspected of randomly shooting seven people, leaving four dead, over five days in the Los Angeles area, authorities said Tuesday. Deputy Chief Kirk Albanese said at a news conference that the three other victims were critically injured and two dogs were also shot and killed before the arrest of 34-year-old Alexander Hernandez of Sylmar. Los Angeles police SWAT officers took Hernandez into custody Sunday evening with a pistol-grip shotgun in his possession that they believe was used in the attacks. Scroll down for video . Major public threat: Los Angeles Police Department officers investigate the scene of a shooting Sunday in Sylmar, California, by a suspect police  called 'a major public threat' Investigation: Police said they are seeking clues to three separate shootings in the Northeast San Fernando Valley that left three people dead and four others injured early Sunday morning and appear to be connected . Horror scene: A vehicle has bullet holes at the scene of a shooting where one person was killed and two were injured in San Fernando on Sunday . Prosecutors have charged Hernandez with one count of capital murder, two counts of attempted murder and three counts of animal cruelty. He's scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday and remains held on $1 million bail. Prosecutors didn't know if he had retained an attorney. Albanese said Hernandez was being uncooperative with police. The shootings began on early August 20 when a woman was shot and wounded by a lone man in an SUV as she exited a freeway. The other shootings occurred over four straight days leading to the killing of three people on Sunday. Hernandez has only been charged in one of the killings. Still, Los Angeles County sheriff's Chief of Detectives Bill McSweeney said he 'is and was a serial killer.' The charges against Hernandez carry a potential death penalty, and prosecutors will ask that he be held without bail. Suspect apprehended: Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Kirk Albanese, at podium, takes questions from the media about a serial killer now in custody who shot seven people, leaving four dead over five days . Ongoing investigation: Hernandez has only been charged in one of the killings but Los Angeles County sheriff's Chief of Detectives Bill McSweeney (pictured) says he is a serial killer . Authorities said the shootings appeared random and there was no known link between the victims or motives. Authorities requested the public's help in filling in details on the shootings. Police believe Hernandez worked alone and is the sole suspect in Sunday's shootings. Detectives pieced together the incidents because of the timing, weapon used and descriptions of the vehicle, McSweeney said. Investigators will be reviewing unsolved shootings dating back several years, that involve similar descriptions of a tan or gold SUV and shotgun. The Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department created a 70-person taskforce along with San Fernando police to investigate the shootings, examining surveillance video among other measures. Los Angeles Police captain William Hayes told reporters at a press conference on Sunday evening that Hernandez barricaded himself in his home for an hour on Sunday night, after which a police SWAT team took him into custody. 'You have three grievous incidents, you have horrendous incidents,' Hayes said at the briefing outside Hernandez's home. 'We want to resolve this as quickly as possible.' Hernandez was charged with murder in the shooting of 48-year-old Gildardo Morales as he drove his pickup truck to work on Aug. 21 in Pacoima. He's accused of firing at a couple in their vehicle in West Hollywood on Aug. 20, and shooting three dogs, killing two, on Aug. 20. Police say Hernandez killed three people within an hour on Sunday. He has not been charged in those deaths, but Albanese said investigators are confident they have the man who did it in custody and the public is no longer at risk. Hernandez has served prison time and has four prior convictions, including possession for sale of methamphetamine, possession of a controlled substance with a firearm, and possession of a firearm by a felon, authorities said.","Alexander Hernandez, 34, was sought be police for four deaths over the course of a few days in Los Angeles .

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . and Frank Coletta . The Senator who sparked an internal revolt against Prime Minister is refusing to comment about what took place when Tony Abbott arrived late to a scheduled party room meeting. The PM reportedly scheduled a last-minute visit to a cancer research centre so he could 'justify' charging Australian taxpayers for a trip to Melbourne to attend a private function the night before. Mr Abbott was an hour late to the meeting of Liberal and National MPs on Tuesday and, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, explained his tardiness by telling the them he had to schedule an official visit to the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre to justify being in the city under entitlements. The private function held on Monday night was a fundraiser for the Liberal party. Scroll down for video . At the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Mr Abbott made no new policy announcements, and told journalists he was there to talk about the government's proposed Medical Research Future Fund . Mr Abbott reportedly scheduled the visit so he could 'justify' billing taxpayers for a fundraising trip to Melbourne . Opposition Leader Bill Shorten claims these revelations show that Tony Abbott is not fit to govern the country. 'What is most telling about these reports is that there are Liberal Party members leaking against the Prime Minister,' Mr Shorten said. 'A party and a leader that cannot govern itself cannot govern Australia.' He also said that the Prime Minister should 'never need an excuse to visit a public hospital in Australia'. At the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Mr Abbott made no new policy announcements, and told journalists he was there to talk about the government's proposed Medical Research Future Fund. Senator Ian Macdonald, who reportedly took the Prime Minister to task in front of colleagues for his late arrival, issued a statement this afternoon, insisting he would not be making any specific comments about what took place in the party room meeting. Prime Minister Tony Abbott shares a joke Ricky Johnstone, Assistant Director of Research at the Peter McCallum hospital in Melbourne on Tuesday . Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says the PM is 'unfit to govern' over the Entitlements-Gate controversy . 't’s a long-standing convention of the Party that we do not comment on, or describe, anything that might be said in the Party Room,' Senator Macdonald said. 'The reason for that is obvious. It allows Members and Senators to speak frankly in what are often robust and beneficial exchanges with Ministers and the Leadership Group. It allows input from backbenchers into the policy debate of the Coalition.' But Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has disputed the report that Mr Abbott told MPs he was late in order to justify being in Melbourne for a fundraiser. Senator Ian Macdonald is tight-lipped now, insisting 'we do not comment on, or describe, anything that might be said in the Party Room' 'He didn't say that to the party room,' Mr Turnbull told ABC radio on Wednesday. 'Tony was quite upfront and said he had been in Melbourne and he had been to a fundraiser the night before.' Asked if Mr Abbott had said he scheduled the visit so he could justify billing taxpayers, Mr Turnbull said: 'I don't recall him saying that, no'. A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister confirmed that Mr Abbott attended a private fundraising function in Melbourne on Monday night. 'All prime-ministerial travel is undertaken within entitlement,' she told the Herald. 'Whenever the Prime Minister travels he maximises his visits by ensuring he participates in community events, business visits and local media.' On Wednesday, parliamentary secretary Steve Ciobo defended the prime minister against what he described as 'slurs'. 'It is crystal clear the prime minister attends events right across the community in a range of areas and there's also a long-standing commitment to medical research,' he told reporters in Canberra. 'It is an absurd proposition to suggest the prime minister is doing anything other than remaining focused as he has been over many, many years to advancing medical research in Australia.'","Prime Minister was an hour late to a meeting of Liberal and National MPs .

"By . Associated Press . A former Marine has pleaded not guilty to killing the pregnant wife of another Marine. Christopher Lee, 24, entered the plea on Tuesday to first-degree murder with a special allegation of lying in wait. Lee said next to nothing at the short hearing in California where his lawyer pleaded not guilty on his behalf. Lee was arrested in Alaska on August 17 after the body of 19-year-old Erin Corwin was found down a 100-foot mine shaft near Joshua Tree in the Mojave Desert. The Tennessee native went missing on June 28. Scroll down for video . Christopher Lee, right, is escorted into the courtroom for a hearing on Tuesday in Joshua Tree, California. Lee is charged with murder in the death of Erin Corwin, a fellow Marine's pregnant wife . The body of Erin Corwin, 19, was found down a mine shaft near Joshua Tree in the Mjoave Desert on August 17. Her alleged lover Christopher Brandon Lee, 24, was arrested in Anchorage, Alaska last week and pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to her murder . Prosecutors said that Corwin and the married Lee were lovers. Her husband, Cpl. Jonathan Corwin, and Lee were both stationed at the Twentynine Palms Marine base. MailOnline revealed last week that Lee allegedly cheated on his high-school sweetheart wife Nichole with neighbor Erin in a secret five-month affair amid claims she became pregnant with his child. It has been alleged that Lee was terrified that his wife would find out. The murdered woman's husband, Marine Cpl Jonathan Corwin, attended the hearing with his father Tom and sat in the back of the courtroom, according to The Deseret Sun. Lee's wife Nichole was not present in court. Police sources said Lee has admitted conducting internet searches on human body disposal, and a witness told detectives that Lee asked him 'what was the best way to dispose of a human body,' a sheriff's investigator wrote in a document filed in San Bernardino County Superior Court in support of an arrest warrant. Lee had allegedly searched online for the best ways to dispose of a human body before Mrs Corwin's body was found down a mine shaft in California . In addition, .22-caliber fired casings and rebar were recovered from the scene where Erin's body was found in the abandoned mine shaft. The head stamp from the casings matched those on casings found in Lee's vehicle and home, the document said. Lee is due back in court for his next hearing on September 16. Erin’s chance of becoming a new mom was cruelly snatched away on June 28 when she vanished. She was allegedly murdered and her killer dumped her body down a 140ft deep mineshaft in a remote area around two miles from her home on Twentynine Palms Marine Base in California. She was three-weeks pregnant. The woman had told her Marine husband Jonathan Corwin she was headed to Joshua Tree National Park to scout trails she and her mother could later bike, but she never returned home. Erin Corwin, left, with her husband, Jonathan Wayne Corwin, a corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps. He appeared in court on Tuesday to face his wife's alleged killer . Her Toyota Corolla was found two days later abandoned just blocks from the Twentynine Palms Marine Base. The alleged killer's wife, Nichole Lee, was not in the California courtroom on Tuesday . According to search warrant documents, tire tracks matching those of Lee’s Jeep were found near to Erin’s car. Search and rescue teams scoured a 300-square-miles area round Joshua Tree National Park, including more than 100 mine shafts, for nearly two months before Corwin's body was found. The investigation grew to focus on Lee, who was the Corwins' neighbor at the Marine Base, according to court papers. Erin’s friend told investigators that Corwin and Lee were having an affair and that the unborn child might be Lee's, the papers showed. A close friend said Erin had become friends with Lee and his wife Nichole and the trio often visited a horse ranch just outside the town of Joshua Tree. MailOnline revealed last week that the newly pregnant 19-year-old  was ‘super-excited’ at having a baby after suffering a miscarriage earlier this year. Erin was heart-broken when she lost her first baby in February after complications during a brief pregnancy. But friends say the young girl was thrilled to fall pregnant for a second time and was looking forward to having a healthy baby.

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . A bank robber accused of raiding more than a dozen banks in New York lost all of his stolen cash playing roulette in Atlantic City. Dorren Singh, 26, of East Harlem, allegedly robbed 12 banks in Manhattan, one in Queens and one in The Bronx during an eight-month crime spree lasting from January until his arrest on Thursday. The bandit was eventually caught after being filmed on CCTV ditching his bank-robbing disguise in a Manhattan subway, reports say. Out of luck: Dorren Singh was arrested by police when he returned to his home in east Harlem after blowing $32,000 of stolen cash in Atlantic City . According to a police source after raiding his last bank, Singh caught a bus at Port Authority Bus Terminal and rode it down to Atlantic City 'to meet girls and have fun', reports the New York Post. They added: 'He met some girls and hung out. And he slept over in one of the hotels'. But Singh had far less luck at the roulette table at Bally's casino as it nearly wiped him out - leaving him with only enough cash to buy cheap clothes and food. And while he was blowing his stolen fortune, detectives in New York were piecing together CCTV footage to identify him. When Singh returned to his home in east Harlem on Thursday, investigators were waiting to arrest him. He was charged with robbery for the 12 Manhattan bank heists, and is awaiting charges on the two other thefts. Karma: After getting away with $32,000 in stolen cash, the bandit (pictured above in several CCTV clips collected) was not so fortunate in the casino . Singh has one conviction for criminal sale of narcotics in 2009 and has also been arrested for minor offenses, including criminal trespass and turnstile jumping. It is believed that the casinos where Singh played and lost are not responsible for repaying the money.","Dorren Singh, 26, robbed 14 banks, 12 of them in Manhattan, in eight months .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A school superintendent has come under fire for reportedly telling her students they were dressed like 'skanks' before making them bend over so she could check the length of their skirts. Ronda Bass insists she did nothing wrong and was simply trying to protect the girls of Noble High School in Oklahoma after noticing they were not following the dress code on the first day of school. When she addressed the issue in assembly, she left many of the girls humiliated, students said. 'As I was greeting the children coming in I knew we had a major, major problem on our hands,' she told KFOR. Under fire: Ronda Bass, pictured, reportedly upset students after she called them out for wearing inappropriate clothing to school. Students claim she called them 'skanks with their a**es hanging out' 'The first question I asked was, ""How many of you in here believe that there are female students on the campus today that are dressed completely inappropriate?"" Most of their hands went up.' But students said that is not the language she used. Student Katelynn Hill told KOCO the teacher actually said: 'Have any of you guys seen anybody around here dressed like a skank? If you can feel your skin on the bleachers then you’re showing your a**. And I don’t want to see anybody's a** hanging out of their shorts.' Another student, Sophie Stephens, said that Bass singled her out even though she believed her shorts and long-sleeved shirt were appropriate for school. She explained that Bass walked into her classroom and told the girls to stand while she checked their clothes. 'She told us to go out into the hallway and I actually watched her ask one of my classmates to bend over so she could see how short her shorts are,' Sophie told KOCO. Inappropriate? One student, Sophie Stephens, left, said she was singled out for this outfit, right, while some of her classmates were told to bend over so Bass could check that the length of their shorts . Humiliated: Students, including Katelynn Hill, said they did not believe the situation was handled well . Bass, who calls herself Momma Bear of the district, denied calling the girls 'skanks' but said she was strict about the clothing because she had heard her students were being ridiculed by other schools. 'I wouldn't have chosen this job unless I was willing to take on some of the stresses of it,' she said. 'I want us to be known as the classy lady Bears.' She said she also sent an email to teachers saying the girls were 'pushing the limits' and wanted their help establishing modesty throughout the school. Despite her comments, students said that some of the girls were humiliated and do not believe Bass approached the issue in an appropriate way.

"By . Emily Crane for Daily Mail Australia . An Australian held hostage in Iraq nine years ago says he came remarkably close to dying after Islamic extremists planned on beheading him before his 24-hour ransom was up. Douglas Wood, who was 63 at the time, had been working as an engineer on a construction project in Iraq when he was captured by extremists in 2005. His captors, who released footage of him pleading for his life surrounded by masked men, had demanded Australia and the United States remove troops from Iraq in exchange for Mr Wood's release.

'Had I not been rescued, they had planned to cut my head off before the next 24 hours were up,' Mr Wood told ninemsn. He was rescued after six weeks by Iraqi and United States troops in Baghdad as they carried out a routine raid at the compound where he was being held captive. 'There were five of us in there initially. The first time one of the others was killed, I heard three shots, and I thought, ""Maybe I'm next, maybe I'm the one after"",' he said.

But refusing to let the race slip away, Spiral Shell dragged itself back into contention - until the pair were neck-and-neck (or antenna-and-antenna) just below the fungus's flat top. Spiral Shell looked as if it was about to pull off a classic underdog story as it hauled itself up over the lip first. But Speckled Shell is not one to play by the rules, and rather than going straight for the cherry itself, decided to fright dirty and attack its opponent instead.

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . A Chinese hospital is being investigated for human organ trafficking after a patient claimed they stole one of her kidneys. Factory worker Wai Jianmin, 29, was admitted to Shenzhen Guangsheng Hospital, in China's Guangdong province, for a routine operation to remove a blockage in her urinary tract on August 23. But when she came round from the procedure she was shocked to learn that her kidney had been removed. Alarm: Factory worker Wai Jianmin (pictured) was admitted to Shenzhen Guangsheng Hospital for a routine operation but was told her kidney was removed when she woke up . Removed: Ms Jianmin's kidney, which a surgeon claims was bleeding . The surgeon told her that the kidney had begun to bleed and was removed to save her life. Ms Jianmin was highly suspicious, however. She said: ‘I was worried because there had never been anything wrong with my kidney and yet here was the doctor telling me out of the blue that it had to go. ‘But when I asked for a second opinion or to transfer to a different hospital he told me that if I didn't have an operation I would die so I reluctantly signed the forms.’ After the operation, Ms Jianmin’s suspicious family asked for independent tests on the kidney, which, they claim, had mysteriously disappeared from the hospital. ‘I think they took my kidney and did something with it. They tried to hush me up by offering me money and compensation, but I want to know what went on,’ said Ms Jianmin, who has made a formal complaint to police and health officials. A hospital spokesman said: ‘The kidney was removed in agreement with expert opinion and is now in storage at the hospital.’ Officials at the Shenzhen Health Inspection Bureau said: ‘We are investigating the allegations. There is no evidence of wrongdoing yet but we continue to interview people.’ Probe: Shenzhen Guangsheng Hospital (pictured) is now being investigated over the claims by Ms Jianmin .","Factory worker Wai Jianmin was admitted to hospital for a routine operation .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans for MailOnline . Jailed: Lee Kershaw, 38, was today jailed after sexually assaulting four women while on duty . A policeman was today jailed after sexually assaulting four women in their homes while he was on duty. Lee Kershaw, 38, who worked for Humberside Police in Hornsea, attacked the 'vulnerable' women on four separate occasions in 2008. He used his uniform and police car to gain their trust, before sexually assaulting them in their own homes. Now, he has been jailed for three years at Sheffield Crown Court after pleading guilty to four offences of sexual assault and four of misconduct in public office. The court heard Kershaw, a former soldier, had been previously imprisoned in 2009 for attempting to rape a woman in her home while her young son was strapped to a pushchair in the next room. During the same period of time, he also sexually assaulted two other women while he was on duty. Kerhsaw, who served with the Royal Engineers for ten years before joining the police force, changed his name from Lee Rackham following his five-year prison term. But after his release in June 2012, four further allegations of sexual assault were made against him. The court heard how all of Kershaw's victims - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had been approached while he was dressed in uniform. David Bradshaw, prosecuting, said in one of the cases, the police officer had been called to a domestic incident in June 2008 in Hornsea, East Yorkshire. Kershaw interviewed the woman, who was 'distraught and highly emotional', the court heard. He then told her he had some documents he needed her to sign, before arriving at her home 'fully dressed in uniform' and touching her intimately as she sat on the settee. Case: Kershaw attacked the unnamed women in 2008. He was jailed for three years at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) after pleading guilty to four offences of sexual assault and four of misconduct in public office . 'She signed some forms and was sat on the settee. He engaged her in conversation and committed the offence,' Mr Bradshaw said. Despite the woman confiding in a friend, she did not report the assault 'for fear of reprisals', the court heard. The attack only came to light when she spoke to another police officer in October 2012. Mr Bradshaw said Kershaw’s second victim had just come out of a long-term relationship and had been 'heartbroken' when she met him. The mother-of-three, who was 33 at the time, went out drinking with a friend and an argument took place, during which her friend was arrested by police, he said. The officers who were called to the incident, one of whom was Kershaw, then offered to take the woman and the friend home to 'remove them from the problem'. The woman was later awoken by a knocking at the front door and, because she was still drunk, answered the door naked. She found Kershaw stood on the doorstep. the court heard. She then went upstairs to get dressed and remembered being on the bed when the officer touched her intimately. Kershaw rang her up a few days later, and 'asked her to meet him in lay-bys', but the woman ignored him, said Mr Bradshaw. She only reported the assault when she read about Kershaw's other convictions, the court heard. Meanwhile, the third victim was approached by Kershaw in December 2008 when she was staying with relatives in Hornsea. She came across a road traffic accident, and the road was blocked, so Kershaw asked her to help him manage the traffic, the court heard. Job: The ex-soldier was working as a police officer for Humberside Police (pictured) at the time of the offences . At some point, the woman gave him her number and the address of where she was staying and later, Kershaw turned up at her house in a police car, apparently to 'make enquiries as to her welfare'. The victims' family went to bed, leaving them alone, and Kershaw engaged her in conversation, during which he told her personal details about himself. Mr Bradshaw said: 'The longer he was there the more uncomfortable she became.' After the victim moved away from Kershaw, he followed her into the kitchen and then sexually assaulted her. The woman felt she was not able to tell anyone and ignored what had happened until she received a phone call from police some years later who said they were investigating Kershaw’s conduct. Kershaw’s fourth victim was having problems with her 14-year-old daughter, who kept stealing and going missing, and her husband when they met, the court heard. Mr Bradshaw said Kershaw turned up at her house in full uniform, before he removing his stab vest and 'settling down on the sofa'. He then went from the living room into the hallway and to the front door, where without warning, he 'kissed her fully on the mouth'. She pushed him out of the front door and ten minutes later he rang her to say: 'I’m sorry I do not know what came over me, you are a very attractive woman.' When he was arrested on October 28, 2013 Kershaw, from Cottingham, claimed one of the women had been flirting with him and another found him 'sexy' in his uniform, the court heard. Caroline Goodwin, defending, said that since being released from prison, the former officer has set up a business as a joiner, and tried to move on with his life, but has been held back by the claims. 'This has not been able to take place because he has been held back by the further offences hanging over him like the sword of Damocles,' he said. Behind bars: Speaking today, Recorder Jonathan Carroll said Kershaw (pictured) had targeted at least two of his victims for their vulnerability . 'Clearly he was convicted in the name of Rackham and tried to make a fresh start and so the opportunity to move on again and forward is going to be the rug pulled from underneath his feet. 'It’s all very unhappily part and parcel of the same course of conduct. These were individuals who came across the defendant in his line of work. The defendant was dealing with these individuals as part and parcel of his job. 'This is not someone who has been trawling the internet. This is someone who in a very privileged role as a police officer, came into contact with these individuals.' Sentencing Kershaw, Recorder Jonathan Carroll said at least two of the former policeman's victims had been targeted for their vulnerability. He told Kershaw: 'You targeted them and preyed upon them knowing they were highly vulnerable individuals. You used your uniform and police car to give authority to your presence.' He added: 'The vast majority of us are taught from an early age that if you are in danger, difficulty or in trouble, we should turn to a police officer to go and get help. 'Policing is conducted by consent and that consent depends entirely on trust. It’s your conduct and conduct of this type that drives a complete coach and horses through that trust, destroying the relationship between police and the people they seek to serve.' Speaking after the case, Humberside Police Detective Superintendent Mathew Hutchinson said Kershaw 'abused the trust that was placed in him as a police officer' by committing 'a number of very serious offences'. He added: 'I would like to praise the victims for their bravery. Coming forward to report allegations such as these can be extraordinarily difficult and these women have demonstrated real tenacity and courage.'","Lee Kershaw, 38, attacked four 'vulnerable' women in own homes in 2008 .

"By . Dave Finlay For The Scottish Daily Mail . Mother: Sally Young, who came across the fatal crash in which her son David died, has been awarded more than £230,000 in damages after a judge ruled she was a 'secondary victim' A widow who came across a fatal crash she later discovered had claimed the life of her son was yesterday awarded more than £230,000 in damages. Martha Sarah Young – known as Sally – saw a badly damaged car while making her way to the gym where she was due to meet 26-year-old David. She later learned that he had been killed when a speeding driver lost control of the car she had seen. Mrs Young raised an action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, suing the driver who hit the young electrician as he walked on the pavement of Danes Drive, Scotstoun, Glasgow, in June 2010. The judge, Lady Rae, said she was satisfied that child development officer Mrs Young, from Bearsden near Glasgow, was a ‘secondary victim’, entitling her to enhanced compensation. The sum awarded dwarfs other packages, such as those given by the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme. A soldier who loses both arms below the elbow, or both legs below the knee, for example, receives only £172,000. Mrs Young, whose husband died in the Cormorant Alpha helicopter crash in the North Sea in 1992, was said to have had a very close relationship with her son, whose father had told him to take care of his mother and sister before embarking on his fatal offshore trip. Mrs Young said of her ‘model son’: ‘He was a very generous man. Anything you asked him to do he would just do for you.’ In 2012, motorist Arthur MacVean, then 63, of Glasgow, was jailed for four and half years at the High Court in Edinburgh after being convicted of causing death by dangerous driving. Mrs Young had parked and was making her way to the gym when she saw the badly-damaged car. Lady Rae said in her judgment: ‘Her initial reaction was one of relief that her own children could not be involved as her son did not drive and her daughter was at home.’ It was while she was at the gym that police arrived to tell Mrs White that her son had been involved. Crash: Motorist Arthur MacVean (right) was jailed for four-and-a- half years for causing the death of David Young (left) by dangerous driving . The judge said: ‘At that point she remembers screaming and shouting words such as “I don’t think I can go through this again. I can’t do this”.’ Mrs Young told the court that following her son’s death she was unable to visit places where she used to meet him, including the gym, and had visions of him walking in the street and ‘being hit into the air’. Lady Rae said that in assessing the damages to be awarded she was entitled to consider that Mrs Young had a particularly close relationship with her son partly due to the untimely loss of her husband. Scene: Mrs Young had seen this badly damaged car as she made her way to the gym to meet her son . The judge’s award included £80,000 for loss of society, £30,000 for personal services, £35,000 for pain and suffering, £80,000 for loss of earnings and services and £6,250 for the cost of psychological treatment. Lady Rae said: ‘I cannot ignore the evidence in the present case of the exceptional and unusual closeness between the pursuer and her son.’ Earlier this month, a boy whose grandfather was killed before he was born was awarded £14,000 for the love and guidance he will never enjoy. Russell Stuart died in a road accident in Aberdeen five months before the birth of grandson Harry.","Sally Young saw a damaged car while on the way to meet her son David, 26 .

"By . Paul Harris Reports For The Daily Mail . Expecting freezing cold water, perilous winds and crashing waves, he made meticulous preparations for a swim across the English Channel. But there was one test that endurance athlete John van Wisse didn’t bargain on yesterday – running into the border authorities as he set out from Dover because locals feared he was an illegal immigrant. As the Australian leapt into the water from a boat beneath the famous white cliffs, two eagle-eyed citizens spotted his bronzed features … and dialled 999. John Van Wisse, 41, was mistaken for an illegal immigrant while trying to beat 'Arch to Arc' triathlon record . Kent police arrived at Shakespeare beach in Dover this morning to look for the reported illegal immigrant, who was in fact a sportsman trying to break the triathlon record from London to Paris . Minutes later, the combined might of Kent Constabulary, Port of Dover Police, the coastguard and Border Force officials descended on Shakespeare Beach expecting to find a migrant struggling ashore after crossing illegally from Calais. Instead, they discovered the 41-year-old athlete – who had simply been posing for a photo before starting the next stage of his record attempt at a London-to-Paris triathlon. Luckily, Mr van Wisse and his team laughed off the official interruption as ‘priceless’. And according to a witness, police – who arrived at the beach expecting to find one of the thousands of migrants who have been massing at a camp on the French coast – also saw the funny side. Drama over, the Melbourne-based champion swimmer and cross-Channel veteran yesterday continued the middle leg of his 289-mile journey to run, swim and cycle between the English and French capitals. Before setting off he explained: ‘It’s the hardest thing I know and I just want to see if I can do it. I know it’s going to be tough but I’m up for the challenge.’ John Van Wisse, 41, had run 86 miles from London to Dover, which he completed in 15 hours 53 minutes yesterday, and is currently swimming from Dover to Calais in tricky conditions . Mr Van Wisse had just seven and a half hours rest between the run from London to Dover and swim to Calais . Mr van Wisse started the 86-mile running stage at London’s Marble Arch on Tuesday. It was timed to make the best use of tide times and conditions in the Channel, although it appears that news of his arrival might have escaped official logs in Dover. Blessed with a prayer by an inquisitive priest who encountered him earlier in Canterbury (‘May you always stay afloat,’ the good Father said) he grabbed some slow-release energy from a takeaway pizza and few hours’ sleep before heading to the water. Mr Van Wisse hopes to beat the current record of 73 hours and 39 minutes, held by Britain's Mark Bayliss . As he set off on the 21-mile swim from Dover to Calais, Mr Van Wisse was mistaken for an illegal immigrant . He completed the Channel crossing last night after 12 hours and 31 minutes. His team tweeted: ‘Next stop Paris!’ Mr van Wisse, who has completed a double Channel crossing and coaches other hopefuls, will now cycle the final 180 miles to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, aiming to arrive at mid-morning today. His aim is to beat the current ‘Arch to Arc’ record of 73 hours and 39 minutes, held by triathlete Mark Bayliss from Croydon. Provided, that is, someone has told the French gendarmes.","John Van Wisse, 41, is hoping to break the London to Paris triathlon record .

"By . Emily Payne for MailOnline . Hotel guests tempted to slyly tuck away couple of fluffy white towels into their suitcases are not alone. Nearly half (43 per cent) of British holidaymakers admit to thieving from their rooms, with 60 per cent of those people not considering it to be stealing, according to a survey. Twelve per cent said they took items because they felt that the hotel wasn't offering them value for money, while 15 per cent admitted to pinching things because they didn't think they'd get caught. Ever stuffed a robe into your suitcase? 43% of Britons admitted from stealing from hotels . Hotel guests that confessed to stealing items from hotel rooms most frequently said they did so because they believed it was expected of them, the survey of 1,000 people revealed. Of the guests who said they didn't steal, 35 per cent said there was because there was nothing they wanted, and 7 per cent were afraid of getting caught. Despite 16 per cent of holidaymakers saying would not take items because it set a bad example to children, those  with kids were just as likely as those without  to take things from hotels. Men were slightly more likely than women to steal things from hotels with 45 per cent admitting foul-play as opposed to 43 per cent of females. Fifteen per cent of those who stole items such as hotel towels thought that they wouldn't get caught . But the largest group prepared to admit their pilfering ways were young people, with 47 per cent of 18-34-year-olds saying they stole from hotels, compared to 45 per cent of 35-54-year-olds and 37 per cent of those aged over 55. Mark Byart, Director of Internet for Just the Flight, which commissioned the study, said: 'The survey shows Britons aren't always sure about what they can and can't take. 'Some hotels are happy for you to take mementos home, but others run on very tight margins and would rather not see extra toiletries going missing. 'Some hotels already have price lists for in-room items such as dressing gowns and towels - being upfront with guests can only improve their hotel experience.'","43% of British holidaymakers admitting swiping goods from hotels .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . Duped: Two couples say they were conned by the same woman who offered to give her 'unborn baby' up for adoption. They later realized she had never been pregnant to being with. Above, a pic of the woman and victim Kayla Hall . Two couples have come forward to warn of a 36-year-old woman who is faking a pregnancy and promising to give her unborn child up for adoption. Kevin and Becky Clark of Ohio and Jeff and Kayla Hall of South Carolina claim they were duped by the same woman who led them on for weeks in the adoption process before abruptly announcing that the child had died in stillbirth. The con artist didn't ask either couple for money, so no charges has been filed against her and her identity remains concealed, the Columbus Post-Dispatch reports. The Clarks say the woman finds her victims on Facebook, where couples seeking to adopt have started setting up special pages to speed up the process. The woman said she had mental health issues that prevented her from becoming a mom and that the father was a man who raped her after asking her out through a Christian dating service. Looking back, the Clarks noticed some early signs that not all was right - like when she shied away form letting Becky listen to the baby with a stethoscope. However, the hopeful couple took the woman on her word when she told them she was due in May and even gave them an ultrasound photo. Then in late January, she called them to say that she had lost the baby in stillbirth. Scroll down for video . Promises: Kevin and Becky Clark of Ohio say the woman offered to give her unborn son up for adoption, then said the baby died in stillbirth last January. They have since found another child to adopt, named Lilly . Victims: Jeff and Kayla Hall were also duped by the woman, who even sent them a picture of the 'stillborn' baby girl she promised them. When they called the company who allegedly took the stillborn portrait, they said they had no record of the baby . The Clarks became suspicious when she wouldn't allow them to visit her at the hospital, instead sending a picture of her ID bracelet and a graphic photo of a dead baby. They agreed to meet with her one more time when they got dinner at a mall. They were completely put off though when she asked to go to Build-A-Bear to put a heart in a teddy bear for their lost child. 'For little kids, it’s a cute place,' Mr. Clark told the Post-Dispatch. 'For three adults? Just weird.' Questions: The Clarks became suspicious of the woman when she would not let them visit her in the hospital after the alleged stillbirth . The Halls were targeted in June when the woman messaged them on her adoption Facebook page, asking: 'Are you looking for a baby?' 'From that moment until we basically busted her, she and I were in contact every day,' Mrs Hall said. Mrs Hall says she was overjoyed at the prospect of being able to adopt the woman's little 'girl'. 'Somebody is willing to do something for you that you can’t do for yourself,' she said. 'I was devoted to her.' At the time, the woman said she was 30 weeks pregnant and that she had been abandoned by the baby's father and her own family. Mrs Hall even invited the woman to visit them at their home in South Carolina. She became close to the family, Skyping with the Hall children and messaging them constantly. Then, just a month later, she broke the news that the baby died in still birth. She sent them a photo to prove it, saying it was from a professional organization that takes portraits for the parents of stillborn infants, . However, the Halls thought the baby just looked asleep. When they contacted the organization, they said they had no record of the request. Expanding family: The Halls have chosen to keep their Facebook page up as they continue to look for another child to adopt. They previously adopted three boys . The Halls then called the woman out for the fake pregnancy and she continued to deny it before eventually revealing she has multiple personality disorder. 'I felt sick,' Mrs. Hall said. 'I realized I literally had a sociopath in my home.' The Halls and Clarks eventually connected and decided to come forward with the story. The Clarks have since found a baby girl to adopt, while the Halls are still looking, and sticking with Facbeook. 'We’re still using it,' Mrs. Hall said. 'I believe there are way more good people than bad.'","No charges have been filed against the woman, who remains unidentified .

The images appeared on an official North Yorkshire Police page with the hashtag 'professionals at work' following a four-car smash on the A171 during rush-hour yesterday morning. At least two drivers were injured in the accident and had to be taken to hospital, while commuters complained of hours of queues as a result. Social media users have branded these emergency service workers 'crass' and 'disrespectful' after they posed for selfies at a crash scene which were then posted on an official North Yorkshire Police Twitter feed . One motorist suffered burns from an airbag, while another had to return to the hospital this morning because of the severity of his injuries. Social media users branded the pictures 'crass' and 'disrespectful', with some calling for the group posing in them to be sacked. Liam Gault, who was involved in the accident, said: 'It doesn’t matter if the crash resulted in injuries or not, there are things you don’t do and this is one. 'The crash will have affected the people involved and would have had a knock-on effect for loads of other drivers who I’m sure would have been annoyed to see the emergency services taking selfies.' North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue area manager Dave McCabe said: 'We will be carrying out an investigation into this occurrence and are, therefore, unable to comment further at this time.' At least two motorists had to be taken to hospital following the four-car crash on the A171 during rush-hour yesterday morning .

And a force spokesperson said that the officer who took the picture has apologised. They added: 'The officers had dealt with the collision and were waiting for the recovery vehicles.' Justin Candlish was in the orange van pictured in the selfie snaps and says taking a ‘selfie’ was the last thing on his mind. However, he added: 'It was a bad crash and the services did a great job'.

"By . Emily Crane for Daily Mail Australia . A woman who was killed by her violent ex-partner in a murder-suicide had called police 34 times in the weeks before her death. Kelly Thompson was stabbed to death in her Point Cook home, north-west of Melbourne, in February by her ex-partner, Wayne Wood. The police probe surrounding Ms Thompson's death will now be subjected to a review after it emerged investigating detectives were from the same station that failed to respond to a call for help on the night of the killing. Kelly Thompson was stabbed to death in her Point Cook home, north-west of Melbourne, in February by her ex-partner, Wayne Wood . Ms Thompson, who started dating Wood back in 2009, took out an intervention order against him in January after he started become abusive last year. Police escorted Wood to Ms Thompson's home on February 7 so he could collect his belongings and a day later her neighbour texted her to say she had seen Wood driving past the house several times. When she didn't respond, her neighbours called the police and while they were on the phone through a window they spotted Wood standing in Ms Thompson's bathroom. 'The caller was told: ""Don't worry about it, call us back if you hear screaming or broken glass"",' the Thompsons' family lawyer, Paula Shelton, told the ABC's 7.30. Police found Ms Thompson and Wood's body in the home three days later after her brother contacted authorities twice urging them to do a welfare check. Ms Thompson, who started dating Wood back in 2009, took out an intervention order against him in January after he started become abusive last year . Her parents, Wendy and John, believe the 34 phones calls she made to police before her death were to report breaches of the order. 'They have failed, miserably failed - they have failed two people that are now dead and families that are shattered and it should never have happened and it quite simply was so preventable,' Mrs Thompson said. In the weeks following their daughter's death, the Thompsons questioned the police investigation, in particular why local detectives from Wyndham station were handling the case due to the possibility that their colleagues failed to help Ms Thompson prior to her death. The police probe surrounding Ms Thompson's death will now be subjected to a review after it emerged investigating detectives were from the same station that failed to respond to a call for help . 'It smacks of conflict of interest from the bottom right through. And even with the detectives that investigated the murder, (they) have from the word go had this attitude that it was a simple murder-suicide,', Mrs Thompson said. Victorian assistant commissioner Tim Cartwright admitted this week the system had failed. 'It's only when the family's raised it that we've understood that the system's broken down there somewhere and that the investigation was remaining in that local division,' he said. 'It concerns me, it concerns the chief commissioner, it concerns the people down the line. The system's failed in ensuring that what we thought would occur has occurred. We'll be looking at that making sure it doesn't occur again.'","Kelly Thompson was stabbed to death in her Melbourne home in February by ex-partner Wayne Wood .

A gang armed with sledgehammers and driving mopeds smashed their way into a Rolex store in central London and made off with designer watches worth tens of thousands of pounds. The gang - also armed with an axe - launched their raid on the shop in Knightsbridge in front of horrified shoppers during broad daylight. Around seven men broke into the Rolex store in the One Hyde Park building shortly after 10.35am, after arriving on the back of three mopeds and a motorbike, witnesses said, using their weapons to smash their way into the store. Thieves armed with sledgehammers and an axe stole Rolex watches from a store in Knightsbridge, central London today . The gang - also armed with an axe - launched their raid on the shop in Knightsbridge in front of horrified shoppers during broad daylight . Around seven men broke into the Rolex store in the One Hyde Park building shortly after 10.35am, after arriving on the back of three mopeds and a motorbike, witnesses said, using their weapons to smash their way into the store . Eye-witnesses described hearing a smash similar to a car crash and also saw so much smoke that they thought the building was on fire. It had been thought that the thieves had used smoke grenades but police confirmed that was not the case. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Smoke grenades were not used. What people could see was a security feature of the shop, where smoke is released so the thieves cannot see what they are doing.' The store is located in an exclusive area of the capital next door to the five . star Mandarin Oriental hotel and opposite department store Harvey . Nichols. One man, who works in a nearby casino but asked not to be named, said: 'My colleague told me that there were people around on motorbikes, or mopeds, and all of sudden there was a lot of smoke and some type of smashing noise. 'He said he wasn't sure what was happening, but then he saw people driving away - he didn't say how many - on motorbikes again.' Eye-witnesses described hearing a smash similar to a car crash and also saw so much smoke that they thought the building was on fire . Another man who works in a Bureau De Change near to the Rolex shop, who also asked not to be named, added 'We just saw lots of smoke coming out, we hadn't heard anything. 'We were serving customers at the time, but we went and checked because we thought it was a fire at first. 'When we looked outside the police were already there.' A number of eyewitnesses to the event turned to Twitter to share what they saw, with one describing the robbers using axes and throwing smoke grenades. Alice Stuart said: 'Someone broke into the Rolex store in Knightsbridge. So much glass.' It is believed that there were seven men in the gang and they stole about 10 watches from the shop's display cabinets. One woman who works in a nearby clothes shop said she heard a noise which she thought was a car crash just before the robbery took place. It is believed that there were seven men in the gang and they stole about 10 watches from the shop's display cabinets . She said: 'I heard a smash, or a bang, from inside the shop, but it sounded maybe like a car had hit something or something like that. 'It wasn't until I heard police sirens in the distance I thought something may have happened, so I walked around the corner to look outside and saw smoke billowing out. 'I didn't have a clue what happened until somebody on the street told me there had been a robbery.' The front door of the shop was smashed and at least three display cabinets at the front of the store appeared to have been ransacked.

"By . James Rush for MailOnline . They do say two heads are better than one, but workers at a turtle farm in the U.S. had never before seen anything like this. A two-headed snapping turtle has been discovered at the Northeast Ark Turtle Farm, in Amagon, Arkansas, in a shipment of 30,000 of the reptiles shipped from China. The baby turtle is yet to be named, but representatives at the farm have confirmed they will be looking for a new home for the young reptile. A two-headed snapping turtle has been discovered at the Northeast Ark Turtle Farm, in Amagon, Arkansas, in a shipment of 30,000 of the reptiles shipped from China . The baby turtle was discovered at the farm last week, according to The Jonesboro Sun. A state biologist has said turtle mutations are rare, but are becoming more common. Workers at the farm have previously discovered a hatchling with one neck and two heads, but that died at birth. Turtles from the farm are usually sold for educational and research purposes, an employee said. The two-headed baby, however, will probably be sold to a collector. Earlier this year it was reported that a two-headed mutant snake had been spotted slithering its way through a village in India. The baby turtle is yet to be named, but representatives at the farm have confirmed they will be looking for a new home for the young reptile . The snake, which was believed to be a checkered keelback, was seen crawling past a house in Burdwan, West Bengal. The non-venomous snake slithered onto Apurba Ghosh's patio, leaving him just enough time to capture the magical moment on his camera phone. And in a flash it was gone, wriggling into a bush before he had a chance to catch it. It was never seen again.","Two-headed snapping turtle discovered at turtle farm in Amagon, Arkansas .

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . In just three days as manager of Crystal Palace, Neil Warnock re-signed Wilfried Zaha, settled his differences with Jason Puncheon and told forgotten front man Dwight Gayle he would lead the line at Newcastle. On Saturday, all three scored. Until last Wednesday, Warnock, at 65, was a semi-retired radio presenter. It certainly didn’t take long to hit the right frequency on his return to the Palace dugout — 31 seconds, in fact. That was the time of Gayle’s goal, but it was Zaha’s strike some 95 minutes later that salvaged a point. A £15million misfit at Manchester United — the club he joined from Palace last summer — the winger had been written off, his attitude questioned and his confidence shattered. Talent: Crystal Palace described Wilfried Zaha as a phenomenal talent after his equaliser against Newcastle . In just 24 hours Warnock changed that, a season-long loan deal having been completed only on Friday. ‘It’s difficult for such a young lad at such a massive club, where you can easily get swallowed up,’ said the new boss. ‘Maybe at that top level they wonder if they can rely on him but he just needs to be given that bit of freedom. He needs to enjoy himself. ‘There were four or five clubs after him but he’s come back to a club he knows. I don’t know where it comes from all this about Wilf’s attitude being poor. I think it might be because he slows play right down and he can look a little arrogant on the pitch and he wears those lilac-pink boots. Motivator: Warnock has had an immediate impact since returning to Crystal Palace for a second spell . ‘I don’t think he was given too much of a chance at Man United, but he can really enjoy this season.’ Like Zaha, Fraizer Campbell failed to make the grade at OId Trafford but he is in no doubt as to the ability of his 21-year-old team-mate. ‘He’s a phenomenal talent,’ said Campbell. ‘Maybe being closer to where he grew up will suit him. What you need to do is give him the ball and let him run at people. That’s what he’s brilliant at.’ Puncheon volleyed Palace’s second after Daryl Janmaat had levelled. Puncheon was fined £15,000 last season for derogatory comments posted on Twitter about Warnock in response to criticism of a penalty miss at Spurs but Warnock said: ‘It wasn’t hard not to bear a grudge. There’s too many turnovers in football. Wingers: Both Zaha and Jason Puncheon scored in the Eagles' 3-3 draw against Newcastle . ‘Will he take the next penalty? You’ll just have to wait and see on that one. But his goal was incredible from that angle. It was a great finish.’ Warnock was denied victory by Newcastle’s livewire winger Rolando Aarons injecting life — and goals — into a previously predictable home effort following his second-half introduction. Trailing 2-1, the 18-year-old’s header — his first senior goal — brought the contest level before he set up Mike Williamson for what should have been the winner two minutes from time. Zaha, though, had the last word when he pounced after Newcastle failed to clear from a free-kick. It was a happy ending for Warnock, whose dog had died earlier in the day. ‘My wife rang me when I got off the plane, it was unexpected,’ he said. ‘But Percy had been to the vet, he had cancer. He was a lovely dog. When you live in Cornwall it’s a great place to walk dogs in the peace and quiet.’ Peace and quiet are a thing of the past for Warnock now — but he’ll certainly be hoping the likes of Zaha can make a big noise this season. SUPER STAT: Palace have conceded injury-time goals in their last two visits to Newcastle. This time it was their turn, Zaha scoring the latest goal of the Premier League season so far. NEWCASTLE UNITED (4-2-3-1): Krul 5.5; Janmaat 7 (Anita 79min), Coloccini 6, Williamson 6.5, Haidara 6; Colback 6.5, Sissoko 5.5; Cabella 5, De Jong 5 (Perez 79), Gouffran 4.5 (Aarons 67, 8); Riviere 5.

"By . John Hall for MailOnline . Incredible footage has emerged showing Israel's Iron Dome air defence system simultaneously shooting down 15 rockets fired by Palestinian militants. The video clip, which was uploaded to YouTube by the pro-Israel group 'Sin', was filmed in an unknown location close to the Israeli border with Gaza. It is believed that the militants who fired the rockets were attempting to beat the Iron Dome by launching multiple missiles in one short burst in the hope that at least one may make it through. Iron Dome has been regularly called into use during the recent seven-week-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict, intercepting roughly 90 per cent of the hundreds of rockets fired by Gaza-based militants - the vast majority of them aimed at densely populated areas of southern Israel. Scroll down for video . Incredible: All 15 of the potentially deadly Qassam rockets are seen breaking up in mid-air as they are struck by missiles fired by the high-tech Israeli air defence system . Aerial attack: The defense missiles streak towards their targets . Threat: Multiple Qassam rockets emerge on the Israeli skyline. The video clip, which was uploaded to YouTube by the pro-Israel group 'Sin', was filmed in an unknown location close to the Israeli border with Gaza . The video clip begins with a scene of panic as Israeli citizens run for shelter while the terrifying sound of air raid sirens rings out in the air. Several seconds later the familiar sight of multiple Qassam rockets emerge on the skyline - fired from inside Gaza by Palestinian militants affiliated with the Islamic organisation Hamas. As the rockets enter air space directly above the amateur filmmaker - who appears to have used a mobile phone to shoot the footage - the explosive sound of reactive Iron Dome interceptor missiles being launched can be heard. Within seconds all 15 of the potentially deadly Qassam rockets are seen breaking up in mid-air as they are struck by missiles fired by the high-tech Israeli air defence system. Fear: The video clip begins with a scene of panic as Israeli citizens run for shelter while the terrifying sound of air raid sirens rings out in the air . Strike: As the rockets enter air space directly above the amateur filmmaker the sound of reactive Iron Dome interceptor missiles being launched can be heard. The deadly rockets are destroyed within seconds, breaking up into white puffs of smoke mid-air . Up close: The Qassam rockets (pictured) fired by Gaza-based fighters are basic steel artillery shells developed and deployed in 2001 by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades - the military arm of Hamas . The Iron Dome has been used by Israel . since 2011, having originally been developed to protect Israel from . rockets fired by Lebanon's Hezbollah Islamist group. During the 2006 Second Lebanon War, approximately 4,000 Hezbollah-fired rockets landed in northern Israel - including on Haifa, the country's third largest city. These rockets killed 44 Israeli citizens and forced a further 250,000 to flee their homes. Partly funded by the U.S., Iron Dome was finally declared operational and initially deployed on 27 March 2011 near Beersheba. Within days the system was forced to contend with the first rockets fired from within the Gaza Strip by Hamas-affiliated militants. Designed to shoot down short range rockets and artillery shells from the air from distances of 2.5 to 43 miles, the Iron Dome has since had to contend with thousands of rockets fired from the Palestinian territory, with the Israeli military estimating a success rate of roughly 90 per cent. Destroyed: Although the Iron Dome intercepts about 90 per cent of the rockets, those that do penetrate the system often strike densely populated areas, causing extensive property damage . Direct hit: Militants typically fire several missiles in quick succession, in the hope that the barrage will confuse or overload the Iron Dome and at least one rocket will make it through and strike an Israeli property . The Qassam rockets fired by Gaza-based fighters are basic steel artillery shells developed and deployed in 2001 by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades - the military arm of Hamas. In contrast to the highly expensive weapons used by many armed groups, the materials used in a Qassam rocket rarely cost more than £500 - allowing them to be produced and deployed quickly. During the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflict it is been estimated that rockets have been fired from Gaza into southern Israel roughly every hour. Militants typically fire several missiles in quick succession, in the hope that the barrage will confuse or overload the Iron Dome and at least one rocket will make it through. Although the Iron Dome intercepts about 90 per cent of the rockets, those that do penetrate the system often strike densely populated areas, causing extensive property damage.","Rockets fired by Hamas-linked militants in Gaza were blasted out the sky .

Wanted man: Arsenal forward Joel Campbell (right) is a target for Benfica according to reports in Portugal . Crisis: Olivier Giroud is out until January and so Campbell is needed as an option up front for Wenger's Gunners .

"By . Chris Cutmore . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . Ian Poulter has got links golf cracked. The way to win The Open at Hoylake this week is this: 'Just don't play bad. Simple as that.' If only it were that easy, England could gloss over a miserable sporting summer by celebrating a homegrown winner of the Claret Jug and anticipating another Poulter tour de force at the Ryder Cup in September. In the pink: Ian Poulter believes that The Open and The Masters offers his best chance of winning a major . But Poulter knows links golf can be brutal. He went to the famed layout at Royal Aberdeen last week with the purpose of getting 'beaten up' to prepare himself for The Open. He got just that: a second-round knockout. Still, Poulter will pick himself up off the canvas for his latest attempt at claiming that elusive maiden major championship. No matter the missed cut in Scotland, the 38-year-old will have more than a puncher's chance at claiming the game's ultimate prize this week. Poulter is engaging in fighting talk already, insisting that The Open, along with The Masters, represents his best chance of winning a major at long last. 'I love links golf,' he says. 'I'm looking for a big finish. I want to get my hands on that illustrious piece of silverware.' Wrong trousers: Ian Poulter made a sartorial double bogey at Troon in 2004 . Eye-catching: Poulter followed up Union Jack trousers (left) by wearing flamboyant plus-fours at Troon (right) VIDEO Poulter fit to play on Thursday . From the moment he dared to show up in that pair of Union Jack trousers at Troon a decade ago, Poulter has often been the talk of The Open. But since that sartorial double bogey, Poulter has also proved that when it comes to links golf he truly can wear the trousers one day (just perhaps not that particular pair). Two top 10s in his last two Opens suggests that the man who now calls Florida home has his best chance of landing one of the game's four big prizes back across the pond. Blistering late charges through the field at Birkdale in 2008 and Muirfield last summer have led to second and third place finishes. There is one obvious leap left to take. Relaxed: Ian Poulter shares a joke with Lee Westwood's son Sam during practice round on Monday . But what about Aberdeen last week? Rounds of 73 and 74 suggested he had not yet regained his touch playing British seaside golf. Poulter has been here before though. Not least at Hoylake in 2006 when he missed the cut by some margin while Woods gave his masterclass in strategic tee shots (or the 'stinger' in more animalistic parlance). The lessons learned that year, playing alongside Seve Ballesteros in his final Open, and a rather harsh reminder in Scotland last week are what gives Poulter confidence in such a simple outlook for this week. 'Links golf will highlight any error,' he . admits. 'There's nothing more to learn than understanding if you hit a . bad shot you will be punished severely. 'There's a lot of ways to see how to play Hoylake but you have to be on every aspect of your game to compete. It depends on the weather. If we get the same conditions as 2006 everyone will be playing it the same way as Tiger. 'You have to stay out of the bunkers. You have to make sure you're not making silly mistakes. They come from being too aggressive off the tee. It's a strategy everybody will consider. Given the big, flat-ish greens at Hoylake, this could be a tournament won by a man with a dead-eye on the greens – Poulter's most dangerous weapon.  But is the Postman – to use his Ryder Cup nickname – ready to deliver at last in a major? 'I feel very happy with my game. I feel fit and ready, refreshed and ready to go,' he calmly asserts. Popular: Ian Poulter signs autographs for fans during a practice round in Hoylake on Monday . But calm is not how most English golf fans want to see him this week. Could playing in front of home support be the key to unlocking that eyes-bulging, fist pumping, American-slaying maniac? 'It's always good to play in front of home fans, they love their golf,' he says. 'They're very partisan and passionate and they get right behind you. It's great, you can't ask for more than that. 'There's not enough events in the UK anymore to satisfy the fans. We have so many great fans and so few tournaments. But that means when The Open comes along they get right behind their players.' And if there's one more way to stir that inner Ryder Cup beast, being paired with two Americans on Thursday and Friday might just do the trick. Dustin Johnson and Jimmy Walker, who are both likely to be in Tom Watson's team in Perthshire, had better watch out. The Postman is on the prowl.

And, despite the glut of goals, Azpilicueta too would rather it had been straightforward. Shape up! Full-back Cesar Azpilicueta has urged Chelsea to tighten up at the back in the Premier League . Normal: Azpilicueta too would rather it had been straightforward like his Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho . 'We scored a lot of goals but we conceded a lot as well, and as defenders we are not happy, but at least at the end we got the three points,' he said. 'We are scoring more goals but we are conceding more goals from last year. 'As a defender I don't like to concede but I think we are playing better football collectively. I'd prefer to win 1-0.' Two of Mourinho's summer signings - Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas acquired at a combined cost of £62million - showed what a difference they can make at Goodison Park. Costa, a threat throughout, scored in the first and last minutes while Fabregas was influential in midfield. Chelsea have already scored 11 times in three matches, conceding four, and taken a maximum nine points compared to the same spell last season which brought four goals, one against and seven points. A lack of goals is what cost them in the title race last term, but that does not look like being a problem this time around. 'Last year sometimes we had to play very well to score goals and sometimes it looks easier now - obviously Diego is scoring for us,' Azpilicueta added after seeing Costa take his tally to four. 'I played against him last season and he is a good striker and we are happy to have him in our team. 'He is a competitive guy who tries his best for the team. He is a worker and we want to provide better balls for the striker. We have to progress and keep improving. We have to play with more quality. 'It is important for the squad to keep pushing because we want to play better and to win the games, which is most important. You get nothing for just playing well and having possession. 'We have a very good squad and we have three wins from three games and it is important to start well.'

But it was not a match he enjoyed because Gulbis is his training partner and mentor. Inspired: Dominic Thiem came from two sets down for the first time in his career to beat Ernests Gulbis . Good friends: The pair train together and Thiem says he did not enjoy beating his Latvian friend . The pair share a coach in Gunter Bresnik and travel the world together. They even warmed up together before Friday's match, but that was all that was normal about it. 'I hated the situation,' said Thiem. 'It's something really, really special, it's a really great win for me. It's my first time coming back from two sets to zero, first time five sets. 'But I would prefer it against anybody else.' Gulbis appeared to have the match in his grasp but struggled with cramp in the fourth and fifth sets. He said: 'A lot of my energy went on the mental part, the nerves that started before the match. Probably if I would play somebody else, I would be more relaxed. 'I thought that it's not going to be so difficult, but mentally it was difficult. We were both really nervous throughout the match. We both played far from our best tennis. Eyes on the prize: Diem, 20, stayed strong physically and mentally to reach the last 32 for the first time . Distraught: Gulbis has been unable to replicate his French Open form since reaching the semi-final in Paris . 'The level we play in practice is much higher than we did today. This was not a nice game. But he showed character, so it's really good. It's good for him.' Thiem next plays 19th seed Feliciano Lopez, and Gulbis hopes his friend can keep his run going. 'The positive is that Dominic is in the third round,' said the Latvian. 'He has an okay draw, so I wish him the best. 'I lost. I'm going home. Nothing is positive for me.' Gulbis was once where Thiem is now as a bright young thing of the tour, but he enjoyed life away from the court too much to realise his potential. Over the last two seasons Gulbis has grown up and knuckled down and the results have followed, the highlight being a run to the French Open semi-finals this summer. Since Paris, though, he has won just four matches in five tournaments, slipping out of the top 10 almost as soon as he climbed into it. Feeling the heat: Despite a good start the Latvian was unable to close out the game, blaming mental fatigue . 'At Wimbledon definitely I was a little bit overwhelmed from my Paris results,' he said. 'It was tough for me. 'Afterwards I took some time off. Then I had a good two weeks of practice. 'I did my homework. I was working hard. I was working good. Everything was good. You never know when the results are going to come. 'Unfortunately now is a grand slam. Everybody wishes that his top form is coming for the grand slam. Mine didn't come. 'Now I have to look forward to Asia. If I play really, really well, I still have a chance for the World Tour Finals. I just need to win something big. But it's good. It's okay. A loss is a loss, but it's fine.'","Dominic Thiem comes from two sets down to win .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . The formidable task of trying to win a third tournament in a row at The Open Championship is the sort of problem Justin Rose will happily take on. It is certainly a great deal preferable to the fool’s gold scenario he was wrestling with when the Claret Jug was last contested at Royal Liverpool in 2006. Never mind the hottest player in the field at Hoylake. Back then, his game was so stone cold he could not even make the starting line-up. Instead of the old-world charm of the Dee Estuary he was living the life of Reilly with the millionaire set off the coast of the South of France in a luxury boat — and rather wishing that he wasn’t. Relaxed: Justin Rose says he has nothing to prove ahead of The Open at Hoylake . VIDEO Rose looking to complete Open hat-trick . ‘That was certainly a strange week,’ he recalled. ‘I was half having a great time, living in the most lavish of environments, but people were asking me who was going to win The Open. There was a major going on, and so I didn’t really want to be in St Tropez.’ He is exactly where he wants to be this week. Brimming with confidence before the event that has become his No 1 priority. And so after the various failures, from the rugby to the cricket to the tennis to the football to the cycling, the hopes of a British sporting summer now lie with this quiet 33-year-old who first came to light at The Open in 1998 when he finished joint fourth as a 17-year-old amateur. With that stunning performance at Birkdale in mind Rose once said he would not feel his story was complete unless he won the Claret Jug. If truth be told, the millstone of that mental burden he placed upon himself has manifested itself in his poor record since, with not a single top-10 Open finish as a pro. But he has a more rational take now. ‘I did say that, didn’t I?’ he chuckled ‘I don’t think like that any more. A lot of that feeling went away when I won the United States Open last year. I’ve won my major now, and so it means I’m not going to The Open with any sense of having to prove myself. Teenage kicks: Rose celebrates finishing fourth at Birkdale in 1998 with mother Annie and late father Ken . ‘I’m over that part of my life. I feel the years of having to live up to what I did at Birkdale, or surpass it or justify it or whatever — that’s gone. It’s just part of my story.’ We met on the eve of the Scottish Open last week. Rose was hosting a clinic for TaylorMade, one of his sponsors, and, bogged down with allergies, he was feeling dreadful. It just sums up what a player he has become that he could go from that state to turn in such a commanding performance over the following four days to win the event. His victory in his previous start in the Quickens Loans National in America’s capital had been all about guts and determination. At Royal Aberdeen he showed all the class of a man now ranked rightly in the world’s top three golfers. ‘I went to Washington feeling like it had been a slow start to the year,’ said Rose. ‘I had played some good golf but nothing had really happened. ‘And then, on the first day, I was four over par after nine and obviously not playing well. To end up winning was unbelievable. It was an out-of-the blue win if ever there was, and what has given me so much confidence are the putts I holed on the 17th and 18th holes. ‘I’d never holed a good putt to win a tournament. I’d always had two putts for it, or a tap-in. So now I’m standing over this 20-foot putt and Fooch (his caddie, Mark Fulcher) has spelled out that this is one I have to make. ‘Now I’m developing the belief that when I need to make some putts I can make them. It started at the Ryder Cup at Medinah against Phil Mickelson in the singles and now this win. Now the whole year has been tipped into a more positive light. I can relax and freewheel a bit, knowing I’ve got wins under my belt, I don’t have to worry about the Ryder Cup and I’m grateful for the lift. These wins gave me a boost in all sorts of ways.’ Rose began the Scottish Open last week seeing it purely as a tune-up for The Open. ‘As the week went on that all changed,’ he said. ‘I hung around on day one and then played really well in the second round and started to really enjoy myself. ‘It’s a great event in its own right on a great course. I’d never won a tournament in Scotland, the home of golf, so it was a fabulous week.’ Great Scot: The world No 3 was delighted to win north of the border for the first time . He knows what comes next. Hype and expectation ramped up to the Nth degree. It’s an unequivocal blessing to have a home crowd in many sports but in golf, when you have so much time to think between shots, it can be a negative. ‘It’s the best feeling in the world if you’re playing well but if you’re off your game a bit you can sense the crowd getting edgy and you have to be careful that doesn’t affect you mentally,’ he said. Rose took in Wimbledon recently and was delighted to bump into Jack Nicklaus. Like Rory McIlroy two weeks earlier, he was eager to pick the great man’s brain. ‘I’m always interested in talking to him about how he prepped for majors,’ said Rose. ‘How can you not learn from him? We talked about the patience you need over the first three days and just trying to put yourself in position. My favourite stat about Jack is not that he won 18 majors but he finished second in 19 more. That’s over nine years of his life that he finished first or second in majors. Isn’t that incredible?’ Winning three tournaments in a row is an awful lot to ask when you’ve never previously won two but again, Rose will turn back the clock to 2006 for perspective. By Royal appointment: Rose, sitting next to rugby legend Brian O'Driscoll, at Wimbledon earlier this month . ‘If you’d panned my life out while I was sitting on that boat in exactly the way it has unfolded I would definitely have taken that,’ he said. ‘Dealing with the challenge of trying to win three tournaments in a row is the one all pros want. ‘When you’re not playing majors and you haven’t got your form, that’s the hard part. It feels such a long way back before you’re playing well again. Now I can just turn up and be myself. I don’t have to play great all week or play out of my skin. I need to do a good job over the first three days, see where I am and give myself a chance. If that happens I believe in myself now to go on and win. It’s so much more fun when you reach this stage and a more relaxed way of going into majors.’ Could he turn out to be the unlikely hero of this British sporting summer? Wouldn’t that be a victory for modesty and decorum? Rose offers a lovely, wry response. Nothing to prove: The Englishman lifts his first major trophy at last year's US Open . ‘It has been the opposite of last summer so far, hasn’t it, when Andy (Murray) did his thing at Wimbledon and the Olympics and all the other successes? So let’s hope the law of averages plays its part. ‘We’ve been through all these disappointments, whether it be in rugby, football, cricket or the Tour de France. ‘Let’s just hope the pendulum has swung in our favour.’ Justin Rose was speaking at the anniversary of the #1 Driver on Tour – the TaylorMade SLDR.

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Grigor Dimitrov will attempt to do in the third round of the US Open what only one player has managed in 28 matches - beat David Goffin. It is unlikely the Belgian will make the latter stages, but no player arrived in New York with more confidence than the Goffin. After losing to Andy Murray in the first round at Wimbledon, Goffin headed to Scheveningen in Holland to play a Challenger tournament. Form of his life: David Goffin is on a run of just one defeat in his last 28 matches, and next faces Grigor Dimitrov . He won that, just as he did the next two Challengers he played. Then he played in Kitzbuhel and won that  too - his first title on the ATP Tour. By the time he had come through qualifying in Winston-Salem last week and made the quarter-finals, he had won 25 successive matches. The run was ended by Jerzy Janowicz, but Goffin remains on a roll and, after beating compatriot Niels Desein in round one, he hammered 32nd seed Joao Sousa 6-4 6-2 6-0 on Friday. Cruising: Dimitrov outclassed Dudi Sela 6-1 6-2 6-2 in his second round match on Friday . 'It's the first time I've won 25 matches in a row and now I'm in the third round for the first time in New York,' said Goffin, whose ranking has climbed from 106 to 56 in seven weeks. 'The first tournament I played in Holland, I went there to get some confidence and I had tough matches in the first and second rounds. After that it gave me some confidence. 'I won the first one, second one and then I continued to play well. I won a lot of matches, but it's not over so why not in the next match? I'm very happy with the way I played today. It was a great match.' Goffin faces his stiffest test next in the shape of seventh seed Dimitrov, who trounced Dudi Sela 6-1 6-2 6-2. 'It's a tough match against Grigor,' he said. 'I have nothing to lose so I'm going to do my best to win this match. It will be an exciting match on a big court so I hope there will be a good atmosphere. I will try to be aggressive like I have been this summer.' Underdog: Goffin knows Dimitrov will be the favourite in their match on Sunday but he goes in with no fear . Goffin burst into the limelight at the French Open in 2012 when he reached the fourth round as a lucky loser and took a set off Roger Federer. His upward curve continued for a little while, but a year later Goffin found himself back outside the top 100, the hype taking its toll. He said: 'After that it was tough, but now the French Open is behind me and I'm looking forward. Now the most important thing is this tournament and the next tournaments in the season. I don't care what happened before.' Elswhere Fourth seed David Ferrer was handed a walkover when opponent Bernard Tomic pulled out with hip problems. On the rise: Dimitrov reached the semi-final at Wimbledon and is at a career-high world ranking of 8 . The Australian had surgery on both hips after the Australian Open and did not want to take a risk when he felt pain in the left one following his first-round win over Dustin Brown. Tomic, who has also been struggling with flu, said: 'I don't want to muck around with that area. For sure something is there. I've got to get it checked. It's not good right now. It's painful.' Marin Cilic has been impressive so far, and the 14th seed's 7-6 (7/2) 6-2 6-4 victory over Ilya Marchenko set up a third-round clash with 18th seed Kevin Anderson, who came from a set down to beat Janowicz. Gael Monfils avoided his customary drama in a 7-5 6-3 6-2 win over Alejandro Gonzalez and next meets fellow Frenchman Richard Gasquet, a 7-6 (7/4) 6-3 6-3 winner over Paolo Lorenzi. Nineteenth seed Feliciano Lopez won in four sets against Tatsuma Ito.","David Goffin has only lost one match in his last 28 .

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Maria Sharapova overcame Sabine Lisicki to set up a tasty fourth-round clash with Caroline Wozniacki at the US Open. There was nothing pretty or straightforward about Sharapova's 6-2 6-4 victory, which took an hour and 41 minutes, but she was the tougher in the end under the lights on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court. Lisicki had only won one of six previous meetings against Sharapova, at Wimbledon in 2012, but her big game means she is always a danger. Full flow: Sharapova sends down a serve as she sees off Lisicki in straight sets . Tough match: Lisicki put in a decent display but Sharapova just had enough in the end to battle through . Last month the German hit a serve measured at 131mph, a world record for a woman. Her radar was off in her first service game, though, with two double faults proving very costly as Sharapova ground her way into a 3-0 lead. The Russian was coming under pressure in every service game but resisted impressively, and another Lisicki double fault eventually handed her the set. Lisicki is known for her attacking style but she showed tremendous powers of defence to move 3-1 ahead in the second set. However, Sharapova is the ultimate scrapper and she took advantage of a horrible drive volley from her opponent to level proceedings. Srapping: The Russian star needed three match points to finally see off her German opponent . The Russian had the momentum now and set up a chance to serve for the match at 5-3 but back came Lisicki, who was certainly playing at a much higher level now. The pair traded crunching forehands but in the end it was a forehand drilled just wide from Lisicki that handed Sharapova victory on her third match point. The fifth seed said: 'She was a really tough opponent, a very aggressive big server. I just tried to concentrate on my return. I wasn't serving as well as I wanted to. 'In the end it was a few points. I was happy I was able to break her.' Sharapova added she was hoping for a 'goodnight hug' from boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov, who won his second-round match earlier. Delight: Sharapova enjoys winning a point on her way to earning a fourth-round tie against Caroline Wozniacki . Wozniacki has had an impressive summer and was very solid in a 6-3 6-2 victory over 18th seed Andrea Petkovic. 'I think every match I get into a better groove out there and I'm playing better,' said the Dane. 'It's nice to be through to the fourth round again. 'It's going to be another tough one, but I'm excited about it.'","Maria Sharapova wins third round match 6-2 6-4 .

"By . Mike Dickson for The Mail on Sunday . Australian Sam Groth trades on the fact that he has the fastest serve in the world but even that was not enough to see off Roger Federer as he continued to cruise through the US Open. Groth managed to get the speed gun — seemingly reliable at Flushing Meadows, which is not always the case — clocking 142mph but still the veteran Swiss got it back en route to a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory that keeps him on schedule for an 18th Grand Slam title. ‘I think once you go past the 135mph mark everything is really fast, sometimes you just have to guess which side and close your eyes,’ said Federer, who could have been extended into a fourth set if he had not managed to break back from 2-4 down in the third. On his way: Federer won the match in straight sets against the 26-year-old Australian to reach the third round . Stretching: The second seed was made to work hard, and saw his serve broken in the second and third sets . Good contest: It was a clash of styles but Federer was just too good after Groth had made him work . Power: The Australian fired down serves of up to 147mph during the match, but it wasn't enough . All smiles: Federer salutes the crowd after his victory as the men's top seeds continue to their fine start . Next up: Marcel Granollers, who beat Ivo Karlovic on Friday, will be Federer's third round opponent . He added: ‘You can often tell when they’re really going to crank it up. I can guess to within two mph how fast a serve is. I was really pleased how I handled it tonight.’ For all the danger of Groth’s serve this has been yet another Major when Federer has been blessed by a good draw, and his third round opponent is Spain’s Marcel Granollers, who beat another huge server, Ivo Karlovic, three sets to two.

"By . Chris Waugh . Paul Collingwood will stay at Durham until the end of the 2015 season after he signed a new one-year deal with the team he skippered to the 2013 County Championship. The 38-year-old was widely expected to announce his retirement at the end of the current campaign, but he has decided to put his plans of calling it day on ice for another year. Durham captain Collingwood, a former England all-rounder who skippered his country to the 2010 Twenty20 World Cup, will lead the county for another season in the four-day format of the game. Staying on: Durham captain Paul Collingwood has signed a new one-year contract until the end of 2015 . Glory: Paul Collingwood captained Durham to the 2013 County Championship and has extended his contract . Having already scored 518 runs in the championship this season in a team fighting relegation, and having averaged 68 in the Royal London One-Day Cup, Collingwood has decided to continue playing. He had coached Scotland to the Twenty20 World Cup and also worked under Ashley Giles for the England one-day side. 'I had presumed this was going to be my last season but I'm really enjoying my cricket and feel as though I'm still contributing to the team,' Collingwood said. 'You're a long time retired and I've still got ambitions to take this team forward. 'It really is a special group of guys to be involved with and I don't want to give that up too early. 'We've got a lot to play for in the back end of the season with the quarter-finals and trying to avoid relegation, which would be a huge achievement. Postponement: Collingwood, who scored 4,259 Test runs for England, has delayed his retirement by a year . Support: Sunderland fan Paul Collingwood watched his team battle to a 1-1 draw with Manchester United . 'There is a bigger picture as well which is about having another year to continue to create a culture that will hopefully be around for another five to 10 years. I'm certain that the backbone of this side, with the youngsters coming through, will be strong for years to come.' Collingwood scored 4,259 Test runs for England in 68 matches, as well as representing his nation 197 times in ODIs and on 35 occasions in the Twenty20 format of the game. Durham head coach Jon Lewis added: 'Everyone at the club is delighted that Paul will be continuing his career. 'His contribution as a player, leader and character in the dressing room is difficult to measure. 'It is a big lift for everyone knowing that he will be with us next year.'

Tomic, who has also been struggling with flu, said: ""I don't want to muck around with that area. For sure something is there. I've got to get it checked. It's not good right now. It's painful.

""I can't afford to get on court and play against David and cause much more pain to myself because I'm going to have to stay with him the whole match. ""I can potentially make it 10 times worse. For me it's the best thing not to go on court today. It's a very difficult decision for me, but I have to do this."" It has been a season of wild extremes for Tomic, who played the quickest recorded match in ATP Tour history on his comeback from surgery when he lost to Jarkko Nieminen in 28 minutes in Miami.

But he never even got close to officially announcing his team as rain set in two hours before the scheduled 10.30am start at Nevil Road and was still falling at 1.30pm. At that point, umpires Paul Reiffel and Rob Bailey decided there was no prospect of even a minimum 20-overs-per-side match taking place.

"By . Pa Reporter . Andrew Flintoff savoured his return to the big stage with Lancashire in the NatWest T20 Blast final but admitted: 'If we'd won it would have been a hundred times better.' The former England captain was expected to be little more than a big name cheerleader on Saturday at Finals Day, having played just two matches since coming out of retirement this summer, but he was thrust into the spotlight after Kabir Ali was injured in the semi-final win over Hampshire. It led to an emotional evening for Flintoff, as the 36-year-old dismissed Birmingham Bears batsman Ian Bell with his first delivery and went desperately close to winning the match with the bat, striking a pair of back-to-back sixes off Oliver Hannon-Dalby at the end of the 19th over. Final attempt: Flintoff launched consecutive sixes to get Lancashire close but it wasn't quite enough . All rounder: The former England captain showed he is still more than capable in both disciplines . Flintoff was later moved to apologise to 25-year-old Hannon-Dalby, after having a pop at the bowler as adrenaline rushed through his system. The potential of a match-winning innings had entered Flintoff's mind, and he blames that for blurring his judgement when he aimed a verbal volley at the bowler he had just carted over the ropes twice. 'I had one of those horrible things where my eyes went a little bit, and I started to get really into it,' Flintoff said. 'I started to think ... 'I can win this, I'm enjoying this, it's brilliant this'. 'I walked past him and he had a big grin on his face and he was staring at me. 'I shouted at him, 'What are you looking at?', but I put another word in. 'It's like shouting at strangers - I didn't even know him. I felt really bad - 'why have you done that?'.' On fire: Flintoff is mobbed by his teammates after getting rid of Ian Bell with his first ball of the match . Sorry: Oliver Hannon-Dalby received an apology from 'Freddie' after the pair exchanged verbals . In the end, Flintoff and Lancashire fell short as Birmingham lifted the trophy on their home ground of Edgbaston with a dramatic four-run victory over the Lightning. 'We gave the crowd false hope. Fair play to the Warwickshire lads afterwards. They were deserving winners and I apologised to the big lad for shouting at him,' Flintoff said. 'If we'd won it would have been a hundred times better.' Speaking on his Flintoff and Holcroft podcast, Flintoff detailed how he had been training alone while filming a television show about fish and chips, taking bowling boots and a cricket ball with him on a trip to the Scottish Highlands earlier in the week. 'I practised well on Friday, and I put myself in the frame but I didn't play the semi-final, I didn't expect to but there was the chance if someone went down injured I'd get a game,' he added. When Kabir was ruled out of the final, the door opened. Congratulations: An ever-graceful Flintoff offers his hand to Boyd Rankin at the game's conclusion . 'I thought, 'how is this happening, it's Finals Day and I've been frying fish for three weeks,' Flintoff said. 'I warmed up well and hadn't batted since the morning, and I thought 'I won't get in, I'm number nine'.' Bell, a former England colleague of Flintoff's, was thrilled by Birmingham's success. He said on the ECB YouTube channel: 'To win Finals Day is huge but to do it at home is unbelievable. 'The guys should enjoy it over the next couple of weeks. It was a great day for Warwickshire. Unbelievable: Ian Bell (left) described winning the T20 Blast trophy as meaning as much as England victories . 'Some of our batting in the middle was incredible. It wasn't just brutal with power, it was clever as well. 'It's nice to pop in for one day of T20 among all the hard work of a season! 'Any chance I get to play for the club I love doing it.

A title winner at 15 and Wimbledon semi-finalist by 17, Lucic-Baroni's burgeoning career was derailed by off-court problems. Upset: Mirjana Lucic-Baroni reacts to knocking out second seed Simona Halep . Game over: Halep and Lucic-Baroni embrace at the net following their US Open third round clash . In 1998, she and her mother and siblings fled their native Croatia for the United States to escape father and coach Marinko, who she alleges physically and verbally abused her from a young age. Although she went on to have her great run at Wimbledon in 1999, beating Monica Seles before losing narrowly to Steffi Graf, Lucic-Baroni's success petered out. Financial problems limited the amount she could play and she contested only two professional matches between 2004 and 2006. But Lucic-Baroni was determined that her personal misfortune would not stop her playing tennis and in 2007 she began the long road back. She has battled away on the lower rungs of the tennis ladder, returning to the grand slam stage in 2010 after a gap of eight years. Her best run until now came at Wimbledon in 2012 when she beat Marion Bartoli on her way to the third round as a qualifier. The result will be a major disappointment for Halep, who has enjoyed a brilliant season, reaching at least the quarter-finals at the other three grand slams and losing to Maria Sharapova in the French Open final. There was also disappointment for Venus Williams, who served for the match against Sara Errani before losing a bizarre contest 6-0 0-6 7-6 (7/5). Williams came into the tournament with high hopes after a good run of form and had never lost more than three games in a set against Errani before. Anguish: Venus Williams served for the match against Sara Errani before losing . Determined: Errani used all her experience to overcome Williams at Flushing Meadows . The American's radar was horribly off in the first set - she hit four winners and made 18 unforced errors - but she looked to have decisively turned the match in her favour in the second. Williams served for the match at 5-3 in the decider but could not force a match point and Errani came up with two fine points to clinch the tie-break, throwing her racquet into the air and then perhaps unwisely shushing the crowd. Bizarrely it is the second time Williams has lost a match at Flushing Meadows having lost the first set and won the second to love - she was also beaten by Kim Clijsters in 2009. Lucic-Baroni will play Errani in the fourth round. It was a day of shocks, and another arrived on Court 17 where 17-year-old Swiss Belinda Bencic knocked out sixth seed Angelique Kerber 6-1 7-5. Teenager: Belinda Bercic, 17, caused a major upset by ousting sixth seed Angelique Kerber . Qualified: Bercic will play Jelena Jankovic in the fourth round after the Serbian thrashed Johanna Larsson . On form: Peng Shuai defeated Roberto Vinci after seeing off Agnieszka Radwanska the previous round . In her first visit to the last 16 at a grand slam, Bencic will play eighth seed Jelena Jankovic, who dispatched Sloane Stephens' conqueror Johanna Larsson for the loss of one game. Peng Shuai followed up her victory over fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska in round two by defeating 28th seed Roberta Vinci 6-4 6-3.","Former child prodigy Lucic-Baroni rolled back the years to beat second seed Halep in straight sets .

"By . Pa Reporter . New Zealand laid down a Rugby Championship marker as they thrashed Australia 51-20 at Eden Park to retain the Bledisloe Cup. The All Blacks missed out on what would have been a record 18th consecutive Test win as they drew 12-12 against the Wallabies last week, but they enjoyed exacting their revenge back on home soil. Richie McCaw scored two tries while Julian Savea, Kieran Read, Steven Luatua also crashed over for the hosts, who also notched a penalty try, while Israel Folau and Michael Hooper touched down for the visitors. Triumph: New Zealand captain Richie McCaw lifts the Bledisloe Cup after victory over Australia . Dominant: The All Blacks ran out comfortable 51-20 winners at Eden Park . It actually started well for Ewen McKenzie's side, who have not won at Eden Park for 28 years, as a lofted kick off from Kurtley Beale created a penalty opportunity as the recalled Conrad Smith strayed offside. Beale took his chance to give the Wallabies the lead, but that just seemed to irritate their hosts who responded with a forceful black tidal wave to pen Australia back in their own 22. They exhibited the kind of precise offloading and incisive running lines that were ruled out by bad weather last week, but ultimately they were made to settle for a penalty as Cruden levelled the score. A further kick from the Chiefs fly-half nudged his side in front before McCaw had a mad moment and was sin binned for hands in a ruck, with Beale taking full advantage to make it 6-6. First up: Julian Savea scored New Zealand's second after their penalty try . Going over: Kieran Read touching down the All Blacks second try just after half time . Despite being a man down it was the All Blacks, who also had two men binned last week, that seized the initiative during this period and Cruden kept the scoreboard ticking over with another penalty. Under mounting pressure Wallabies lock Rob Simmons was sent for a spell on the sidelines to equal the numbers and, in his absence, the All Black pack crushed Australia's scrum to earn a penalty try. Cruden and Savea then combined to devastating effect as they ran almost the length of the field before the Hurricanes winger made it an incredible 24 tries in as many Tests. Cruden added the extras to make it 23-6 at the break. Spot kicker: Aaron Cruden (left) converted eight of nine attempts in a confident display . Touchdown: Captain McCaw celebrates two tries in quick succession early in the second half . Conclusive: And Steven Luatua rounding off the scoring in the last minute of the game . Read's try was probably the highlight of the day as he latched on to an intelligent chip inside from Savea to finish off a fine sweeping move that had Australia scrambling from deep. Captain McCaw more than made up for his spell in the bin with two tries in five minutes, with Cruden also completing five out of five conversion attempts, before Australia hit back with a three-minute salvo of their own. Folau and Hooper both ran in fine efforts just after the hour-mark, with Beale adding the extras, but it was rightly the All Blacks who would have the last word. Once again down to 14 men after Ben Franks was pinged for hands at a ruck, Luatua went over in the final minute on his home ground and Aaron Smith added the late conversion. The result means Australia, who have not won the Bledisloe Cup since 2002, will have to wait until next year's shortened Rugby Championship for another attempt to lure the trophy across the Tasman Sea.","New Zealand thrash Australia 51-20 in Rugby Championship at Eden Park .

"By . Nick Purewal, Press Association . Chris Robshaw will lose vital opportunities to 'fine-tune' his Rugby World Cup captaincy after stepping down as Harlequins skipper this season, according to John Smit. Former Springbok hooker Smit believes England captain Robshaw's decision to relinquish his club leadership role could backfire on the host nation's bid to land the 2015 World Cup. England prop Joe Marler is Harlequins' captain for the new Aviva Premiership season, with Robshaw handed a sabbatical as he gears up to skipper Stuart Lancaster's side at next year's home World Cup. Hands up if you want a break: Robshaw is taking some time off from captaining Harlequins . Lead by example: Robshaw has been an inspirational captain since taking on the role . World Cup winner Smit believes head coach Lancaster has turned England into serious title contenders, but admitted Robshaw could regret standing down from captaincy duties at Quins. 'I'm not so sure that's helpful for Chris to stand down at his club,' the 2007 World Cup-winning Springbok told Press Association Sport. 'Captaincy's like anything, the more you do it, the more you practise, the easier it becomes, and the better you get. 'So I'm not so sure that's something I might have prescribed. Mistake? Smit says that Robshaw should be practicing his captaincy like any other skill before the World Cup . 'In a World Cup year you want to be right on your game, and there's an art to captaincy as well, and so to fine-tune that art every year is important. 'So I'm not so sure that's the best decision ever.' Smit joined Land Rover's Least Driven Path initiative in taking the World Cup trophy to remote communities. The ex-Saracens front-rower took the Webb Ellis Cup to South Africa's Cape Agulhas, Africa's southernmost tip where the Atlantic meets the Indian Ocean. Natal Sharks CEO Smit admitted getting his hands on the World Cup trophy brought back fond memories of South Africa's victorious 2007 campaign in France. Humility: Lancaster has produced a strong side led by a dominant pack but remains humble . Smit admitted head coach Lancaster's 'humble attitude' only serves to make England more of a threat at the World Cup. 'I think England are one of the strong contenders for the title to be honest,' he said. 'Lancaster has changed a lot of the culture of the team, and he's got an unbelievable pack of forwards. 'They are absolutely more dangerous with their new humble attitude, and I think they've already shown that. 'We've already seen a team that's full of no-nonsense attitude: we've seen a no-tolerance approach from Lancaster in terms of prima donnas. 'We've seen what he's done in terms of Danny Care, who's a great player: he's managed to make Danny understand what's required to be in the squad. On the road: John Smit and Chester Williams show off the trophy that they each won as South Africa captain . 'And a team with that amount of talent, with a no-nonsense attitude, is going to be a massive threat.' Smit believes the Springboks must beat reigning world champions New Zealand in the current Rugby Championship to arrive in London next year confident of claiming the Webb Ellis Cup. 'It seems like every Test match is a prelude to what will be the best World Cup ever,' said Smit. 'The important thing for the Springboks is to beat the All Blacks. 'They've progressed so much under Heyneke Meyer in the last two years but they haven't beaten the All Blacks yet, and I think that would be a real building block. 'All they have to do I think is arrive at the World Cup knowing that they've beaten the All Blacks previously. Getting over the block: The Springboks, who narrowly beat Argentina last week, need a to beat the All Blacks . 'We've taken the trophy to schools and kids who would never have seen this trophy in their lives; it's really building excitement for the tournament quite nicely. 'This trophy has an aura about it, and it's having an unbelievable effect on people. 'When I see the trophy all I can think about is that seven-week journey that took us to the title in 2007. 'Without doubt the highlight of that was just the relief of the whistle, a weight just lifted off your shoulders once we'd won.'","Robshaw taking time off from Harlequins captaincy .

"By . Pa Reporter . Rory McIlroy roared back on the second day of The Barclays with a brilliant six-under-par 65, but the world number one still trails joint leaders Adam Scott and Cameron Tringale by five shots heading into the weekend. McIlroy, looking to add to his victories at the Open Championship, WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and US PGA Championship, suffered a nightmare start on Thursday as he carded a 74 that left him nine shots behind pacesetter Bo Van Pelt. However, the Northern Irishman enjoyed a much better day on Friday, recording a blemish-free round that included three birdies on the front nine and three more on his way back - including the 12th and 13th holes, where he dropped three shots in total on the first day. VIDEO Scroll down to watch McIlory take Ice Bucket Challenge with Tiger Woods . Back in touch: Rory McIlroy hit a superb second round of 65 at The Barclays at Ridgewood CC on Friday . Face in the crowd: McIlroy hits a shot at the 13th tee as spectators watch on in Paramus, New Jersey . McIlroy's efforts left him on three under for the tournament, alongside the likes of Sergio Garcia (68) and Charl Schwartzel (70), although they were some way off the leading duo at the Ridgewood Country Club. Scott, the world number two and defending champion, matched McIlroy's 65 - the Australian recording seven birdies and a bogey - while American Tringale followed up his opening-day 66 with a 68. Scott felt his round could have been even lower, saying on www.pgatour.com: 'I played the par fives in one over today, so I could find four (strokes) there for you, and missed so many 10-footers...' They hold a one-shot lead over a group of three Americans in second place, Kevin Chappell (67), Brendon Todd (69) and Jim Furyk (69). Swede Henrik Stenson leads the European challenge on six under after a brilliant 64, alongside Scotland's Russel Knox, who shot a two-under-par 69. Overnight leader Van Pelt (71) and Kevin Na (66) are also in the six-man group on six under, along with Jason Day who matched Stenson's magnificent round of 64 - the lowest of the day - after recording four birdies in his final six holes, and Ernie Els. Els, 44, said after his second successive 68: 'I'm starting to feel like the old Ernie again on the greens. So it's exciting.' Among those to have missed the cut are English duo Ian Poulter and Luke Donald, South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen and Martin Kaymer of Germany.

But David Redvers, Sheik Fahad’s racing adviser, insisted Spencer had made his own decision while not ruling out a comeback at some stage. Redvers added: ‘Jamie knows his own mind.

"By . Pa Reporter . Jamie Donaldson has booked his place in the European team at this year's Ryder Cup after winning the D+D REAL Czech Masters by two shots. The Welshman held off the challenge of his countryman Bradley Dredge to scoop the 166,660 euros (£128,000) prize money and qualify via the European list. The 38-year-old hit six birdies and carded a four-under-par 68 to reverse a two-shot deficit behind Dredge after a third-round 71 saw him slip behind after leading following the first two days at the Albatross Golf Resort in Prague. Ryding ambition: Jamie Donaldson qualifies for the European Ryder Cup team after his Czech Masters win . At the start of the week he needed 30,000 euros (£24,000) from the Prague tournament and next week's Italian Open to ensure he tees off at Gleneagles without fighting a host of other names for qualification from the world points list. Donaldson was in a strong position to do that anyway and occupied the eighth of nine automatic spots, but his victory in the Czech Republic means he no longer has to worry about Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald, Ian Poulter and Stephen Gallacher breathing down his neck. ""This is big - it's been an amazing week,"" he told the European Tour website. Determined: Donaldson hit three back-to-back birdies to start his final day round helping him secure victory . ""I needed to play well either this week or next week, or both, to guarantee my place in The Ryder Cup Team so there was a lot on the line and this week I played really well, so that's great."" Donaldson hit three back-to-back birdies to start his round in style and picked up a further shot, with bogeys on the fourth and 17th holes, to nudge him to 14 under overall and past Dredge, who could only manage a par 72 after dropping shots on the third and 17th holes. The victory is Donaldson's third European Tour title and he savoured the moment afterwards, adding: ""Winning is everything: wins shoot you up world rankings, Race To Dubai, all sorts. It's massive - those three last holes coming in there were really tough with the wind blowing, so I'm just really happy to seal it. ""It's so difficult to get into the team, the lads are playing so well. You know that you have to play well to secure your place and it did come down to the wire. But that's how it is to get into the team - I played as well as I can play for 18 months, and then a couple of slow events and you rocket down the list, so it's great to come here and play so well and do enough to get into the team."" Dredge finished one ahead of Soren Kjeldsen and South African Merrick Bremner to be a runner-up for the second time in as many weeks, but the 41-year-old is not too disheartened and congratulated Donaldson. Belly up: Donaldson's win here was his third European Tour title and he will now shoot up the world rankings . ""I was trying to keep the pressure on and try to force the other guys into mistakes, but to be fair to Jamie he played great and I'm pleased he's secured his place in the Ryder Cup,"" he said. Gallacher, meanwhile, finished in a share of seventh on seven under and the Scot still needs a good performance in Italy to book his own place on Paul McGinley's team at the Ryder Cup. He said: ""The week went pretty well - bit disappointed with today, I didn't really play that well,"" said Gallacher, ""but top ten if you're not firing is quite good.""","Jamie Donaldson won the D+D REAL Czech Masters by two shots .

"By . Ian Ladybourn, Press Association . Hull captain Gareth Ellis has signed a contract extension that will keep him at the KC Stadium until the end of 2016. The 33-year-old former England international had the pick of Super League clubs when he decided to return from the NRL three years ago and opted to pen a three-year deal with the Airlie Birds. Although he still had 12 months left on that deal, the former Wakefield, Leeds and Wests Tigers second rower is keen to help turn around Hull's fortunes after failing to reach the play-offs this year. Deal: Hull FC second rower Gareth Ellis has signed a contract extension to 2016 at the KC Stadium . 'It has been a tough year but the signs are all there for the club to progress.' Ellis said. 'We have recruited well, the coaching staff are working really hard for us and (chairman) Adam Pearson remains really committed to the club, so as a player that is what you look out for. 'Hopefully I can repay some of that faith that the club has shown in me by signing me again and I will look to carry on with my best for the club for years to come. 'To have been able to secure another year on my contract is a great feeling and, just because it is only one more year, it doesn't mean that's what I feel I have left, because I feel I can play beyond that.' Ellis has been one of Hull's better players in 2014 and coach Lee Radford is re-building his side around the talismanic back rower. Stay: The 33-year-old ex-England international still had a year left on his deal before signing the contract . 'Gareth is a fantastic player and has shown why this season,' Radford said. 'He is playing some of his best footy and thriving on his role as leader of this group and those efforts have probably deserved much more than how this season has panned out.' Ellis will have a new second-row partner next season in Australian second rower Mark Minichiello, playing off a new half-back pair in Leon Pryce and Marc Sneyd, and Radford says the club's recruitment is not yet complete. 'We still have a little bit of work to do internally and have our eyes set on one, possibly two more new recruits to come into the club,' he said. 'We are talking to the players about joining the club which has so far been positive and we'll see where that takes us.' Target: Ellis (left) will be hoping for a better season next year after Hull failed to reach the 2014 play-offs .","Ellis has signed a contract extension keeping him at KC until end of 2016 .

"By . Martha Kelner for the Daily Mail . Mo Farah claimed yet another slice of British athletics history by breaking Steve Ovett's two-mile record in his first competition on a home track for 12 months. Farah, 31, grimaced as he ran against the clock, hunting a time set 36 years ago. The crowd at Birmingham's Alexander Stadium rose to applaud as he ran alone for the final three laps, having left his competition for dust. There was no Ovett-inspired waving to the crowd down the home straight but Farah soaked up the adoration afterwards, kissing the track and performing a lap of honour. Miles ahead: Farah surges towards the finish, with none of his competitors anywhere to be seen . Record breaker: The Olympic champion beat Steve Ovett's record that has stood for 36 years . Employing the devastating pace he usually reserves for more competitive races, Farah blitzed a 56-second final lap, crossing the line in trademark style with his arms spread wide. His time of 8min 7.85sec obliterated Ovett's previous European record of 8:13.51. 'I really wanted that one,' said Farah. 'As I got into it I felt better and better. I looked at the clock and thought 'you can do it'. The crowd definitely made the difference, they kept pushing me and I wanted to give something back to them.' There is double the reason to celebrate in the Farah household with a birthday party planned for twin daughters Aisha and Amani, who were two yesterday. 'We'll have a tea party and a bouncy castle,' said Farah, 'but I'll have to check with Alberto (Salazar, Farah's coach) to check if I can go on the bouncy castle, maybe if I take off my shoes.' Numerous setbacks this year, including four days in hospital and a disappointing marathon debut, have prompted Farah to discuss a time when he can leave behind the demands of elite sport to spend more time with his young family. It has, Farah admitted, been his toughest year. But in the past fortnight he has still managed to win double European gold and set his eighth British record, which bodes well for his second tilt at the Great North Run in two weeks. Delight: Farah sinks to his knees after crossing the line to become the fastest ever European over two miles . Strain: The Brit pushed himself hard to break the record despite being practically unchallenged in the race . 'I think I'll be able to come back stronger and more determined for the Great North Run,' he said. 'It will be about winning the race and finishing my season on a high. Getting ill and getting beaten has made me more determined than ever.' The British team, which produced their best ever European Championships performance this month, arrived in the Midlands with high expectations after performance director Neil Black promised they were poised to 'go global'. Ten of the medallists from Zurich were in action. Of them, only Farah, who won double gold, and silver medallist Lynsey Sharp truly delivered on Black's rally cry. Sharp has been running with open wounds, both literally and figuratively, all season but ran an astute 800metres, beating a top class field in 1:59.14. The 24-year-old, who was devastated after missing out on European gold, broke away to beat to beat world and Commonwealth champion Eunice Jepkoech Sum of Kenya. After two unsuccessful operations on a troublesome left heel, Sharp is 'having nightmares' about going under the knife again at the end of September. Sprint finish: Lynsey Sharp edges in front to win the 800m at the Diamond League Birmingham Grand Prix . Celebration: The Scot looks delighted with her win, which rounds off an excellent few weeks . 'The surgery site never healed,' she said. 'I have to keep it open because if it closes, the infection can't get out and it swells up. I have a suction pack which I put on every day to suck the bad stuff out. It's pretty nasty. 'We're having rows about the recovery time. They're saying four months, I'm saying six weeks.' Sharp only resumed training in May and has twice run personal bests this season. 'It's exciting to think about what I could do when fully fit,' she said. 'People are talking about Kelly Holmes's British record of 1:56.20. That's a big difference from what I'm running now but hopefully the times will come.'

"By . Press Association Reporter . Midfielder Callum McGregor insists Celtic will have put their Champions League disappointment behind them by the time they arrive at Dens Park for Sunday's Scottish Premiership clash with Dundee. The ramifications of the Hoops' 2-1 aggregate play-off defeat to Maribor - sealed by Wednesday's 1-0 second-leg reverse at Parkhead - are still being felt as it meant not only the loss of around £15million in potential revenue but also loss of face, given that the Scottish champions had two chances to reach the lucrative group stages. Legia Warsaw beat Ronny Deila's side 6-1 on aggregate in the third qualifier, but Celtic were reinstated when the Polish club were found to have fielded a player who should have been suspended in the second leg at Murrayfield. Scroll down for video... Call for calm: Celtic midfielder Callum McGregor says his team must move on from the Champions League exit . My bad! Ronny Deila (R) accepted responsibility for Celtic's exit from the Champions League . Chief executive Peter Lawwell explained the club's financial situation and reiterated transfer policy to disgruntled fans in a series of interviews on Friday in which Deila was given a vote of confidence. The Norwegian manager will have to try to recover the club's reputation in the Europa League, where they were drawn against Austrian side Salzburg, Dinamo Zagreb of Croatia and Romanian outfit FC Astra. However, McGregor, who signed a new five-year deal on Friday, maintains the immediate priority is the Premiership. 'It is back to league business and we have got to take care of that,' the 21-year-old said. 'I don't think it will be difficult. 'Obviously it was a hard knock we took during the week but we have dusted ourselves down and it is back to the league. Home disadvantage: The Celtic manager looks on as Maribor celebrate their 1-0 victory at Celtic Park . Super strike: Maribor's Tavares scored in the second leg to give Maribor a 2-1 aggregate victory . 'All the boys are focused and ready to go.' McGregor, whose displays this term have seen him called up to Gordon Strachan's Scotland squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against world champions Germany in Dortmund on Sunday week, is aware that newly promoted Dundee are showing good early-season form. Paul Hartley's side are unbeaten in four games, with three draws and a win taking them into sixth place.. 'Dundee have started well,' he said. 'Obviously they have just been promoted and they have a new squad so they will be flying and confidence will be high.

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Manchester United and Liverpool are set to do battle over Norwegian teen sensation Martin Odegaard. The fierce rivals were among those paying close attention to the 15-year-old's international debut this week. Odegaard became his country’s youngest-ever player when he appeared against the UAE. Easy to forget he's only 15: But perhaps not when Martin Odegaard's age is also his shirt number . But the secret is out on the Stromsgodset midfielder and the English sides were joined by Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus in the stands at Stavanger. The European heavyweights will again be in attendance when Odegaard and Norway face England at Wembley next week. Hernandez to seal £10m club record move to Hull . Abel Hernandez will complete his move to Hull City on Friday but a work-permit hearing means he is unlikely to be available for the weekend. A fee approaching £10million – a club record - has been agreed for the Palermo striker but he still needs the necessary paperwork before the deal is done. In the pink: But red tape is set to make Abel Hernandez (left) wait for his Hull City debut . Against the clock: Steve Bruce must find cover for injured Robert Snodgrass before the window shuts . Hernandez – who has completed a medical and agreed personal terms - has been capped 14 times by Uruguay and was part of their squad at the World Cup in Brazil, so manager Steve Bruce does not envisage any problems in that respect. The delay, however, means he will miss Sunday’s trip to Aston Villa. Meanwhile, Bruce is still looking to replace the injured Robert Snodgrass and West Ham’s Mo Diame is on a shortlist along with Manchester United's Tom Cleverley. One in, one out at the back for Sunderland . Sunderland defender Valentin Roberge is set for a return to France – and that should pave the way for the arrival of Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk. Ligue 1 club Reims want Roberge and they are in talks with the Black Cats over a fee, thought to be nominal given his free-transfer signing from Maritimo last summer. Transfer tussle: Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk attracting attention at Sunderland and Southampton . Sunderland boss Gus Poyet will immediately look to replace Roberge with Dutch centre half Van Dijk. Celtic are willing to sell the 23-year-old and he was offered to Newcastle last week. They are holding out for a fee of £8m but, given their failure to qualify for the Champions League, they are likely to accept £6m. Southampton are also interested.

The Foxes have made a £7m approach for the Wigan midfielder but Palace have also entered the race and Selhurst Park is his likely destination.

United have made a calamitous start to life under new manager Louis van Gaal, failing to win two Premier League games against Swansea and Sunderland before crashing to a 4-0 at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup. Paul Scholes has admitted he is ‘scared’ for the club he served so well. Cole, however, is a little more optimistic and does not believe that United will stagnate in the same as Liverpool did following the Anfield club’s sustained dominance in English football in the 1980's.

Red alert: United were thrashed 4-0 by MK Dons in the second round of the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night . VIDEO Van Gaal blames injuries, errors and luck . ‘I understand where Paul Scholes is coming from with his comments but I don’t think we will do a Liverpool’ Cole said,’We won’t be like that. ‘You don’t want barren spells because the Premier League gets stronger. European football moves on again if you are not in it for a year. That is the way football is it doesn’t stand still for anybody. So problems have to be addressed quickly.’ Cole does, however, accept that urgent improvement is required: ‘If you don’t win something at a club of this magnitude then people start questioning the players the manager and everybody.

You bring a new manager in and it doesn’t work out so you change again. It is going to take time.

"By . Joedy Mccreary . Camilo Villegas won the Wyndham Championship by a single stoke on Sunday for his first PGA Tour victory since 2010. Villegas shot a 7-under 63 and finished at 17-under 263. He earned $954,000 and 500 FedEx Cup points in the final regular-season event. The Colombian had four birdies and an eagle on the front nine, added a birdie on the par-5 15th and took the lead into the clubhouse. All smiles: The Colombian beams with the Sam Snead Cup after winning the Wyndham Championship . Always time for a selfie: Villegas poses with the trophy after being crowned champion in Greensboro . He then watched the rest of the field stumble late, giving him his fourth PGA Tour title and first since the 2010 Honda Classic. Bill Haas and Freddie Jacobson tied for second. Haas had a 64, and Jacobson shot 66. Jacobson needed a par on the final hole to force a playoff, but he rolled his 11-foot putt inches past the hole. Heath Slocum was two strokes back after his 67. Brandt Snedeker, Webb Simpson and third-round leader Nick Watney finished at 14 under. Villegas had to wait about 40 minutes after his round ended before his victory was secure. He closed his round with three straight pars, tapping in from about 2 feet on 18 and hoping it was good enough. In the zone: Villegas won his first PGA Tour title since 2010 with a fantastic final round . It was - because the crowd near the top of the leaderboard thinned itself out. Watney was at 17 under and appeared to be headng for his sixth PGA Tour victory before he ran into trouble on 14 and picked up his third bogey of the tournament and second of the day. He followed with four straight pars, leaving him needing a birdie on the final hole to tie Villegas. He had one on Saturday - but couldn't do it again. He wound up with a double bogey after his tee shot bounced past a cart path and out of bounds. That came after Jacobson also couldn't catch Villegas. The Swede's second shot on 18 fell short of the green and his 70-foot birdie putt from the front edge rolled well past the hole before he was wide with his par putt. Letting it slip: Swede Freddie Jacobson crumbled on the final day and missed a vital putt on the 18th hole . Congestion atop the leaderboard was expected after 12 players entered their last trip around Sedgefield within three strokes of third-round leader Watney, who was at 14 under through three rounds. And Villegas wasn't one of them. He began five strokes back but made a quick trip up the leaderboard, with three birdies and an eagle among his first five holes to move to 15 under and put himself within striking distance. The other main subplot here this week was the last-gasp push for spots in the PGA Tour's playoffs, which begin next week at The Barclays in New Jersey. Slocum, who arrived at No. 158 on the points list, was briefly at 17 under but slipped off the pace by closing with two bogeys that also helped keep him out of The Barclays field. He finished at No. 129. Paul Casey, 125th at the start of the week, tied for 18th to put himself safely in the field. Martin Laird, who was at No. 136, was near the lead all weekend but his tie for 14th could only propel him to No. 127.","Colombian shot seven-under in his final round to finish ahead of Freddie Jacobson, who missed a par putt on 18th that would have forced a play-off .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Mohamed Al Fayed has hit back at Felix Magath after the Fulham manager blamed the club's former owner for their recent demise. The Cottagers were relegated from the Barclays Premier League in May, after 13 seasons, and a poor start to life in the Sky Bet Championship saw fans of the club calling for the manager to be sacked. Magath told the London Evening Standard Al Fayed 'had not spent money', despite injecting around £200million into the club in 16 years to take them to the Premier League. He also claimed, under Al Fayed's ownership, Fulham 'sold the best players and brought in average players. You cannot go on doing that for a long time.' Changing hands: Shahid Khan (right) bought Fulham from Mohamed Al Fayed (left) in 2013 . Torrid time: Felix Magath has overseen Fulham's awful start to the Championship season . However, Al Fayed has described suggestions he is to blame as 'absurd' and was keen to point the finger back at Magath and 'absentee landlord' Shahid Khan, who he sold the club to last year. Writing in his column for the London Evening Standard on Friday, Al Fayed said: 'What an odd man Felix Magath is. I am not talking about the way he jumps around in the technical area when things go wrong on the pitch and then appeals to the dugout as if the physio and team doctor had caused it. 'No, what's strange is that after losing Fulham's first four games of the Championship season, he has got time to criticise me - someone he has never met - instead of devoting every waking second to putting right his own glaring mistakes. 'There is nothing dishonourable about failure, if you face up to it. Mr Magath isn't the first foreign coach to find the English game hard. What is wrong, and frankly un-English, is to blame someone else instead of taking responsibility for your own actions. Humiliation: Fulham were beaten 5-1 at Derby in their last game and are now bottom of the league . Hitting back: Al Fayed has described suggestions he is to blame for club's demise as 'absurd' 'I sold my beloved Fulham on July 13, 2013. If a week is a long time in politics, 13 months is a lifetime in football. Mr Magath was brought in to stave off relegation from the Premier League but instead presided over a meek surrender. 'It broke my heart. After 16 years at the helm at Craven Cottage, to see my work destroyed in a season was a bitter experience. To be blamed for that failure, is absurd. 'Fortunately, there are 25,000 people who know the truth. The Fulham fans. I am content to be judged by them.' Al Fayed also insisted he spent money in the best interests of the club, who saw their best years under his ownership as they reached the final of the Europa League in 2010. 'We played our part in making it the best and most entertaining league in the world. Fulham achieved their highest ever top-flight finish, seventh,' he wrote. Under pressure: Fulham boss Magath is in desperate need for his side to start picking up points . Outraged: Al Fayed insisted he spent money in the best interests of the club . 'We carried English prestige into the inaugural season of the Europa League, taking Atletico Madrid into extra-time in the final and within five minutes of a penalty shoot-out. 'Mr Magath says I bought only average players? So who were the men playing that night in Germany? I'll tell you: titans of the game and every one a hero. 'In football, you cannot be an absentee landlord, as I fear Shahid Khan is most of the time. I went on the pitch before games. I met the fans. I talked to the players. I encouraged them. Yes, they are paid a lot of money but they are still young men who need inspiration. People work for people, not anonymous boards of directors. I gave the players gold chocolate bars from Harrods. If they needed to try harder, I handed out blue peppermints and said they were Viagra. 'Those players never let me down. Misery: Fulham's Scott Parker looks dejected as the west London side lose 1-0 against Wolves . 'The personal touch is important. Managers need encouragement too. Every manager I chose tried to take Fulham forward. Two of them became England managers.' He added: 'When I was young, there was a cartoon character, Felix the Cat. Whatever happened to him - whether he was run over on the road to Dover or blown up with dynamite - he just kept on walking. 'If Fulham's results do not improve, starting with Cardiff tomorrow, perhaps this particular Felix should follow that cat down the road to Dover and then just keep on walking.'","Fulham manager Felix Magath had blamed former owner for club's demise .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Nico Rosberg has fuelled the debate over Lewis Hamilton’s failure to follow team orders during Sunday’s Hungarian Grand Prix by saying his rival’s behaviour was ‘not good’. Rosberg, the world championship leader, is not the most outspoken driver so his careful criticism of Hamilton is noteworthy. Speaking as the debate over the rights and wrongs of the incident widened, Rosberg said: ‘Lewis didn’t let me by although he was ordered to, so that’s obviously not good, and we need to discuss that internally.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nico Rosberg discuss disappointing Hungarian GP result . Holding station: Lewis Hamilton ignored a team order from the pit wall to let Nico Rosberg through in Hungary . The origins of the dispute lie in the . eight laps when Rosberg was a place behind Hamilton. The  Brit was . asked three times by the  Mercedes hierarchy to let his team-mate . through. That was because Rosberg was on a different strategy that . could, according to boss Toto Wolff, have allowed him to win. Hamilton . refused. The message was . passed on to Hamilton by his race engineer Peter Bonnington, who was . conveying the instruction coming from the technical director-cum-team . principal Paddy Lowe. In . similar circumstances last year — in Malaysia — it was Ross Brawn, then . team principal, who told Rosberg to hold position. His voice came over . the radio firmly, and Rosberg complied with the instruction even though . it cost him third place. The . incident on Sunday highlights doubts as to whether Lowe and Wolff, who . is meant to be in charge of the team’s commercial wing but is their . spokesman on most matters, are providing the right kind of leadership. VIDEO Hamilton should have obeyed team orders - Rosberg . I'll drink to that: Lewis Hamilton believes he has what it takes to challenge for the title . It . is questionable whether Lowe was even right to ask Hamilton to move, . something he seemed to doubt himself given he did not go on the radio to . issue the order and withdrew the instruction after the third attempt, . undermining his authority in the process. Niki Lauda, Mercedes F1 chairman, admitted they panicked into asking Hamilton to give way. John . Watson, a five-time grand prix winner, said: ‘I don’t see anyone at . Mercedes with the authority, credibility and gravitas that Brawn had. Brawn emphatically said: “No. Hold position,” in Malaysia. It is not . just what you say, it is the way you say it and it is the person who . says it. ‘Is Toto Wolff . more interested in projecting himself? Does he really have the . authority? Paddy Lowe is a fantastic guy, but he is not the person to . deal with this. Lauda is a very clever man, but I don’t know what . authority he has.

"By . Adam Crafton for MailOnline . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . As Manchester United seal the £16m signing of Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo, it seems fitting to reflect on the club’s rather combustible previous associations with Argentine footballers. There have been only three - Juan Sebastian Veron, Gabriel Heinze, Carlos Tevez. One has been cast as one of Sir Alex Ferguson’s greatest misjudgments, another attempted to engineer a move to Liverpool and the third musketeer ended up at Manchester City. United will hope that Rojo - whose surname in Spanish means ‘red’ or ‘fiery’ - will prove rather less problematic... Argentines: Marcos Rojo will be the fourth man from the South American nation to play for Man Utd . Juan Sebastian Veron . When did he sign? In the summer of 2001, United spent £28.1m on Argentine superstar Juan Sebastian Veron. Ferguson said:’What we have done is bring in a really top player, one of the best players in the world. He is world class - a fantastic footballer. Juan will bring a personality to the team which I feel we need at this moment.’ Delighted: Sir Alex Ferguson was full of praise for his new man Juan Sebastian Veron in 2001 . How did it begin? Veron’s early form was impressive, as the Argentine scored against Bolton, Newcastle and memorably, the fourth goal of that famous comeback as United defeated Tottenham 5-3 at White Hart Lane. Watch back the showreels of Veron’s passing and finishing and you cannot dispute his talent. Good star: The Argentine started well for Manchester United following his arrival . What went wrong? Sadly, it also coincided with a nightmare season for United, in which Sir Alex Ferguson’s side had lost six matches before Christmas and sank to 9th in the table. He struggled to adapt to the rigours of English football, although some of his performances in Europe were outstanding. Two seasons on, as Roy Keane, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes continued to outshine the Argentine, Veron was sold to Chelsea for £15m. Trouble: But it quickly went wrong for him as Manchester United struggle badly that season . What Sir Alex Ferguson said: ‘Juan Veron was capable of exceptional football and was talented. But, at times, he found the Premiership a bit difficult. He was a European player and that was where we got our best form from him.’ Famous faces: Veron celebrates with David Beckham during a Champions League match . What Veron said: ‘Ferguson trusted me when I first arrived. But later on it seemed we didn’t understand each other as well. There were times when I felt he preferred some of my team-mates.’ Tussle: Veron tries to get the ball off Chelsea's Frank Lampard during a 2-1 win at Old Trafford in 2001 . Gabriel Heinze . When did he sign? Now 10 years ago, Heinze was a £7m acquisition from PSG in the summer of 2004. Also signed that summer: Wayne Rooney, Gerard Pique and Giuseppe Rossi. How did it begin? The Argentine made a promising start to life at Old Trafford, scoring on his debut at Bolton and named as the club’s Player of the Year at the end of his first campaign. Supporters admired his all-action, committed approach, flying down the left-flank from full-back. Poser: Gabriel Heinze signed for Manchester United for £7million in 2004 . Battler: Heinze challenges Liverpool forward Fernando Morientes at Anfield . What went wrong? Heinze suffered a serious injury at the beginning of his second season at United and in truth, he never really recovered. Patrice Evra was signed as cover in the January and the Frenchman established himself as Ferguson’s first-choice at left-back. The following season brought reduced opportunities and in the summer of 2007, Heinze demanded a move away from the club. A £6.8m bid came in from Liverpool and Heinze argued that United had agreed to sell him to any club that matched that valuation. Ultimately, the case went to a Premier League tribunal and Heinze even recruited Liverpool’s solicitor, Hill Dickinson, to work on his behalf. The Premier League ruled in United’s favour and Ferguson shipped Heinze out of the back door to Real Madrid. Cheer up! Heinze tries to lighten the mood of a downbeat Wayne Rooney during training in 2006 . What Sir Alex Ferguson said: ‘A lot of fans will be asking what all this was about but it started a long time ago. ‘I was disappointed with Gaby from the time he joined us because he chose to play for Argentina in the Olympics in Athens in 2004 and didn’t come to us until the end of that September. ‘His first season was fantastic but the day before he got his bad injury his agent came to our hotel and asked if we could sell Gaby. After one year I thought it was an absolutely distressing signal to put out. ‘We allowed him to train in Spain and really he prepared to have himself fit to represent Argentina in the World Cup, which we couldn’t do anything about. Glory: Heinze did have some good moments at Manchester United, including being named Player of the Year . ‘We were not happy especially as he came back unfit from the World Cup. ‘Meanwhile all through that time his agents kept having meetings with (chief executive) David Gill asking to leave or double his money. ‘They wanted him to be the top-paid player, which is absolutely ridiculous given the quality of forward players we have.’ What Heinze said: ‘I am convinced Ferguson would not have given me a minute all season. I deserved better treatment after my efforts for the club. I thank the United fans - but they are very different to the directors.’ Has the relationship recovered? From the chants of ‘Arg-en-tina’ that Heinze was formerly greeted with by the Stretford End, it then became ‘You Scouse B*****d’ when the defender faced United with Marseille in 2011. Heinze has since said: ‘I don’t have many regrets from my career as a footballer, but that episode with Ferguson [has] to be one of them. I’m impulsive and strong-willed and this has got me into trouble at times, which was the case when I left United.’ Fierce: But he lost support from United fans after trying to engineer a move to Liverpool . Carlos Tevez . When did he sign? Carlos Tevez signed in the summer of 2007 on a complicated two-year loan deal after he arrived into English football with West Ham. How did it begin? United won the Premier League and Champions League in Tevez’s first season at the club, as the Argentine formed a potent partnership with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. His indefatigable style appealed greatly to United followers. Superstar: Carlos Tevez played for two seasons at Manchester United from 2007-09 . What went wrong? The signing of Dimitar Berbatov limited opportunities and left Tevez a exasperated. United were slow to take up the option to sign Tevez permanently and speculation grew that he would leave the club at the end of the season for Liverpool or Manchester City. Eventually, he decided to leave and make one of the most controversial transfers in Premier League history to the Etihad Stadium. What United said: ‘The club agreed to pay the option price of £25.5m and offered Carlos a five-year contract which would have made him one of its highest-paid players. ‘Disappointingly, however, his advisers informed the club that, despite the success he has enjoyed during one of the club’s most successful periods, he does not wish to continue playing for Manchester United.’ Glittering: He won two Premier Leagues and a Champions League during that time . Famous night: Tevez (left) celebrates with his team-mates after their famous win in Moscow in 2008 . What Sir Alex Ferguson said: In his autobiography, the former United manager wrote: ‘I brought Tevez on at half-time [in the 2009 Champions League final] and just felt he was playing for himself a little bit. From what I could gather, he had already made his mind up before joining City. ‘The rumour, not confirmed, was that our Manchester rivals had paid £47million. To me these were incredible sums. To me he was an impact player.’ All smiles: Tevez sharing a laugh with Sir Alex Ferguson in training before their relationship soured . What Tevez said: After Manchester City won the title in 2012, Tevez held up a sign that read ‘RIP Fergie’. He was quoted by the BBC to have told an Argentine publication: ‘It seems like Ferguson is the president of England. When he speaks badly about a player, nobody says he has to apologise but when someone comes out with a joke, you have to say sorry. I don’t say sorry. There’s no relationship at all between me and Ferguson.’ Preferred: The manager favoured new signing Dimitar Berbatov, which forced Tevez out of the door .

They will be seeking to avoid another disastrous season, and here's who they're after, and what chance they have of capturing them. Early worry: Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Swansea highlighted huge deficiencies in the United team . Down to business: Van Gaal has work to do before the transfer window closes on September 2 . MARCOS ROJO . Club: Sporting Lisbon . Price: £16m to £30m . Van Gaal's new priority target. The left-sided centre back will allow United to bring the ball out of defence better and improve the balance of their team. Third party ownership is the obstacle but should be resolved. CHANCES: 9/10 . Priority: Marcos Rojo (right) was promising at the World Cup for Argentina, and has a good chance of signing . VIDEO van Gaal chasing Rojo . KEVIN STROOTMAN . Club; Roma . Price: £25m to £80m . Strootman only returned to training last month after a serious knee injury and Roma's escalating valuation makes the deal a difficult one for United to complete. If fully fit, Strootman would prove the midfielder United sorely miss. CHANCES: 7/10 . Midfield general: The Dutchman knows Van Gaal, but has only just returned from a serious injury . ANGEL DI MARIA . Club: Real Madrid . Price: £50m . One of the best wingers in the world, who Van Gaal publicly hailed as one of the players he would like to have. However, the deal is extremely expensive and Carlo Ancelotti wants the Argentine to stay. CHANCES: 1/10 . Dreaming? £50m-rated Di Maria is drowned out with the talent at Real Madrid, but Carlo Ancelotti wants him . DALEY BLIND . Club: Ajax . Price: £17m . Blind brings something Van Gaal values in a squad, which is versatility. He can play left back, left wing back and defensive midfield. Has doubts in himself whether he could handle the physical side of the Premier League. CHANCES: 6/10 . Here and there: Versatile Dutchman Daley Blind would be a useful addition at Old Trafford . BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER . Club: Bayern Munich . Price: £15m . The Germany midfielder is one that has been discussed by United scouts and would be perfect but for his age having just turned 30. Played last season with knee injuries and is still recuperating but Bayern would sell. CHANCES: 3/10 . Happy: World Cup winner Schweinsteiger is a legend at Bayern, and the German side could sell . ARTURO VIDAL . Club: Juventus . Price: £35m . United have an interest in the Chile midfielder and know they could complete a deal should they wish to press ahead but there are too many concerns at this stage with the repair of Vidal's knee injury among them. CHANCES: 1/10 . Saga: Speculation surrounding Arturo Vidal's future has been rife during the summer .","Man United lost 2-1 to Swansea in Louis van Gaal's first game in charge .

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Great Britain's women capped a record-breaking European Championships by securing the 4x100 metres crown with a new national record. The British team will return home with 23 medals - four better than the previous best set in Barcelona four years ago - and a remarkable 12 golds. That haul blew away the previous record of nine set in Budapest in 1998 and came thanks to a golden last day in Zurich. Golden girls: (left to right) Asha Philip, Ashleigh Nelson, Jodie Williams and Desiree Henry celebrate after winning gold in the women's 4x100m relay on the final afternoon of the European Championships . Over the line: Final leg runner Desiree Henry crosses the finish line to secure gold for Britain . The men's 4x400m relay team got the ball rolling, before London 2012 stars Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford triumphed either side of the men's 4x100m team. Asha Philip, Ashleigh Nelson, Jodie Williams and Desiree Henry added a fifth gold of a wonderful Sunday for the British team by romping to victory in the women's 100m relay. In the last event on the Stadion Letzigrund track, they crossed the line in a European-leading time of 42.24 seconds, breaking the national record in the process. Embrace: Henry runs to celebrate with fellow British sprinter Harry Aikines-Aryeetey at the end . All smiles: The women's triumph completed a golden Sunday for Britain, with five wins achieved . 'I'm so happy,' Philip said. 'We've been talking about the record for so long and wanted it so badly. 'I am so proud of these girls because we worked so hard for it. We deserve this, we fought for it.' Team-mate Jodie Williams, fresh from winning 200m gold in Zurich, echoed those sentiments. 'We've been looking for this national record this whole Championships,' she told the BBC. 'Everyone has been talking about how British sprinting has come on in the last year and I think we've proved that in the relays with the medals we've got.'","Women's 4x100m relay quartet cap record-breaking medal haul for GB .

"By . Phil Blanche, Press Association Sport . Six-time Paralympic champion David Weir has pulled out of this week's IPC Athletics European Championships. Weir was due to compete in four races in Swansea against his great Swiss rival Marcel Hug but has been forced to withdraw with tendonitis in his arm. The 35-year-old won four Paralympic gold medals at London 2012 in T54 events at 800 metres, 1500m, 5000m and the marathon following two golds at Beijing four years earlier. Injury setback: London 2012 champion David Weir has suffered an injury to his arm . Main rival: Weir was scheduled to race alongside Marcel Hug of Switzerland in four separate events . Weir took a break from competition last year and missed the World Championships in Lyon but won Commonwealth Games gold in the Para-sport T54 over 1500 metres in Glasgow last month. Nearly 40 countries and over 550 athletes will be competing in the Swansea event from August 19-23, many of the British team fresh from taking part at the Commonwealth Games. And English discus thrower Dan Greaves insists there will be no let up after his Glasgow gold. Greaves hit the headlines when he won England's first track and field gold at the Commonwealth Games in the men's Para-sport F42/44 discus competition at Hampden Park. Chasing success: Dan Greaves will not be resting on his laurels after winning gold in Glasgow . The Leicestershire athlete's throw of 59.21m pushed Welshman Aled Davies into second place and now he is aiming for European gold at championships which start in Swansea on Tuesday. 'The fact that the Commonwealth Games were only a few weeks ago means I'm still in great shape,' said Greaves. 'It's not as if the Europeans have come later in the year and you have to double peak. 'It was fantastic to compete at a multi-sport Championship and to win the first gold medal for England was a great feeling.' Greaves, 31, won Paralympic discus gold at Athens in 2004 and also picked up silvers in 2000 and 2012 and a bronze in Beijing in 2008. But Greaves admitted: 'Glasgow was one of my most special medals. 'The Paralympics is the top of tree for us athletes but it was fantastic to compete in the Commonwealth Games, especially as it was held in Britain. 'I've got a picture of the medal of my phone and when I see it between training sessions it gives me a constant reminder of the motivation I need to succeed.'","The six-time Paralympic champion was due to take part in six races .

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . James Dasaolu has predicted Britain’s ‘golden era’ of sprinters will dominate at this week’s European Athletics Championships. And he insisted they are poised to shake up the Jamaican and American stronghold over athletics’ blue riband events. Dasaolu, the second fastest European in history after Linford Christie, admitted it would be an underachievement if he fails to win a medal in the 100 metres final in Zurich on Wednesday evening. Ambitions: James Dasaolu wants to help see in an era of British sprinting dominance starting in Zurich . ‘I’m going into the competition as the second ranked (behind France’s Jimmy Vicaut) so, on paper, I should pick up a medal. That’s what expected of me.’ The 26-year-old ran 9.91sec in 2013 but has struggled with a hamstring injury and has only competed three times this year. His first challenge will be proving he is physically durable enough to advance through the rounds unscathed. ‘I feel like my late start to the season has worked to my advantage,’ said Dasaolu, ‘I’m quite fresh and I’ve still got a lot to give. It took four or five races last year to reach my peak. ‘I fancy there will be quite a few British men on the podium in the 100m and the 200m, ‘Seeing me and Chijindu Ujah go sub-10 and a number of guys go 10.1 (sec) and lots of medals at the Commonwealth Games, you just want to continue this on. Multi-talented: Adam Gemili will go in the 200m in Zurich after his 100m success in Glasgow . ‘Confidence is high and we believe we can beat the best in the world and challenge the Jamaicans and Americans. I think it’s important we continue to win medals in the sprints and relays to grow that confidence.’ Dasaolu was overlooked for selection for Team England at the Commonwealth Games and watched on TV as Adam Gemili, 20, won a silver medal in the 100m, splitting Jamaicans Kemar Bailey-Cole and Nickel Ashmeade. Gemili will run in the 200m in Zurich, while Dasaolu will compete alongside Dwain Chambers and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey. ‘I’m disappointed I wasn’t there but I can only look forward,’ he said, ‘Adam’s living up to his potential now and got a medal. He’s a championship performer and he produced on the day.’ Dasaolu said he was a ‘better athlete’ now than when he ran 9.91sec last year but claimed he was not thinking about breaking Linford Christie’s British record of 9.87sec, which has stood since 1993. His main opposition in Europe will be France’s Jimmy Vicaut, who clocked 9.95sec in May. Prospect: Harry Aikines-Aryeetey celebrates success in Glasgow during the Commonwealth Games . ‘I never really think about times but British sprinters are expected to pick up medals at the Europeans if you want to compete against the best in the world.’ On the back of his Commonwealth gold medal, Greg Rutherford said he was prepared that he might have to beat his own British long jump medal to win gold again in Zurich. Rutherford recorded a jump of 8.51 metres in Chula Vista in San Diego in April. ‘I have not been jumping like that since,’ he said, ‘but I caught one at the Commonwealths which filled me with confidence. I might have to go 51 (to win in Zurich. Aleksandr Menkov (from Russia) jumped 56 last year and if he’s on point it can happen . ‘Apparently the track is amazing, so from that point of view it could be a very exciting competition.’ Sprint kings - almost: The England boys celebrate with silver medals at the Commonwealth Games .","Dasaolu is second fastest European in history after Linford Christie .

"By . Richard Arrowsmith for MailOnline . Not only did Petr Cech get dropped for Chelsea's opening Premier League game against Burnley but, to add insult to exclusion, the keeper's name was misspelt as a substitute on the official team sheet. Jose Mourinho has chosen to start with the returning Thibaut Courtois for Monday evening's game at Turf Moor, casting doubt over the 32-year-old's future at Stamford Bridge. Having collected three Premier League titles and the Champions League during his time in west London,you might think the Czech Republic keeper would be a recognisable name to most.

Lost in translation: The Blues goalkeeper was one of several players to have his name misspelt . However, some confusion at the Clarets home saw the team sheet delivered bearing the name 'PETR CHECH'. At least the Blues legend can rest assured that the slight was nothing personal as new signing Felipe Luis' name was also misspelt to 'PHILIPE LUIS' and Cesar Azpilicueta was as wrongly transcribed as 'AZPILCUETA' - while the 'h' was omitted from John Obi Mikel's first name. Paris Saint Germain are monitoring Cech's situation at Chelsea with reports they are interested in taking him to Ligue 1, despite Mourinho insisting he can keep both stoppers happy this season.

We are economically stable. 'We can have Diego Costa, Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres, so we can have Courtois and Cech.

"By . Jim Van Wijk, Press Association . Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta believes 'on fire' midfielder Aaron Ramsey can become as important a player as former skipper Cesc Fabregas was at the Emirates Stadium. The Wales international, 23, netted a dramatic stoppage-time goal to beat managerlesss Crystal Palace 2-1 on Saturday as the Gunners secured a morale-boosting victory on the opening day of the new Barclays Premier League campaign. It was Ramsey's extra-time goal which won the FA Cup at Wembley in May to end a nine-season trophy quest - and an untimely injury to the dynamic midfielder at the turn of the year which impacted on the Gunners' fading title challenge. Top form: Aaron Ramsey was Arsenal's match winner at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday afternoon . High praise: Arsenal club captain Mikel Arteta believes Ramsey can be as good as Cesc Fabregas . VIDEO Wenger lauds late Ramsey goal . Arteta is in no doubt of the influence Ramsey, who scored 16 goals last season, can have. 'Aaron is on fire. When you have a player like this coming from midfield to score that many goals gives you something extra,' said Arteta, who took over the armband full-time following Thomas Vermaelen's summer departure to Barcelona. 'We don't really have a 30- or 40-goal scorer at the moment, so to have players who can score goals from the middle of the park is very important. 'He reminds me a little bit of Fabregas when he was here. At his best, Cesc was coming off the front, making the final ball and scoring very important goals. 'I think Aaron's confidence is really high at the moment, physically he can do whatever he wants and technically he is in a very good state, so he is one of the most important players in the team. Former team-mates: Ramsey played with Fabregas at Arsenal before the Spaniard joined Barcelona in 2011 . Decisive: Arsene Wenger decided to pass up the opportunity to sign Fabregas because of Ramsey . 'I think he will get better with experience, with knowledge and confidence. 'People have a fear now with him because they know he can create things and that gives you an extra yard which is very important. 'Whatever he wants to do, he has shown in the past two seasons how much he is able to improve, so I think he can do even more.' Such is the influence of Ramsey and his other attack-minded midfielder colleagues, which now include £30million signing Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger passed up on the chance to bring their former captain back from Barcelona this summer, with Fabregas joining London rivals Chelsea instead. It is some transformation for the former Cardiff youngster, who recovered from an horrific double leg break at Stoke in February 2010 to win over the critics. 'For me, there are two factors. First of all, he showed great character because I remember the days when he used to come here and the people used to be against him. To get through that and feel the love that he feels now is very important,' Arteta said. 'The manager as well backed him big time. If you have someone like that then you need to give something back and that's what Aaron is doing.'","Arsenal's Mikel Arteta has heaped praise on fellow midfielder Aaron Ramsey .

"By . Jim Van Wijk, Press Association . Caretaker Keith Millen admits the new Crystal Palace manager could quickly opt to dismantle the team built by former boss Tony Pulis. The Eagles were stunned on Thursday night by the abrupt exit of the man who had guided them to Premier League safety last season, with Pulis reportedly unhappy with the way the south London club had done their transfer business in the summer. Millen took temporary charge against Arsenal, just as he had done when Ian Holloway left last year, but could not gain a positive result as Palace were beaten 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium by a stoppage-time goal from Aaron Ramsey. Wise words: Keith Millen has warned Crystal Palace's current crop of stars that they could be shipped out . Battlers: Crystal Palace were beaten by a late goal from Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey at the Emirates Stadium . VIDEO Wenger lauds late Ramsey goal . Palace co-chairman Steve Parish indicated the board are looking for someone with experience of the English top flight, with former Cardiff boss Malky Mackay and ex-Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood thought to be the leading candidates. Millen will hold further talks with the board on Monday, but understands all too well what a complete change in football philosophy could bring. He said: 'This is the problem with changing managers. You bring in players to suit the system you play and if you are bringing in a different manager with different philosophies, then maybe they won't suit that. 'With the window shutting at the end of this month, the appointment is important so they have a little bit of time to bring in new players.' Quick decision: Co-chairman Steve Parish is expected to appoint a successor to Tony Pulis later this week . Favourites: Tim Sherwood (left) and Malky Mackay (right) are leading the race to replace Pulis . Whatever happens, Millen believes a quick resolution is needed for everyone to look forwards. 'The players will want to know on Monday which direction the club is going. There is a good group there, but they do need leadership,' he said. 'Whoever comes in, it needs to be pretty quick. The longer you leave it then it can start drifting. 'We don't want to be like that and get off to a poor start like last season.' Millen, who served his apprenticeship as a young player at Palace in the 1980s, hopes he will be considered for the job full-time. 'The circumstances are different now. I felt then (last season) that the situation wasn't right for me,' the 47-year-old former Bristol City boss said. 'I know I can manage - I have done it before. I want to speak to the chairman and see which direction he wants to go in. 'If he has got belief in me, I will speak to him where we want to go with it. 'If he says to me that he's definitely bringing someone else in you get on with it. Hopefully I will be a part of it, so we will just have to wait and see.'","Keith Millen is in temporary charge of the Eagles following Tony Pulis' exit .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has implemented a new code of conduct with regard to team orders for drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. Wolff was forced to act following events that unfolded during the Hungarian Grand Prix at the end of last month when Hamilton was surprisingly told to allow Rosberg by. Running third and fourth at the time, and with 20 laps of the race remaining, the differing strategies of the duo forced the pit wall crew at Mercedes into what non-executive chairman Niki Lauda later described as 'a panic'. Action: Toto Wolff has implemented a new code of conduct with regard to team orders for drivers . Starting from pole position, early crashes and safety car periods had resulted in Mercedes opting for an aggressive three-stop plan with Rosberg in a bid to ensure he took the chequered flag. Starting from the pit lane and last on track at the end of lap one, those same crashes and safety cars played its part in propelling Hamilton into a fight for a podium, potentially even the win, and so two stops was preferred. Hamilton, however, declined to let Rosberg past when told to do so, citing the fact the German was never close enough to make an overtaking manoeuvre. The duo eventually finished third and fourth in the race, allowing Hamilton to close the gap on a disgruntled Rosberg in the drivers' standings to 11 points. Duel: Lewis Hamilton (left) declined to let team-mate Nico Rosberg through during the Hungarian Grand Prix . In clearing the air with both men, Wolff now maintains the drivers will continue to be free to race over the closing eight grands prix, but with a new directive should circumstances arise. Speaking to German newspaper Bild, Wolff said: 'We will augment our team agreement before the season that the driver behind must clearly show he is faster before a passing manoeuvre can be instructed.' Wolff appreciates if Hamilton had lost momentum in pulling to one side for Rosberg it would have compromised his chances of a strong result. 'No one should have to go off the gas,' added Wolff. 'Our drivers are allowed to freely compete against each other for the rest of the season when it comes to the victory.'","Toto Wolff puts new code of conduct into place for dueling drivers .

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Darren Fletcher thinks Steve McManaman, who branded the current Manchester United side the worst he had seen in 20 years, will be eating a large portion of humble pie come the end of the season. McManaman laid into United following their 2-1 defeat to Swansea on the opening day of the season. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid man, who was a pundit for BT Sport at Old Trafford this weekend, claimed Louis van Gaal possesses the worst United squad he had ever seen in two decades. Scroll down for video . Damning verdict: Former Liverpool winger says United squad is the worst the club has had in 20 years . Prove a point: United vice-captain Darren Fletcher is determined to silence critics by helping team win trophies . Fletcher thinks McManaman, and United's other critics, have been desperate to take pot shots at the club as a consequence of their recent success. And the United vice-captain thinks the former England international will be eating his words at the end of May. 'People have been waiting for an opportunity to have a go at United for years and this is the perfect time (to do it),' the Manchester United midfielder said. 'It's a long season and I don't think they will be saying those things at the end of it. 'I believe we're going to have a very good season. 'All the players believe that too. 'Comments like that give us a greater determination, without a shadow of a doubt.' New team: Ryan Giggs, left, has been appointed as Louis van Gaal's assistant since the Dutchman took over . Having been part of the United team that finished seventh last year, Fletcher knows how it feels to be on the receiving end of some scathing criticism. The midfielder may have just been 11-years-old at the time, but he also remembers when former Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen told Sir Alex Ferguson 'you can't win anything with kids' in 1995. Ferguson won the league that year and scooped a further 10 titles after building a team around a group of youth players from the famed 'Class of '92'. Fletcher thinks Van Gaal's squad has a similar look to it as the one that contained the likes of David Beckham, Paul Scholes and a young Ryan Giggs just over a decade ago. Belief in youth: Van Gaal is giving young players at the club a chance to impress, including Tyler Blackett, left . 'To be honest it felt like that in the dressing room today,' said Fletcher, who played alongside debutants Tyler Blackett and Jesse Lingard on Saturday. 'It did have a feel of that in terms of people looking at the squad and maybe not seeing household names, but these players are good enough and the manager believes in them. 'All you need is a platform to go and perform and I'm sure they'll definitely go and prove people wrong. 'This whole club is about bouncing back from adversity.' Van Gaal has lost experienced heads like Giggs, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra from his playing squad this summer. But Fletcher thinks the players that remain are strong enough personalities to fill the void. He said: 'People talk about the players that have left but I see it in the eyes of the young players, they're ready for it and determined to show people how good they are and we're determined to show people how good the team are. 'You have to be a big character to play for this club.' Back on track: Wayne Rooney scored an acrobatic equaliser for United but it was not enough to gain a point . Wayne Rooney equalised for United following Ki Sung-yueng's opener with an overhead kick from short-range. But the striker's first outing as captain ended up being one to forget thanks to Gylfi Sigurdsson's 72nd minute winner. Rooney admitted it was a far from ideal way to start the season, but the striker trusts Van Gaal to pick the team up in the coming days. 'This is a really bad result for us, but we will learn, especially with the manager we have got,' Rooney said. 'He is strong and he wants 100 per cent every game. 'We know last season was a disaster. It wasn't good enough and we were ready for the start of this season. 'Maybe after a good pre-season we were a bit over confident. 'But we just have to look at the bad points and cut them out. If we do that we will win games.' Match-winner: Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson scored the decisive goal in the second half at Old Trafford . Sigurdsson, meanwhile, could not think of a better place to score on his second debut for Swansea. 'Getting three points at Old Trafford is always special, but to score the winner here has been a dream for me ever since I was young,' said Sigurdsson who returned to Swansea this summer following a two-year spell at Tottenham. 'It is one of the biggest stadiums in the world.'","Steve McManaman made the comments after United's opening-day defeat .

The former France defender - still only 37 - guided Les Girondins to an opening-weekend win at Montpellier and watched his side take a share of the Ligue 1 lead after Monaco fell apart in the second half of action on Sunday night.

Emiliano Sala fired Bordeaux ahead from the penalty spot in the 61st minute and, only four minutes later Rolan grabbed his second. Monaco's humiliation was complete when Wahbi Khazri scored a 75th-minute penalty. St Etienne are tied with Sagnol's men for first place after extending their own winning start to the season with a come-from-behind 3-1 win over Reims at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. It was not all plain sailing for Christophe Galtier's side, with Benjamin Moukandjo's effort finding its way into the home net via a deflection off Loic Perrin in the 27th minute.

Montpellier bounced back from their opening-day defeat to record an impressive 2-0 victory at Marseille. Rolland Courbis' side were beaten 2-1 by Bordeaux on the opening weekend but hit back in the best way possible, with Anthony Mounier and Morgan Sanson getting the goals.

The first round tie was settled as a contest when Muller scored 10 minutes later, completing a century of competitive goals for the club in the process. Alaba's powerful shot crashed in off the crossbar after 52 minutes and Muller teed up Pizarro to score the fourth with 17 minutes remaining. Rogier Krohne scored a late consolation from the penalty spot for Munster and there was still time left for Lewandowski to see his weak spot-kick saved by goalkeeper Daniel Masuch in stoppage time. Munster midfielder Marc Heitmeier was sent off for brining down the Polish striker, who moved from Borussia Dortmund in the summer. Underhit: Robert Lewandowski had a great late chance to get on the scoresheet but saw a penalty saved . Denied: Munster goalkeeper Daniel Masuch guessed correctly to repel Lewandowski's kick . On the charge: Muller carries the ball forward to launch another Bayern attack . Thirsty work: Bayern manager Pep Guardiola takes a sip from a water bottle in the dug-out . Bayern defender Holger Badstuber was in competitive action for the first time since tearing the cruciate ligament in his right knee last December, though Pep Guardiola still has Bastian Schweinsteiger, Rafinha, Franck Ribery, Javi Martinez and Thiago Alcantara on the treatment table ahead of the Bundesliga opener against Wolfsburg on Friday. Elsewhere, Sven Schipplock scored five in Hoffenheim's 9-0 rout of fifth-tier side USC Paloma, Werder Bremen needed extra time to beat fourth-tier FV Illertissen 3-2, and Freiburg defeated Eintracht Trier, another fourth-tier side, 2-0. Wolfsburg progressed by winning 5-4 on penalties after a scoreless game at second-division Darmstadt. Goalkeeper Max Gruen made two saves in the shootout for the visitors. Augsburg lost 1-0 to fourth-tier side Magdeburg for the biggest upset of the opening round, and Paderborn, promoted to the Bundesliga this season, lost 2-1 at second-division Leipzig. We're through: Bayern salute the travelling supporters at the final whistle . Third-division side Arminia Bielefeld upset second-division SV Sandhausen 4-1, with captain Fabian Klos scoring arguably the goal of the round - a spectacular volley directly from a corner in off the crossbar. There was another upset later, when fourth-tier Wuerzburger Kickers defeated second-division Fortuna Duesseldorf 3-2 with a deflected free-kick in extra time. Erzgebirge Aue defeated fourth-tier Carl Zeiss Jena 1-0, 1860 Munich beat third-division Holstein Kiel 2-1 and Karlsruher SC won 3-1 at fifth-tier Neubrandenburg.

"By . Mark Wilson for MailOnline . For Callum McGregor, this was the most brutal of comedowns after the high of his Scotland call-up. The 21-year-old spoke for the entire Celtic dressing room when he summed up the feeling of utter dejection in the wake of a dismal defeat against Maribor. The chance of Champions League group stage action - and the accompanying £15million financial influx - seemed at their fingertips following a 1-1 draw in Slovenia last week. Yet Celtic proved toothless for the most part in the return and were undone when Brazilian Marco Tavares struck the most painful of blows with 15 minutes remaining. That it came after some truly flimsy defending, not an isolated incident this season, made it all the more difficult for Ronny Deila and his players to bear. Devastating: Celtic midfielder Callum McGregor (centre) was devastated after the 1-0 loss to Maribor . Stunned: Celtic Kris Commons (left) and Virgil Van Dijk are dejected after the latter missed a late chance . Winner: Maribor's Marco Tavares (centre) scored the goal that knocked Celtic out of the Champions League . Admirably, McGregor was first out to face the media in the interview marquee erected outside Celtic Park. On the other side of the canvas, a couple of hundred fans had massed in front of the main entrance to chant ‘Sack the Board’ and direct more personal ire at chief executive Peter Lawwell. The recriminations and fall-out will linger for days to come. On Tuesday night, however, it was the immediate pain of defeat that hurt so deeply for McGregor and his colleagues. ‘It’s just devastating,’ said the Parkhead youngster. ‘It’s a really tough one to take. The dressing room was silent at the end. We couldn’t believe it. In the second half, we had a few chances but then we got sucker-punched at the other end. ‘The feeling now is a mix of everything - anger and frustration. As I said, it is devastating. All the boys are absolutely gutted. ‘I’m obviously delighted to be part of the first team but it is hard to be happy when things like that happen. The Champions League was massive for the club. But it also meant everything to all the staff and the players. Party time: Tavares (centre) celebrates scoring goal that sent the Slovenian side into the group stage . ‘We will just have to work hard to try to get better. We will look to get better over the course of this season and come back and try to qualify next season. ‘A good week for me has ended quite badly. It’s good to get that recognition from the Scotland squad so I will just keep working hard and try to keep myself in the Celtic team.’ There was understandable apprehension before kick-off but few in a near-capacity crowd expected events to unfold quite the way they did on the Parkhead pitch. Maribor pressed Celtic much higher than in the first leg and knocked Deila’s system out of sync. McGregor struck the bar early in the second half but, in truth, the Slovenians always looked the more likely scorers. From a huge roar at kick-off, the noise around the stadium gradually morphed into one of anxiety and bitter frustration. ‘Were we edgy? It felt like that a wee bit,’ admitted McGregor. ‘They were happy to sit in and defend and that made it difficult for us to try and break down. ‘Once they managed to get a few shots on target the crowd start to get on your back a bit and it becomes difficult again. Not happy: Celtic fans protest after their side were knocked out of the Champions League . Here we go! The Maribor bench celebrate as the Slovenians stun the Scottish champions . ‘But I thought the boys managed to regroup quite well at half time. We threw pretty much everything we had at them and we were unlucky at some points. Virgil (Van Dijk) had a couple of efforts and I had one that hit the bar. You can say we were a wee bit unlucky there but you have to defend well at the other end as well. ‘We had an advantage from the first leg and I think everyone expected us to go through tonight. But we conceded a sloppy goal when we were trying to get the winner and maybe we should just have sat and taken the advantage we already had.’ Having seen a Champions League reprieve slip away, Celtic are left grasping at the consolation prize provided by the Europa League. The hope for Deila is that his team can develop in the same way Neil Lennon’s did when they were involved in the secondary competition three years ago. ‘We didn’t play well against Legia and now we have been knocked out tonight,’ said McGregor. ‘Maybe the Europa League is a stepping stone for us to get better as a squad and come back stronger next year. ‘Neil Lennon’s team did quite well in a Europa League campaign a few years ago. Obviously it is hard when a new manager takes over. He is trying to implant his ideas and his own kind of work ethic into the team. That is going to take time. At a big club like Celtic you don’t have a lot of time. You have to get the results along with the performances and the progression. Maybe the Europa League will give us that platform to improve as a team.’ Talking to: The Maribor fans are spoken to by police at Celtic Park as their side .","Callum McGregor was 'gutted' by Celtic's 2-1 aggregate loss to Maribor .

"By . Dan Ripley for MailOnline . Follow @@Ripley_77 . With the aim to win the Premier League for the first time in five years, Chelsea arrived at Burnley with a host of new faces ready to lead a title charge. Jose Mourinho splashed the cash in the summer, spending £32million on Diego Costa and £30million on Cesc Fabregas. Mourinho also resigned former Blues striker Didier Drogba on a free and recalled Thibaut Courtois from his loan spell at Atletico Madrid. But how did the four Chelsea new boys get on? Sportsmail takes a look at the summer arrivals who helped the Blues to a 3-1 win at Turf Moor. Cesc Fabregas . It's like Cesc Fabregas has never been away from the Premier League. The Spain international had spent the previous three years desperately trying to become a key player at Barcelona but he already looked integral to Chelsea within one half of football. In control: Cesc Fabregas ran the midfield on his Chelsea debut in a standout performance . Key player: Fabregas is congratulated by Branislav Ivanovic after assisting the Serbian's goal . Dominant: Sportsmail's Match Zone shows how Fabregas controlled the Chelsea midfield . Click here to view more maps and stats with our excellent Match Zone . The former Arsenal midfielder assisted Branislav Ivanovic’s goal from a corner, but it was his first-time pass from the edge of the box for Andre Schurrle’s strike which will have Blues fans purring. It’s already set to go down as one of the passes of the season. Tougher tests lie in wait for the 27-year-old though. Verdict 9/10 . Diego Costa . There’s plenty more to come from Diego Costa, who didn’t have many chances to make his mark on his Chelsea debut. But when they did come, he looked encouragingly sharp. The striker was first on the scene to convert a rebound and the Blues equaliser after a cross rebounded off the post. While the 25-year-old showed his sharpness to latch on to a woeful back-pass before being unfortunately booked for diving after being brought down by Burnley keeper Tom Heaton. Up and running: Diego Costa scored on his Chelsea debut and was unfortunate not to win a penalty kick . Well done, lad: Jose Mourinho was pleased with Costa's performance speaking post-match . Better nights will come for Costa to show off his hefty price tag but he already looks well on his way to becoming a fan favourite. Verdict 7.5/10 . Thibaut Courtois . Seen as the long term future for Chelsea by boss Jose Mourinho, but Thibaut Courtois didn’t look it after allowing Scott Arfield’s 14th minute strike to fly past him a little too easily. That’s perhaps a little harsh on the Belgian making his debut, but the 22-year-old would soon show why he has been given the nod over veteran Petr Cech, denying Arfield’s top corner bound drive later in the game with a superb one-handed stop. Kicking practice: Thibaut Courtois had little to do on his Chelsea debut in goal . Keeper's ball: But the Belgian looked confident in commanding his box and gathering crosses . It was one of the very few saves Courtois had to make during the game, but the former Atletico Madrid stopper commanded his box well and was not shy in racing off his line to collect a cross. Mourinho’s faith in the keeper looks like it will pay off. Verdict 7/10 . Didier Drogba . Given six minutes to make his mark, it wasn’t going to be the toughest of tests on the 36-year-old legs of Didier Drogba. But the veteran striker still nearly rolled back the years on his second Blues debut, neatly controlling a long goal kick from Courtois before unleashing a powerful volley just wide with his next touch. Eye on the ball: Didier Drogba soon got involved with the game despite playing just six minutes . Still got it: Drogba showed flashes of brilliance with a volley which flew just wide . Jose Mourinho at the very least may have just found his ultimate super sub, with the Ivorian looking lively and still showing he has the ability to compete at the top. The stamina test will come another day. Verdict 6.5/10 .","Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa and Thibaut Courtois shine on Chelsea debuts .

"By . Pa Reporter . The race that sees Sir Bradley Wiggins return to the streets of London and the site of his 2012 Olympic has had to alter its route due to forecasts of heavy rain. The bicycle race that will see thousands ride from London to Surrey has been shortened by 14 miles amid a forecast of heavy rain. Organisers of RideLondon said they 'reluctantly' made the decision to cut the race from 100 miles to 86 after information from the Met Office as the effects of Hurricane Bertha's remnants are felt in the UK. Raring to go: Wiggins waits on the start line ahead of the London-Surrey classic on Sunday . The route will now miss out a section covering Leith Hill and Box Hill in Surrey due to predictions of heavy rain. Sir Bradley will race for Team Sky - which dropped him for this year's Tour - in the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic this afternoon with a host of big-name pro cyclists. More than 22,000 amateur riders are taking part in the race, which finishes on the Mall outside Buckingham Palace. Event director Hugh Brasher said the safety of the cyclists, who will include 2012 Tour de France and Olympic gold medal-winner Sir Bradley Wiggins, was the most important consideration. 'This decision has been made in the light of detailed information from the Met Office and with full agreement of local authorities and other agencies,' said Mr Brasher. Setting off: The Olympic champion and former Tour de France winner is the biggest star in the event . 'The current weather forecast is for localised, heavy rain. Our primary concern is for the safety of all participants, volunteers and staff. 'Please ride appropriately in these wet and windy conditions: leave more space between you and your fellow riders and moderate your speed.' Sir Bradley, 34, said: 'I always enjoy competing in front of home fans and have great memories of riding this route at the Olympics. 'The support we got then was unbelievable, and it was the same again at the Tour of Britain last year, so this promises to be a really special day.' Up against it: The peloton makes its way through Richmond Park, braving the wet and windy conditions . Charity fun: Some of the amateur riders arrive on The Mall at the end of the race . He will be joined in the pro race by 2012 World Champion Philippe Gilbert, Belkin Pro Cycling duo Laurens ten Dam and Steven Kruijswijk, who were 19th and 15th respectively in this year's Tour de France, plus five medallists from the Commonwealth Games, gold medallists Luke Davidson and Tom Scully, Shane Archbold, who won a gold and bronze, and bronze medal-winners Scott Thwaites and Aaron Gate. The professional riders head out from the Olympic park in east London at 1pm, but before they blitz around the city streets and rural roads at high speed, thousands of plucky amateurs will attempt the same gruelling route. Yesterday an estimated 60,000 people took to the streets of London for the RideLondon Freecycle. The event saw a ten-mile circuit of normally busy London roads cleared for cyclists, taking in some of the capital's top landmarks, including Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, St Paul's Cathedral and the Tower of London.","Forecast of torrential rain causes organisers to to alter race route .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Legia Warsaw owner Dariusz Mioduski last night angrily branded UEFA’s decision to hand Celtic a passage to the Champions League play-off round a sporting scandal. And in an interview with Sportsmail, the majority shareholder of the Polish champions further claimed his club would have handed the tie to Celtic had the disciplinary shoe been on the other foot. A multi-millionaire investor and businessman in Warsaw, Mioduski spoke out after UEFA upheld a decision to punish Legia for fielding the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski as a substitute for the last four minutes of their 2-0 win over Celtic in Edinburgh. VIDEO Scroll down to hear reaction from Ronny Deila to Celtic being reinstated . Appeal: Dariusz Mioduski, owner and chairman of Legia Warsaw, at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon . Henning Berg’s team earned a 6-1 aggregate victory – but now find themselves facing a trip to Kazakhstan in the Europa League after UEFA’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body upheld the decision to award Celtic a 3-0 second leg victory. ‘I think this is a scandal because I don’t know a court in a democratic country anywhere where the penalty would be so grossly disproportionate to the crime,’ Mioduski told Sportsmail. ‘I cannot believe there is another organisation like UEFA which stands so far outside of the principles of justice anywhere in Europe or the democratic world. ‘Let’s admit that and change this crazy rule. It is a scandal because it is such a flagrant instance of going against the spirit of the game.’ Verdict: Legia Warsaw are out of the Champions League as they fielded an ineligible player . Handed a three-match ban for a red card in the Europa League last season, Bereznyski sat out two qualifiers against Ireland’s St Patrick’s Athletic and the first leg 4-1 win over Celtic in Warsaw. But, in a critical error, Legia administrator Marta Ostrowska failed to register the defender in the squad to face St Pat’s – meaning the first two games of his ban were never properly recognised. ‘If our player had not served his three-game suspension and played against St Pat’s or in the first game with Celtic it would have been different,’ added Mioduski. ‘But we left a space open in our squad for those games – we didn’t put anyone else in our squad instead. ‘We were saying: “This player is suspended, we have left him out.” Manager: Henning Berg's side won 6-1 over the two legs, but Celtic will progress to the next round . ‘It was clear we complied with the spirit of the law. But because of a small technicality and interpretation of the rule, we suffer. ‘Everybody says it’s clear, rules are rules. But we showed in our appeal that it is confusing. Because of that, the penalty is gross. Grossly unfair. ‘I am appealing to UEFA to rethink this rule because it is simply not fair.’ At a press conference last Sunday, Mioduski angered Celtic by applying emotional blackmail on the Parkhead club to forfeit the tie. When that failed, Legia put their case at a UEFA appeal hearing on Wednesday morning in Nyon. Shock: Ronny Deila's Celtic were poor in both legs, and deserved to go out based on their performances . Mioduski has vowed to pursue the matter all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, with CAS secretary general Matthieu Reeb confirming yesterday that Legia could take advantage of a fast-track process before the Champions League play-off first leg against Maribor next Wednesday. With Celtic already preparing for a flight to Slovenia, however, a statement from the Scottish champions read last night: ‘We have been advised by UEFA of the decision of the Appeals Body to dismiss an appeal by Legia Warsaw. We understand that Legia Warsaw may appeal that decision to CAS. ‘For our part we can only proceed on the basis of UEFA’s decisions and the fixtures announced by them and, therefore, we must now prepare for our match against NK Maribor next week.’ Persistently critical of Celtic’s willingness to take advantage of a lifeline worth a potential £15million in revenue, Mioduski claimed Legia would have reached the opposite decision had the roles been reversed. Outplayed: the Polish side won 4-1 in the home leg, and 2-0 in Scotland . ‘We have asked ourselves many times how we would react if Celtic had played a suspended player. ‘In our heads and in our conversations we came to the same conclusion. We would have given the tie to Celtic. ‘We have very specific fans here. For them the issue of honour is incredibly important. ‘Our fans would not accept it if we took advantage of a situation like this as Celtic have. ‘Of course there would be a number who would say we were stupid giving up a place in the Champions League and all that money. ‘But in the end, taking into account our history and the values we want to be known for as a club, I think we would make a decision to not take advantage. ‘Who knows? It would have been a very difficult decision, but I think we would have been on the right side of the situation.’ Meanwhile, Ronny Deila says Celtic are fully prepared for their tie with Maribor – despite days of uncertainty over their fate. Future: Celtic will now face Maribor over two legs as they look to reach the Champions League group stages . He had no idea until yesterday lunchtime if his side were heading for Slovenia or Kazakhstan in the Europa League but proceeding on the basis they would play Maribor, he said: ‘We have had them watched. ‘We have full reports on them. They are a good team, well organised. They are compact and good on the counter attack. They have some good players as well. ‘They have won their league three years in a row but you always meet good teams in the Champions League.’ Asked if the Slovenian champions – conquerors in recent years of Rangers and Hibs – were better than Legia, Deila shrugged. ‘It’s hard to say. I haven’t watched them myself in person, but I think it’s pretty close. ‘We have to step up a level in our performances - that’s the most important thing. ‘But we are now two or three weeks further on. We have played one domestic game and are back at Celtic Park. ‘We have got players in also and I am looking forward to the games. ‘I’m just happy we are getting fixtures now, real matches you can learn from. ‘You give feedback to the players and work from there. And that’s why I’m looking forward, first, to the game on Saturday against Dundee United.’","Legia Warsaw beat Celtic 6-1 in their Champions League playoff .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Caretaker boss Neil Redfearn refused to rule himself out of the running to succeed David Hockaday as Leeds head coach as they ended a run of three defeats with victory over luckless Bolton. Although Redfearn is happy in his post as Academy manager, he sidestepped the question over his future role, and said: 'I love coaching and working with players. Scorer: Left-back Stephen Warnock scored early in the first-half to set up the 1-0 victory for Leeds United . Leeds United: Silvestri, Wootton, Warnock (Taylor 55), Pearce, Bellusci, Mowatt, Cook, Bianchi, Sloth (Benedicic 78), Sharp, Antenucci. Subs Not Used: Smith, Taylor, Tonge, Dawson, Cooper.

I will have a chat with the president and see what he is thinking. It is his decision, but the club needs a settled set of circumstances.' Marco Silvestri, the former Chievo Verona goalkeeper, repeatedly frustrated Bolton and pulled off a crucial double save from former Leeds favourite Jermaine Beckford and Lee Chung-Yong in injury time, to leave Dougie Freedman's men with only one point from their first five matches. Stephen Warnock's 17th-minute goal, driven in from the left corner of the area, was enough to settle an entertaining game in Leeds' favour, but they owed much to Silvestri and young midfielders Lewis Cook and Alex Mowatt. Redfearn added: 'Our keeper was out of this world. He made half a dozen saves out of the top drawer and showed bravery coming off his line.' In charge: Caretaker boss Neil Redfearn took charge of the side as Leeds ran out 1-0 winners at Elland Road . Cook, Mowatt and left-back Charlie Taylor, who replaced the injured Warnock, are graduates of Redfearn's Academy and he said: 'I was delighted with them. Cook was the best player on the pitch. He is old beyond his years and nothing fazes him.' A frustrated Freedman admitted: 'I am scratching around to understand how our domination failed to get us anything from the game. We dominated possession in the last hour and created so many chances. 'It was a mistake for the goal. We didn't get out quickly enough to close Warnock down, and we have to stop making silly errors at the back. We came up against a keeper who played his part. Leeds showed a lot of desire to keep the ball out of their net and we didn't show enough desire to put it in theirs. When we concede a goal, we have to work harder to score.'

"By . Yasmin Alibhai - Brown . There were countless occasions when I needed my brother’s help. The time my mother had an operation; the day she had a heart attack; the many evenings she felt lonely and needed company. Like the morning in 2005 when I was called by the lovely woman Ealing Council had hired to care for Mum, who was by then in her 80s. The carer was distraught; Mum had a fever and was delirious, speaking only in Kutchi, our home language. Could I come over? But it was impossible — I was in Manchester, working. Worried sick and filled with guilt, I began ringing round. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown explains how she wished that her only, older brother Amir had been around to step in to help with her mother but he had moved to Cape Town years earlier, so every time there was a problem, it fell upon her to do what she could . A warden in the sheltered accommodation arranged for a doctor to visit. But he couldn’t speak our language either. Eventually, I found a couple of people from the local mosque who went over to translate and hold Mum’s hand. How I wished then that my only, older brother Amir had been around to step in. But he had moved to Cape Town years earlier, so every time there was a problem with our mother, it fell upon me to do what I could. I loved my mum deeply. I still miss her now, eight years after her death. But over the years resentment gnawed away. Yasmin with her mother Jena Damji who she cared for even once the local Council had stepped in to help . And there were times when fury broke through. I’d say to her: ‘Where is he, Mum, your wonderful son? Thousands of miles away. You keep praying for him, but does he even care about you?’ How that must have hurt her. Last week, David Cameron spoke with conviction about the importance of family. He announced that, from now on, all policies would have to meet the ‘family friendly’ test. Though I have never been a Tory I do agree with the PM that family stability is the foundation of a good society. But his vague utterances sounded more pie in the sky than real life. And he was too focused on aspects of family life — child rearing, relationship counselling and marriage — that are already well known about. What he could have addressed, but didn’t, was the unfair distribution of responsibilities within families. He needed to acknowledge that women are still expected to do more than men to sustain families. And that millions of them are not only having to look after children and grandchildren but also ageing parents. Prime Minister David Cameron has recently spoken about the importance of family, which Yasmin strongly agrees with . According to the charity Age UK, 78 per cent of carers are female. Yet it seems that the men in their own families and the wider society hardly notice. These women are unheard, unseen and unsung. For many years, I was in this place, pulled this way and that by various duties, feeling weary and often aggrieved. Like most women I also feel treacherous complaining about it publicly. My beloved mum, Jena, would not have let me speak out against my brother while she was alive. And she would have not approved of speaking ill of the dead. Amir passed away a few years ago, when he was in his early 70s. Until I was a teenager, Amir adored me, told me I was his little doll. He put me to bed, told me scary stories and sent me presents when he was travelling as an insurance rep. He had given up education to support the family because my father was hopelessly unreliable. After I married, there were a few good times. Amir had a large house in the suburbs of London and we went over for barbecues or big lunches. But after 1990 we hardly spoke, and when we did, we argued. Why did relations break down? Partly because after he married, our relationship lost its warmth and camaraderie. But much more it was because, as my widowed mother grew older and needed more care, he left it all to me and never acknowledged what I was doing. And didn’t want to acknowledge what he wasn’t doing. In fact, he went off to live with his family in South Africa in the early Nineties, leaving her in London in her small housing association flat. She said nothing to him as he departed, but missed him every day of her life after that. On his rare visits, her cup runneth over. She cooked his favourite foods, told all her friends and was filled with joy. I never heard her complain about him — he was her firstborn, only son and could do no wrong — though she did say from time to time: ‘You lose a son when he finds a wife. A daughter is yours for ever.’ After she married, there were a few good times with her brother. Amir had a house in the suburbs of London and she went over for barbecues or lunches. But after 1990 they hardly spoke, and when they did, they argued . He didn’t think about what his emigration meant to our mother. He wanted to live in the sun and make money, which he achieved. Oh, he phoned once every few weeks, came over briefly and invited her over for holidays. The rest was left to me. As she got older and less able to do things, it was I who took her to the doctors, got her medicines, shopped for her, went to the bank, took her out, drove her to mosque, took over food and made sure my children saw their lovely gran. Yasmin's daughter Leila being looked after by her grandmother Jena . Why wouldn’t I do all that? She had given me life, brought me up, supported us by cooking and sewing for others, moved in with me in the Seventies to look after my boy till he went to school, moved in again when my first husband left me. When my daughter Leila was born in 1993, my mother helped again. But those years when she got more and more dependent on me were not easy at all. Sometimes I snapped and shouted at her when, in truth, I was furious with the way my brother didn’t seem to give a damn. I am ashamed of that. To her he remained the golden boy till the very end. In fact, when she was dying, she waited till he turned up and she saw his face, then passed on in peace. The funeral did not bring Amir and I together. He hardly spoke to me, did not co-operate with the arrangements, and left after the final prayers without saying goodbye. I was never invited to his house by the sea in Cape Town. I was very moved by a recent article in this paper by Claudia Carroll, the best-selling chick-lit author. When her mum got cancer, Carroll was in the hospital all day, every day, while her brothers came once in a while carrying many lovely flowers. What delighted her mother more? Her sons’ visits. Mum, too, was so very thrilled when Amir did some small nice thing. She did value what I did, too, but it wasn’t special. Now new research published in the U.S. proves what we women know already. Sons spend as little time as they can, and daughters as much time as they can, looking after ageing parents. Not only that, the daughters increase the time they give to compensate for the sons. So yes, women have got to the top of politics, science, arts, business and are getting better maternity rights and childcare arrangements, but when they have to look after their parents, they are alone. We need to start shouting about this. New research published in the U.S. proves what we women know already. Sons spend as little time as they can, and daughters as much time as they can, looking after ageing parents . Since last year, I’ve been on a commission looking into the lives of middle-aged working women. Many struggle looking after grandchildren and their own parents, while employers and the men in the families are indifferent to their needs. If they drop in and out of work, they earn and save less. They can’t ask for flexi-time, because while there is sympathy for young mums and their needs, there is none for older women. Most of my female friends seem to be looking after parents, too. None of my male friends have mentioned this duty. One friend, Mary, took care of her disabled mum for almost six years. ‘My five brothers did sod all,’ she told me. ‘One even suggested we take her to Switzerland and see her off at Dignitas. My marriage broke up under the strain. But I am glad I was there for Mum.’ And another woman called Samira, 54, looks after her baby grandchild — her daughter, a nurse, can’t afford childcare — and her own father who is suffering from dementia. ‘My brothers do nothing,’ she says. ‘I am so tired I cry all the time. They never say thank you. It’s just expected.’ That is what I feel, too. If only my brother had said, just once: ‘I know what you do for Mum.’ But he didn’t. Most don’t. More men now are better dads. They should learn to be better sons, too. If David Cameron really cares about families, he must address the unfair burdens placed on daughters. Amir and I were finally reconciled. Four years ago, my daughter made me phone him in Cape Town. We had heard he was unwell. We spoke, and for the first time in a long time he was warm, contrite and loving. He said he was sorry for not being a good brother, a good son. I too said sorry for being so angry with him for so long. He died, unexpectedly, a week later. Alas, it was all too late.

The man arrested in Melbourne was interviewed at the airport and released, but he remains under surveillance. His family members were not suspected of illegal behaviour and were allowed to continue their journey to Beirut but they chose not to. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Parliament that a new airport-based counter-terrorism squad had intercepted a suspect. He did not say whether it was the Sydney or Melbourne man. The news comes as The New York Times reports Australia may support a potential US military mission to bomb ISIS targets in Syria. Mr Abbott made the announcement during Question Time this afternoon. Mr Abbott said the new Australian Customs and Border Protection counter-terrorism units have been put in place at Sydney and Melbourne international airports and the program is set to expanded. 'I'm advised these new units have already intercepted at least one person of interest,' Mr Abbott told Parliament. 'This government will do everything that is necessary to keep this country safe.' Similar units will be established at other Australian international airports. Eventually 80 officers will be stationed at airports to monitor the movements of people on the national security watchlist. Daily Mail Australia has approached the Prime Minister's office and Customs and Border Protection for further detail. An estimated 60 Australians are believed to be fighting with extremists in Syria and Iraq. The government believes there are a further 100 'facilitators' in Australia.

Now a wildlife photographer has captured extreme close-ups of the creepy crawlies, revealing the complex compound eyes of flies, aggressive stance of ants and even water drops clinging onto one insect’s hairy face. The striking images were shot by 33-year-old Yudy Sauw at his home studio in Tangerang, Indonesia. His models included a soldier fly, red ant and a longhorn beetle, which he painstakingly watched to get the best shot. While the creatures may not sound particularly exotic, they are interesting. Soldier flies mimic organ pipe mud dauber wasps and longhorn beetles make pests of themselves by boring into wood to damage trees and houses. To take his photographs, Mr Sauw placed the insects between half an inch (2cm) and four inches (10cm) away from his camera. He used specialist lighting and a macro lens on his camera to record the creatures’ portraits, before enhancing them on a computer.

"By . Emily Payne for MailOnline . Holidaymakers could be paying as much as five times more for express airport transfers compared to the cheapest option available, according to a new study. The research looked at the fastest and cheapest transport options available to people travelling to and from 20 major European cities. For more than half of the airports, travellers are paying as much as five times more for services such as Heathrow and Gatwick Express - that were on average just a third slower than the cheaper public transport option. Paying a premium: The Heathrow Express is 356% more expensive than opting for public transport . The study, by travel money specialist No.1 Currency worked out the prices and travel times for a single trip from the airport to the city centre. For people arriving at Heathrow Airport, the Heathrow Express offers a speedy journey into central London in just 15 minutes. But  a one-way ticket for two cost £52. The London Underground takes four times as long but a couple will only pay £11.40 for tickets, so the express option costs an extra £40.60 or a premium of 356 per cent. Both options are still cheaper than taking a taxi, unless you are travelling with four paying adults - in which case taking a cab would work out a much better value option than the Heathrow Express. The biggest price discrepancy was found in Stockholm. The Arlanda Express train from Stockholm Airport to the city centre cuts down the transfer time by more than half compared to the cheapest option, a local bus, but the ticket price is 419 per cent more expensive. For visitors to London, taking the Heathrow Express or the underground work out cheaper than catching a cab . The cheaper (and slower) option: Taking the Tube in London to Heathrow will save travelling couples over £40 . A couple will pay almost £45 for two single tickets for the 20-minute journey, compared to just £9 on a local bus which takes 45 minutes. And travelling from the Swedish airport to the city centre will pay around £30 for a taxi, which is £15 cheaper than taking the express train. The Leonardo Express from Rome's Fiumicino AIrport, costs £22.26 for two, while the local bus costs just £6.36  - but take a good book, as it takes more than an hour. While from Dublin Airport, the airport express bus - £11.12 for two passengers - costs more than twice the local bus (£4.76), and the transfer time is only 22 per cent faster. The research revealed, that in 16 of the 20 European city airports surveyed, it is possible, if you take public transport, to transfer from the airport to the city centre for less than £10 for two people. In some cities, the cheapest option of getting to the airport was also the fastest option. A train from Geneva Airport costs £4.76 for two and takes just six minutes - compared to  £22.11 for taking a taxi. In others, tourists will want to pay a premium for the ease, speed and stress-free travelling of the express airport service. Paris offers a 50-minute train connection from Charles de Gaulle airport to Gare du Nord station for just £14.81 for two passengers. And while a local bus service offers the journey for less than £10 one-way, tourists do face a journey of two hours through a city notorious for its bad traffic. The train connection from Charles de Gaulle aiport to Gare du Nord station in Paris costs £14.81 for two people . Simon Philips, head of retail, No.1 Currency, said: 'There are so many transfer options available for travellers when they arrive at their destination airport that it can be difficult to know which one to choose. 'The choice really comes down to whether you want to get to your city centre destination as quickly as possible or as cheaply as possible. 'In some cases it is possible to achieve both, but our research reveals that those airports that offer a service operated by the airport itself, you will pay a considerable premium for the shorter transfer times. 'It's always worth checking out the transfer options from your destination airport before you travel, because you may find you can get discounted prices by booking in advance.'","Faster transfers are on average only a third faster than cheaper options .

He added that futile activities include chatting on the internet and smartphones, and watching TV soap operas. Pope Francis (pictured) made the claims to German altar servers in Rome on Tuesday. He urged the young people not to waste 'too many hours on futile things', including chatting on the internet and smartphones, and watching TV soap operas . Pope Francis, 77, was elected in March 2013 to lead the world's 1.2 . Catholics. He was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina and was one of five children. He was named 2013 Person of the Year by Time magazine - edging out NSA whistleblower and fugitive Edward Snowden in second place. His predecessor Pope Benedict . XVI was the first pontiff to join Twitter @pontifex. Pope Francis regularly tweets in English to more than 4.3 million followers. Reports claim the Pope previously worked as bouncer when he was a student, and he has expressed a love of dancing. During an address to the 50,000 young servers, who are on a pilgrimage to Rome, Pope Francis said: ‘Our life is made up of time, and time is a gift from God, so it is important that it be used in good and fruitful actions.’ He continued that these activities ‘should simplify and improve the quality of life, but distract attention away from what is really important.’ The 77-year-old pope has Twitter accounts in several languages.

In a statement about Catholic Church communications, Pope Francis said the web offers ‘immense possibilities’ for differing points of view to be heard, including those that oppose or question the Catholic religion.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A 23-month-old girl cannot eat after she was born with her intestines growing on the outside of her body. Georgia Diamond has never enjoyed a bite of food, as a result of the crippling bowel condition, gastroschisis. She is fed by a tube directly into her stomach, and has to carry a back-pack containing a line of medicine and food. Georgia has faced multiple operations since she was born, to try and correct the problem, but she will only be able to eat properly once she has had an intestine transplant. Georgia Diamond, 23 months, (pictured with her mother Lisa James) was born with her intestines growing outside her body. The condition is called gastroschisis and means Georgia is unable to eat . As soon as she was born, doctors began to treat Georgia's condition. In her short life, the 23-month-old has had multiple operations to push her intestines back inside her abdomen and close the abdominal wall . But the toddler, who lives in Newport in South Wales, will have to wait at least another two years before experts at Birmingham Children's Hospital can attempt the procedure. The hospital is one of only two in the world where the operation is available. Georgia's mother, Lisa James, 26, said: 'We are desperately hoping to find a way to feed her as she needs to be tube fed at the moment.' Georgia's gastroschisis meant Miss James was unable to breastfeed her daughter. And instead of starting to eat solids when other babies would, the toddler has been fed through a tube through her nose since birth. For the first 14 months of her life, home for Georgia was the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales. In June, doctors tried to stimulate her bowel to work by narrowing it. For the first 14 months of her life, the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales was Georgia's home . But the 23-month-old still has two tubes taking nutrients directly to her stomach and small intestine. A gastrostomy tube replaced the tube in her nose and a Jejunal tube goes direct to her intestine. She has had seven operations and managed to return home to Miss James and her father Scott Diamond last November. But unfortunately the operation to fit the tubes in June was unsuccessful and MIss James said they are ‘back to square one'. 'She is still not feeding so we are going back to Birmingham next week for tests to see why it didn’t work,' she said. 'She is comfortable at hospital and still goes to Cardiff’s Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales for check ups as well as going to Birmingham for surgery. 'We are hoping to find a way to feed her as she needs to be tube fed. If we can do that then we can progress from there. 'We are hoping that it will be this month or next or in the spring at the latest but it just depends in what they find and as they will be doing lots of different tests and she may require and operation - we are going in completely blind.' But Miss James remains positive and said that on the whole Georgia is doing really well. 'She is doing well and will be starting playgroup,' she said. 'She is at home but still loves the hospital - every time she goes she seems to pick up more things. 'I think it is helping her to come on with her development as she is speaking loads.' Doctors have told Miss James her daughter will require an intestines transplant, if she hopes to feed normally . Gastroschisis is a type of abdominal wall defect that occurs when a child's intestines do not develop fully while in the womb. In the early stages of pregnancy, the intestine develops within the umbilical cord. Weeks later it moves inside the foetus' abdomen. But where an unborn child has gastroschisis, the abdominal wall does not completely form.It results in the intestines growing outside the body. Around one in 3,000 babies are born with the condition in the UK, each year. As soon as the child is born the condition requires immediate treatment. Within a few hours of birth, the baby is usually transferred to a specialist children's hospital. The first step is for doctor's to wrap the exposed intestines in a type of 'cling film' to reduce the amount of fluid and body heat lost. It also acts to protect the intestines from further damage. Once a baby is stable, they will have an operation to put the intestines back inside the abdomen, and close up the abdominal wall. It can take several operations to achieve this, placing the intestines back a bit at a time, until they can all be contained. For some children, their intestines will recover and start to work properly, allowing them to begin to eat normally. For other children, the intestines can experience too much damage during the process, meaning further treatment is required.

"By . Mark Prigg . It is great news for those in their thirties and forties worried life is over. Researchers say that in fact, our personalities develop until well into our fifities. They say our personality becomes most stable during middle age - but then begins to decline again. Researchers say our personalities develop into our fifties - and that middle age in peak time for them. Researchers in New Zealand recruited 4,000 men and women aged 20 to 80 to complete a personality questionnaire twice, with a gap of two years in between. The survey measured a person's honesty-humility factor as well as five major personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience. They compared how people's scores varied between years, and analyzed how all of the participants personalities related to one another, depending on age. Experts found that the stability of personality increases through youth, peaks in mid-life and then gradually reduces again into old age, presumably in response to the variations in social and biological pressures we experience at the different stages of life. Petar Milojev and Chris Sibley at the University of Auckland in New Zealand recruited 4,000 men and women aged 20 to 80 to complete a personality questionnaire twice, with a gap of two years in between. The survey measured a person's honesty-humility factor as well as five major personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience. They compared how people's scores varied between years, and analyzed how all of the participants personalities related to one another, depending on age. Most people's personalities were generally stable, they found, but the stability of those trait followed a bell curve over time, peaking at middle-age and then dropping again. For certain traits—conscientiousness, openness to experience, and honesty-humility, the oldest participants' personality stability matched those of the youngest. Extraversion was the most stable trait, and agreeableness the least, according to the British Psychological Society's Research Digest. People in their 30s, for example, showed high levels of neuroticism, but by the time they reached their 50s that had  been replaced by conscientiousness, openness and honesty-humility. People in their 30s, for example, showed high levels of neuroticism, but by the time they reached their 50s that had been replaced by conscientiousness, openness and honesty-humility. The researchers said these ""domain specific"" variations in personality stability point to different environmental and social demands influencing different personality traits to varying degrees at slightly different times of life. ""This report further highlights the need to test ... the effects of events that might cause the lower stability [of personality] in younger and older adulthood,"" the researchers said. ""In addition our finding of systematically different peaks in stability between different personality dimensions suggest the need to further investigate age-specific changes in environmental and social pressures that are associated with such domain-specific effects.""","Extraversion and neuroticism showed highest stability in the late 30s .
Openness, honesty-humility, and conscientiousness showed peak stability in the late 40s ."
"By . Rebecca Brett for MailOnline . Brits spend nearly £400m a year, more than £1m a day, on excess baggage charges at airports because they take too much on holiday. Overloading bags with too many clothes and other possessions costs Britons a staggering £393m a year in baggage fees. And research found that an astonishing 50 per cent of clothes and other items taken on holiday are never actually worn. A total of 32% of women only wear half of what they take on holiday, compared to 36% of men . 1. Public transport delays - 39% . 2. Oversleeping - 28% . 3. Disorganised/last minute packing - 26% . 4. Forgetting travel date - 18% . 5. Going to wrong airport terminal - 13% . 6. Out of date passport - 12% . More than one in three holidaymakers wears only half of what they pack. And one in four jet-setting Brits have to spend an average of £32.50 on extra luggage capacity, adding up to £393m a year. Contrary to popular belief, it's men rather than women who are packing unnecessarily large amounts for holiday. A total of 36 per cent of men only wear half of what they take on holiday, compared to 32 percent of women. Travellers aged 35 to 44 years said they spend the most on extra luggage - around £33 per journey. Overloading bags with too many clothes costs Britons a staggering £393m a year in baggage fees . However, as travellers get older they get wiser on holiday baggage allowances. 43 per cent of holidaying 18 to 24 year olds wear less than half of what they pack, compared to just 21 per cent of people aged 55 or older. The survey of 1,000 holidaymakers was commissioned by minicab booking website Kabbee. Justin Peters, Kabbee founder, said: 'Our study is designed to remind people to plan ahead for a stress-free getaway on their holiday. 'Extra costs for luggage can be avoided by being disciplined when packing clothing and other possessions. 'We've heard stories from our minicab drivers about passengers taking large amounts of luggage and now we know that half of it is not even being worn. 'More than 25 percent of all bookings made via Kabbee are airport journeys, so we're keen to help to keep costs down by offering simple advice to passengers.'","Overloading suitcases costs £393m in baggage fees every year .

"An art student has been given the highest possible award for an A level project dedicated to her dying mother. When former beauty queen Denise Powis, 51, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given just months to live, her daughter Becca chose to stay at home to spend as much time with her as possible. The young artist, 17, studied old photographs of her mother, a former model, while sitting at her bedside. Art student Becca Powis - who dedicated her A-level project to painting and sketching pictures of her dying mother - has been rewarded with top marks for the moving artwork . She was so inspired by pictures of her mother posing on a car bonnet, winking into the camera, and a stunning black and white portrait, she decided to make her her muse for her A level art project. She created seven pieces from Mrs Powis’ modelling portfolio which included oil paintings, pencil sketches and watercolour pieces. She died last December, midway through Becca’s course and just three months after being diagnosed with metastatic cancer. Becca, one of four  children left by Mrs Powis, continued working on her A-level project in memory of her mother and submitted it in May. And despite having just a 52 per cent attendance record in her final year at sixth form, Becca achieved an A* grade in art. She was also awarded the same grades for photography and fashion. Becca, who lives with her dad Barry, a company director, and siblings Gemma, 16, and Ashley and Luke, 13, in Ferndown, Dorset, now intends to study a foundation art course and apply to university. She said: 'I had started doing my project about the Rokeby Venus painting, but when mum was diagnosed I had a rethink. Becca's mum Denise Powis in her modelling years.

The 17-year-old poured over old photographs of her mum, a former model, at her bedside and became so inspired by them she decided to . centre her art course around them . 'Mum used to be a model when she was younger and so I made my mum my project. 'We dug out all these old photos and newspaper cuttings about her, it was so moving to see her at her most beautiful. 'I was going to school like normal but I found it really hard to concentrate so I spoke to my teachers and they said if I felt more comfortable working at home that was fine. 'My mum was on an electric bed in the lounge so I set up a section in the same room and did all my work from there. 'I think she really enjoyed getting all the albums out and looking through everything again.' Mrs Pows died last December, midway through Becca's course and just three months after being diagnosed with metastatic cancer . All of her artwork was created from oil paints, sketches, and watercolours and was based on pictures of her mum in 1980 when she was 18. Becca said: 'Mum did lots of beauty pageants and was a former Miss Wimborne. 'I created oil paintings, sketches, and watercolour pieces from some of the photographs and submitted seven in total. 'In a way, I guess it helped me. Sometimes it was really hard to get motivated and I just didn’t want to think about it, other times it was a good distraction.

"By . Antonia Hoyle . Declan's mother Paula, 32, a nurse, decided to donate his organs to help save other lives . As 12-year-old Declan Hodgson lay on a life-support machine, his parents sat beside him and stroked his hands. They . told Declan they loved him and then, with tears of disbelief, said . goodbye. They walked on either side of their son as he was wheeled . towards theatre, in the agonising knowledge that the operation Declan . was about to have would not save his own life, but that of other people. The . previous day Declan, who was born with a heart defect, had undergone . major surgery. But catastrophic bleeding at the start of the operation . had starved Declan's brain of oxygen and he was pronounced brain dead. In . the midst of almost unimaginable grief, his mother Paula and father . Kevin were asked if they were willing to donate their son's organs. They . didn't hesitate. 'It would be selfish not to give others a chance . of life,' says Kevin, 35, a civil servant. 'As painful as the process . was, we were determined to view it as a positive decision.' It's now . a year since Declan's death, and while the family's grief is still raw, . they are proud of the fact their son's kidneys, liver and pancreas have . helped save three other people's lives. 'No matter how poorly Declan . was, he remained positive. He never gave up. He was such a loving, . brave boy and I would do anything to have him back, says Paula, 32, an . orthopaedic nurse. 'But there was never any doubt that I would donate . his organs, to spare other parents the heartache we are going through.' Yet . figures released yesterday to mark National Transplant Week suggest . many other families would behave differently: 45 per cent of people . refuse to donate their loved one's organs because they don't know what . that person wanted; the figure rises to 47 per cent for children. In . the past five years, 112 children have died because no donor organ was . available. Currently, 149 under-18s in the UK are waiting for an organ. According . to NHS Blood and Transplant, the authority responsible for organ . donations, many parents are driven by a misplaced desire to protect . their children, even after their death. 'I think some also . mistakenly believe not as much effort will go into saving their child's . life because their organs are needed,' adds Paula. 'But I can't stress enough how important it is that they donate. It is the right thing to do.' Although . children's organs are mainly used for other children, they can also be . given to adults depending on the organ needed. So one of Declan's . kidneys and his pancreas saved a woman in her 40s, his other kidney . helped a woman in her 20s and his liver saved a teenage boy. 'Declan was simply excited that he was having an operation to make him better,' says Paula . 'Knowing I had saved someone else's child, especially, gave me strength,' says Paula, through tears. Declan . was diagnosed with congenital heart disease - a defect in the structure . of his heart - soon after his birth in May 2001. His lips had turned . blue and he was transferred to the paediatric unit at Leeds General . Infirmary. Scans showed that the blood vessels in his heart were in . the wrong place, while a blockage was obstructing blood flow to his . lungs. The wall dividing the left and right lower chambers of his heart . was also faulty. As a result blood was not being pumped properly around . his body, causing cyanosis - where the skin turns blue because of poor . circulation - and fatigue. Doctors warned Kevin and Paula that, as Declan grew up, he would need operations to improve the efficacy of his heart. If . these were successful, his life expectancy could still be normal. In . the meantime he would need to take aspirin every day to thin his blood . so that it could circulate better. Kevin, from Wakefield, Yorkshire, . says: 'We clung to the hope that Declan could still lead a normal life - . especially as he developed healthily as a baby.' In fact, at six . months Declan was deemed robust enough to endure a nine-hour operation . to have a shunt - a 3cm tube - fitted in his heart to create a detour . from the heart to the lungs, so blood picks up more oxygen and . circulation is improved. The operation was a success and Declan blossomed. 'He . occasionally grew tired if he over-exerted himself, but refused to let . it hold him back,' says Kevin. 'He took his first steps at a year and . thrived at school.' (Although Kevin and Paula separated when Declan was 12 months old, they remained friends and shared custody of their son). But in 2008 Declan, then seven, fell and cut his arm. Although . only a small 2cm graze, within days he developed flu-like symptoms, . caused by an infection in his blood that travelled to his heart. The . following month he was diagnosed with endocarditis - a potentially fatal . heart infection. Declan spent three months in hospital on an . intravenous antibiotic drip. Though the infection cleared up, his heart . had become weaker. Paula says: 'His condition could have deteriorated . anyway. We'll never know if the cut was the cause.' Declan grew so . lethargic that she had to drive him the half-mile to school. 'If he . exerted himself he would turn blue or throw up,' says Kevin. 'Declan dreamt of being a footballer and asked why he couldn't run around like his friends. It made us constantly anxious.' In . January 2010 Declan underwent surgery to have a large vein connected . directly to an artery, bypassing the heart so blood could go straight . into the lungs to be oxygenated. But his condition continued to . deteriorate and last year his consultant said he needed another, similar . procedure. This was the only treatment option left - without it, he . would need a heart transplant. 'We never talked about this with Declan. We thought he was too young to understand,' says Paula. They . were warned the operation carried a risk of brain damage, internal . bleeding and infection. 'Because his life expectancy was limited anyway, . we didn't feel we had a choice,' says Paula. The 12-hour operation . took place on June 12 last year. 'Declan was simply excited that he was . having an operation to make him better. I told him I loved him and . promised that everything would be OK,' says Kevin. Declan's father Kevin says it would have been hypocritical to say no . But early on in . the procedure, surgeons discovered Declan's heart lining had fused to . his ribcage. Opening the ribs caused his heart to bleed, and in the time . it took for surgeons to stop the bleeding, Declan's brain was starved . of oxygen. His consultant told Declan's parents he had suffered an . irreversible brain injury. 'It was a nightmare I couldn't comprehend,' says Paula. 'I screamed and vomited.' Their son was pronounced brain . dead at 3am on June 13. Shortly afterwards, a specialist organ donation . nurse - on call in every hospital - asked Declan's parents whether . they'd let his organs be used to help others live. 'Given that Declan . would have needed a transplant, it would have been hypocritical to say . no,' says Kevin. Aside from Declan's heart and lungs which were . damaged, the couple agreed to donate everything else except his corneas. 'His blue eyes were so sparkly,' says Kevin. 'They reminded me of how . happy he had been and I couldn't stand the thought of them being taken . away.' By 6pm the transplant nurse had found three recipients for . Declan's kidneys, pancreas and liver. The process is time-sensitive as . organs don't last for long outside the body. A liver can survive between . six and eight hours before transplant, a pancreas 12 hours and a kidney . up to 24 hours. Declan was kept on the life-support machine until . that evening and the recipients had been prepared for surgery in other . hospitals. As his parents kept a vigil by his bedside, a nurse cut a . lock of his strawberry-blond hair for them to keep and created Declan's . handprints out of clay. Then the family was moved into a private room to say goodbye. 'We . kissed him and told him we loved him,' says Kevin. 'I had promised . Declan he would be OK and he wasn't. I felt I had failed my son.' At Declan's funeral, the 200 guests were banned from wearing black. 'We . wanted it to be a celebration of life and the love everyone felt for . Declan,' says Kevin. 'I miss everything about him, from the way he . bounded into bed with me in the morning for a cuddle to the Barnsley . football matches we watched together.' Paula has kept Declan's . bedroom untouched. Sometimes she sits amid his Horrid Henry books and . football posters, inhaling the boyish scent still on his dressing gown. 'I still wake up some mornings and for a few seconds forget my beautiful boy is not here,' she says. 'My heart is broken.' Last . month, on the anniversary of Declan's death, the couple received a card . from the lady who had received Declan's kidney and pancreas. She wrote about how sorry she was for what had happened to Declan, and said she would be for ever in their debt. 'We were incredibly touched,' says Paula. 'I feel ready to meet the recipients now - I think it would give me hope.' Adds Kevin: 'We would do anything to have Declan back. But knowing he has helped others means his legacy lives on.'

Mariella says that she asked broadcaster Penny Smith if she could borrow her actor boyfriend Vince Leigh for the canal barge trip.

Scroll down for video . Husband sharing: Mariella Frostrup borrowed best friend Penny Smith's (pictured, right) husband for a holiday . Mariella told Waitrose Weekend magazine: ‘I have just returned from a canal boat trip in south-west France with my two children and my best friend's boyfriend. Seriously! ‘Verily I say unto you that I have seen the future and it’s partner sharing. ‘I don't mean in some sordid Seventies throw-your-keys-in-a-bowl sort of way but a modern, squeaky clean, no-sex-please-we're British manifestation. ‘Initially it seemed a disaster when my husband was called away on business and was unable to join us on our much-anticipated trip aboard the beautiful barge Alouette on the 17th century Canal du Midi between Carcassonne and Beziers. Close friends: Mariella, left, and Penny Smith with husband Vince Leigh . ‘So I asked my friend Penny Smith if I could borrow her husband. Enter Vince Leigh, shortly to appear on the West End stage in Ed Hall's brilliant Kinks musical Sunny Afternoon. ‘Luckily rehearsals had not yet begun so this child-friendly, easy on the eye wine-guzzling charmer was mine for the voyage. ‘To say it was an unqualified success would be to undervalue the pleasure of a familiar but not intimate male companion.’ On holiday: Mariella pictured relaxing in Cambodia . Mariella says that she shared a cabin with her daughter while her son shared with Vince. ‘All in all Vince proved a top-of-the-range companion. Divesting myself of responsibility for another man's peccadillos awaked in me the desire to try harder to do likewise in my own home. ‘So much friction in life is self-induced and down to the minor annoyances and perceived injustices of daily life. ‘My mini-break with Vince has proved the best marriage-enhancer possible.

But when he opened the photo and saw the image, Mr Briggs was left horrified by the sight of his 31st frame. Now, two years on, he has shed an astonishing 17st and, in November, will complete the New York marathon in memory of his mother Susan who died from multiple sclerosis when he was just 18. Pounding the pavements: Matthew Briggs, 32, has lost an impressive 17st in just two years of slimming . 'In March of 2000, she lost her battle with Multiple Sclerosis,' he says. 'She has always been my inspiration. I am the man I am today because of the woman she was.' Money raised by Mr Briggs' 26-mile run will be donated to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, a charity dedicated to beating the disease as well as supporting sufferers and their families. Mr Briggs, who has dropped from 31st to just under 14st, had piled on the pounds thanks to a diet of ready meals, takeaways and daily two litre bottles of Coca-Cola. But, after seeing the photo posted on Facebook and spurred on by a bet with his father, Mr Briggs joined his local Slimming World group and went on to shed more than 17st over two years. Embarrassing: This snap of a heavyweight Mr Briggs and his father spurred him into losing weight . Looking good: Mr Briggs now weighs just under 14st and has lost a whopping 17st over two years .

Balotelli has agreed a three-year, heavily incentivised £90,000-per-week contract and Mino Raiola, the forward’s long-term adviser, has urged him to seize the opportunity. Having already played for Manchester City, Inter Milan and AC Milan it is unlikely Balotelli will get another big move if he fails to settle at Liverpool. During his time at the Etihad, Balotelli netted 30 goals in 80 appearances. He also scored 18 goals in 41 matches for Milan last season.

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . The customer is always right. So much so that Waitrose has let a seven-year-old boy redesign its brown sauce label - because it's 'too boring'. Harry Deverill wrote to the supermarket complaining about the drab design, and included his own suggestion. Scroll down for video . Lead designer: Harry Deverill with his own design to improve Waitrose's 'boring' brown sauce label . Re-vamp: The seven-year-old budding artist posted his own sketch of a breakfast replace the original (right) To his surprise, executives wrote back a few weeks later agreeing to take him up on the offer. Now, Harry's label - which features a hand-drawn picture of a full English breakfast - has gone on sale nationwide. His mother Helen Deverill, 38, said it was her father that encouraged Harry to get in touch with the supermarket. But family in Wimborne, Dorset, never expected to get a response. The mother-of-two said: 'Harry wrote in his letter that he didn't really know what was on the bottle, he said his mummy thought he was really good at drawing and he'd happily draw them a new label if they wanted. Surprise: He wrote a letter to Waitrose managing director Mark Price and was astounded to receive a reply . 'A few weeks later he received a letter back thanking him for his comments and agreeing to take him up on his offer to design a new label. 'We didn't really expect Harry to get a response I think his dad and I were more shocked than Harry. 'Harry was really surprised and really excited as he was only six at the time, he spent almost a week perfecting his design, he drew three suggestions one with a picture of a bacon sandwich another with a picture of fried eggs on toast and another with a fried breakfast. Dear Mark Price, . I am writing as the other morning I had Waitrose essential Brown Sauce with my bacon sandwiches. I asked Daddy what the picture is of o the label. Daddy didn't know and neither do I. Please could you let me know. Mummy says I am good at drawing so if you would like me to draw a new picture for the label I would be happy to. Kind regards, Harry Deverill, aged 6. 'Now the label is on the shelf it looks great and I think Waitrose have really done themselves proud it proves they listen to their customers no matter how young they are.' Harry is not the only one to take the supermarkets to task - and come out victorious. In 2012, three-year-old Lily Robinson pointed out that so-called 'tiger bread' bears no resemblance to tigers, but rather resembles a giraffe. Astoundingly, she received a reply to her suggestion two weeks later from customer manager Chris King who wrote: ‘I think renaming tiger bread giraffe bread is a brilliant idea. ‘It looks much more like the blotches on a giraffe than the stripes on a tiger, doesn’t it?’ The firm has now adopted the name permanently. Harry said: 'I love brown sauce, but I didn't know what the picture on the front of the bottle was. 'I love eating eggs and bacon with brown sauce, so I thought I'd draw a new version. 'I'm so excited that my picture is on bottles in lots of Waitrose shops.' Confidence: His mother said the reply boosted Harry's confidence in his drawing skills and his own opinions . Jo Heywood, Waitrose sauces buyer, said: 'When we heard Harry's offer and read his letter, we couldn't resist. We love our customers to tell us what they think of products, and when they're as creative as Harry, it's a pleasure to be able to do something fun like this. 'The drawing Harry created was perfect, and we're so excited for our customers to pick up an original Harry Deverill print on a bottle of brown sauce.'

"By . Adrian Durham . Follow @@talkSPORTDrive . Germany could win this World Cup, but they’ll face tougher tasks than the victory over Portugal. They thrashed a team whose best defender was sent off in the first half, whose best player Cristiano Ronaldo wasn’t fully fit, and who had one of the least reliable goalkeepers I’ve seen at this tournament. And of course the Germans did a bit of cheating to make sure they won. Party time: Germany started their World Cup campaign by thrashing Portugal on Monday . Easy pickings: Germany made light work of Portugal but will face tougher tasks later in the tournament . The main culprit was Thomas Muller, yet he was hailed as world class after the game because of his hat-trick. A penalty, then a lucky ricochet that the keeper should have saved, and finally a tap in  - again from a goalkeeping error – those three goals do not come together to make a player world class. Muller is a modern day David Platt – a good player, effective in big games, but not quite world class. He could change that at this tournament. But there are better players in this Germany team, as most expert eyes can see. Germany have looked excellent in spells at major tournaments, but without putting it together often enough to have an impact and win a trophy. And that’s the point with Germany. They’ve gone close, but not close enough. They haven’t won a trophy this century and they’ve not won a World Cup for a whole generation – 24 years. They’ve stuck with Joachim Low since 2006 because it’s been a succession of near misses in tournaments. So far Low’s career as Germany coach since he took over could be headlined: 'They’re good, but they’re not quite Spain.' Frustrations: Cristiano Ronaldo endured a difficult night as neither he nor his team-mates performed well . Flashpoint: Pepe put his head in while Thomas Muller was on the ground and was shown the red card . Off: Pepe's dismissal left Portugal with a mountain to climb in their opening match against Germany . Of course it’s better than England – but Germans don’t judge themselves by England’s low standards. They want excellence, they want to be champions, they’re winners. In England we would be absolutely delighted with semi-finals. The history of German football is very different – they expect to beat the best in the world, as happened in the 1974 World Cup final. You can have Maradona in your team, and the Germans will find a way to defeat you, as was the case in the 1990 World Cup final. Even teams at a particular tournament that are significantly better than Germany are defeated – witness England’s painful exit from Euro 96. Somehow the Germans found a way. So far though, despite having a seemingly brilliant crop of players, Low hasn’t found a way. Will this tournament be the one? If Germany don’t win this World Cup, they may well go down as the nearly men, left wondering what could have been if only they’d had that little bit extra. As one Germany fan told us on talkSPORT after the game: 'If it’s not this time – this crew has had it.' Let’s see what they’ve got because for me Germany are the team under most pressure in Brazil, apart from the hosts. Opener: Muller fired Germany ahead from the penalty spot in the early stages in Salvador . Doubling up: Muller notched his second, and Germany's third, to put his side in an unassailable position .

The tragedy in Manaus was that the English players, and probably even Roy Hodgson decided he was untouchable when actually we needed to get close to him, kick his backside, nutmeg him a few times and bring him back down to earth. He’d soon have come off with a strained calf or broken bootlace. We respected Pirlo far too much on Saturday, when it should have been our chance to put him in his place after that disrespectful chipped penalty in the shoot-out at Euro 2012. Remember Stuart Pearce’s contorted face after burying that spot-kick in 1996, 6 years on from the pain of missing from the spot at Italia 90? Remember David Beckham slamming in that penalty in 2002 against Argentina after the injustice of the red card in St Etienne four years earlier? That was revenge, that was redemption. Raheem Sterling running at Pirlo and nutmegging him, or Wayne Rooney leaving a foot in to upset – not injure – the Italian, upsetting him so much he wants to get off the field. That’s what England should have done. More of this: England showed Pirlo too much respect and should have closed him down, as Jack Wilshere did . Must do better: Raheem Sterling could have run at Pirlo and Wayne Rooney should have closed him down . Instead we stood off him, and a load of dreamy-eyes glossed over back home at this Azzuri legend. 'If only we had him,' the English teenagers cried. 'England have never produced a player like that,' said the older generation. 'He dummied the ball! Did you see that? He actually dummied the ball!' screamed a gaggle of World Cup groupies who have probably never been to a game of any level in England in their lives. The English obsession with all things foreign takes over yet again. Oh, if only we could produce a precious Pirlo. The sad thing is English football did produce a Pirlo. His name is Michael Carrick and after being left out of Roy Hodgson’s squad this summer he will end his career having played in just one game at a World Cup finals. We won it 1-0. Lone appearance: Michael Carrick's only World Cup appearance came against Ecuador in 2006 . Other plans: Carrick has been holidaying this summer after he was overlooked for a place at the World Cup . I don’t know if Carrick would have had as good an international career as Pirlo, but I do know the job he did in a very successful Manchester United side under Sir Alex Ferguson for many seasons. All these England managers felt they knew better than Sir Alex. They all failed. It’s all about opinions, and I’d probably conclude Pirlo is a better player than Carrick. But if England had used him in their midfield instead of messing around trying to use Lampard and Gerrard together, we may have been more successful. Anyone scoffing at this can’t prove me wrong. If you love Pirlo, you’ll appreciate what Carrick has done for United all these years. If you can’t see the connection, then English football’s problems run worryingly deep. Mainstay: Carrick has been an almost ever-present at the heart of the Manchester United midfield .","England gave Andrea Pirlo far too much respect in Manaus .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Ian Poulter expressed one final thought before leaving the Association of Golf Writers’ dinner at Royal Liverpool on Tuesday night. ‘I’ve got a good feeling about this one,’ he said. Good feelings abound at the start of the 143rd Open Championship. There is hardly a big name in the sport who is not coming here feeling good about his game. After a slow start to the season, the stars are all flexing their muscles. Rory McIlroy won in England in May. Justin Rose has won his last two events. Martin Kaymer was a classy winner of both the US Open and the Players’ Championship. Walking tall: Justin Rose goes into The Open in great form having won his last two tournaments . Adam Scott has reached the summit of the game, Graeme McDowell has triumphed in Versailles while defending champion Phil Mickelson looked like he made a breakthrough with his putting last week. There is no sport like this one for upsetting the odds but it will be a surprise if this major does not run close to form. This edition is due to begin with a blessed day, and every competitor will be looking to make a first-round statement given a forecast of virtually unbroken sunshine and a gentle breeze. Nobody could quibble with the number of hours the BBC are showing but some spectacular rounds might be heading for home by the time they come on air at 9am. Starting proceedings: Swedish golfer Robert Karlsson will get The Open underway with David Howell . David Howell and Robert Karlsson, for instance, are in the first group out at 6.30am. Two years after pulling out of The Open with a sad case of the yips, Karlsson is more than capable of posting a score that could stand all day, as is fellow nice guy Howell. ‘No problem for me getting up at that hour raring to go,’ said Englishman Howell, the father of seven-month-old twins. ‘Getting up at 5am is a lie-in for me.’ Tiger Woods, his playing partner Henrik Stenson, and McIlroy are off shortly after the television coverage begins and will inevitably carry much of the early interest. Given the forecast, it will be something of a surprise if McIlroy does not add to his impressive list of low first-round scores. As for Woods, who knows what might happen. Would anyone be shocked if he shot 68 or 78? The suspense simply adds to the anticipation. Eyes on the prize: Rory McIlroy will tee off with Tiger Woods and Henrik Stenson on Thursday morning . Woods has not won a major for more than six years but the 14-time champion remains on pace, nonetheless, to catch Jack Nicklaus’s total of 18 majors. The Golden Bear also had 14 at the age of 38 and won his 15th at his 66th attempt. This is 38-year-old Woods’s 65th major, and he will play his next two on courses where he has won. Yes, it remains close. And then there is Rose. It is 45 years since an Englishman won on English soil, when Tony Jacklin unleashed his ‘corking’ drive of legend down the 18th hole at Royal Lytham. Jacko is here this week, and the 70-year-old is as keen as anyone for the long wait to end. ‘Given the form he is in and the fact he’s a proven major winner, you’d have to think Justin has a great chance,’ he said. Yet has he . peaked too early, with his win in Washington and sumptuous illustration . of links play at Royal Aberdeen last week? Rose has certainly got the . right attitude. ‘If . I hadn’t won last week I think this event would be a realistic . opportunity for me to win, so I don’t see how it is less realistic . because I did win,’ he said. ‘The goal for me is to trust my game, and . give myself that opportunity.’ Sure thing: Rose says he trusts his game following successive Tour victories ahead of The Open . How poetic if he were to prevail here, on the same stretch of English coastline where he emerged, with his stunning performance in finishing tied fourth as a 17-year-old amateur at Birkdale. Three wins in a row sounds such a tall order but maybe, just maybe, the 33-year-old is about to complete an unforgettable milestone for British golf. The last time The Open was played at Hoylake it was won by the world No 1, and what a contrast he makes with the current holder. When Woods turned up on Sunday, 3,000 people showed up to follow him around. Out on the links, Scott was an almost solitary figure. Under the radar - as much as any man can be occupying top spot - is how Scott likes it but nobody is fooled. He is the favourite on merit. Two years ago Scott led at Lytham by four shots with four holes to play but still lost to Ernie Els. Star: 14-time major winner Tiger Woods (centre) has been mobbed by fans during his practice rounds . VIDEO Tiger aims to roar once more . ‘It might not have been the finish I wanted but I left knowing I had the skillset to win an Open,’ said the gentle Aussie. ‘I had a chance to win last year as well and it makes you hungrier than ever to get the job done. ‘I am playing some of the best golf of my career so I should be taking advantage and giving myself a good chance.’ Scott has been here for a week already, developing a familiarity with the course under different breezes. ‘I just enjoy coming early, it’s one of my favourite tournaments,’ he said. Under the radar: World number one Adam Scott is looking to win his first Claret Jug having come close in 2012 . VIDEO Scott aiming for prizes not points . ‘Last week I got to play an Open Championship course when it was closed to everyone else. It’s a real perk of the job.’ Born a fortnight apart in 1980, Rose and Scott will surely add to their total of one major apiece in the future. ‘This is our time,’ is the mantra that binds these great friends tight. Here at Hoylake, in the form of their lives, there is no time like the next four days. Familiar foes: Scott (right) lost to Ernie Els (left) in 2012 after leading by four shots with four holes to play .","Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose ready to lead the stellar names charge at The Open .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . India head coach Duncan Fletcher’s continued bitterness over his England axing seven years ago and the acrimony between the two teams came to a head at a Lord’s function. MCC put on their traditional drinks reception for the Test sides in the pavilion committee room last Friday night — but the Indians left before the England party had even arrived. Fletcher, who can’t hide his huge dislike for the England cricket hierarchy since losing his job after a World Cup failure that followed the Ashes whitewash in 2006-07, made it clear his players would only be staying for a brief period. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alastair Cook: Maybe I'm not the right man for the job . Acrimonious: Duncan Fletcher (second left) with his India team is still unhappy about his England axing . As a result MCC president Mike Gatting brought forward his welcome address, after which Fletcher and Co quickly departed while the England dressing room were still celebrating Gary Ballance’s Test hundred. And when England did finally join the MCC party, Gatting had to make another speech. Fletcher has also complained to the MCC about members in the pavilion walking behind the bowler’s arm when India have been batting. And ECB chiefs are understood to be blaming him for India being so resolute in their official ICC complaint about the Jimmy Anderson fracas at Trent Bridge with Ravindra Jadeja. It is not just hoteliers in Rio that raise their prices for sports events. Closer to home, hotels around St Andrews in Scotland are already quoting £400 a night with a minimum week’s stay for the 2015 Open there confident of the demand from Japan and the USA. Jaime Byrom, whose family business is at the centre of a World Cup ticket touting scandal, continues to plead the innocence of his British brother-in-law Ray Whelan. Imprisoned: Ray Whelan is being held in a prison in Rio de Janeiro following a ticket touting scandal . He is still in custody in Rio’s notorious Bangu prison on suspicion of attempting to off-load £450,000 worth of hospitality packages to Algerian Lamine Fofana, whom it later transpired was a tout and on Byrom Group’s banned list. Byrom said it was ‘tragic’ for Whelan to be held in prison when he had done nothing wrong. But the difficulty for Byrom’s Cheadle-based company is persuading Rio police that Whelan is the innocent party. Shane Warne has done all he can to destabilise England captain Alastair Cook, yet MCC are so much in thrall to the Aussie irritant that they are even putting the plastercast from his broken hand in the Lord’s 200th anniversary match in the museum. Meanwhile, it is understood Warne is still furious with his compatriot Brett Lee for causing the damage with a beamer. Critical: Aussia spin legend Shane Warne has been scathing in his criticism of Alastair Cook . Flower’s hanging on less than a year after last summer’s victorious Ashes defence, the England Cricket Board resembles a sinking ship. On the way out with the England managing director, chief selector, chief executive and commercial director are now Goodwood-bound Mark Pearce, head of commercial, and Lesley Cook, HR director. And the chances of either captain Alastair Cook or coach Peter Moores, a serial loser at international level, lasting the summer looks remote. The clearout makes it all the more remarkable that former England team director Andy Flower remains on board, pulling the strings from behind the scenes at Loughborough as director of elite coaching. Dry spell: England coach Peter Moores and captain Cook are overseeing a terrible period for England . Jackie Brock-Doyle, London 2012 director of communications, is a highly formidable late replacement to run the media operation at the Commonwealth Games following a serious family health issue for communications chief Gordon Arthur. Brock-Doyle OBE was also rushed in for the 2002 Games in Manchester when it was felt the media chief was struggling, which is not the case this time. Guy Kinnings, head of golf at IMG, is understood to be high on headhunters Spencer  Stuart’s wishlist to replace Peter Dawson when he retires as chief executive of the R & A after the 2015 Open. Kinnings, who has also been linked with the European Tour top job, ticks all the boxes to be a leading golf administrator. But with the new American bosses of IMG focusing strongly on golf, Kinnings will need a lot of persuading to leave.","India head coach Fletcher still bitter following England sacking in 2007 .

Sergio Garcia scooped more than £500,000 for finishing second at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational but the Spaniard was lucky not to be handed a hefty bill after breaking a spectator’s diamond ring with a wild drive. Garcia, who lost out to Rory McIlroy despite taking a three-shot lead into the final round at Firestone, smashed his tee shot into the gallery at the third hole on Sunday, hitting a woman on the hand and knocking out the stone. With the sparkler lost in the rough, Garcia helped look for it before giving the woman a signed ball and moving on, although he did ask for her number in case the diamond never turned up. Happy: A crowd gets together as relief sets around for the woman as she finds the diamond to her ring .

Respect: Garcia embraces McIIroy after the latter's win at the WGC on Sunday . Garcia wasn’t out of pocket as the rock was found but a bogey on the par-four and a third straight birdie from McIlroy saw the lead change hands. That sent the Northern Irishman on his way to a second successive victory after winning The Open and a return to the top of the world rankings.

"By . Phil Casey . Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley believes Rory McIlroy is on course to dominate golf following the Open champion's victory in the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday. A fortnight after holding off Sergio Garcia to lift the Claret Jug at Royal Liverpool, McIlroy overhauled his Ryder Cup team-mate to claim his first World Golf Championship event and regain top spot in the world rankings. McIlroy turned a three-shot deficit into a two-shot lead within the space of five holes at Firestone Country Club before Garcia battled back to leave the pair tied heading into the back nine. Champion: McIlroy with his trophy after winning the WGC-Bridgestone invitational at Firestone Country club . Garcia had played the same stretch of holes in just 27 shots in his second round of 61, but it was McIlroy who came out on top two days later in a tense duel, the 25-year-old carding a closing 66 to finish 15 under par, two ahead of Garcia as he had been in the Open. With Adam Scott finishing outside the top five, that meant McIlroy reclaimed the world number one spot he last held in March 2013, just in time for the final major of the year, this week's US PGA Championship at Valhalla. Asked if McIlroy was on the way to dominating the sport as Tiger Woods had, McGinley told Sky Sports: 'There is no reason why not. That's the best exhibition of driving I have ever seen from anybody in terms of length and accuracy. That golf course is very narrow off the tee and he is finding the fairway time after time at 340 yards. Duel: McIlroy and Ryder Cup team-mate Sergio Garcia finished first and second at the Open and at the WGC . Form: The Northern Irishman said he was proud to follow up his Open victory with a similar performance . 'What I think is great is that Rory can hold his attitude where it is at now, it's very much in the present, taking one week at a time. He's never said he was chasing Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 majors and that's a great attitude, it takes the pressure off him and keeps him very much in the present where he needs to be.' Atfer 16 birdies in the first three rounds Garcia could only manage one in a disappointing closing 71, meaning the 34-year-old has now won just three times after holding the 54-hole lead on 16 occasions. 'What I am really proud of this week is following on from the Open with a performance like this,' McIlroy, only the second European winner of the title after Darren Clarke in 2003, told CBS. 'I said straight after I did not want any let down, I wanted to keep going and performing until the end of the season. 'It's great to come to one of my favourite tournaments of the year and to perform like this I am pretty satisfied.'

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Rory McIlroy believes he is in the best form of his life as he seeks a third win in succession and second major title in the space of four weeks in the US PGA Championship. McIlroy headed to Valhalla back on top of the world rankings for the first time since March 2013 after claiming his first World Golf Championship event in the Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday. It is the third time the Open champion has taken top spot with a win, the first coming in the Honda Classic in March 2012 and the second later that year when he won the US PGA Championship by eight shots at Kiawah Island.

Success: McIlroy holds the Gary Player Cup after winning the World Golf Championships . VIDEO WGC-Bridgestone Invitational - Final Round highlights . That was one of five victories around the world which saw McIlroy finish top of the money list on both sides of the Atlantic, but the 25-year-old feels his Open triumph at Hoylake and victory at Firestone Country Club - both by two shots over the unfortunate Sergio Garcia - means he is playing at a higher level. 'This is better,' said McIlroy, who also came from seven shots behind to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in May. 'I’m more in control of my ball and my ball flight. Mentally, I’m really sharp. 'It was the most comfortable I’ve ever felt trying to close out a golf tournament out there (on Sunday). I felt normal. I felt like it was the first round or the second round. It didn’t feel like a fourth round. 'When I say mentally it’s the best I’ve ever been, I didn’t get ahead of myself. I didn’t start to think about my score. I didn’t think about where I was in the tournament. I just kept playing my shot after shot after shot.' With Adam Scott narrowly failing to secure the top-five finish he needed to prevent McIlroy from overtaking him, the Northern Irishman’s lead at the top of the rankings is just 0.17 points. Challenger: Australian golfer Adam Scott is slightly behind McIlroy in the rankings . But McIlroy is more focused on tournament victories than rankings, with plenty still to play for in the rest of the season. 'It’s a nice honour and it’s a nice title to have, but I don’t think you should go into tournaments thinking about it or thinking ""Oh, this guy could pass me if I don’t finish in this position, or this guy could do this"",' McIlroy added. 'I think you just go and you play and you try to win golf tournaments, and if you win golf tournaments, the ranking takes care of itself. My goal now until the end of the year is just to try to win as many golf tournaments as I can. It’s not to try to finish number one in the world. It’s just to get as many titles as possible. 'I feel like the run of golf courses we’ve got coming up are going to suit me. I haven’t seen Valhalla, but from what I heard you need to hit it pretty long and drive the ball well.' McIlroy certainly did that in Akron, leading the field in driving distance (334.8 yards) and also finishing joint first in greens in regulation at 79.17 per cent. Asked if McIlroy was on the way to dominating the sport as Tiger Woods did in his prime, European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley told Sky Sports 4: 'There is no reason why not.

"By . Paul Newman for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Alex Hales will have his first chance on Monday to provide the spark at the top of the order which has so often been lacking in England’s one-day cricket. Alastair Cook confirmed on Sunday that Hales will open with him against India at Bristol at the start of England’s intensive spell of limited-overs cricket which will culminate with the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in February. It means Ian Bell, Cook’s most recent partner in a largely orthodox opening combination, drops down to three to allow Hales the opportunity to show he can extend his explosive Twenty20 game to the longer format. Boom! Hales has shown in the shortest format that he can kick-start an innings at international level . New Lion: The young opener scored a century for the Lions this season playing 50-over cricket . ‘Alex is a different batter to the other guys,’ said Cook of an opener who will have licence to attack from the off. ‘He hits the ball incredibly hard in different areas but with an orthodox technique. He’s done really well in Twenty20 and now he can show us what he can do in 50-over cricket.’ The presence of Hales should allow Cook or Bell to play the anchor role but the captain insisted yesterday his approach will remain unchanged as he tries to extend his recovery with the bat in the Test arena. Confidence: Cook says winning the Test series has given him renewed confidence in his own batting . England (probable): Cook (captain), Hales, Bell, Root, Morgan, Stokes, Buttler (wicketkeeper), Jordan, Tredwell, Finn, Gurney. India (probable): Dhawan, R Sharma, Kohli, Rahane, Raina, Dhoni (captain and wicketkeeper), Jadeja, Ashwin, Kumar, Shami, Yadav. Start: 10.30am, Bristol County Ground. TV & Radio: LIVE on Sky Sports 2 from 10am; BBC 5 Live Sports Extra from 10.15am. Umpires: Paul Reiffel (Australia) and Rob Bailey (England). TV: Michael Gough (England). Match referee: Ranjan Madugalle (Sri Lanka). Weather: Dreadful forecast plus drainage issues mean this could be a damp squib. ‘I don’t think it changes what I do,’ said Cook. ‘The job of anyone in the top four or five is to score a hundred and set up the game. You have to try to do that in your own way. ‘My confidence is at a better level to what it was three weeks ago. You only really get confidence from winning games.’ While the selection of Hales, who has hit four centuries for Notts this season and one for the Lions, was a formality, England have resisted any temptation to make more changes to what can seem a staid approach. That means James Vince, James Taylor and Jason Roy must wait, while the bulk of the side who won the last three Tests against India have the chance to inflict further misery on the 50-over world champions. The decision to stage back-to-back Ashes, so costly last winter, was made to give England a better chance of breaking their perennial duck in longer global tournaments, which so nearly ended in last year’s Champions Trophy. Waiting in the wings: James Taylor (left) and Jason Roy (right) have both staked their own claims for the spot . They play India in five 50-over games and one Twenty20 match before a series in Sri Lanka in November and then a tournament in Australia against the hosts and India ahead of the World Cup. ‘We’ve never had a period of one-day cricket like this,’ said Cook, who continues at the helm of the 50-over team after answering so many doubts about his captaincy in the last three Tests. ‘It gives us time to practice those skills that are needed in one-day cricket, especially the extra ones you need in the power-play overs with the bat, and in death bowling. That’s what we need to do if we are going to have a chance of winning the World Cup in what should be good conditions for us.’ Pressure: In the absence of Ravi Bopara a large part of the bowling burden may fall to Chris Woakes . The biggest surprise in England’s squad was the absence of Ravi Bopara, left out because of the decision to go back to four ‘specialist’ seam bowlers and a spinner rather than a part-timer as one of their five main bowlers. That leaves Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes, who successfully defended the 14 Lancashire needed off the final over of Saturday’s Twenty20 final against Birmingham at Edgbaston, competing for the final place in a team which sees the return of Steven Finn for the first time since being ‘unselectable’ in Australia. Jimmy Anderson, who had a chastening time for Lancashire in that final defeat, looks likely to be rested — if a dreadful weather forecast allows a game to take place at Bristol’s redeveloped ground. Number one: Dhoni (right) made it clear he still sees Duncan Fletcher as the main man for India . This is the form of cricket that usually stirs India into a more concerted effort but they go into this series with Duncan Fletcher’s position as coach threatened by the introduction of Ravi Shastri as team director and the standing-down of Fletcher’s support staff. MS Dhoni insisted Fletcher remains ‘the boss’ and will stay with India for their defence of the World Cup but the tourists find themselves under the sort of pressure Cook and England were experiencing just the matter of a few weeks and three Tests ago.","Hales has been in impressive form with the bat this summer .

He said the UK economy is ‘underachieving’ by focusing too much on Europe rather than faster growing markets.

He told the Mail: ‘Leaving the EU would not be as disastrous a scenario as some people have painted it as. ‘If we get a terrible deal we should stay out.

"By . Kirk Maltais . A 88 year-old poster advertising an appearance of baseball legend Babe Ruth is set to go to auction, after being found in a demolished Minnesota home. The poster will reportedly fetch more than $20,000. The 14-by-22 inch poster, promotes a June 16, 1926 exhibition appearance of Ruth and the New York Yankees, pitting them against the St. Paul Saints, an AAA minor league team from the American Association. The cardstock poster, which curiously lists the icon as 'Ruth Babe,' was discovered as the owner's home was being demolished. The poster found inside of a wall in a Minnesota home (left) / Babe Ruth in 1934 (right) Babe Ruth standing behind a row of bats during Opening Day 1932 at Yankee Stadium. The newly found poster errs in the listing of his name . 'As the walls were being knocked down, he noticed it within the paper insulation,'  Chris Ivy, Director of Sports Collectibles with Heritage Auctions, told FoxNews.com. Heritage Auctions is handling the sale of the poster. According to Ivy, who said that the poster was the only surviving one for the event, he told the owner of the poster soon after the find that 'he found a diamond in the rough.' The poster reportedly falls into the most common categories for sports collectibles, as it is not only a New York Yankees/baseball collectible, but it's a Babe Ruth collectible, the first larger-than-life superstar of American sports. According to Heritage Auctions, the game was scheduled to happen at Lexington Park, in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was an exhibition game scheduled in between games against the St. Louis Browns and Chicago White Sox. However, the game was rained out, and the Great Bambino instead put on his own show, treating fans to a batting practice.

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . These are the ambitious plans which suggest skyscrapers of the future may one day house an entire city. This 'Endless City' project would see a giant skyscraper as tall as The Shard in London, built with its own complete  ecosystem featuring offices, shops and 'huge' parks. London is the proposed city for the mixed-use tower, which would include interlinking ramps connecting different sections of the structure to create a 'vertical city' housing thousands. Scroll down for video... Architects believe the 'Endless City' skyscraper, pictured in its design phase, would help create much-needed space in crowded city areas and feature its own 'ecosystem' Residents would be able to walk around intertwining ramps in the interior of the giant building, passing through shopping, commercial and residential areas in a so-called 'vertical city' Vast: The building would include many of the features that can be found in a city environment, including parking, green spaces and parks, shopping districts, housing and entertainment . The proposal has been drawn up by SURE Architecture, whose design has already won the SkyScrapers and SuperSkyScrapers Competition. The firm insists the building would be a great space-saver in dense cities which have previously spread outwards rather than upwards. Although the skyscraper is only at design phase, the company has earmarked a location close to the City of London - but it remains to be seen whether it will reach the construction stage. It is not yet clear exactly how tall the building would be, but early indications suggest it could top 300m - around the same as London's tallest skyscraper The Shard. The building would take up an area of 165,855 sq m. Residents would be able to walk up a series of interlinked ramps through vibrant streets, plazas, technological spaces and 'huge' parks in a 'complex and rich system like a real city' London is the proposed city for the mixed-use tower, which would feature huge interlinking ramps connecting different sections of the structure to create a 'vertical city' Early indications suggest the building, outlined in green, could tower as tall as 300m - around the same as London's tallest skyscraper the Shard, pictured to the left. Architects have earmarked land near the City of London . According to the company's report, the building's shape will 'maximize passive energy and reduce artificial light, cooling and heating needs'. The different levels, as well as having stunning views of the surrounding area, will feature plazas and communal spaces. Alina Valcarce, associate director of SURE Architecture, said: 'There is no break anymore, neither between street level and the skyscraper, nor between the skyscraper floors themselves. 'The goal of the design is to conceive an open building that is effective as it is inviting and a powerful symbol in all directions while being permeated by generosity and openness.' Structural support for the giant tower would be provided by six steel tubes, which would also contain the plumbing and electrical work for much of the building.

"By . Deni Kirkova . A crackling, heating potion claims to beat cellulite faster than any other. Fisioline, the 'number one' cellulite treatment amongst Italian women, boasts revolutionary crackle technology which sparks and fizzes on contact with skin, warming it to a 'pleasant but significant' temperature. This, along with a lymphatic massage, is said to enhance the activity of the £25 product's multiple active cellulite-targetting ingredients. Cellulite is a problem for many women but Italian company Fisioline claims to have the answer . Chilli . pepper extract features in the formula to reactivate microcirculation . while ivy, birch, asiatic centella aid lymphatic draining.  There's also . antioxidant green tea and smoothing and soothing aloe, as well as . carnitin, brown algae, theobromine, bromelain, caffeine and genistein . which are known to work to stimulate the metabolism. The strange bubbling sensation occurs because active ingredients are getting to work straight away. Commissioned research has shown that daily use of the Fisioline product leads to a 'significant improvement in the appearance of the skin' in just three weeks. Private healthcare search engine, WhatClinic.com, found patient enquiries for cellulite treatments in the UK have risen by 21 per cent in the last 12 months, so the product definitely has a growing market in this country. The feeling of the product is addictive, like warming popping candy against your skin. But that shouldn't be the only reason to love it, as there's science behind the formula. The University of Ferrara found that cellulite creams and gels only start working five to seven minutes after application - providing you're still working it into the skin. Studies have found though, that we rarely massage product into offending areas for more than a mere three minutes - hence we are not getting the maximum benefits. However, thanks to Fisioline's crackle technology, the product's maximum potential is realised within the first five minutes when active ingredients are working at their peak. The crackling effect warms the skin to a pleasant but significant temperature which enhances the activity of the active ingredients in the epidermis within the very first minutes of application. Absorption and effect is optimised further thanks to the physical action of massage. Beating the bumps: massaging the area could help the cream be absorbed quicker into the skin . Dr Susanna Hayter (MB BS BSc pharmacology) is a specialist in aesthetic medicine and clinical director of My Beauty Doctor Ltd where they offer non surgical body contouring and cellulite treatments. 'I'm not at all surprised by the increase in number of people wanting treatment for their cellulite. My clinic has seen an upsurge in women wanting treatment for stubborn fat and cellulite in the last year,' she says. 'Most of them have tried unsuccessfully to treat their cellulite with various creams and brushes but have not seen significant results so they come to me for something more radical. 'Cellulite is disordered fat so it's not as simple as just loosing weight to get rid of it. The problem is lack of lymphatic drainage to any area where there are localised deposits of fat cells and this lack of drainage leads to failure of removal of fluids from the affected tissue resulting in the characteristic peau d'orange (orange peel) appearance. 'With cellulite the fat cells are encapsulated in a connective tissue matrix and to successfully to treat it you need to break down the fibrous matrix but also improve blood supply and lymphatic drainage to the area. 'I don't believe that creams applied to the skin surface have sufficient penetration to start to breakdown this matrix or improve the circulation. 'However anything that stimulates the lymphatic drainage could lead to visible results.' Elle Macpherson Rotating Dry Brush .

"By . Emma Innes . A teenager is being forced to attend an all-boys school because he is dangerous to women - at least if they're pregnant. Bryant Hackett, 14, has been diagnosed with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and has been told by medics he is to avoid close contact with expectant women for the foreseeable future. Although the virus is not causing Bryant to suffer any symptoms, it could be harmful if contracted by a pregnant woman. Bryant Hackett, 14, is not allowed near women who could be pregnant because he has a virus which is dangerous for unborn babies . He is even unable to have any contact with his sister Terri Wooton, 20, who is expecting a baby in a few weeks’ time. Bryant, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, said: ‘I miss my sister a lot and can’t wait until she gives birth. She is due in a few weeks.’ Bryant was diagnosed with the virus in July of last year after a rare strain of hepatitis he believes he picked up while on holiday in Majorca left him with a catalogue of health problems. It caused him to develop liver failure and end up a with a blood platelet count of just four – the normal level is between 150 and 400. He suffered bone marrow failure and had to have two bone marrow transplants which first required him to have chemotherapy to clear his existing bone marrow. He was left with a weakened immune system, which caused him to contract pneumonia which his mother says almost killed him. Bryant (pictured with his mother, Leanne) has cytomegalovirus which is usually harmless in adults but can cause deafness and learning disabilities in unborn babies . Leanne, 36, said: ‘At one point I honestly thought he was going to die. ‘He had to have chemotherapy to get rid of all of his own blood platelets, otherwise they would have clashed with the transplants. ‘Bryant lost all his hair, he was very sick. He is a teenager, and teenage boys usually like to be around girls. CMV is a common virus that is part of the herpes family of viruses. Most people develop few, if any symptoms, when they contract it and many are infected during childhood without knowing it. Once a person has been infected with CMV it stays in their body for life but usually does not cause any problems. It can occasionally reoccur if a person's immune system is weakened, for example, by chemotherapy. If this happens, it can cause problems with vision, ulcers and pneumonia. CMV can also cause serious problems if a woman has her first CMV infection during pregnancy as it can spread to the unborn baby. It is estimated that about one per cent of babies in the UK are born with CMV. Of these, about 10 per cent will have problems such as hearing loss and learning difficulties. The virus is spread through bodily fluids and can be passed on through changing nappies, kissing and sex. Source: NHS Choices . ‘It is a shame he can’t spend time with girls, but I am just so glad he is out of hospital.’ Bryant has been unable to attend school for the past 15 months after he was diagnosed with liver failure in October 2012. After undergoing the bone marrow transplants last year, he spent five months in isolation in the Royal Victoria Infirmary, in Newcastle, receiving chemotherapy. Following his recovery, he had been due to start at a co-ed school. However, after doctors told him he was suffering from CMV, which is harmful to unborn babies, he has been forced to attend a boys-only school instead. CMV is a common virus that is part of the herpes family of viruses. It causes few symptoms in most people and so most do not know they are infected. Once someone has been infected, the virus stays in their body for the rest of their life without usually causing problems. However, it can sometimes cause symptoms if a person has a weakened immune system, for example, if they are having chemotherapy. CMV can also cause serious problems if a . woman becomes infecting during pregnancy as this can lead to hearing . loss and learning difficulties in the baby. Bryant will start at St Aidan’s . Catholic Academy this week, but says he is looking forward to getting . out of the house, despite the lack of girls. He added: ‘It was so boring when I was in hospital. I couldn’t have many visitors, in case I caught an infection. Bryant contracted the virus because he had to have chemotherapy which lowered his immune system. He had the treatment after suffering bone marrow failure. He is pictured when his immune system was weakened . Bryant currently has to avoid his sister, Terri, 20, because she is expecting a baby. He says he really misses her and cannot wait for the baby to be born so he can see her again . ‘It is not great being dangerous to girls, but at least I will be able to spend time with people my own age again.’ A spokeswoman for St Aidan’s Catholic Academy said: ‘We are going to admit Bryant to the school this week. ‘We are happy to support Bryant and his family as he integrates back into full-time education.’","Bryant Hackett, 14, has cytomegalovirus (CMV) which is usually harmless to adults but can cause deafness and learning disabilities in unborn babies .

"By . Penelope Leach . Child psychologist Penelope Leach has been working with families for nearly 40 years. Here, in the final instalment of her new book, Family Breakdown, she describes one of the cruellest consequences of divorce... Before his divorce, Ben wouldn't change his baby daughter's nappies, seldom played with her eight-year-old brother and never once made it to the school carol concert. On top of that, he had an affair with a woman at work. And now? Much to his ex-wife Maggie's fury and disbelief, he's demanding regular access to the children. Unfair: Bitter mothers sometimes force their child to cut their father out . It's not hard to see why women like Maggie can be reluctant to co-operate. Indeed, the lengths to which some parents will go to prevent their ex from keeping in contact with the children are truly shocking and, ultimately, very damaging to the children themselves. When a father (it's usually the father) leaves the family home, some mothers will lie to stop them from seeing the children or speaking to them. A father, hoping to talk to his son, will be told: 'He can't come to the phone - he's in the bath.' To the child: 'No, it wasn't your father. Do you really think he's going to bother phoning?' To the father on doorstep: 'They're not coming out with you; they've gone to their nan's.' To the children: 'You didn't want to go with him and leave me all by myself, did you?' Perhaps cruellest of all, a parent may play on a child's sympathies, making him (or her) feel disloyal for loving the other parent: 'Don't you leave me, too... You're all I've got.' Or: 'We're all right together aren't we? We don't need him.' ""However much a mother may wish it weren't so, her ex is the children’s biological father and should never be airbrushed out of their lives..."" Research shows that children are often so desperate not to hurt the parent they live with that they'll say whatever they know she (it's usually the mother) wants to hear. They may even say they no longer want any contact with Daddy - when actually, they still love him. The parent who has left home, of course, is in a far weaker position than the furious mother. Indeed, a lot of fathers are sufficiently intimidated that contact with their children gradually shrivels and even stops. If a dad insists on seeing them, the mother may eventually realise that she can't continue refusing access without a very good reason. At that point, she may set about producing one. Some women say there's been sexual abuse or domestic violence. They may suggest that the father's environment is unsafe, or that he's a bad influence (alcoholism, drug addiction and mental illness may be mentioned), or that they suspect he'll take the child abroad. Whether such claims are accurate or not, they'll have to be investigated because they're to do with child protection - the family court's principal concern. And although parents no longer get legal aid for any other aspect of their break-up, mothers can get it for this because a child's safety is involved. (A fact, I'm afraid, that's making this type of accusation more common.) Understandably, the father is often outraged. If the mother's accusation has never previously been mentioned, it may seem difficult to understand why anyone takes any notice. However, if there's the least chance that a parent has been abusive, no contact can be allowed until the matter has been investigated. That means the father will have to apply to the court for a contact order. But the date for that hearing may well be months ahead - and until then, he won't be able to see his child. As a result, their relationship will be further damaged. Tread carefully: The psychological damage of warring parents on children can last a lifetime . For children who have been sexually abused by a parent, the psychological damage can last a lifetime. But if a child is falsely led to believe that a loving parent harmed him, that too can cause long-lasting psychological harm. An allegation of sexual abuse can be dismissed, found unproven, even withdrawn - but it cannot be unmade, ruining relationships that never recover. Yet it really doesn't have to be anything like this - even if one parent remains bitterly angry with the other. However much a mother may wish it weren't so, her ex is the children’s biological father and should never be airbrushed out of their lives. The very best way to manage the break-up of a family, with minimal long-term harm to your offspring, is to support the relationships that each of you has with the children. Granted, it's not easy; it may even seem downright impossible. But whatever you're feeling about your ex is irrelevant. He's never going to be an 'ex' to the children. To them he's just Daddy. Some one million children are growing up without fathers in the UK, says a 2013 Centre for Social Justice report . Ideally, you should do all you can to keep your sense of betrayal, loneliness and fury strictly private. Best of all is if you can make a clear separation in your mind between your adult relationship with your ex, and your relationship with him as a parent. If you can manage that, your child will know that the unhappiness he sees and senses is only adult business; the parenting business that is central to his life is still intact. When both parents make an effort to do this, they sometimes find that part of the lonely space left by the broken partnership has been filled with what I call 'mutual parenting'.  This is the best possible gift they can make to their children. The toxic truth: Penelope discusses the affects of divorce on children on ITV's This Morning . Mutual parenting means that they are jointly committed to putting their children's wellbeing first and to protecting them as far as they can from the ill-effects of the family break-up. The most important word in that sentence is 'jointly'. Many mothers say that they put their children first, and many fathers say likewise - but not many of them credit each other with doing so. The most difficult aspect of mutual parenting is that it requires frequent communication, when you'd probably prefer to have nothing whatsoever to do with each other. One way or another, your joint responsibilities will have to include making it possible - and enjoyable - for children to be closely in touch with each parent. If you're having trouble deciding whether you can manage mutual parenting, don't rush. Give yourself time to get over the shock of separation - and then ask yourself: . If the answer to all or most of those is 'yes', then you have the foundations for mutual parenting. Bear in mind that giving equal headspace to the children is more important than being equally hands-on. So there must be give and take - particularly when the father has never had hands-on care of his offspring. This was clearly the case with Mark, who has two girls, aged five and seven, and a boy of nine. Indeed, his ex-wife Jenny was initially very dubious: 'I've never known him put the children ahead of his own wishes,' she said. Co-operate: Try 'mutual parenting' to prevent children getting stuck in the middle of your rows . 'Finding time to spend with them - amid his work and the tennis club - was rare. He really doesn't like family treats or celebrations. In fact, I don't think he's really a family man.' Mark disagreed. His main responsibility, he felt, was to make generous financial arrangements after the divorce. In addition, he planned to play a part by sharing decisions about the children's education and activities. Now that Jenny was a lone parent, he assumed it would also be his responsibility to provide emergency back-up - although 'by throwing my money at it rather than my time'. Meanwhile, he was looking for ways of seeing the children regularly that fit in with his lifestyle. His most successful initiative, he said, was taking them for lessons at the tennis club each weekend, which they very much enjoyed. However, after more than a year, it became clear that mutual parenting wasn't working and Mark and Jenny decided to settle for the next best thing: 'polite parenting'. In polite parenting, there are lesser degrees of contact and communication but parents still protect the children from the worst fall-out from the separation. Some couples draw up amazingly detailed documents, including lists of rules, templates for telephone calls between them, and 'visit logs' which each parent must fill in whenever a child is transferred to the care of the other. In practice, though, these are usually abandoned after a few months. In time, as passions cool, it's not unheard of for polite parenting to become closer to mutual.

"By . John Stevens . The pro-union Better Together campaign has been criticised for a ‘sexist’ advert aimed at winning the support of undecided women voters ahead of the Scottish referendum. Nationalist supporters claimed the video, which features a mother talking to the camera about her concerns about independence, depicts Scots women as ‘daft ditherers’. In the broadcast, first shown on Scottish television on Tuesday night, the woman played by an actress says: ‘there’s only so many hours in the day and there’s so much to weigh up’. The 'No'  campaign has been ridiculed in Scotland after releasing a 'patronising' video urging voters to reject independence . Parodies images of the film have been posted online, showing a 'busy mum' The images mock the message of the official 'Better Together' campaign film . She says that her off-screen husband, ‘Paul’, keeps going on about the referendum and she refers to First Minister Alex Salmond as ‘that guy off the telly’. A spokeswoman for nationalist campaign group Women For Independence said: ‘We think it's disappointing that Better Together decided to portray Scotland's women in this way. ‘The narrative suggests that women who are still making up their minds how to vote don't understand enough about the issues to arrive at an informed decision. That is not our experience. They are thoughtful, intelligent and articulate.’ The video has been mocked online with people nicknaming the woman ‘Patronising BT (Better Together) Lady’ and posting their own spoof versions of the advert. In one the woman is quoted as saying: ‘Maybe I won't even bother voting. It's too much hassle. I'll let the men decide whilst I bake cookies in the kitchen!’ Another Twitter user posted: ‘#PatronisingBTLady leave the kitchen and shape your future. The dour sexist NO camp want to transport us back to fifties. Over my dead body!’ While one added: ‘Trident, foodbanks, unelected Lords? I’ve got a kitchen to clean.’ Better Together said the wording of the advert was drawn from the verbatim comments of women in focus groups and doorstep canvassing. Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown joined forces today in Dundee in a bid to check Alex Salmond's momentum after his crushing win in Monday's live TV debate . Campaign director Blair McDougall said: ‘The key factor for people isn't the love of our country - as both Yes and No voters love Scotland. The key factor is the love of our families.’ He added: ‘The words spoken in the film are taken verbatim from conversations on doorsteps with undecided women voters and from the opinion of women in dozens of focus groups around the country. ‘With so many unanswered questions, more and more of us are coming to the decision that it is just too big a risk to take with our kids' future.’ Women have become a key campaign target for both sides of the campaign. Polls have consistently shown that women are less likely to support independence than men. Last night, pro-union campaigner David Ross sarcastically tweeted: ‘BREAKING: Nationalists don't like Better Together campaign material.’ A group of 130 business leaders yesterday urged voters to reject Scottish independence, saying the case ‘has not been made’. Bosses of firms including Baxters soup, HSBC and The Co-op Bank signed the open letter, which said: ‘We should be proud Scotland is a great place to build businesses and create jobs ... success that has been achieved as an integral part of the UK.’ Meanwhile, past rivals Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown put their differences aside to share the No campaign platform, insisting ‘of course’ they are friends. Mr Darling said the two ‘share exactly the same outlook on the sort of Scotland we’d like to see’.","Video features a mother talking  about her concerns on independence .

He was granted a provisional blue badge to let him park in disabled spaces but when he tried recently to renew it, he was told that because he could walk 20 yards he was not eligible. Scroll down for video . Turned down: Tom Hannah, 73, was told by Fife Council he was not eligible for a disabled blue badge - despite the fact both his legs have been amputated . Mr Hannah, a retired Ministry of Defence employee from Rosyth, Fife, said yesterday: 'Walking is a real struggle. 'I applied for a blue badge last year and they gave me one for a year. When I spoke to them, they said, ""This is a provisional one"" and I said to them, ""What do you expect – the leg to grow back?"" 'I was told I could walk more than 20 yards. They said it more than once. 'It's a struggle. My friend from across the road comes and takes me because when I go out, I take a wheelchair because I don't trust myself not to fall. 'I'm really annoyed and really upset. I was so angry when I was told that I would not be eligible for one because I can walk a short distance with my crutches. 'I couldn't get from my front door to my car.' Mr Hannah was told that the ability to walk 20 yards was part of the assessment for blue badge eligibility. He said: 'Am I disabled or am I not? I've lost both my legs and if I'm not, what else do I need amputated? 'Because of my age I don't get any help from the Government – no disability allowance and I even have to pay for my own road tax because I don't qualify. 'The only concession I have is a blue badge and they're threatening to take it away from me. I'll not be able to go up the street. Upset: The retired Ministry of Defence Employee has 'put himself through hell' to walk and asks 'what else do I need to get amputated' in order to qualify as disabled . 'I put myself through hell to try to walk. I'm ok in the house but when I go out you have no idea. 'You think you're walking on a level surface but when you get a prosthetic leg you have to keep an eye on the road all the time. Your foot will catch and it will trip you over.' Mr Hannah started having problems when he went on a cruise holiday in Norway and felt what he thought was cramp down his right leg. After returning, he visited hospital but even after numerous tests doctors were unable to identify the cause of his problems. Then one day while going upstairs in his home he collapsed with a severe pain down his side. After more tests at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee medics found he had an irregular heartbeat which was causing circulation problems. Mr Hannah said: 'They took my left leg off – it was really painful.' He was later told his right lower leg would also have to be amputated and another prosthetic limb fitted. He said: 'A blue badge is for the disabled. Surely that classes me as disabled?' Fife Council has now told him he will have to go for a mobility assessment with an occupational therapist in an attempt to resolve the situation. Initial applucation: Mr Hannah was granted a provisional blue badge to let him park in disabled spaces but when he tried recently to renew it, he was told that because he could walk 20 yards he was not eligible . Anne Cowan, Fife Council's lead professional for accessible transport and concessions, said all councils had to follow a code of practice issued by Transport Scotland when evaluating blue badge applications. She added: 'This is national practice, not council policy, and the rules laid out in this guidance are very specific. 'Common sense would suggest that he is eligible for a blue badge but the way his mobility was described in his application did not meet the national scheme criteria. 'We explained this to Mr Hannah over the phone and are continuing to discuss the situation with him.'","Tom Hannah, 73, from Rosyth, Fife, had the lower part of both legs removed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The world's oldest egg - belonging to an extinct ostrich-like bird - is expected to raise a staggering £50,000 at auction. The rare item is over 500 years old and is just one of a handful of undamaged eggs left by the extinct elephant bird, once native to the island of Madagascar. At over a foot in length, it's larger than seven ostrich eggs and the equivalent in size to an astonishing 100 hens' eggs. The giant egg belongs to an extinct ostrich-like bird and should raise in the region of £50,000 at auction . Set to be auctioned at Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst, West Sussex, it is thought to be the only one in the world up for private sale. Curator Errol Fuller, who has written several books on rare extinct birds, said: 'The egg of one of these birds is simply a miracle. 'It comes from Madagascar and these birds became extinct in around 1600, so it must be more than 500 years-old. 'There are probably only about 60 or 70 in existence in the world and almost all of them are owned by museums so to see one of for private sale is very rare. 'It is the largest egg ever known - bigger than any known dinosaur egg. Errol Fuller, pictured, said the egg which was laid in Madagascar is at least 500 years old . 'Engineers have calculated that structurally and functionally it is impossible for an egg to be any larger. 'Sometimes the eggs are found buried in the sand semi-fossilised but this one had been used as a water container as it is hollow and was handed down from generation to generation. 'It's much tougher than a chicken egg, but they can still get broken. Thankfully, this one is perfectly intact.' The egg will be part of the 'Evolution Sale' - a sale of specialist natural history artefacts on November 26. Also on sale will be a stuffed 100-year-old extinct passenger pigeon which is expected to sell for between £4,000 and £6,000. Other unusual taxidermy include a tiger's head in a case and a 'unicorn' created from a horse, a narwal tusk and a bear skeleton.","The egg is about one foot long and is the same size of 100 hens' eggs .

"By . Damien Gayle for MailOnline . A self-styled adventurer is to spend a year living on a melting iceberg off the coast of Greenland to try to draw attention to climate change. In spring next year Alex Bellini, 36, will find a suitable iceberg off the north west of Greenland where he will remain until it melts. He hopes his stunt will raise awareness of the impact of global warming, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently warned is 'widespread and consequential'. Scroll down for video . An iceberg is reflected in calm water at the mouth of the Jakobshavns ice fjord near Ilulissat, Greenland,near where Alex Bellini will find an iceberg to spend a year living on to highlight the effects of climate change . Predictions by the World Resources Institute, based on IPCC data, suggest even in a best-case scenario that 24 per cent more of the global population will face shortages of renewable water by the 2080s compared to the 1980s. Mr Bellini, who is from northern Italy but is based in the UK, has already run more than 14,000 miles worth of marathons, and rowed solo across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. But his one-man global warming campaign could be his most-difficult yet. He will live in a Kevlar-reinforced survival capsule provisioned with 661lbs of dried food. He will be mostly alone, but for periods of the year hopes to invite writers and broadcasters to stay to raise awareness. His equipment will be powered by a rowing machine-powered generator, which will allow him to keep in touch with the outside world without contributing to global warming himself. When the iceberg becomes too dangerous to remain on, he will cast off into the ocean, drifting aboard his capsule until he is rescued. He told Motherboard: 'My objective is reporting and investigating, by means of scientific methods, the entire lifetime of an iceberg. I want to prove how the pace of ice-melting has dramatically accelerated over the last decades. 'We’ll also play the symbolic card: the adventure of a man floating adrift on an iceberg will come to represent the condition of the whole humankind going adrift on an endangered planet.' Mr Bellini says his goal is to encourage others to take action as well. In a YouTube video where he outlines his plans he says: 'On the iceberg, I will be generally alone, but for short periods of time I will be meeting with writers, bloggers, environmentalists… . 'I dream that this will become the era of responsibility, where each of us can take on his version of responsibility to try to reverse this trend.' But he said that his aim is not to be labelled as a new kind of environmentalist, telling Adventure Journal: 'I am and will always be an explorer. 'In this new mission I wish to become the bridge between the researchers and the rest of the world, and I hope I will help all those who will follow the adventure understanding the urgent need for action and for a greater sense of responsibility.'","Alex Bellini will find an iceberg in Greenland and live on it until it melts .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greg for MailOnline . A Wyoming police officer has pleaded not guilty to an animal-cruelty charge that alleges a police dog died after he left it in a hot patrol car for several hours. According to an investigator's statement filed in Natrona County Circuit Court, Mills police officer Zachary Miller left the dog, a 10-year-old female black lab named Nyx, in his patrol car for over six hours July 9. 'It's a tragedy,' Mills Mayor Marrolyce Wilson said. Team: Officer Zachary Miller with Nyx, his canine drug detecting dog who had been with the force since 2006 . Tragedy: Nyx died after being left in a hot car for more than six hours by Miller . The car was running, but the air conditioning was off and outside temperatures reached 86 degrees, KCWY News 13 reported. Miller, a four-year veteran of the Mills Police Department, pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charge at a court appearance on Friday, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Nyx was trained to detect drugs and had been with the department since 2006. Miller had been her handler for the past two years,  and the dog lived with his family and went on family vacations. Mills police Chief Bryon Preciado said it's not normal to leave a car running that long. 'I'm not justifying it,' Preciado said. The affidavit states that Miller left the dog inside his car with the windows rolled up, went into the police department about 6 a.m. and did not return to the car until about 12:20 p.m. Police dogs are allowed inside the station, Preciado said. During the time Miller was inside, he was training another officer on patrol-duty procedures. Miller is no longer a training officer, Preciado said. The officer who was with Miller that day will not be disciplined, Preciado said. 'A wonderful dog': Miller has pleaded not guilty to animal cruelty in the death of Nyx, who was 10 years old . Questions: It's unclear why Miller left the dog in the car for such a long period of time; she was allowed into police headquarters . Miller remains employed by the police department but is currently not on active duty, Preciado said. He was suspended for a week with pay starting the day the dog died. 'It was a mistake he's going to have to pay for,' Preciado said. 'He's going to be disciplined through our department.' Miller had never faced disciplinary action by the department before this incident, Preciado said. He was named 'Officer of the Year' in 2013. The dog had assisted Casper Police, Wyoming Highway Patrol, the Division of Criminal Investigation and the Natrona County Sheriff's Office, Preciado said. A plaque or other kind of memorial will be created in the dog's memory at the police department, he said. The dog's body was buried on Miller's property, Preciado said. 'Everyone was hurt by her loss,' he said. Nyx was the department's first and only police dog. The department has suspended its K9 program and is reviewing its policies, Preciado said. Alarms will be installed in the K9 patrol car before the department acquires a new police dog, Preciado said. The alarm will come with a key fob that dog handlers will carry that will alert them when the car gets too hot or too cold. The police department is planning a memorial plaque in the office for K9 officer Nyx. 'She was the best dog I have ever seen in narcotics,' Preciado told Oil City Wyoming. 'She was a wonderful dog.'","Police officer Zachary Miller pleaded not guilty to animal cruelty .

"By . Chris Waugh . Sunderland manager Gus Poyet was delighted by the performance of new £2.5million signing Will Buckley against Manchester United on Sunday. The Black Cats drew 1-1 with Louis van Gaal's side at the Stadium of Light and Poyet was full of praise for a player he previously coached at Brighton before bringing him to the North East during the summer. Buckley was a target for Poyet as soon as he took over the helm at Sunderland - even though the Uruguayan was not convinced the winger would ever make it as a Premier League footballer when he coached him on the south coast. Praise: Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was impressed with Will Buckley's (right) display against Man United . Impressed: Poyet thought Buckley showed his direct ability as a winger against United at the Stadium of Light . Poyet said: 'When I first saw him, no. But he was learning, listening. 'He is very quiet, shy, but with his feet when he is on the pitch and he's got the chance to attack you, he's a nightmare. 'He is confident with the position that we play him, he knows what we want from him. When it's clear, it's supposed to be easy. 'He doesn't need to make too many decisions, apart from doing what he does best and being in position.' Unexpected: Poyet did not think that Buckley would make it as a Premier League player when at Brighton . Sunderland retain an interest in Liverpool forward Fabio Borini.

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet is hoping to spring a surprise during the remaining days of the summer transfer window. Reports from Italy suggest the Black Cats have signed Inter Milan's Argentina international winger Ricky Alvarez on a season-long loan deal, although sources on Wearside were insisting on Thursday morning that was not the case. However, Alvarez is very much on the radar as Poyet attempts to put the finishing touches to his summer rebuilding programme.

I'm confident we'll be doing something. 'You're going to be surprised.' Sunderland have spent much of the summer attempting to lure Liverpool's Fabio Borini back to the Stadium of Light after his successful loan spell last season.

"By . Maarten Meijer . Manchester . United's players have been getting to know new boss Louis van Gaal and . will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial . traits. Here, . Sportsmail has exclusive extracts from Maarten Meijer's explosive new . book on the Dutchman which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at Old . Trafford. They call Louis van Gaal ‘The Iron Tulip’, a moniker that exquisitely sums up his essential Dutch stubborness. The tall, proud figure who is about to take charge of Manchester United believes that the coach is in charge. He will lead with the right state of mind and he expects his players to follow suit. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal give a fascinating talk on the psychology of football . The Iron Tulip: Louis van Gaal firmly believes the coach is in charge and expects his players to follow . All in the mind: For Van Gaal, training is as much about the player's mental framework as it is about tactics . Casting an eye: Van Gaal looks on as United wideman Nani takes part in Monday afternoon's training session . A big noise: Van Gaal, pictured managing Holland at the World Cup this summer, is firm in his coaching beliefs . Let's get physical: Phil Jones and Wayne Rooney do some stretches as the United prepare for the new season . Training is not just about acquiring tactical skills, but also the mental framework that will underline them. He’s always been the same: it was this men tality that brought his success and not the other way round. His first big job as head coach of Dutch giants Ajax came in September 1991, a shock appointment when Leo Beenhakker went to Real Madrid, and the club chose their former youth coach despite a campaign for the return of legend Johan Cruyff. ‘I sat in my car and suddenly I realised “I am technical director of Ajax”. I began sweating profusely,’ Van Gaal revealed in an interview with, of all magazines, Playboy. ‘That feeling lasted for only one minute. Afterwards I never again had that feeling.’ Certainly his players learned in no time that their new manager wouldn’t tolerate anybody who broke the rules. If anybody arrived just a minute late for training, Van Gaal the disciplinarian fined them. If it happened again it was doubled. A third time and it was doubled again. Shock appointment: Van Gaal's first big job came when he was named Ajax head coach in September 1991 . Van Gaal would get irritated over players not putting used towels in the laundry basket in the dressing room. If someone threw his towel elsewhere he could take it home and wash it himself. Another hallmark was that everyone, including the superstars, would lug around the giant cases of equipment and not just the kit man or reserves. Discipline was everything. At press conferences the players invariably appeared in the stiff club suit, with matching tie and shoes. The jacket had to be buttoned up. He fell out with Jan Wouters, the 33-year-old veteran who had been the star of central midfield since Cruyff signed him in 1986; he fell out with Bryan Roy, humiliating the fleet-footed winger in training sessions; he sidelined Johnny  van ’t Schip, who had been part of the furniture for a decade, by  moving him to the right wing until the striker announced he no longer wanted to play there. It wasn’t an instant success. Van Gaal’s Ajax managed just 20 points out of the first 16 games, the  supporters lost confidence and calls from the stands for Cruyff to return were mixed with those for Van Gaal to go. His reaction? ‘I will not change my attitude,’ he said. Discipline: The Manchester United squad will quickly learn that new boss Van Gaal is a strict disciplinarian . His confidence was proved right. By the end of his first season Ajax had won the UEFA Cup. A bright new team of young players, who had emerged through the system when Van Gaal was their youth coach, had begun to take shape. Players who had learned under his wing such as Patrick Kluivert, Marc Overmars, Edgar Davids and Edwin van der Sar went on to win the Champions League in 1995, only failing to retain the trophy when Juventus beat them on penalties a year later. With Van Gaal, there are no half measures. People tend to be grouped by him as either friends or enemies. All smiles: Van Gaal watches on next to a griining Wayne Rooney during a United training session on Saturday . VIDEO United will continue to spend - Woodward . His second . wife Truus once worked as a PR manager and so can offer him help on . polishing his image, but he is neither bothered nor interested. He . says: ‘If I think something unfair is taking place, I react. That has . nothing to do with respect. You can turn it around; the other person has . failed to show respect for me.’ Those who work for him and follow his lead will tell you he is warm and generous with his time and his conversation. But he will cut dead those who take a different path. Years after his first glory days at Ajax - when, during a second spell at the club, he was falling out with star players again but this time without the same success - he was asked if he had ever read the book  I am always right by the Dutch author Willem Frederik Hermans. ‘I know . Hermans, but not that book,’ replied Van Gaal. ‘A catchy title but I . would never say that about myself. I would add the nuance: “I usually am . right”.’ There . is a saying that nobody gets to know what would have happened. That’s . certainly true of Louis van Gaal’s years as a player. He wanted to make it as a star in the Ajax first team; his family wanted him to study as a PE teacher.What’s . certain is that in trying to do both he cost himself the chance of the . sort of star career on the field that would match what he later achieved . as a coach. Helping hand: Van Gaal's second wife worked as a PR manager and can offer him help on polishing his image . Just 17 when he enrolled in the Academy of Physical Education in the Amsterdam suburb of Geuzenveld, he stuck to his studies even when two years later he was spotted by Ajax. They gave him a Fiat 127 to replace his Puch moped, but did little else to make life easy over two seasons. ‘These . were two heavy, hard years,’ said Van Gaal, ‘because I simultaneously . played football and studied to become a PE teacher. ‘But . my game mentality took shape in those years and that still benefits me. You see, playing football well is not enough; you have to want to win.’ Youngster: Van Gaal stuck to his studies even after he was spotted by Dutch giants Ajax in the early 70s . If Ajax formed his football philosophy, his time first studying and then working in schools was  also a major influence. Manchester United’s players will find a bit of coach, a bit of social worker, and a lot of school teacher about their new boss. He says himself that studying in the Academy was where ‘I learned what makes people tick’. Ajax and Dutch manager Rinus Michels, credited as the architect of total football, was one of his role models because he’d also experienced life outside the professional game. Van Gaal said: ‘Michels was a PE teacher . first as well. Players are just like big children. So there really is a . resemblance between being a teacher and being a coach.’ Big influence: United players will find a bit of a coach, social worker and school teacher in Van Gaal . His first taste of the job he dreamed of as manager of his own country ended in failure with a Dutch squad that imploded and failed even to qualify for the World Cup in 2002. Even then, in his own mind, that failure was the fault of the players and not him. ‘Some of the players refused to accept my methods,’ he said. ‘I am who I am and I have my own ways. I’m not going to change and I have no desire to.’ In 2009, when he started work at Bayern Munich and results took time to come, it was reported that he had been heard going round the dressing room insisting: ‘I am like God. I never get ill and I am always right.’ A few months later, Van Gaal put the record straight. ‘I am not God,’ he said. ‘If I were God I would win everything all the time.’ At Old Trafford they will have to get used to that. Assured: During his time in Munich, Van Gaal compared himself to God and insisted he was always right . Adapted from Louis van Gaal by Maarten Meijer, published by Ebury, price £16.99.

"By . David Kent . Crystal Palace have announced the signing of striker Fraizer Campbell from Cardiff. Campbell has joined for an undisclosed fee, putting pen-to-paper on a three-year deal with the London club. The 26-year-old, who came through the youth ranks at Manchester United at the start of his career, won the solitary senior England cap he has to his name in 2012. Happy days: Fraizer Campbell looks in jubilant mood after completing his move to Crystal Palace . Match winner: Palace new boy Campbell celebrates scoring against former side Manchester United . Confirmation: Crystal Palace FC tweeted their delight at signing Campbell from Cardiff . Campbell made his professional debut with Belgian side Royal Antwerp while on loan for the 2006/07 season from United. That stint was a success, as was a spell with Hull the following term, and he subsequently spent time on loan with Tottenham before departing United - for whom he had made a total of just four appearances - to join Sunderland in 2009.

"By . Alex Miller . Mario Balotelli’s £16million transfer from AC Milan to Liverpool has caused plenty of excitement on the red half of Merseyside, and according to industry experts, the Reds have kopped a bargain by paying £14m less than the Italian striker is currently worth. Analysts at Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory have placed ‘market values’ on top players from around Europe based on a wide range of ‘objective’ factors from age and contract expiry date to position, performance data and international experience. The comparison between transfer fees paid by clubs to sign new players and their current market value allows us to assess the best and worst recruitments from a financial perspective. Great value: Experts say Liverpool's purchase of Mario Balotelli for £16m represents excellent value, given that the player's true worth is nearer £30m . Ready for action: Balotelli in training at Liverpool's Melwood training ground ahead of a possible debut at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday . Mario Balotelli (Milan to Liverpool) Paid: £16m Value: £30m (-£14m) Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid to Chelsea) Paid: £32m Value: £40m (-£8m) David Luiz (Chelsea to PSG) Paid: £50m Value: £24m (+£26m) They calculate that Balotelli was worth £30m, based on a market rates for what a buyer should have reasonably paid for him this summer. That is £14m LESS than Liverpool paid for him and explains why manager Brendan Rodgers called the deal ‘outstanding value’. The Balotelli deal represents the best value signing for a Premier League club so far this window from a financial perspective, with Liverpool paying just over half of his transfer value. Jose Mourinho and Chelsea have pulled off the best sale involving a Premier League club so far during this transfer window, by offloading Brazilian defender David Luiz to Paris SG for £50m - £26m more than his transfer valuation of £24m. Good business: Chelsea did very well to get £50m for David Luiz, who is actually worth £24m . Shrewd operator: Jose Mourinho sanctioned the sale of Luiz, which has pocketed Chelsea £26m . Luis Suarez (Liverpool to Barcelona) Paid: £75m Value: £85m (-£10m) Angel di Maria (Real Madrid to Manchester United) Paid: £60m Value: £25m (+£35m) Alexis Sanchez (Barcelona to Arsenal) Paid: £35m Value: £23m (+£12m) Without the attraction of Champions League this season Manchester United appear willing to overpay to ensure they continue to attract the best players. Angel di Maria represents the most over-valued player brought in by a Premier League club. United paid Real Madrid £60m for the versatile Argentinian World Cup star, but is ‘worth’ just £25m - suggesting the club have overpaid by a massive £35m. However the club’s deal for Luke Shaw was close to his market value. The fee of £27m paid to Southampton to secure his services, was just £2.5m over his valuation of £24.5m. Over the odds: The research suggests Man United have paid £35m more for Angel di Maria than his value . Price is right: The research suggests Man United have paid the going rate for Luke Shaw . While Liverpool may have pulled off a coup to bring in Balotelli, it seems the Anfield club sold Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £10m less than his worth. Despite bringing in £75m to the club’s coffers, Suarez’s value was actually £85m. Uncharacteristically, Arsene Wenger appears to have overspent to secure the services of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona. The Chilean winger was brought to the Emirates for £35m, £12m more than his book value - although his winner against Beskitas this week secured Champions League football for the Gunners again this season and will have paid much of that amount back. Other major transfers involving Premier League clubs have seen players move for amounts close to CIES valuations. Everton snapped up Romelu Lukaku for a club-record £28m, £2m less than his value, while Cesc Fabregas joined Chelsea from Barcelona for £26.6m. He was valued at £28.5m.

The 22-year-old England international has been allowed to travel to the London club for tests after Cardiff accepted an £8million offer.

However, the hurricane did prove more troublesome for beachfront homeowners who became inundated with saltwater, and the storm-roiled Pacific knocked out a piling at Malibu Pier. But the attitude was much more cheerful at hotspots like The Wedge in Newport Beach, where crowds egged on bodysurfers brave enough to take on the big surf.  Lifeguards on both sea and shore kept a watchful eye on the crowd. The bold also flocked to Surfrider beach in Malibu, where a surfer died Tuesday after being pulled from the water. It was not clear whether the death was related to the surf or a medical condition. 'It's very hectic, stormy and dangerous, really,' said Scott Bosco, 26, who surfed Seal Beach for an hour but only managed to catch two waves because of the roughness. 'You live for days like this.

'We are pretty careful about who we let in the water,' Lifeguard Capt. Boyd Mickley told KCAL-TV. 'We look everyone over, talk to them briefly and find out what their experience level is. And we will suggest strongly that today's not the day for them to go in.' Above, beachgoers watch large waves crash on the shore at Seal Beach on Tuesday . At the Wedge, a huge crowd watched surfers take on ferocious waves for a second day. Lifeguards dove into the surf there as well to save a person with the help of a rescue boat.

'We look everyone over, talk to them briefly and find out what their experience level is. And we will suggest strongly that today's not the day for them to go in.' The towering waves and rip currents were being produced by swells generated by Hurricane Marie in the Pacific Ocean about 800 miles west of the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California peninsula. Although Marie will likely weaken to tropical storm levels, life-threatening water conditions were expected to continue through Thursday.

Surfers and body borders come out of the ocean after riding big waves off the coast of Newport Beach, California on Wednesday . Along the long arc of Southern California coastline, high surf warnings were posted for Los Angeles County south through Orange County, with lesser beach-hazard advisories down to San Diego and as far northwest as San Luis Obispo County on the state's central coast. The fiercest surf primarily affected south-facing beaches. At one point in Seal Beach, a lifeguard climbed from the beach to the deck of the pier, sprinted to the end and dove in to rescue a swimmer. That man was successfully brought ashore well down the beach. Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdi said the man was OK. Residents of about four blocks of homes along Seal Beach, south of Los Angeles, swept seawater from ground-floor rooms after flooding overnight, and bulldozers reinforced a 6-foot-tall sand berm hastily built to protect shoreline structures.

Resident Jerry Rootlieb points to the high water line on his gate Wednesday,  after heavy flooding in Seal Beach . The berm - a measure normally not needed until winter storms - and the use of pumps prevented more water intrusion during the morning high tide and another test was expected close to midnight. Along the shoreline, firefighters went door to door, dropping off more sandbags for residents and surveying damage after the initial surge that arrived late Tuesday and topped a 2 1/2 foot beach wall, causing flooding in or around the first row of homes. About 100 residences were affected, Concialdi said. 'This is our worst summer storm and I've been here 42 years,' said resident Jerry Rootlieb, who was sweeping out his home on Wednesday.

'What can you do, man? We are just trying to win the war and we're just bringing out water. Water, water, water,' said the Browns' nephew, Hector Brown. The Malibu Pier was closed after seven pilings were knocked loose. State Parks Department official Craig Sap said rangers noticed three more pilings missing on Wednesday. The pier's structural integrity remained sound because of redundancy but people were asked to stay away, he said. A previously closed pier at Port Hueneme in Ventura County also lost pilings.

"By . Sean Gallagher . Swansea got their pre-season campaign back on track with a 3-1 win over Championship side Reading at the Madejski Stadium. A first-half double from Wayne Routledge and Bafétimbi Gomis' second goal for the club was enough for Garry Monk's side to record their third pre-season win, with Nick Blackman's superb volley a mere consolation for the Royals. After losing to Bournemouth on Friday night, the Swans fielded a near full-strength side this time around and the quality shone through in a close first half. Celebrations: Bony, Sigurdsson and Routledge celebrate Swansea's opening goal against Reading . Stand-off: Nick Blackman scored a superb volley in his side's friendly defeat to Swansea . The Premier League side should have taken the lead as early as the 14th minute after they were awarded a penalty when Sean Morrison handled inside the area, despite the ball being bundled in at the back post. Reading: McCarthy (Federici 45), Gunter (c), Pearce, Morrison, Progrebnyak, Obita, Hector (Kuhl 70) Akpan (Tshibola 72), Edwards (Tanner 68), Blackman, Taylor (Cummings 72). Swansea: Fabianski, Tiendalli (Rangel 90), Williams (c), Bartley, Taylor, Ki, Shelvey, Gomis, Sigurdsson, Routledge (Dyer 66), Bony (Montero 66). Goals: Routledge 23 & 25, Gomis 65. Blackman 43 . Attendance: 5,421 . Wilfried Bony stepped up to take the spot-kick but fired the ball against the crossbar as the game remained goalless. Gomis then went close eight minutes later as Dwight Tiendalli found the former Lyon man in the box, but Alex McCarthy got down well to put the ball out for a corner. The visitors weren't to be denied though as they scored a quick-fire double to put them firmly in the ascendancy. Summer signing Gylfi Sigurdsson teed up Bony whose threaded pass found Routledge who made no mistake inside the area to put  Swansea ahead on 23 minutes. Just a couple of minutes later it was two after Sigurdsson and Bony were again heavily involved in the build-up, with Routledge providing the decisive finish for his and his side's second goal. The Royals then went close to halving the deficit as Michael Hector's audacious 25-yard strike was palmed away by Lukasz Fabianski on 34 minutes. Power: Bony looked lively for the Premier League side while also missing a penalty in the first half . The Championship side did pull one back just before the interval though as Blackman's 30-yard wonder strike flew into the back of the net to give the Royals renewed hope. Swansea looked to extend their advantage after the break with goalscorer Routledge nearly turning provider as Gomis struck the post from 20 yards out. On 65 minutes Gomis did restore Swansea's two-goal advantage though, in turn notching his second goal for the club after racing through on goal and lobbing Adam Federici to make it 3-1. Both sides made changes aplenty as the game drew to a close after a entertaining friendly in Berkshire. Swansea play Villarreal in their final pre-season fixture before they travel to Manchester United on the opening day of the Premier League season.

"By . Gerri Peev . They are the ‘discontented’ and ‘resentful’ English. Those who identify themselves as English rather than British are more likely to be Eurosceptic and suspicious of the Scots. Most of them, who live in England, believe the EU is a ‘bad thing’, with 58 per cent saying they would vote to leave. Seven out of ten who believe they are English and not British, would vote to leave the EU in a referendum. Britishness is also declining as a sense of identity for many in England, the Future of England Survey run by the IPPR think tank and Cardiff and Edinburgh universities, found. While people in England have a strong sense of dual identity, they are increasingly saying they are English rather than British. Those who sees themselves as English rather than British are more likely to be sceptical about the EU, according to new research . The results, from a poll of over 3,500 people living in England will cause jitters in Downing Street. David Cameron is supporting the campaign to keep the union ahead of a Scottish vote on independence next year. There is also strong link between Euroscepticism and concerns over the ‘unfairness’ of devolution. Those who oppose membership of the EU or have concerns are also more likely to believe that Scotland ‘gets more than its fair share of public spending’ (72 per cent) and that Scottish MPs should be banned from voting on laws that only affect England (91 per cent). Yet just 30 per cent of the English want Scotland to become an independent country, with 49 per cent wanting it to stay in the union. The survey also showed that respondents named UKIP as the party that is best placed to ‘stand up for English interests’.

Attitudes towards England’s two unions are related and two sides of the same coin of English discontent.’ He added that mainstream parties had to ‘embrace Englishness, take it seriously, and find new ways of giving it political expression. 'Labour and progressive politics need to recognise that Englishness is not something to be feared or abandoned to those on the margins of right wing politics.

"By . Phil Blanche, Press Association Sport . Swansea manager Garry Monk insists summer signing Bafetimbi Gomis has been signed to play with and put pressure on Wilfried Bony - not replace him. Gomis joined Swansea on a four-year contract from Lyon in June and has plenty of pedigree having scored over 140 goals in French football and won 12 caps for France. The 29-year-old's arrival caused speculation about the possible departure of Bony, who scored 25 goals last season during an excellent first campaign in England, and the frontman was linked to Liverpool and Tottenham after impressing for the Ivory Coast at the World Cup in Brazil. Signing: Garry Monk said Bafetimbi Gomnis was brought to the club to compete with Wilfried Bony . But Monk is adamant the pair can thrive together after free transfer Gomis claimed his first goal in English football on Tuesday night to ease Swansea into the third round of the Capital One Cup. 'It's definitely not the case that he's his replacement,' Monk said about Gomis, whose strike put paid to the cup ambitions of Championship outfit Rotherham. 'I don't think it's about pressure on Bony. 'Through the season we'll see different things: they'll play as lone strikers, they'll play as a pair, use them in different ways. Transfer: Monk said he is not worried about Bony's future and no bids have been made for the Ivorian striker . 'It's not a competition between them but obviously we want them all to push each other and every striker will want to be top scorer. 'But it's about them working together which they've done very well in pre-season and been great with each other on the training field.' Monk insists Swansea have received no offers for Bony with the transfer deadline now only five days away. 'We haven't had one offer for Bony.

'If someone comes in with an offer, that's the only time you think about it. 'It's not over until the window closes and that's with all of our players, an offer could come in for any of them.

"By . Simon Jones for MailOnline . Arsenal have enquired about Torino forward Alessio Cerci but face competition from Southampton. Manager Ronald Koeman is making a late push to bring extra quality into his side after a couple of promising performances but poor results in the Premier League. Italy striker Cerci has been a target for Everton and Atlletico Madrid this summer but he was reluctant to move to Goodison Park while Atletico thought he was too expensive at £15million. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger refuse to rule out buying a striker . Wanted man: Arsenal and Southampton are battling for the signature of Torino striker Alessio Cerci . Injury: Olivier Giroud could be out for three months so the Gunners are in the hunt for a new frontman . Koeman has already enquired about a deal for Atletico defender Toby Alderweireld and midfielder Jordy Clasie at Feyenoord but wants another option in attack. Southampton have enquired about Nathan Redmond at Norwich and bid for Andros Townsend at Tottenham but Cerci would be a real coup if they could tempt him to the south coast. However, Arsenal would be the player's preference. The Gunners are discussing options as they weigh up the extent of Olivier Giroud's injury. They have missed out on Olympiacos defender Kostas Manolas who had a medical at Roma this morning before agreeing terms. Roma see him as a replacement for Mehdi Benatia, who is joining Bayern Munich after the clubs agreed a fee of around £27m on Tuesday morning. VIDEO Giroud injury scare for Wenger . Impressed: Arsene Wenger is keen on Cerci, who was part of Italy's World Cup squad in Brazil . McArthur involved in tug-of-war . Leicester City have had a £5million bid for James McArthur rejected by Wigan as Burnley prepare a new offer of their own. The 26-year-old is happy at Wigan and pivotal to Uwe Rosler's plans despite the £4m signing of Adam Forshaw from Brentford. However, Burnley manager Sean Dyche is keen to see if an improved bid can tempt Wigan into a sale. Crystal Palace and Cardiff also have an interest in McArthur. Transfer tussle: James McArthur is a target for both Leicester and Burnley before the transfer window closes . Dyche will give debuts to Matt Gilks, Steven Reid and Stephen Ward at Sheffield Wednesday on Tuesday night as he looks to test his squad ahead of their weekend clash with Manchester United. However, it is clear to Dyche that he needs two or three more players before Monday and he would prefer British-based players with Premier League experience if possible. Wigan are also looking to bring in another defender and are close to signing a striker. Dawson set to depart as Tottenham close in on Fazio . Michael Dawson is due to have a medical ahead of his proposed £3.5million move to Hull City. The 30-year-old knew his chances were limited at Tottenham who will now complete the signing of Federico Fazio from Sevilla for £8m. Tottenham have been linked with a move for Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot but they will not be making a move for the 19-year-old. No go: Tottenham will not be making a move for highly-rated PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot (left) Clough wants Maguire reunion . Sheffield United have asked to take Harry Maguire back on loan from Hull. Manager Nigel Clough has also made enquiries to Leeds United about defender Jason Pearce but thinks that will prove beyond their budget. Clough said: 'We’d always be open to the prospect of Harry coming back if the chance arose. It might be interesting to see how things develop with (Michael) Dawson and also, I would imagine, how they do in Europe and also the League Cup.' Talking to the South Yorkshire Times, Clough added: 'We know (City manager) Steve Bruce well. He kicked me enough times when we were both players and get along.' Ibe looks to follow in Sterling's footsteps via loan move . Derby County are poised to sign Liverpool's highly-rated Jordon Ibe . Bolton and numerous other Championship sides have been keen to take the teenager on loan but Liverpool trust Steve McClaren in the way he helps develop their players. Andre Wisdom improved before joining West Brom and Ibe, tipped to follow a similar path to Raheem Sterling, is expected to make an impression on Liverpool's first team next season. Championship switch: After impressing at Birmingham last season, Jordon Ibe is set to sign for Derby on loan . Ruiz too costly for Werder . The proposed transfer of Fulham forward Bryan Ruiz to Werder Bremen is off after the German club tightened their purse strings. General manager Thomas Eichin revealed: 'Actually it's impossible to sign Bryan Ruiz. The club is determined to keep up with the financial consolidation and get closer to achieving a black zero.' Talking to German publication Kreiszeitung Syke, he added: 'That is why we are not talking about signing new players, we are just out for further departures.' Bremen manager Robin Dutt added: 'It's no real news to me as we did not have money yesterday, we have no money now and we will likely have no money tomorrow.' Holloway looks to capitalise on Blackpool uncertainty . Ian Holloway is bringing Angel Martinez to Millwall. The manager knows the 28-year-old from his time at Blackpool where he made 62 appearances but, despite being offered a new deal by Jose Riga, former Spain U21 midfielder Martinez decided to keep his options open and is now poised to sign for  Millwall. Blackpool coach Riga has held talks with chairman Karl Oyston as he wants more help building a competitive squad. The Championship strugglers have signed 18 players this summer, with more likely to follow. Oyston is back from his family holiday and Riga said: 'I will never complain about my players but the situation has dictated who we sign. It’s more and more difficult now to get my original targets in. They aren’t sat around waiting for Blackpool. It was always going to be difficult to get these players and it’s even more difficult now.' El Hadji Diouf and former Arsenal winger Quincy Owusu-Abeyie have been training at the club lately. New faces in: Former Arsenal winger Quincy Owusu-Abeyie (left) is currently training at Blackpool . Benitez looking elsewhere after Lucas rejection . Rafa Benitez is considering Espanyol defensive midfielder David Lopez after Liverpool blocked a loan move for Lucas Leiva. Liverpool want a permanent deal and value the Brazilian at £6m to £8m while Napoli would prefer a loan partly to ensure Lucas is also fully recovered from his knee trouble. Benitez has coolled his interest in Marouane Fellaini even though the Belgian will not be out for too long with his ankle injury. Lopez is a stylish 6ft 1in midfielder who has impressed La Liga observers in the past year but may still be short of the quality Napoli really need. Tottenham's Sandro is liked by Benitez but too expensive at this stage. Clayton heads to Denmark . Max Clayton has taken the unusual step of going on trial at FC Midtjylland. The England U20 striker has already spent time this summer with Sunderland, Wolves and Bolton. The Danish side have taken the 20-year-old on trial after striker Morten Duncan Rasmussen was ruled out for up to two months with a ligament injury. Clayton is out of contract having rejected Crewe's offer of a three-year deal which has been on the table since November. Odd move: Max Clayton is going on trial at FC Midtjylland but Andreas Cornelius will not be joining Newcastle . Newcastle have no interest in former Cardiff striker Andreas Cornelius. Although club scouts were present at a recent FC Copenhagen game in which the 21-year-old played, they will not be pursuing the 6ft 4ins striker who controversially cost Cardiff £8m and played only eight games. Meanwhile, Hatem Ben Arfa played and scored for Newcastle reserves in their 5-2 win over Reading on Monday at Whitley Park. Alan Pardew and club managing director Lee Charnley were among the 400 spectators keen to see how the French midfielder, who is available for sale, shaped up. Should Neil Warnock arrive as Crystal Palace manager, he remains keen on Sunderland striker Connor Wickham. The England U21 forward was an option for Tony Pulis prior to his departure. Sunderland will listen to offers as Wickham is not signing a new contract and has a year left. They want £8million as West Ham found out and are continuing their own search for a new striker.","Arsene Wenger keen on Italian striker after Giroud injury .

"By . Jenny Hope . Rash: A preservative commonly used in beauty products, such as a product in L'Oreal's Revitalift range, may be behind a spike in skin allergies . Everyday beauty and cleaning products are being blamed for an epidemic of skin allergies. Preservatives used in Nivea skin lotion, some L’Oreal creams and Wet Ones cleaning wipes are being linked to an outbreak of acute allergic contact dermatitis, mostly in women over 40. The ingredients – MI and MCI – are also found in mascara, shower gels and washing up liquids. Dermatologists say there has been a surge in allergic reactions  –including facial swelling, itching, hives and redness – caused by exposure to the preservatives. Dr John McFadden, consultant dermatologist at St Thomas’ Hospital, London, is urging the cosmetics industry to take action. He said: ‘We are in the midst of an outbreak of allergy which we have not seen before in terms of scale in our lifetime. ‘Many of our patients have suffered acute dermatitis with redness and swelling of the face. ‘I would ask the cosmetics industry not to wait for legislation but to get on and address the problem before the situation gets worse.’ Cases identified by Dr McFadden’s team at St John’s Institute for Dermatology have gone from one in 2010 to 33 in 2012. ‘Sources of exposure were diverse, including moist tissue wipes, cleaners, toners, shower gel, shave foam, mascara, hair products and washing up liquid,’ his report found. A team at the Leeds Centre for Dermatology also discovered a sharp rise of 6.2 per cent in sensitivity in contact allergy to the ingredients over the past three years. They suspect the legal limit of 0.01 per cent of MI in personal care products is too high. Specialists presenting research to the British Association of Dermatologists’ conference in Liverpool this week say the levels should be cut further, or eliminated. In the US, the American Contact Dermatitis Society named MI ‘contact allergen of the year’ for 2013 to draw attention to its potential for triggering reactions. David Orton, president of the British Society of Cutaneous Allergy, said: ‘Across the large patch test centres in the UK, data suggest that rates of allergy to these two preservatives are now nearing 10 per cent – and in some cases higher – this is clearly far too high and is an unacceptable situation.‘The last time a preservative had this type of effect it was banned by the EU.’ But Dr Emma Meredith, head of scientific and technical services at the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association, said patch testing was an important way of seeing if an individual reacts to allergens. Wet Ones anti-bacterial wipes contain the MI and MCI preservatives, which can cause redness, itching and hives . She said maximum levels of the preservatives allowed in products were restricted by law to 0.01 per cent of MI and 0.0015 per cent MCI. Dr Meredith added: ‘If there is a positive reaction to a patch test it does not necessarily mean a reaction will occur on exposure to a cosmetic product, and the small amounts legally allowed.’ The ingredients – full names  Methylisothiazolinone (MI) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone/Methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) – have been used since the 1980s in wall paints and have more recently been used in other manufacturing. Products that contain the ingredients include Nivea body lotion and facial cleaning wipes, Wet Ones, Piz Buin 1 Day Long Lotion and L’Oréal Revitalift Laser Renew moisturiser. Wet Ones, L’Oreal and Piz Buin insist their products are safe.","Preservatives used in widely-used products may be behind rise in allergies .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Threats: Five-year-old Mia Talerico has been targetetd by an internet troll, threatening to kill the Good Luck Charlie star . Los Angeles Police are today hunting an internet troll who has made death threats to the five-year-old star of the Disney series Good Luck Charlie. In a series of messages posted on Mia Talerico's Instagram account, the suspect has threatened to kill the child star, adding she 'deserves to die'. Mia, who plays Charlie Duncan in the show, began receiving the threatening messages last month, reported TMZ.com. The account is managed by the five-year-old's mother Claire Talerico. According to police documents obtained by the site, the suspect posted the first message: 'Die Mia, F***ing Die in hell! Kill yourself, you deserve to die.' The suspect then posted another message, which included a picture of Mia's head with a bloody fist covering it, with the message: 'Yes, kill you stupid b**ch.' The LAPD are said to be taking the matter seriously, after Mrs Talerico contacted Disney security. The force is understood to have assigned their Threat Management Unit to the case, launching a full investigation to track the suspect. Mia who plays the lead role of Charlotte (Charlie) Duncan in the Disney show, first started filming for her role when she was eleven months old. Good Luck Charlie will come to an end after four series, later this month. Investigation: Mia first received the death threats on her Instagram account last month. Her mother Claire Talerico, who manages the account, reported the threats to Disney's security.

"By . Martyn Ziegler . Germany will wait until the very last minute before deciding whether to withdraw Munich's rival bid against Wembley to stage the final of Euro 2020. The German Football Association (DFB) is also planning a bid to host the entire Euro 2024 tournament and is considering dropping its 2020 bid to boost its chances. DFB president Wolfgang Niersbach has disclosed however that they will wait until the day of the vote on September 19 before deciding whether to pull out of the 2020 race and settle for hosting group games instead. Change of heart? World Cup winner Germany are considering a U-turn on their bid to host Euro 2020 final . Niersbach told German newspaper Die Welt: 'There are 19 cities in the race, and we are very confident that Munich is among the 13 places. We will keep our position until the date of decision. What happens then is open.' 'I can confirm that it is our great ambition for the entire Euro 2024 be played in Germany only,' Niersbach added. 'We need no new stadiums for 2024, that is crucial. The investment that was needed before the 2006 World Cup will not be necessary.' He also dismissed there being a potential conflict of interest with a possible German bid for the summer Olympics in the same year. 'We are very supportive,' Niersbach said: 'There is no competition and we are not competitors.'

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and Michael Zennie . Al and Betty Perry celebrate their 47th wedding anniversary this week. But neither one of them would have lived to see it, if a quick-thinking police officer hadn't come to their aid. The couple were driving down the highway near Tofield in Alberta, Canada, Saturday, when - from out of nowhere - a bolt of lightning struck their truck. Video from the incredible moment was captured on a surveillance camera from a nearby warehouse and broadcast by CTV News. The cab instantly filled with smoke as the electronics in the truck went haywire. The locked stopped working, the airbags deployed and Mr and Mrs Perry couldn't open the door. Scroll down for video . This is the heart-stopping moment that Al and Betty Perry were hit by a lightning bolt as they drove down the highway in Alberta, Canada. Their truck was instantly engulfed in flames . The lightning strike was captured by the surveillance camera on a nearby factory. The cab filled with smoke and all the electronics were fried . 'It’s an awful feeling to have,' Mr Perry told CTV. 'I saw our lives passing before my eyes.. 'It sounded like a sonic boom,' he added. 'I turned my body and put my two feet up . and tried to kick the window out. I don’t know how many . times I tried.' In the footage, the couple's car is seen driving along a road next to power lines and under stormy skies. Lightning suddenly strikes the truck, and a halo of flames can be seen engulfing the vehicle as it continues down the road. Mr Perry said he feared their truck would become a 'coffin' and added that he was concerned for his wife because she was recovering from a stroke. Shocking: The truck began to light on fire around Mr and Mrs Perry and the cab filled with smoke . Impact: Potholes mark the road surface at the points where the lightning made contact . Lucky escape: Al and Betty Perry thought they would be overcome by smoke after their truck was hit . Fortunately, a police officer who had been driving behind them was able to break into the vehicle and help the couple to safety. While the couple, who celebrated their 47th wedding anniversary just days after the strike, were given a clean bill of health by doctors, their truck didn't fare so well. All of the air bags inside it had gone off, and the strike and flames had melted sections of the vehicle. Two deep potholes also mark the road at the point where the lightning made contact. Constable Brian Jamont broke the window in the Perrys' truck and allowed them to escape .","Strike engulfed vehicle with flames and trapped husband and wife inside .

"By . Ashley Clements for MailOnline . Follow @@Ashley_Clements . Follow all the movers and shakers here . Lewis Holtby has agreed to join Hamburg on a season-long loan. Holtby signed for Spurs in January 2013 from Schalke but has struggled to establish himself in the starting line-up at White Hart Lane. A six-month loan spell at Fulham last term proved unsuccessful as the Cottagers were relegated to the Championship and manager Felix Magath criticised the 23-year-old's attitude. All smiles: Lewis Holtby poses in the Hamburg shirt after completing his loan move to the German side . Nearly there:  Holtby (above) pictured ahead of his medical with Bundesliga side Hamburg . German experience: Holtby has been frustrated by a lack of first-team opportunities at Tottenham . Mauricio Pochettino's arrival as Spurs head coach offered renewed hope for the midfielder, but, despite a promising pre-season, Holtby has not started any of the club's three Barclays Premier League matches so far. Holtby has scored one goal for Tottenham in 25 league appearances. Hamburg's director of sport Dietmar Beiersdorfer told hsv.de: 'Lewis has great passing ability and he is going to do us good with his creativity. 'He's just 23 but he already has a great deal of experience in the Bundesliga, the Premier League as well as in Europe and he should now bring that experience here with him.'

"By . Sean Gallagher for MailOnline . Watford have appointed former Brighton boss Oscar Garcia as their new head coach. The Hornets moved quickly to appoint the 41-year-old following the resignation of Beppe Sannino on Sunday. Garcia spent a season at the Seagulls before departing in May, leading them to the Championship play-offs. Warm welcome: Watford have pulled off a real coup in capturing highly-rated manager Oscar Garcia . Impressive: Garcia led Brighton to the Championship play-offs last season . In the summer he returned to former side Maccabi Tel Aviv, but due to security concerns in Israel he resigned last week. However, it has not taken him long to make his return to the game, as he looks to build on the success he achieved at the Amex last season. He also reportedly turned down the manager's job at Leeds to become the new Hornets boss. Shortlived: Garcia left Maccabi Tel Aviv due to the current security situation in Israel . A club statement read: 'Watford Football Club is delighted to confirm the appointment of Oscar Garcia as Head Coach, the Hornets having won the race against several high-profile English clubs to secure his services. 'Oscar's recent Championship experience, taking Brighton & Hove Albion into last season's Championship promotion play-offs, was a key factor in his appointment.' Watford sit second in the Championship following a impressive start to the season, with 12 points out of a possible 15, with Garcia's former employers sitting firmly poised in mid-table with seven points from their first five games.","The 41-year-old is Beppe Sannino's successor at Watford .

"By . Jenny Awford . Shenaz Ahmed was left with horrific head injuries in a go-karting accident which has left her paralysed from the neck down . A woman who was ‘scalped’ in a horrific go-karting accident has been named as 48-year-old mother Shenaz Ahmed. Mrs Ahmed suffered ‘traumatic’ head injuries which have left her paralysed from the neck down after her hair became entangled in the engine of a kart at an indoor race track. Her head was snapped back and she suffered horrific wounds to her scalp during the family night out with her husband and two children, aged eight and 11. Last night, a source close to the family described the scene at The Garage leisure centre in  Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, as ‘like something out of a horror story’. They added: ‘Her scalp was ripped off and became wrapped around the axle of the wheel. ‘There were piercing screams and the men who worked at the leisure centre came running over. I had to hold her head because her neck had been snapped.’ The source said Mrs Ahmed’s young children had suffered nightmares since the accident last Wednesday. It is expected she will be in hospital for six months and may not work again. The source said the family was speaking to lawyers and would seek compensation of at least £500,000. They claimed Mrs Ahmed, of Cumnock, Ayrshire, was not told to tuck her hair in and that her helmet was not fastened correctly, so came off in the accident. ‘I’m just worried that this will happen to someone else,’ the source said. Mrs Ahmed, who runs a property business covering the whole of Scotland, was taken to Crosshouse Hospital, near Kilmarnock, after the incident at 8.20pm. She was later transferred to the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, which has a specialist unit for head injuries. Surgeons have already performed a successful procedure to reattach her scalp. The accident happened at The Garage leisure centre in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire last week . The source said: ‘She has had one operation on her scalp, which went very well. She is paralysed from the neck down but is still talking. ‘At the moment, her neck is being held in place with pins. We are still hoping for the best.’ Go-karts intended for the general public are often limited to speeds of around 16mph. Most karts have a petrol engine mounted behind the driver which powers the vehicle’s rear wheels. Speaking to the Scottish Daily Mail on Sunday, Carol Blanchard, secretary of the Association of Scottish Karting Clubs, said: ‘This type of accident is very unusual in Scotland. Our clubs all have to comply with the national health and safety standards set by the Motorsports Association. ‘Privately run tracks like these do not have the same nationally enforced rules. There are only four certified tracks in the whole of Scotland which are overseen by the national guidelines.’ Mrs Ahmed is being treated at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow and may be in hospital for months . A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde last night confirmed that Mrs Ahmed was in a serious but stable condition. An East Ayrshire Council spokesman said: ‘Senior officers from environmental health have conducted a thorough investigation of the site. They will now present a report to the procurator fiscal.’ Douglas Cunningham, the manager of The Garage, said: ‘As there is an ongoing health and safety investigation, I feel it would be inappropriate to comment further.’ In 2012, a woman in Indiana lost more than half of her scalp in a similar accident after her hair got caught in the axle of a go-kart at Whiteland Raceway Park in Indianapolis. Shelbi Crouch also suffered skull fractures and facial paralysis. In 2009, 18-year-old Suzanne Cornwell was strangled when her scarf was caught in the engine of a go-kart at Peterborough Raceway Ltd in Cambridgeshire. Peterborough Raceway Ltd and its then manager Paul Shinn both pleaded guilty to safety breaches.The company was fined £8,500 and Shinn £1,700.","Shenaz Ahmed's hair became tangled in engine during family night out .
