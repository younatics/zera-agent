"By . Luke Salkeld . John Dunn was found safely by his wife Rosemary who used the MindMe device to track him down . A wife has spoken of her relief after a ‘tracking’ device worn by her husband, who suffers from dementia, saved his life. John Dunn, 73, went missing on Christmas Day during a family coastal walk while the couple were on holiday. Unable to locate him, his worried wife Rosemary used the new gadget to track him down and get him to safety. The ‘MindMe’ locating device was worn around Mr Dunn’s neck and sent information about his location to a control centre almost 100 miles away. They then contacted a local volunteer ambulance worker who had joined the search where to find Mr Dunn, who was found on a farm track, west of Durdle Door in Dorset, near to where the couple had rented a cottage. Mr Dunn, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease six months ago, was said to be in a distressed state, was stuck in mud, and had suffered cuts as he tried to get over a barbed wire fence. He was airlifted to Dorset County Hospital suffering from the early signs of hypothermia, but was successfully treated. Mrs Dunn said afterwards: ‘If John hadn’t been wearing the device around his neck, it would have been very difficult to locate him. ‘I panicked as soon as I realised that John was missing. It was surprising how far he got in such a short space of time.’ Mindme is a locating device that can attach to a user’s house keys, or simply be placed in a pocket, or hung around the neck. It is monitored by Chichester Careline, which is run by Chichester District Council, and supports vulnerable people 24 hours a day, every day of the year. The device, which has already helped to save a number of lives, is a small GPS locator. If a person becomes lost or disorientated, they can be located through a dedicated website by their family, or Chichester Careline. The device sends details of its location to the website every four minutes, and is thought to be the smallest GPS locating device in this country. The 'MindMe' locating device was worn . around Mr Dunn’s neck and sent information about his location to a . control centre almost 100 miles away . Mrs Dunn, 62, from Midhurst, West Sussex, added: ‘I cannot explain how much of a relief it is to know that when you have lost someone there is a way of finding them again. ‘If it hadn’t been for the people helping us, I dread to think what would have happened.’ She continued: ‘The device assists us on a regular basis. ‘If I’m sorting the washing out upstairs and John happens to leave the house for a walk, I know that I will be able to locate him if he doesn’t return. ‘On another occasion, John asked if he could wait for me while I popped into a shop for two minutes. ‘When I returned, John had walked off. However, I was able to call Chichester Careline, who told me exactly where I could find him. ‘The device gives John his freedom and provides me with the reassurance that I can find him if he wanders. ‘It is absolutely invaluable and I wouldn’t be without it. Knowing what a difference the device has made to us, I now want to make sure that others in a similar position are aware that this is available.’ A new version has been created which comes with a button allowing the user to speak directly to Chichester Careline. Cllr Eileen Lintill, Cabinet Member for Wellbeing and Community Services at Chichester District Council, said: ‘The device helps to give freedom to those with dementia, and reassurance to their families 24 hours a day, every day of the year.’ She added: ‘We are delighted that our Mindme device helped to locate John and that he is now fully recovered.’ Chichester Careline is the only centre in the country monitoring the devices. They are able to locate the person if they become lost - regardless of where they are in Europe as long as they have a mobile network. Information on the location of the person will only be provided to the carer or family once a series of security checks have been passed.","John Dunn went missing on Christmas day during family walk .

She gave birth to their daughter at the turn of the New Year, and last week was seen sharing parenting duties with her mother Sue, near the young family's home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire. The grown-ups took turns to push the baby and walk the pet dog and also stopped to look in a toy shop in the high street. The new mother was said to have been keen to start a family more than 16 years after she was convicted of shaking eight-month-old Matthew Eappen to death in Boston, Massachusetts. At the time she was 19 and working for the Eappen family as a nanny on her gap year. She was jailed for 15 years in 1997 after being found guilty of second degree murder. But her conviction was later reduced to involuntary manslaughter on appeal and she served 279 days. Woodward, originally from Wirral, Merseyside, has always maintained her innocence and her claims were backed by experts. She kept quiet about her pregnancy but has previously spoken about people's reaction to any news she might be expecting. She previously told the Daily Mail: 'I know there are some people waiting for me to have a baby so they can say nasty things. The pair look in a toy shop.

"By . Luke Salkeld . A pair of middle-aged siblings who live in separate wings of a mansion dating back to the 12th century have squabbled their way into a criminal court. The feud between the brother and sister, who no longer speak, is said to have escalated until Philip Baden Watkins smashed a window in his sister’s side of Flaxley Abbey. Stroud magistrates’ court heard on Monday that the married 47-year-old father of two ‘snapped’ while coming home one night and attacked some of his own property before crossing the garden to the part of the abbey belonging to his sister, Lynn Zijlmans, 45. Calm: Flaxley Abbey in the Forest of Dean, where the siblings live in separate wings . She was put ‘in fear of her life’ when he then smashed one of her windows in the Grade I listed property near Blaisdon, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. It is not clear precisely what started the dispute between the two siblings, whose house was first built as a monastery and substantially rebuilt in the 18th century. But it is thought that it was at least aggravated by the planned sale of a business they own together, which is thought to be a construction and lettings company. Appearing for Watkins, Jennifer Stetson said of the siblings’ relationship that: ‘To say it is acrimonious is an understatement. [Watkins] tells me difficulties became more acute with the approach of his sister and perhaps her wish to sabotage the sale.’ Prosecuting, Karen Grant told the court that Watkins ‘is in business with his sister and they live in separate wings. ‘It is a large property. It appears there have been difficulties and they no longer speak. They were in business but it is being sold.’ Referring to Watkins’s rampage, she said: ‘The defendant returned home with his wife and family on the night in question, and he smashed up his own post box. Case: Stroud magistrates' court heard on Monday that Philip Baden Watkins father of two ¿snapped¿ while coming home one night . ‘Then, witnessed by his sister, he damaged a fence. ‘He walked across the garden to her wing. She feared for her safety and he smashed  a window.’ Miss Stetson, for Watkins, said that he had ‘snapped’ under pressure and done something that was out of character. ‘He deeply regrets his actions,’ she added. ‘It is a very sad situation.’ Watkins pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal damage at the property, which was left to the pair by their grandfather, the industrialist Fred Watkins, who bought it in 1960. The house was originally a Cistercian monastery founded in around 1148 by the second Earl of Hereford. After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s it was given to Sir William Kingston, who had been the Constable of the Tower of London and supervised the execution of Anne Boleyn. District Judge Joti Bopa-Rai told Watkins: ‘It’s a shame you have to come before a court at your age. ‘Bearing in mind there is acrimony, I will give you a 24-month conditional discharge.’ Watkins was also ordered to pay £85 towards prosecution costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Neither of the siblings could be reached for comment yesterday.","Philip Baden Watkins, 47, vandalised Flaxley Abbey in the Forest of Dean .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Being such a huge golf fan, and living so close to the site of The Open, John Singleton planned to spend the next few days working as a volunteer at The Royal Liverpool Golf Club at Hoylake. But instead, the 30-year-old - whose day job is a fork lifter - will be teeing off alongside the likes of Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy tees, as he competes in the world's greatest golf tournament. Mr Singleton, who works only a few miles away from site in The Wirral, qualified for the British Open on his very first try - despite thinking his golf career was over. John Singleton, 30, who works as a fork lifter by day, is today taking part in the British Open alongside the likes of Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy . Tiger Woods, pictured left, and Rory McIlroy, pictured right, are among the star golfers due to compete at the 143rd British Open Championship . Mr Singleton once tried to make it as a professional golfer but soon started a day job at the resin factory Advanced Electrical Varnishes, where he works the 8am to 4.30pm shift. There, he . drives a forklift truck and mixes the resin, a thick compound used as a . waterproof coating for wiring, circuit boards and other electrical . devices. But now he is giving the sport another chance, after claiming the available last spot by winning a sudden-death playoff. Before that, Mr Singleton had missed out on a regional qualifying by a single shot - but he was called into the final as an alternate when another player dropped out. Today, his 30 colleagues will take a day of paid holiday, granted to them by their boss, to cheer on their fellow worker, in the hope he makes the cut and it still around at the weekend. Mr Singleton said: 'I've got nothing to lose. I've done the . hard work just getting here and no-one expects anything from me so I'm . just going to enjoy myself. The amateur golfer tried his hand at turning professional through the American college system at Rend Lake College, Illinois, where he spent two years. The golfer made it through to the Open by winning a sudden-death playoff, after an alternate player dropped out . But his professional dreams were derailed by . serious injuries to both knees. He was forced to undergo six operations which all-but kept him off the course for three years. Today, he will be supported by his heavily-pregnant fiancée Lucy Johnson, one of the main drivers behind his second attempt at professional golf. He said: 'We had a good . chat about it and she said ""I'd like you to give it another try because I . know it's what you want to do"". 'I . owe her a huge thank you for that and she instilled a lot of belief in . me to be able to go back and do it and it has paid off. Hopefully we can enjoy the rest of our lives with me as a professional golfer.' But he also hopes that the excitement won't prove too much and force his partner into an early labour. He said: 'You never know to be honest with . you but I'll see how it pans out. I hope she's okay and doesn't get too . stressed out and worried. 'We'll . just see how it goes. There are enough friends and family who can shout . me from the sides if Lucy is going into labour and if that's the case . I'll take it from there.' Although he has never played in front of big crowds before, Mr Singleton does have the upper hand over some of the more well-known golfing names. He said: 'I've got to play the course every day since I qualified and that has been a huge bonus. 'It was hard at first because there weren't many people here and you couldn't soak up the atmosphere. 'Now there are a lot of people here for the practice days so it is exciting to play in front of people. 'I'm going to be nervous but some people are here to watch golf and some are here to watch me so that is nothing to be scared about it. Mr Singleton will be at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club watched by his 30 colleagues who have been given the day off to cheer on their fellow worker . The sun rose over the clubhouse at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake, for the first day of the British Open, which will see the world's best golfers compete . 'That injury break really helped me. To have those sort of injuries is hard enough but to have two of them I never thought I'd recover but luckily I did. 'It gave me a little bit of perspective in life so I now don't take things too seriously.' Jonathan Kemp, the firm's managing director, who will be at the course cheering him, told the Telegraph: 'He will have a lot of local support. The Wirral is a small place and a lot of people know he is local.' And colleague Sean O'Flanagan, the warehouse supervisor, said: 'To us, John is just one of the lads. He does the same work. 'He mixes his resins, he drives the forklift truck around the factory, he just mucks in. He's a very genuine guy.' A man has been arrested after crashing into a security guard while attempting to drive a golf buggy out of the gates at the Open Championship at Hoylake. Merseyside Police said a 45-year-old man was arrested following the incident outside Gate Four of the site at Royal Liverpool Golf Club, off Meols Drive. The security guard received a minor leg injury as the man clipped him before crashing the buggy into a barrier. Pictures emerged on social media of the buggy, owned by tournament organiser the Royal & Ancient, on a banking outside the gate. A Merseyside Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that a man has been arrested following an incident at The Open golf practice day in Hoylake at about 7.30pm this evening. 'The 45-year-old man from Birkenhead was arrested following an incident which involved the taking of a golf buggy on the course. 'One man was arrested on suspicion of assault after the buggy collided with a barrier near to the entrance gate on Meols Road. Just before colliding with the barrier the buggy caught a security guard causing a slight injury to his leg.' Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, executive director of championships at the R&A, said: 'Police are now investigating and I cannot say any more at this time.'","John Singleton, 30, is a forklift driver at factory near to Hoylake, The Wirral .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Brooke Greenberg may look like an infant, but she is actually 20 years old. Despite her increasing age, Brooke has remained physically and cognitively similar to a toddler, with an estimated mental age of nine months to one year. Appearing on Katie with her parents and 17-year-old sister, Brooke, who is from Maryland, is . unable to talk, still has her baby teeth and like any infant, travels in a push chair - but doctors have never been able to explain why. Scroll down for video . 20 years old: Despite her increasing age, Brooke remained physically and cognitively similar to a toddler, with an estimated mental age of nine months to one year. She died last week . Her father, Howard Greenberg, explained: . 'From age one to four, Brooke changed. She got a little bit bigger. But . age four, four to five, she stopped.' She has been examined by some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the U.S., however no formal diagnosis for Brooke’s condition has been given, leading doctors to term her condition Syndrome X. Dr Eric Schadt, director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at The Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, explained that she has 'no apparent abnormalities in her endocrine system, no gross chromosomal abnormalities, or any of the other disruptions known to occur in humans that can cause developmental issues.' Supportive family: Brooke appeared in January on Katie with her mother Melanie, father Howard and 17-year-old sister, Carly . Brooke, who has stayed the same size for 15 years, requires 24-hour care from her parents. She is fed through a tube inserted into . her stomach, because her oesophagus is so small that swallowed food . could back up into her lungs and cause pneumonia. Her mother, Melanie Greenberg, said: 'It's been 16 years of on the job training, giving her medicine, knowing when she's sick, knowing the right amount.' Mr Greenberg added: 'The key with Brooke is we don't know what tomorrow brings.'

Scientists . believe her unique genetic code could provide a fresh insight into the . process of aging, leading to the development of new treatments for . diseases related to old age, such as Parkinson's. Tests have shown that Brooke, who was born in 1993, may suffer from a gene mutation that switches off her ability to mature. Dr Schadt is in the process of sequencing Brooke’s genome, which is comprised of two long strings of letters, one from the mother and one from the father. Each string is three billion letters . long, and changes in just one of these letters can lead to profound . effects on development, physical appearance, and risk of disease.

Brooke Greenberg, a 20-year-old woman trapped inside the body of a toddler. According to ABC News, in the first six . years of her life, Brooke suffered series of medical emergencies from . which she recovered, often without explanation. She survived surgery for seven perforated stomach ulcers, and suffered a brain seizure followed by a stroke that weeks later left no apparent damage. Then at age four, she fell into a coma . that caused her to sleep for 14 days. Doctors diagnosed a brain tumor, . which disappeared by the time she awoke. Mother and daughter: Mrs Greenberg, who said she loved Brooke the way she was, explained that if another mother with a toddler asks her how old Brooke is, she usually doesn't answer truthfully . Key to aging: Scientists believe Brooke's unique genetic code could provide a fresh insight into the process of ageing, leading to the development of new treatments for diseases related to old age, such as Parkinson's . Dr Schadt hopes to find out whether any abnormal genes identified in Brooke 'are involved in aging related processes, whether manipulating these genes could increase longevity and/or reduce aging related disorders such as Alzheimer’s, heart disease and many forms of cancer,' he said. Mrs Greenberg, who said she loves Brooke the way she is, explained that if another mother with a toddler asks her how old Brooke is, she usually doesn't answer truthfully. 'My system always has been to turn years into months.

"By . Charlotte Griffiths . and Peter Lloyd . The BBC placed staff at its Radio 1 Teen Awards under draconian restrictions to prevent presenters being accused of sexual misconduct with minors. All adults – including the station’s star DJ Nick Grimshaw – were banned from moving around Wembley Arena without a security guard and even needed an escort for visits to the lavatory. The rules were so stringently enforced that guests referred to them as ‘Savile Lockdown’, in reference to the late paedophile BBC DJ Jimmy Savile. Stringent: Parents had to sign a new consent form for the Radio 1 Teen Awards which said staff and artists would not be placed in a 'caring or supervisory position'. Guests referred to the rules as a 'Savile Lockdown' Hosts Rita Ora, left, and Nick Grimshaw, centre, were pictured with a security guard, right, during the awards . The awards, for 14 to 17 year olds, took place at Wembley Arena on November 3. Performers on the night included Jessie J. The event came just two days after it was revealed that BBC broadcaster Paul Gambaccini had become the 15th person to be arrested on suspicion of sexual offences as part of Operation Yewtree. Jessie J was one of the artists who performed . A BBC source said: ‘Security staff even waited outside while we visited the bathroom, then ensured we were taken back to our seat without any detours. ‘It was made very clear that we were not to speak with any of the teenagers or engage with them on the stage. We called it the Savile Lockdown.’ The security measures taken at the event are among many hardline rules introduced as the BBC attempts to undo the damage caused to its reputation since it emerged that Savile spent years abusing children during his time working for the Corporation as a children’s presenter. They include an update of its child consent forms. Parents of children who participate in any BBC show or project must now agree that they ‘will not leave any BBC staff or associate artists unaccompanied in the presence of a child or children’. The form also insist that parents ensure that their child is told they must not ask any BBC staff for  contact details or hand over their own details to BBC staff. Parents dropping their children off at the Teen Awards were told to sign the updated form. A BBC insider said: ‘It is a BBC policy that adults have to be escorted when they are around anyone who is under age. ‘Managers, photographers and producers all have an escort, even when they are in the studio or the office. The escorts themselves also have to go around in pairs so they have a back-up who can vouch for them if they find themselves in a difficult situation. ‘At the Teen Awards, BBC staff and escorts were told to stop an adult if they were walking around the venue alone and question them about what they were doing. ‘Parents were not allowed into the Arena and instead had to drop their children off at the door. After the Jimmy Savile saga, parents were more concerned than usual and security was tightened.’ As well as security guards, the BBC hired teams of Security Industry Authority-approved officers who were stationed around the arena. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We take our duty of care towards this young audience extremely seriously and have a very clear process in place that states that the handful of adults who are allowed front-of-house must be accompanied at all times.’ The awards came two days after it was revealed broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, pictured, had been arrested on suspicion of sexual offences under Operation Yewtree. He issued a statement denying the 'historic' allegations . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Every adult at awards banned from moving around Wembley Arena alone .

"By . Julie Moult . They are supposedly Kanye West's closest friends. So it can only be seen as the ultimate snub that Jay Z and Beyonce were no-show at the rapper's extravagant nuptials to Kim Kardashian on Saturday. While the couple's famous friends and family flocked to 16th century Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy, Beyonce and her husband were in the Hamptons, according to US Weekly magazine. Scroll down for video . Busy... posting selfies: Beyonce posted a make-up free picture of herself with braided hair with no caption, at almost the same moment Kim Kardashian's wedding to Kanye West got underway in Florence last month . It was thought Jay Z would be the best man at the wedding, as the two rappers have grown very close and often collaborate on musical ventures together. But in avoiding the wedding, Jay Z and Beyonce also swerved a potentially awkward run in with Rachel Roy. Beyonce and Solange had 'words' with Rachel at the Met Ball after party in NYC, and our source told us that it all stemmed from Rachel’s 'too close relationship with Jay Z, according to Hollywood Life. 'Too close': The now infamous Met Gala row is alleged to have stemmed from Rachel's 'closeness' to Jay Z . Then the row is said to have continued between Solange and Jay Z, and spilled into that elevator bust up. It's certainly odd that Jay Z was in attendance for his close friend's big day. Just this week Kanye was named the headliner of the 99 Problems Made In America music festival - a sought after sport by the world's top artists. Fab four: Pictured here together  in 2012, Kimye and Jay Z and Beyonce have been close for years . Big Love: The couples embrace in a show of their deep friendship but mystery surrounded Jay Z and Beyonce's absence on Friday night . As . if their no show was not enough, Beyonce seemed to be sending a message . about her attendance as she posted a make-up free selfie on her . Instagram, with no comment, as the wedding got underway. But later she appeared to have a change of heart posting a touching photograph of the West family with the message: 'Wishing you a lifetime of unconditional love. God bless your beautiful family.' And then moments later she followed that with a picture of clouds against a blue sky through a window but with no message of explanation. From the heart: Beyonce sends a message to the newlyweds on her Instagram account . Blue sky thinking: moments after posting a heartfelt message on her Instagram account to Kimye, she posted this mystery picture of clouds . On Friday night, speculation started that the musical powerhouse pair were not coming when they were conspicuous in . their absence as 600 guests gathered at the Palace of Versailles to mark . the beginning of celebrations. It had been reported that notoriously private Queen Bey was unhappy attending the event because  of the huge media interest. And the thought of appearing on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the family's reality show, did not go down well. Power couples: Kanye and Jay Z are two of  the biggest names in showbiz while their wives are multimillionaires in their own rights . A source told Radar . that Beyonce, 32, had informed Kanye that: 'under no circumstances will . she be a part of any filming on the wedding day if it’s for Kim’s . reality show.' A spokesman for the mother of one refused to comment on the report. Kim, 33, attempted to pal up with Beyonce soon after starting dating Kanye.  But her friendly approaches are widely reported to have been rebuffed. Here comes the guests: Is this chaos why Beyonce was so keen to avoid the wedding? Indeed, . after the pair were spotted dancing together as they watched their . husbands in concert, Beyonce was blasted by her fans - and the pair have . not been seen in such circumstances since. But perhaps the attendance of Lana del Rey is the reason why Beyonce is keen to stay away. Lana who performed three songs at Friday's Versailles dinner, is fast becoming more popular than the 32 year-old. From Paris to Florence: KimYe's guests, pictured is Vogue's . André Leon Talley check in to fly across Europe - but there's no sign of Beyonce and Jay Z . The . couple have also been dogged by rumors of marriage difficulties which . intensified following the elevator bust-up between Jay Z and his sister . in law Solange. Solange . ferociously attacked the rapper as they left the Met Gala after party . on May 5th and the family were forced to release a statement when video . footage of the brawl leaked. Fans will be hoping for the best however as the music power couple, parents to daughter Blue Ivy, are due to embark on their first concert tour together beginning on June 25th in  Miami.

"By . Stephanie Linning . A 14-year-old boy has been left in a coma after a cornice from the Galleria Umberto in Naples, Italy, fell and hit him as he was walking below. Salvatore Giordano was walking on Toledo Street - a road in the historic city centre - on Saturday evening with a group of friends when a fixture broke off from the building. He was taken to the city's Loreto Mare Hospital, where he remains in a coma. Collapse: A cornice at the Galleria Umberto in Naples, crumbled away from above the archway and on to Salvatore Giordano, who was walking on Toledo Street below . Hazard: Firefighters have since secured the crumbling facade. Local officials said it is still unclear who was responsible for the crumbling part of the building that fell and injured Salvatore . Rubble: Pieces of stone remain on the street next to where Salvatore was hit on Saturday. The 14-year-old remains in a coma in a Naples hospital . Fragile: A passer-by points at the top of the Galleria Umberto, where the cornice fell from. The facade had reportedly crumbled in the days before Salvatore was injured . It has been reported that the boy sustained head and lung injuries as a result of the accident. Salvatore's family, from Marano, a town on the outskirts of Naples, have asked for privacy while the teenager is in hospital. Police in Naples are investigating who was responsible for maintaining the cornice that collapsed. They are also looking into claims that other pieces had fallen from the . building, built between 1887-1891, in the days before the accident. Yesterday, Luigi Merola, an Italian priest and writer known for his close ties with the community said that someone will have to take responsibility for what happened. He asked that those in the local community prayed for his recovery. After the accident, firefighters cordoned off an area of the road to ensure no one else was injured. It has been reported that there were others taken to hospital. Closed: Red tape keeps a young boy away from the crumbling wall. The road outside the Galleria Umberto will remain closed until the police investigation into the accident has concluded . Cordoned-off: Firefighters and police officers inspect the scene where the cornice fell - on a popular shopping street in Naples historic city centre . Recovery: A firetruck arrives on scene. Salvatore was taken to Loreto Mare hospital after sustaining injuries to his head and lungs. He remains there in a coma . Popular: A view looking out from inside the Galleria Umberto. The partial collapse of the front of the landmark, built between 1887-1891, has prompted a debate on the maintenance of the city's other historic buildings . Speaking to journalists outside the hospital yesterday, Angel Liccardo, mayor of Marano, said that the boy's condition had deteriorated further. One of Salvatore's teachers, Simioli Guild, who visited the boy, saying he was 'astonished' at what had happened, one Spanish newspaper reported. Local officials told Spanish reporters that the accident had drawn attention to the maintenance that needs to be carried out on more of Naples aging buildings and urged that more money be allocated to such projects.","Salvatore Giordano was struck by cornice from the Galleria Umberto, Naples .

"By . Stephanie Linning . A father-of-one died after drinking a toxic pesticide which was sold to him as a weight loss aid, a court heard today. Sean Cleathero, 28, was allegedly advised to dissolve a sachet of Dinitrophenol (DNP) in water, and then drink the mixture, at a gym in Buckinghamshire. He died later in hospital after being poisoned by the chemical. Jamie Chivers, 44, Jason King, 41, and Peter Purkins, 47, are on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of manslaughter. All three deny the charge. Victim: Sean Cleathero, 28, died after drinking Dinitrophenol (DNP), an industrial pesticide that is poisonous when consumed by humans, at a gym in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire on October 16 2012, a court heard . The court heard that Purkins and Chivers were co-owners of two businesses in High Wycombe - Precision Laboratories where the drug was produced, and Apollo Fitness, where Mr Cleathero collected and drank the lethal drug on October 16 2012. King was their employee at the gym and it was alleged that he knew about the supply of DNP to Mr Cleathero. He said Mr Cleathero, a member of the gym since March 2012, had previously been supplied with DNP pills. But after complaining to Purkins that they were not working, Chivers dropped off an envelope containing DNP powder at the gym for the customer to collect. Mr Price said the only warning Purkins offered to Mr Cleathero about the powder was: ‘It won’t taste any good’. Chivers then dropped it off at the gym and King handed it over from behind the counter, advising him to dissolve it in a beaker of water before drinking, the prosecution said. The jury was shown CCTV footage from the gym showing the victim drinking the bright yellow liquid and then start to sweat. Prosecutor John Price QC said: 'The minute he drank the contents of that glass he was a dead man because there is no antidote for what he consumed.' Accused: Peter Purkins (left) and Jason Chivers (right) were co-owners of two businesses - Precision Labratories, where the DNP was allegedly produced, and Apollo Fitness, where the drug 'was supplied' Employee: King, an employee at Apollo Fitness allegedly handed Mr Cleathero a packet of the pesticide from behind the counter, advising him to dissolve it in a beaker of water before drinking . 'He could not stop sweating even long after he had finished his workout and he was starting to struggle to breathe.' An ambulance was called and Mr Cleathero was taken to Wycombe Hospital where he died eight hours after consuming the poison. A post mortem examination showed the cause of death was poisoning by DNP. His temperature had soared to 42C - well above the average body temperature of around 37C - the court heard. He said the gym had 'all the appearance of being a professional, well run and legitimate operation' but that was just 'a veneer'. On trial: They appeared at the Old Bailey (pictured) today. The prosecutor said Purkins, King and Chivers were involved in the production and supply of DNP and they would have known 'the truth' of its potential dangers . Mr Price said that DNP was not a controlled drug and had a legitimate use as an insecticide or herbicide. It is alleged that the three men knew about the potentially lethal effects of the pesticide when they sold it. Mr Price added: 'It has a long history of misuse by humans as what is called a fat burner, as the name implies those who take it do so to assist in an attempt to lose weight,' he said. Mr Price said Purkins, King and Chivers were involved in the production and supply of DNP to the public for personal consumption and they would have known 'the truth of it'. In 2003, nine years before Mr Cleathero died, the Food Standards Agency had advised that DNP was 'extremely dangerous to human health' following an incident in Finland, the jury was told. Chivers, Purkins and King, all from Buckinghamshire, along with Laura Hague, 23, of Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, deny charges of producing and supplying anabolic steroids. King and Hague also deny perverting the course of justice by removing incriminating evidence after Mr Cleathero’s death. The court was told Chivers has already admitted perverting the course of justice after he 'forgot' to delete CCTV footage showing him deleting incriminating footage from earlier in the week. Purkins is not accused over the alleged cover up. The trial continues.

"By . Stephanie Linning . A reclusive pensioner died surrounded by a huge pile of rubbish that he had been hoarding - and his body was not found until police broke down his door eight months later. Denis Walsby, 74, who had not had contact with his family for years, was found lying underneath a stack of papers at the foot of his stairs, with bags of rubbish and cardboard boxes packed in around him. The police officer who uncovered the decomposing body described the scene as being 'like a nest' where Mr Walsby had collected, and kept, everything that he needed. Hoarder: Plastic bags and cardboard boxes filled with junk were stacked so high in Denis Walsby's house that the police officer who discovered his body found it difficult to open the front door . During the inquest at Southampton Coroners' Court, it emerged that Mr Walsby was living downstairs among the clutter in his terraced house in Romsey, Hampshire during the final months of his life. Dates on the piles of mail found in his home indicated that Mr . Walsby could have died in April last year - eight months before he was found dead - the court heard. The alarm was raised when a postman saw mail piled up inside the porch at his home in Romsey, Hampshire. PC Lindsay Miell, who found Mr Walsby's body, noticed an infestation of flies upon entering the property. She said: 'It was hugely cluttered to the point that I couldn’t step inside the doorway. 'The thing that immediately struck me was the smell. It appeared in the last stages of his life that he had created a small nest for himself - it was where he had basically done everything.' Reclusive: Denis Walsby, pictured in 1968. He did not have any contact with his family for years before he died, according to his ex-wife . Mr Walsby had not had contact with any family for years and had not been in touch with his ex-wife Joyce, 69, for 30 years. Joyce, from Southampton, said they had moved to the then new-build home in 1970 when they were both working for Ordnance Survey. The couple divorced in 1982 and his ex-wife said that she had not spoken to Mr Walsby since he retired in 1984. It was only after Mr Walsby died that she met his cousin, Robert Lucas, who it appears is his last surviving relative. Mr Walsby would holiday in Germany and would visit Mr Lucas at his home in Camberley, Surrey, on his way home. He was last seen at a family funeral in 2001 and Mr Lucas last spoke to him in 2006. Little is known about the last ten years of his life. Richard Heather, of Hampshire taxi firm Samtax, took Mr Walsby on weekly shopping trips. He said: 'He never used to complain about his health.' Mr Walsby’s neighbour, Karen Stewart, also said she had knocked on his front door several times each year. She said would only see him once every few months and could have been the last person to have spoken to him. She said: 'I felt so awful when I heard that he’d died, I was in tears.' A post-mortem found that Mr Walsby had died from a head injury although it is uncertain how he sustained it. Delivering a verdict of accidental death, Central Hampshire coroner Grahame Short said: 'Because of the period of time which has elapsed, it’s not possible to ascertain whether he had been drinking, for example, and then fallen, or if he had a fall because he tripped. 'He was clearly a very reclusive man who preferred his own company.'","Denis Walsby was found underneath stack of papers, surrounded by rubbish .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Sally Bercow made headlines in 2011 when she said that her husband John had become more attractive since becoming Speaker of the House of Commons. Now he has offered his opinion on her claims - insisting that he is 'certainly not' a sex symbol. Dismissing her comments as a joke, he spoke of her 'very good' sense of humour. Sex symbol? Speaker John Bercow insists that he is not a sex symbol, despite his wife's claims that he had become more attractive. Dismissing the comments, he said simply that she has 'a very good sense of humour' Making headlines: In 2011, Sally Bercow, pictured with her husband, spoke of the 'aphrodisiac' effect of their life at the Palace of Westminster. Mr Bercow said that they are not fazed by scrutiny of their marriage . He told The Times Magazine: 'I have most . certainly not become a sex symbol. She [his wife] does have a very good . sense of humour.' In 2011 Mrs Bercow sent ripples around Westminster when she appeared in a newspaper wearing nothing but a bedsheet. She also spoke at the time of the 'aphrodisiac' effect of their life at the Palace of Westminster. Mr Bercow said that they are not fazed by scrutiny of their marriage, which has made headlines on a number of occasions. He said: 'Sally and I have our own approach to marriage and we are perfectly comfortable in our own skin,' he said. 'And, in the politest possible way, I think I would say: if other people disapprove of it or think it should be otherwise, that's their problem, not ours.' Rising above it: Mr Bercow, 51, who is 5ft 6in tall, said he was 'never bothered about being short' and said that those who comment on his height are being 'intellectually substandard and schoolboyish' Mr Bercow, 51, who is 5ft 6in tall, said he was 'never bothered about being short'. 'Whereas nobody these days would regard it as acceptable to criticise someone on grounds of race or creed or disability or sexual orientation, somehow it seems to be acceptable to comment on someone's height, or lack of it. 'Does it affect me, personally? Not at all. It's just low grade, intellectually substandard and schoolboyish.' In February Mrs Bercow, 44, said she 'can't wait' for her husband to quit his role as speaker so her private life will no longer be under the spotlight.","Sally Bercow said that her husband's role had made him more attractive .

"By . Stephanie Linning . This is the moment an inquisitive squirrel was spotted taking time out to smell the daisies. The curious creature couldn't resist sniffing some local Erigeron flowers as it made its way through fields near Vienna, Austria. But while it might look like its simply taking the time to appreciate the summer blooms - the squirrel was in fact on the hunt for the tastiest flower of the bunch. That smells nice! The squirrel stands up on its hind legs, grasping the stem with its paws, and takes a sniff of the daisies. The moment was captured as the inquisitive squirrel scampered across a field in Vienna, Austria . Seen pulling the plant towards its nose, the rarely-seen animal was captured by Austrian photographer, Julian Ghahreman-Rad, 23, who was hiding in the bushes nearby. Reaching out with a tiny paw, the squirrel is first seen bending the stem closer, before bringing the blooms to its nose with a gentle tug. After sniffing the individual flowers, the squirrel decides on the one that smells the best - and leans in for a bite. Mr Ghahreman-Rad used a camouflage net to stay hidden from the timid animal. Hewas forced to stay hidden for three hours before catching a glimpse of the endangered European ground squirrel. And he was able to stay still enough to capture the animal in these tender photographs. Which one? With a tiny paw, the squirrel brings the buds close enough to touch its nose. The photographer captured the incredible images by lying quietly on his stomach in some nearby bushes for three hours . Lunchtime! After spending time sniffing out its favourite one, the hungry squirrel takes a bite of its pick of the bunch. Mr Ghahreman-Rad said the trick to taking photos of the timid creature was to make yourself 'invisible' Mr Ghahreman-Rad said: . 'It wasn't an easy task getting these shots, European ground squirrels . are not easy to find, but I knew I just had to be patient and wait. 'When . you want to take professional photos of them you have to be at eye . level with the squirrels, that means you have to lay on your stomach for . quite a few hour in order to get the squirrels in front of your lens. 'Basically, you have to make yourself invisible, they are extremely timid so you it is important that they have no indication you are there. 'The moment I saw the ground squirrel reaching for the flower I knew it would be a special and unique shot. 'I was so pleased with the results, it really does look as if it is smelling the flowers but of course it is searching for some lunch. 'Those few shots are some of my favourite pictures I've ever taken and I feel lucky to have them in my own photo collection.'","The European ground squirrel was seen in the fields of Vienna, Austria .

"By . Stephanie Linning . A drugs smuggler linked to an international network which used specially adapted clothing to smuggle heroin has been jailed for 16 years. Tahir Mahmood, 53, was jailed at Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to five drug-related offences at an earlier hearing. Judge James Burbidge QC also jailed his 'right-hand man', Anwar Bashir, 43, for 15 years. Bashir, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was found guilty of three offences. Jailed: Anwar Bashir (left) was sentenced to 15 years and Tahir Mahmood (right) was sentenced to 16 years. They were linked to an international drug trafficking network which used adapted clothing to smuggle heroin . Smugglers: A body suit that was worn by a drug mule linked to the two men. The suit, which was worn under clothes, is made up of a series of concealed compartments in which drugs could be stored . Concealed: Packets of heroin were tied into concealed pockets lining a specially-designed body suit. On one occasion a drug mule was picked up wearing a body suit that contained 87 packets of heroin . The court heard how the group smuggled large quantities of heroin from Pakistan into the UK using a network that passed through Dubai and a number of European countries. They used sophisticated concealed compartments and pockets within suitcases, books and specially-adapted clothing to hide heroin from customs officials. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said . Mahmood, of Stourbridge, West Midlands, was in charge of multiple . couriers - people who traffic drugs - based in Spain. Prosecutor Timothy Hannam told the court that Mahmood played a 'leading role - directing and leading on a commercial scale' with the aim of 'substantial financial gain' while Bashir was his 'right-hand man'. The court heard the offences took place between September 2011 and January 2012. The network’s activities spanned the UK, to the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Spain, Dubai and Pakistan. On one . occasion, Mahmood and Bashir met a drugs mule at Birmingham Airport who . was wearing a body suit stuffed with heroin under his clothes. The body . suit contained 87 packages of heroin, the court heard. CCTV . footage captured Bashir and Mahmood putting him into a taxi at the . airport. The taxi was later stopped by police and the man was arrested. Specially-crafted: The men also used suitcases with hidden compartments to traffic drugs. The network's activities spanned the globe - from the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Spain to Dubai and Pakistan . On another occasion, heroin was found in a concealed compartment in a suitcase taken off a carousel at Birmingham Airport. Mahmood admitted three counts of assisting or inducing the commission of an offence abroad and two counts of trafficking. Bashir was convicted of two counts of assisting or inducing the commission of an offence abroad, and one count of trafficking. Sentencing . the pair today, the Judge Burbidge said: 'When heroin is placed on the . streets of Europe and England it creates misery to many. You wanted to . make money out of that. That was your aim.' Deception: The network used books like this one that had been hollowed out to conceal heroin from customs officials. Sentencing the pair, the judge said the drug 'creates misery to many' He added: 'You both expected substantial financial gain.' NCA Branch Commander Paul Risby said: 'We proved Mahmood and Bashir were linked to seizures totalling 46 kilos but I believe the network dismantled could have been responsible for many more importations - bringing misery, harm and violence to communities in Birmingham, Bradford and other cities. 'Tackling the supply of drugs on a global level and protecting our borders are priorities for the NCA and its partners. 'These two men are now behind bars where they belong.' Five couriers linked to the gang were prosecuted separately and received sentences ranging from five to 12 years. The NCA operation was supported by the Crown Prosecution Service’s Organised Crime Division, West Midlands Police, the Spanish Guardia Civil and other international law enforcement agencies.","Tahir Mahmood, 53, was jailed for 16 years after pleading guilty to five drug-related offences .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Animal rescue workers are seeking the owner of this dog - which was found abandoned in a tent at Glastonbury Festival. The lurcher was found cowering in one of the 5,000 discarded tents during the clean-up of the 1200-acre festival site at Worthy Farm, Somerset.

Loveable: Rescue workers say that they are now looking for the owners of the dog, which they describe as 'sweet natured and older'. They say that the animal has been left stressed by her situation . Abandoned: The white lurcher was found in one of the 5,000 tents that were left discarded in the fields of Worthy Farm, Somerset after the festival. A crew of up to 800 were responsible for tidying up the camp site . Discarded: Dolly was found in a tent on Tuesday as the cleaning crew began transforming the site back to a working dairy farm. The process, which involves litter pickers, tractors and volunteers, could take six weeks . Dolly the dog is now recovering at the Happy Landings animal shelter in Pylle, Somerset and rescue workers are looking for answers. A spokesperson said: 'How anyone could do such a thing is beyond me. 'She is a sweet-natured older lurcher, and clearly very stressed to find herself in this predicament. 'We had hoped that an owner would come forward but there has still been nothing.' Dolly was found in one of the open camping fields as the clean-up operation got underway on Tuesday. Appeal: Rescue workers said that they had hoped Dolly's owners would have come forward, but there has been no information so far . Namesake: The lonely dog was renamed Dolly after Glastonbury hit Dolly Parton who performed on the Pyramid stage on day three of the festival. Some 80,000 revellers crowded around  to watch the 68-year-old singer . Crowded: For five days the 1200-acre festival site was home to some 175,000 people. Tractors carrying magnetic strip were dispatched to pick up tent pegs left at the festival site . Recovery: Dolly, pictured with a rescue worker, is now being looked after at Happy Landings animal shelter. A spokesperson from Glastonbury declined to comment but said that pets were not welcome at the festival . Over five days last week it was home . to some 175,000 people, who attended performances by world-class acts . such as Metallica, Arcade Fire and Kasabian. And some 80,000 revellers crowded around the . stage to watch Dolly the dog's country music singing namesake bring the festival to a . close on its third day of music. Campers had until 6pm on Monday to leave the site while crew and stall holders are given a week to clear their property. A . team of around 800 workers have started the mammoth task of clearing an . estimated 11 tonnes of clothes and camping gear which were abandoned at . the site, while volunteers began sifting through recycling yesterday. Tractors carrying magnetic strips will travel across the 1,200-acre site to pick up tent pegs. Meanwhile workers will carry out a fingertip search to make sure no inch of the land goes unchecked. The mission to  convert the land back to a working dairy farm could take up to six weeks. A spokesman for the festival declined to comment but said pets were not welcome at Glastonbury.","Lurcher was found in one of the 5,000 tents discarded at Worthy Farm .

"By . Stephanie Linning . A barrister walking from John O’Groats to Land’s End for charity was injured in a hit-and-run accident, just 16 miles after he started. Dave Redmond, 31, was on the first day of his planned seven-week walk when he was clipped by a campervan and tossed into a verge. The father-of-one was raising money for three charities - Macmillan Cancer Support, the MS Society and Help for Heroes. Walking for chairty: Dave Redmond was just 16 miles into his 1,100-mile journey when he was clipped by a campervan that was driving on the wrong side of the road. His trek has been postponed for at least two weeks . Planned route: Mr Redmond posted this map of his ambitious route on his blog. He was injured in the hit-and-run between John O'Groats and Wick, which is pictured just beneath the top white arrow . Mr Redmond, a barrister from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, will now have to postpone his trek - which has raised more than £3,000 - for at least two weeks because of his injuries. He was walking on the side of the road when the campervan, driving the wrong way, came up behind him. He said that the wing mirror clipped him and that the pack he was carrying acted as a buffer, according to posts on his Twitter page. Despite suffering multiple injuries to his arm, ankle and collarbone, Mr Redmond was able to walk another six miles after the accident. An elderly couple in a passing car noticed the lone rambler and took him to a nearby caravan site outside Wick, Caithness. Mr Redmond initially refused to go to hospital and was looked after by site owners Trisha and William Miller. Bold feat: The father-of-one has raised more than £3,000 for three charities - Macmillan Cancer Support, the MS Society and Help for Heroes. His target is £5,000, according to his fundraising page . 'When he . came at first, he wasn’t saying much and he actually only told me he’d . hurt his ankle with absolutely nothing mentioned about the accident,' said Mrs Miller. 'We told him there was a hospital near at hand but he decided not to go. 'He came back about an hour later and told us he thought he should go to hospital so we got someone to take him around. 'It wasn’t until we picked him up later that he told us everything that had happened. I actually wonder if we wasn’t concussed when he first came in to us.' The hospital found the criminal barrister had suffered damage to his arm, shoulder and ankle. Training: Mr Redmond from Dunstable, Bedfordshire uses walking sticks on a training walk ahead of his trek from John O'Groats to Land's End. He initially refused to go to hospital after the accident . 'It’s so sad what happened to him as he came so far north and was all geared up for his challenge,' said Mrs Miller. 'To see him with a hurt arm and unable to pick up his rucksack was so upsetting. 'It could have been a lot more serious as he could have been left in a ditch and then hypothermia could have set in.' Mr Redmond has reported the incident to police but, as he was unable to record and give a registration number, the culprit may go uncaught. Injured: Mr Redmond, pictured on a previous walk. He suffered injuries to his arm, shoulder and ankle which mean that he will not be able to sustained weight on either leg for up to six weeks . On his Twitter account, Mr Redmond said he wanted to thank everyone who had helped him and he has donated his campsite fee to his fundraising page because the Millers refused to keep it. He will not be able to hike for at least two weeks and will not be able to carry a backpack for far longer due to damage to his collarbone. Doctors think it will be between four and six weeks before he can put any sustained weight on either leg. All the money raised by Mr Redmond’s walk was to be divided equally between his three chosen charities of Macmillan Cancer Support, the MS Society and Help for Heroes.","Dave Redmond, 31, was on the first day of his seven-week charity walk .

She roared him on to victory as he made it through to the quarter-finals yesterday, but admits that his matches are still nerve-racking to watch. When asked if sitting in the players’ box was less stressful than last year, she said: 'No! I think there is a huge expectation level out there from everybody, obviously because he’s won Wimbledon and he’s won the US Open and the Olympics.

She said her son Andy, right, faces a greater level of expectation this year after his success at Wimbledon, the US Open and the Olympics . High hopes: Mrs Murray couldn't stay in her seat as she watched Andy in the Wimbledon finals last July. She said that her 27-year-old son is more mature this year, something that will help him in his push for the title . 'I think everybody is expecting him to do well.' Mrs Murray, who was , added that her son has the experience to win it all again. 'It’s a very, very tough sport. The strength in depth in the men’s game is enormous,' she said. 'But he’s been playing at Wimbledon since 2005, he knows what to expect. 'He’s always handled it really well and he’s 27 now, he’s older, more mature. He’ll be out there trying to do it all again.'

Mrs Murray was speaking at the launch of the Miss-Hits tennis programme, which she created along with the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) to encourage young girls to pursue the sport. She also hit out at parents who don't spend enough time playing sports with their children. She said: ‘I loved all sports when I was young, I wanted my kids to enjoy sport so I was always playing actively with them, whatever they wanted to play. ‘But it’s not every parent that does that with their kids anymore. ‘It’s much easier to hand them a DVD or a CD or something and sit and watch that. ‘I think parents generally have less time, maybe more money and less time, so they are paying people to look after their kids and do the activity with them, rather than doing it themselves.’ She said: ‘The things that are trendy for kids to play with nowadays tend to be sedentary things. You sit and twiddle your thumbs or you watch something on a wide screen and that is just a fact of life.","Judy Murray admits that it is still nerve-racking to watch her son Andy play .

"By . Stephanie Linning . O'Brien outside Minshull Street Crown Court today before he was sentenced to eight years in jail . An undertaker has been jailed for misleading grieving clients and pocketing funeral charity donations to help balance the books of his struggling business. Michael O'Brien, 59, admitted keeping around . £1,500 in donations while in charge at Murray's Funeral Directors in . Dukinfield, Greater Manchester. Minshull Street Crown Court heard how he took advantage of a series of vulnerable . clients even though he knew that his family business was struggling and later went bankrupt. O'Brien has now been jailed for eight months after he admitted fraud and offences under unfair trading regulations. The donations that he took had been left in envelopes which also contained cards with heart-felt messages of support, which he also failed to pass on to grieving families. The scale of his deceit . unravelled when police were called and discovered a series of diligent . notes written by O'Brien, detailing donations which hadn't been passed on. It . was found O'Brien had kept £800 intended for British Heart Foundation, . £495 for MacMillan Cancer Support and £190 for Tameside General . Hospital. Human ashes were also seized as police raided the premises in October last year. O'Brien, . 59, of Hyde, pleaded guilty to three counts . of fraud by false representation between January 2010 and February 2013 . at Tameside Magistrates Court in March. O'Brien, of Woolley Lane, Hollingworth, had also mis-sold a series of funeral plans to elderly people worth a total of £10,219. Those who did not want to burden surviving relatives had paid him up to £3,000 for their funerals. But the court heard none of the plans was backed by insurance and O'Brien had not been regulated as required by the Financial Conduct Authority. It meant that families didn't realise they risked losing their money if, as later happened, his business went bankrupt. The scale of his deceit unravelled when police were called and discovered a series of diligent notes detailing donations which hadn't been passed on in a raid on the premises in October . Although O'Brien never failed to provide a funeral, the money he took for funeral plans went into propping up his failing business rather than into holding accounts for his customers. Sentencing him, Judge Andrew Lowcock told O'Brien: 'It's very sad to see you in the dock of the crown court. You had, prior to these events, led a blameless life. 'Your offences were committed against people at their most vulnerable, whether through illness, age or bereavement. 'Trying to support your business was not an excuse.' Earlier, Simeon Evans, defending, said: 'He would say he's a very good undertaker and a very, very bad businessman.' Police and council officials also removed documents during the investigation last year, which was triggered by a string of complaints. O'Brien has been sentenced to eight months in prison . After the sentencing hearing, Francis Hancock's grieving family, who paid £1,080 to Michael O'Brien for a headstone, told how they finally had justice. Retired builder Mr Hancock, a father-of-four with seven grandchildren, died aged 64 of cancer and O'Brien arranged the funeral. It went well and the family, from Ashton-under-Lyne, went to O'Brien again for the headstone. Francis' daughter Fiona Smith, 39, confronted the undertaker after a series of delays and later learned he had gone bankrupt. They also realised he had pocketed donations for Macmillan Cancer Care. After watching him being jailed, Fiona said: 'We trusted him completely. This was justice for dad really, not for us. It was his money. He would have been fuming.'","Michael O'Brien admitted keeping .

"By . Stephanie Linning . A replica village, complete with shops, a post office and a village green, has been built to help dementia sufferers who are 'stuck in the past'. Staff at Baylham Care Centre in Ipswich, Suffolk, came up with the quirky idea when they noticed that residents with dementia took comfort in completing everyday tasks and activities that felt familiar. The village boasts a butcher's, bakery, greengrocer's, sweet shop, haberdashery and post office, all designed to look like shops from the 1950s - when many of the residents were young adults. Memory lane: The village at Baylham Care Centre in Ipswich, Suffolk has a post office, sweet shop and greengrocers, which have been built around a small green where the staff planted flowers and bushes . Daily chores: Staff have also left half-finished tasks, like this washing that needs hanging up, around the centre to help residents who suffer from dementia . It also has a railway and bus station - complete with a waiting room and suitcases - all built around a village green. The idea was to create a space that felt familiar to residents with dementia, who often have better long-term memory than short-term. It gives them somewhere to carry out everyday tasks that they might miss, or chores that they feel they need to complete - such as picking up some milk or hanging up the washing. This sense of purpose can keep sufferers calm and help alleviate the distress and confusion they can often feel. One resident spends a lot of time sitting on the bench in the station waiting room - which staff said reminded him of journeys he used to take as a boy. Sandie Oxborrow, manager of the centre, said: 'The village gives the residents the ability to have a normal life with meaningful engagements rather than just activities which fill in time. Familiar feeling: The shopfronts have all been designed based on how they would have looked in the 1950s - around the time when many of the residents were young adults . Place to relax: Residents helped decorate the village green with homemade bunting. This sense of purpose that it offers residents can help alleviate the distress and confusion dementia sufferers can often feel . 'It's important for them to be busy and have a purpose. 'Often they say, ""I need to go to the shops"", so we created the shopping village. 'In the middle of the village we have created a park where we have planted some flowers and bushes so people feel like they've gone to the park to feed the ducks.' The village is not the first idea the carers have come up with to make their residents feel more comfortable. They also place half-finished chores around the house so if residents forget what they are doing they are able to assume they were planning to take up the activity. Comforting: One of the rooms inside has been transformed into a train station waiting room. Staff said that one man spends a lot of time sitting on one of the benches as it reminds him of journeys he took as a child . At the top of the stairs rests a pile of half-finished knitting, so if a resident forgets on the way upstairs what they wanted to do there is a task waiting for them. Prema Fairburn, who runs the care home for its 53 residents, said: 'We are always trying to think of new and innovative ideas to help them. 'They live for the moment and just having simple tasks, such as going to the shop or waiting for a train, is a simple idea but is very relevant to how they lived and has a calming and soothing effect. 'Just giving them a pram or a washing line which wouldn't be available in other homes helps them do something they remember. 'It's been an ongoing process but it has already made a huge difference to even our more challenging residents. 'They even helped make the village by putting up bunting. 'They have much better long term memories than short term and it really helps those that may be stuck in the past.'","The village at Baylham Care Centre in Ipswich, Suffolk, is based on one from the 1950s .

He was joined at Newton Abbot Racecourse by their daughter Victoria, 36, and granddaughter Paige (pictured together) Special race: Mr Chillery paid £300 to sponsor a race in celebration of his divorce. He was given more reason to celebrate when the horse he backed, Cash For Steel, romped in first, ridden by Daniel Hiskett . The race was run over two miles and six furlongs. Mr Chillery watched the action from a box where he sipped champagne with friends and family - including daughter Victoria from his second marriage. 'When the race was announced you could hear the commentator was tickled because of the tone of his voice, it sounded as if he was trying hard to keep a straight face. I absolutely love it,' Mr Chillery told the Express. Mr Chillery, of Dawlish Devon, was given more reason to celebrate when the horse he backed, Cash For Steel, romped in first, ridden by Daniel Hiskett. The win brought him in £1200 - money that went towards the sponsorship, he said. Mr Chillery met and married his first wife Jean in 1966 in Andover, Hampshire. They had four children together, but the marriage only lasted six years - ending when Jean had an affair. He met Madeline, his second wife, while living in Woking, Surrey. Her husband was the boss of the taxi company where he worked. They wed in 1977 and had a daughter Victoria, now 36. Family day out: Mr Chillery (pictured wearing a black hat) watched the race from a box where he sipped champagne with friends and family. He has remained happily single for 16 years . The marriage ended when Madeline met someone else, and the couple were divorced on June 24 1996. They now don't speak, despite living close to each other. 'I was so pleased to be free I decided to . mark the day every year, so on June 24 I host a ""gentleman’s afternoon"" with some of the lads,' said Mr Chillery. Since then, Mr Chillery has remained happily single and has been able to spend more time on his passions, which include football and amateur dramatics - as well as horse racing. Mr Chillery added: 'I plan to retire in about five years and if I was still married I would never have been able to afford to carry on like this.'","David Chillery, 69, marks his 1996 divorce from his second wife every year .

The disfiguring condition has left Mr Sheikh's right leg so severely swollen below the knee that he is forced to wear shorts. He also has smaller hardened lumps and growths across his face and arms. Mr Sheikh, from the eastern Indian state of West Bengal, spends his days begging on the streets of Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, India.

Elephant Man: A portrait of Joseph Merrick . Born in 1862, Joseph Merrick began growing disfiguring tumours before the age of two. He suffered from Proteus syndrome and had growths all over his body - especially on his head. His skin appeared thick and lumpy, he developed an enlargement of his lips, and a bony lump grew on his forehead. Merrick's painful condition and subsequent health problems made it difficult for keep any sort of job. Poverty eventually forced him to enter the Leicester union workhouse. Desperate to find a way out of such grim conditions, Merrick contacted the owner of a Leicester music hall in 1884. Together, they established an act called 'The Elephant Man'. As The Elephant Man, Merrick earned a living working in freak shows and circuses in the 19th century, where he was often abused by members of the public. Merrick died on 11 April 1890, aged 27. In 1979, Bernard Pomerance's play about Merrick called The Elephant Man debuted.

A man who claims he was seduced as a 13-year-old boy by a teacher today told a jury that he now believed it was 'disgusting and wrong'. Anne Lakey, 54, an acclaimed headteacher, was friendly with the alleged victim and would invite him to visit her alone while her husband was at work, the court heard. Lakey, who transformed her school into one of the best in the country, is accused of grooming the boy from the . age of 13 or 14 for a year-long period in the late 1980s. The alleged victim today told the jury . that he had sex with Lakey because . it was 'what all lads in their early teens want to do.' But that looking back at the situation he could see that it was 'disgusting and wrong'. Lakey, who he called a 'disgusting sexual monster' is appearing at Durham Crown Court, accused of a string of ‘predatory’ sexual offences, including . sex with a boy under 16. She is accused of having sex with him while he was in his school uniform and exposing herself to him. The . complainant claimed that one day when he was in her family home she started flirting with him and asked him to play a game of 'dare' with her. It led to her baring her breasts and . allowing him to touch them. Later she had sex with the boy, still dressed in his school . uniform, and continued a sexual relationship with him regularly after . that, it was alleged. On other occasions he would watch her bathe and they would have oral sex, he told the jury. The complainant today told the court: 'I knew we shouldn’t be doing it. 'I understood I was under age and she was married, but I didn’t think it was wrong like I do now. 'I was not looking at it like an adult. At the time I knew we shouldn’t have been doing it but it was exciting as well.' The offences were said to have occurred when Lakey was a teacher in her late 20s, but the alleged victim was not a pupil. She denies the charges. Scroll down for video . Ann Lakey arrived at court on Tuesday hand-in-hand with an unknown man. The offences she is accused of were said to have occurred when Lakey was a teacher in her late 20s, but the alleged victim was not a pupil . Asked why he had done it, the complainant said: 'Because I was a lad in his early teens, that’s what lads in their early teens want to do,' he said. 'Now looking at it as an adult, I think it is disgusting and wrong. 'That’s why I am here.' When he told Lakey that he did not want to see her any more, he claimed she tried to keep him in her room and told him he must not tell anyone about what had been going on. Feeling trapped, he grabbed something and threw it at her before running away, he told the jury. Asked how the abuse when he was 13 and 14 had affected his later life, he said he regretted not mixing more with girls his own age during that time. The complainant came forward in 2012 . after seeing a piece of literature which said that Lakey was committed . to giving young people the best chance in life. In . a letter, he called the defendant a ‘disgusting sexual monster’. Lakey, . from Stanley, County  Durham, was described as an ‘inspiring leader’ by . the Chief Inspector of Education after improving GCSE pass rates at her . struggling school by focusing on vocational education. But she was suspended from her position as chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools last December after the allegations came to light. The complainant's mother today gave evidence via videolink saying that 'his face crumpled' when he told her in 2000 what had happened. 'He told me she had taken his cherry off him when he was 13. 'I asked if he had ever done anything about it, had he gone to the police? 'He just said no, he had been too embarrassed to talk to anybody about it.' Lakey denies all nine charges against her, which include two counts of inciting a boy to commit an act of gross indecency, two of gross indecency, and five counts of indecent assault. The offences are said to have happened between April 1988 and May 1989. Lakey became the head teacher at Deerness Valley Comprehensive in 2001 which later became one of two schools to form the Durham Federation of Schools. Under Lakey’s leadership the school boasted GCSE pass rates of 80 per cent in 2013 against 26 per cent the year before, and it was named the country’s most improved secondary school last year.

A 41-year-old teacher has been accused of having sex with two students - with police fearing there could be many other victims. Lori Carmichael Quigley was arrested at her home a week after she resigned her position as a math teacher. She is alleged to have had sex with the students at the McIntosh County Academy in Brunswick, Georgia, sources told WTEV. Police have charged her with three counts of sexual assault upon a person under supervision or discipline, said Maj. Danny Lowe from McIntosh County Sheriff's Office. He said the investigation was ongoing and feared other students were victims of the married mother of two. 'We think there's more out there,' said Major Lowe. All three of the male students at McIntosh Academy were at least 16 years of age, Lowe said. Although 16 is the age of consent in Georgia, the law forbids school personnel from having sex with students. All of the alleged sexual encounters occurred on school property, Lowe said. He did not elaborate on where the sex supposedly took place but said Quigley had taught the assumed victims. Where she taught: Quigley was a math teacher at McIntosh County Academy . No longer with the school: Quigley resigned her job when the allegations became public . 'The charges are serious, all three felonies,' said Lowe. Quigley, who was arrested Friday, was denied bail. Students and parents at the school told WTEV they were shocked by the arrest. 'I'm just really surprised its going on here, I'm sorry it's happening,' said Bonnie Cobb. Schools Superintendent Tina Kirby said she could not comment due to the pending criminal charges. 'I'm really not at liberty to say anything because it's an ongoing criminal investigation,' said Tina Kirby. Quigley had been teaching advanced level math to ninth- through-12th graders since 2005 at the school.","Lori Carmichael Quigley is accused of having sex with multiple students .

Steve Miller, whose teen daughter hosted the party and was among those rushed to hospital, told local TV he was asleep while as many as 100 people crammed into his home. Miller, a father of six, claimed he had no idea there would be alcohol at the party - but did not say if he had checked. He insisted he slept through all the noise as 100 teens flocked to his home in Winter Garden, Florida. 'If my daughter told me they were going to have alcohol I wouldn't have permitted it,'Miller said. 'I didn't see any drugs.' Hospitalized: Five teenagers were taken to hospital suffering from the after-effects of drink and drugs . Unwanted attention: As soon as the cops showed up, most of the guests ran off . Denial: Steve Miller whose home the party was held at says he never saw any alcohol and would have known about it if there was (even though he claims to have been asleep) Police said the teenagers taken to hospital had passed out from drink but fear they may have also taken drugs. 'We found five teenagers who appeared to have overdosed on alcohol and we are not sure of what type of drug right now,'said Lt. Paul Hopkins from the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Investigators said they spotted numerous underage kids partying at the home. They said one was unconscious and five were sickened, apparently from drinking too much alcohol. The victims were boys and girls between the ages of 15 and 17. Neighbors were stunned by the scenes in their road on Friday night and said they were kept awake by the noise. 'I've . been living here 30 years, and I've never really seen anything going on . over there. It just surprises me. I'm like, 'Wow.' Hopefully, the kids . are going to be OK,' a neighbor said. Deputies . said the conditions of the teens had improved over the weekend and they . said the parents apparently didn't know someone had brought alcohol . into the home. Doreen Blume said Miller's daughter was one of the hospitalized teens. Blume said Miller did the right thing. 'He confiscated all kinds of alcohol, big bottles,' Blume said. Other neighbors said deputies have been to the home before. The Department of Children and Families has launched an investigation because of concerns about alcohol and supervision.

"By . Paul Thompson . An al Qaeda supergrass is to give evidence against hate preacher Abu Hamza and show he was a 'terrorist with a global reach'. British-born Saajid Muhammad Badat will be the star witness when Hamza goes on trial in New York later this year, according to court papers. Badat, who was jailed for plotting to blow up a U.S. passenger jet with shoe bomber Richard Reid and later released for agreeing to become the first terrorist supergrass, has agreed to give evidence via a video link. British-born Saajid Muhammad Badat will be the star witness when Abu Hamza goes on trial in New York later this year having turned from terrorist to supergrass . Abu Hamza, who lost an eye and two hands fighting the Russians in Afghanistan, is also charged with providing material support to the al Qaeda network by trying to set up a training camp in Oregon . Prosecutors in the U.S. believe Badat's evidence will help convict Hamza. Assistant U.S. Prosecutor Ian McGinley said in court filings Badat will show Hamza 'was a terrorist leader of global reach, who among other things, sent his young lieutenants around the world to engage in terror training'. Badat was released from prison in 2010 after striking a deal with British authorities to give evidence in future terror trials. The 33-year-old had been jailed for 13 years in 2005 for taking part in the plot to blow up a U.S. passenger jet along with Richard Reid. He admitted being personally briefed on the plan by terror mastermind Osama bin Laden. But Badat backed out at the last minute while shoe bomber Reid went ahead and was foiled by passengers who subdued him before he could explode his bomb on the Paris to Miami flight in 2001. Reid is serving a life sentence in the SuperMax prison in Colorado and will never be released. Badat, from Gloucester in the south-west of England, has been re-housed using taxpayers' money and given money towards the cost of office space and education courses to help him get a job. His mobile phone bills and internet are paid for by Scotland Yard. Face of shoe bombs: Richard Reid will never be released from a SuperMax prison in Colorado for trying to detonate a shoe bomb on a flight from Paris to Miami in 2001 . U.S. prosecutors are hoping Badat's evidence will help secure a conviction of Hamza who was extradited from Britain after a lengthy legal battle. He will give evidence by video link as he is afraid if he attends the trial in New York he will be arrested by U.S. authorities. Hamza, who lost his hands and an eye fighting the Russians in Afghanistan, faces a life sentence if convicted. He is accused of being involved in hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian. He is also charged with providing material support to the al Qaeda network by trying to set up a training camp in Oregon and attempting to organize support for the Taliban in Afghanistan. While being held in a U.S. prison, Hamza has complained about the harsh conditions and claims the stumps of his hands have become infected. A plea to move to a 'softer' jail was rejected by U.S. authorities. Badat is well known to U.S. terror chiefs and has already given evidence via a video link against a group of terrorists who plotted to blow up the subway. He is also due to be the star witness at the trial of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and  bin Laden's son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghayth. Abu Ghayth goes on trial later this month accused of holding terror training camps. Prosecutors do not name Badat in their court filings but refer to him as a witness who .agreed to participate. in the shoe bomb plot in 2001. U.S. Federal Judge Katherine Forrest, who will oversee Hamza's trial in April, is expected to agree to the request.","British-born Saajid Muhammad Badat will be the star witness when Hamza goes on trial in New York later this year .

"By . Paul Thompson . A man has told how he survived after getting sucked into wood chipper. Frank Arce was attempting to dislodge some wood when the machine suddenly started up. Metal spikes and claws that can shred a tree branch in seconds began pummeling his body. He suffered seven broken ribs, a toe, his ankle and his pelvis. Scroll down for video from KATU-TV . Lucky to be alive: Frank Arce, 23, is recovering after he fell THROUGH a wood chipper this week. He was badly injured but escaped with his life . The chipper broke Mr Arce's ankle and toe - as well as cracking his ribs and pelvis . The 23-year-old also suffered an open fracture to his knee, numerous cuts and a collapsed lung. He is recovering at Peace Health Southwest Medical Center in Vancouver, Washington, where he has undergone multiple surgeries since the accident. Speaking about the accident he told KATU-TV: 'Basically I was praying for the best and preparing for the worst. 'In a situation like that, that's honestly all you could do.' Mr Arce added: 'Actually going through the machine itself wasn't the worst part about it. 'What was the worst part (was) the not knowing what was going to happen.' Mr Arce was conscious the entire time he was sucked into the machine and pushed out on to a conveyor belt. He was working at the Swanson Bark and Wood Products company when the bark-stripping machine jammed. Colleagues switched off the power as Mr Arce reached into the wood chipper. He said he was satisfied all safety procedures had been followed and was confident the machine was off. But health and safety investigators found the machine known as a porcupine was still switched on and started up pulling him inside. The porcupine consists of six to seven-inch-long tines, which are curved that spin on shaft to break apart and fluff-up bark. Mr Arce said the equipment left gashes in his hard hat. He believes his slim frame also helped him survive. Mr Arce landed on a conveyor belt about six feet below where he had been standing. Coworkers shut down the machinery when they heard him scream. They applied compresses and kept Mr Arce calm and conscious while he waited for paramedics. 'They kept their cool enough to keep me calm,' Mr Arce said. Frank Arce's ordeal is reminiscent of THAT gruesome scene from the 1996 Coen Brothers film 'Fargo' - though Mr Arce was far more fortunate . 'Everything happened so fast. It's hard to put it in words. They handled it in the best way they possibly could, which I'm eternally grateful for. 'There was a thought (that I was going to die) but it was more like something was telling me I wasn't going to die that day,' he said. 'I felt I had a lot of angels out there with me that day a lot of people looking out for me.' Keeping him calm help keep his heart rate down and slowed his blood loss, he said. Paramedics took Mr Arce to St. John Medical, where he was stabilized and sent to PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center in Vancouver. Mr Arce said doctors expect he'll remain hospitalized for at least three weeks, but he  is bracing for a 'lengthy' recovery process. 'It's a long road ahead of him,' his mother, Brenda Arce. 'He could face some permanent nerve damage.' The state Bureau of Labor and Industries is investigating the accident.","Frank Arce was sucked into an industrial-sized chipper when it turned on as he tried to dislodge a piece of wood .

"By . Paul Thompson . Joseph Julian Guerra, 28, was jailed for 60 years after kidnapping a woman and carving his name into her thighs in Texas . A pimp who kidnapped a prostitute and carved his name into her thighs has been jailed for 60 years. Joseph Julian Guerra was convicted after a two-day trial during which the jury heard horrific details of the injuries suffered by Margaret Dodd. After having her hands and feet bound with duct tape she was smashed in the face with a metal skillet. The victim was punched, kicked and kneed in the face breaking her nose and knocking out her teeth. Guerra, 28, used a knife to carve his nickname 'Ace' into her thighs. The victim told the court that Guerra also tried to strangle her with a wrench and threatened to rape her with a knife, according to Dallas News. The court in Collin County, Texas, heard the 20-year-old escaped after Guerra fell asleep. She ran to a neighbor who was so terrified by the sight of the blood-soaked woman that she refused to let her in. The . neighbor called 911 and the woman was found battered and bleeding by . police sitting on a curb outside a house in Allen, Texas in July 2012. The court heard Guerra told the woman he carved his name into her so that she would 'always remember him'. After finding the woman, police entered Guerra's home and found him sleeping soundly next to his one-year-old daughter. Prosecutors told jurors that Guerra took advantage of Dodd and became her pimp. After she lost $700 she owed him, Guerra set out to teach her a lesson, prosecutors said. Prior to sentencing Dodd ran out an impact statement saying: 'Since the day I met you, you had complete control over everything. That’s done now.' Dodd told Guerra she forgave him prompting Guerra to apologize. 'I'm sorry,' he said. District Judge Scott Becker ordered Guerra to stop talking and when he said sorry again and said that he loved her was removed from the courtroom. The sentences for the aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charges are identical and will be served at the same time. Guerra can be considered for parole after serving at least 30 years of his 60-year sentence.

"By . Paul Thompson . and Alasdair Baverstock In Caracas, Venezuela . Monica Spear’s father today told MailOnline that he intends to fight for the custody of his five-year old granddaughter saying he wants to take her back to the US. Rafael Spear, the father of the former Miss Venezuela murdered with her husband in a brutal street-side robbery on Monday, spoke as it emerged the little girl, Maya, has been told the shattering news and will attend her parents' funeral. 'It’s my aim to get Maya out of the country', Mr Spear said today in an interview at the couple's lying in state ceremony in Caracas’s East Cemetery. Ms Spear and her husband, Thomas Berry, will be buried side by side tomorrow. Scroll down for video . Despicable: . Maya was also shot by the robbers who killed her mother and father in . cold blood. The brave girl has now left hospital and been given the . crushing news they are dead . Future: Monica's father, from Orlando, told MailOnline that he will fight to bring Maya to the US with him insisting that Venezuela is not place to bring up a child. The child's paternal grandparents live in the country, however . 'Maya is my priority now and I need the Venezuelan government to help me obtain her guardianship', he stated. 'We have an agreement with the Berrys that the best for Maya is to be outside Venezuela'. Meanwhile, Thomas Berry's father, also called Thomas, who moved from Britain to live in Venezuela thirty years ago, insists that the decision over his granddaughter’s future 'has yet to be discussed'. 'We are leaving all decisions about Maya until after the funeral proceedings', he told MailOnline. 'Such things have a time and a place and it is improper to discuss them now. The most important thing is that Maya is safe'. Should Maya remain with her British father's parents, she will move into their house in Los Palos Grandes, a secure and clean part of Caracas. Vow: Rafael Spear, 61, told MailOnline: 'Maya is my priority now and I need the Venezuelan government to help me obtain her guardianship' Mourning: The couple will be laid to rest side by side because family say 'that's how they lived their lives' Carolina Spear, sister of actress Monica Spear, stands behind her father as she mourns the departure of her sister at a cemetery in Caracas, Venezuela .

'This country is no place to grow up', he said, his voice choked by tears. Maya is currently in the custody of Monica Spear’s cousins in Caracas. While Venezuelan law states that an orphaned child’s custody is transferred to the maternal side, the fact that all of Monica Spear’s immediate family live outside the country may become problematic. The Berrys, Maya’s paternal grandparents, have lived in Caracas for over thirty years and would be the preferred option for a government which is strongly anti-US. The couple's five-year-old daughter Maya survived the shooting after being hit in the leg and is recovering in a Caracas hospital, although she doesn't yet know that her parents are dead . The couple were gunned down during a . robbery on the Puerto-Cabello to Valencia highway in Venezuela's . Carabobo state on Monday. Maya was in their car with them and suffered a . glancing wound to her leg during the robbery. She was treated in hospital but did not require any surgery. 'The biggest tragedy is that Maya will never get to know her parents', said Alfonso Pedemonte, one of Thomas Berry’s closest friends. 'They were perfect parents. Their families must now think about what’s best for her'. On Wednesday the brother of Ms Spear, Ricardo, said the family had yet to tell Maya that . her mother and father, were dead. But on her release from hospital the bewildered little girl was told the shattering news. The beauty queen and Mr Berry will be buried side by side on Friday in a funeral expected to attract thousands of mourners, MailOnline has learned.

A colour photograph from the couple's wedding day with Thomas scooping his stunning bride up in the air was placed between the two coffins. As family members solemnly walked into the room they were met with hugs and kisses. Many could be see openly weeping after viewing the two victims. Thomas's father emerged briefly from the glass room with his wife Kate. Her eyes eyes were red rimmed from weeping and she buried her face in the shoulder of friend who had come to console her. Ricardo, 22, said the family were overwhelmed by the love and support they had received. He said he knew his sister was popular in Venezuela but was surprised by the the number of people who turned up for the public viewing. 'It just shows you how much Monica was loved by the people here. She loved this country, and they loved her.' The . pair, who were never formally divorced, were taking a New Year holiday . as a family following more than a year’s estrangement which many thought was a sign of reconciliation. Love: . Relatives said they told Monica to return to the US. but said she was . so in love with the country and wanted to teach her daughter about it . 'They . truly loved each other, and their daughter only cemented their love”, . said Monica's father, Rafael Spear, who had flown in from his home in Orlando to attend . his daughter’s funeral.

'We all expected them to return from holiday . with the news that they were back together again'. The . camera bag belonging to the murdered Miss Venezuela Monica Spear has . been found in the possession of the only woman arrested in connection . with the case. As family members made final . preparations for the funeral new details emerged about the gang alleged . to have carried out the brutal killing. The only woman among the six arrested was found to have Spear's camera bag in her possession. The female bandit is known as Eva ""Guns"" Mejias. Authorities were quizzing Mejias and six men aged from 15 to 26. The . group which believed to have carried out the murder acted from a . building where they were squatters known as El Churro, a notoriously . dangerous government project in the region. Residents of El Cambur, the village . close to the squatters den, have told local press that their lives had . been ruined by the invasion of the building by the dangerous gang a few . years ago. 'Before we could go where we wanted, but since they moved in and established a ""Red Zone'. 'I have to take a different route home at night to avoid it?, one resident of the sector told El Nacional. 'There . are police and military patrols on the highway, said  Mary Gonzalez, . another resident of El Cambur. But there is no phone signal, a lot of . places to hide and although everyone knows where the gang is squatting . no one has done anything about it'.

A still from a short film showing the actress riding before she blew a kiss to the camera on the day she died . 'It's only now that this tragedy has occurred that they have done anything.' The . couple and Maya are believed to have been targeted by the robbers after . they left an obstacle in the road, causing the car to tire to puncture. A tow truck arrived and was being loaded onto it when the armed gang . approached. It is believed the couple locked them inside and the gang fired through the windows, killing them and injuring Maya. The . only two witnesses to the crime are two men from the road rescue team . who fled for their lives as the couple were in the car. The deaths of the couple has led to the country's President to meet with regional leaders to discuss ways of combatting the crime wave that has plagued the south American country. President Nicolas Maduro, who has been criticised for failing to halt the 24,000 murders a year suggested Wednesday that the murder of soap star Monica Spear and her ex-husband was a targeted hit and not a random robbery gone wrong. 'That assassination seems more like a contract killing,' he said. 'We have identified those involved in this assassination and we are going to look for them.' Maduro provided no evidence that that Spears was the victim of a murder-for-hire.","Maya Spear was orphaned when her mother Monica Spear Mootz and father Thomas Berry were gunned down in front of her in their broken down car in Venezuela .

"By . Paul Thompson . and Daily Mail Reporter . 'Evil twin?' Brian Lucas has been accused by his twin brother of being the real culprit behind a series of sex assaults . This is is the man whose brother claims is the 'evil twin' - the real culprit behind sex assaults in Texas and Alabama. Decorated U.S. Army Lieutenant Aaron Lucas faces charges that he tried to abduct 11 young girls and sexually assaulted three outside Fort Carson, Colorado. But, he claims he is being framed and that it is really his twin brother Brian Lucas who is responsible. Brian Lucas has lived in two of the same states as Lt Aaron Lucas and drives a black Acura sedan, the same vehicle identified by several of the victims in the case. But Brian claims he has nothing to do with the sex cases and that he has never been to El Paso County, Colorado, where the crimes too place. DNA evidence from Lt Lucas matched . him to several of the cases, as well as two attempted assaults on young . girls in Texas and Alabama. DNA is unique for every person in the world - except identical twins, for whom the pattern is almost exactly the same. Lt . Lucas' attorneys won the right last week to argue at his trial that his . twin brother Brian could have been behind the sex crimes. Prosecutors, though, aren't convinced and Lt Lucas remains their only suspect in the crimes. Look similar? Lieutenant Aaron Lucas (left) says witnesses are mistaking him for his brother Brian Lucas (right). Brian says he has never been near the area where the crimes too place . Lt Lucas, who won the Bronze Star - one of the military's highest honors, was arrested last year in connection with a child abduction and an attempted child abduction over the summer. But detectives realized the 32-year-old matched the description of a suspect in as many as 11 attempted abductions. DNA taken from an attempted abduction in Colorado matched samples taken from crime scenes in Alabama in 2007 and Texas two years later. Lawyers for the officer claim the DNA was from his twin brother Brian, who lived in both states at the time of the attacks. As identical twins the brothers share the same DNA. 'War hero': Aaron Lucas is the recipient of the Bronze Star, the fourth highest military honor in the country . Brian Lucas has not been charged and could not be located for comment, reports the Colorado Springs Gazette. It said Brian Lucas had previous addresses in Madison and in Texas. Aaron Lucas' attorneys say an unidentified third man is responsible for the Colorado assaults. El Paso County prosecutors said the Colorado victims' ages ranged from six to nine and that they were targeted at random in Colorado Springs and nearby Fountain by a man who tried to coax them into sex with promises of money and ice cream. Prosecutors contend three girls were assaulted during the encounters. The incidents began shortly after Aaron Lucas' arrival at Fort Carson with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. A Colorado Springs police detective, Fred Walker, has testified the assaults stopped while Aaron Lucas was deployed to Afghanistan. Stationed: The crimes began shortly after Aaron Lucas' arrival at Fort Carson with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division . Lucas received . the Bronze Star, the fourth-highest honor given to members of the . military, for valor during a deployment to Afghanistan. In his four years of active duty, Lucas amassed a glowing military resume including 10 medals and awards. He is being held at El Paso County jail on $1.2 million bond. He goes on trial in January and could face life behind bars if convicted. A judge in Colorado Springs, Colorado, has said she will allow Lucas to blame his twin brother. District Judge David Shakes ruled Friday it would be 'inappropriate' to bar 1st Lt. Aaron Lucas' lawyers from presenting his identical twin as an alternate suspect given the siblings' shared DNA. 'Whether it's persuasive or not that's not my role,' the judge said. 'It's the role of the jury.' Karen Steinhauser, a criminal defense attorney and adjunct law professor at the University of Denver, told The Associated Press such an argument is rare. 'I have never seen it, ever,' she said.

Prosecutors with the Orange County District Attorney's office allege that he lied under oath during the civil proceedings that arose from the rhinoplasty operation in 2009. District Attorney's investigator Kathy Tomlinson has appealed for other patients who believe they might have been over billed to contact her. Dr Calvert is said to have many celebrity clients. In 2010 he issued a press release which said he was 'known also for the successful surgery results of celebrity clients.'

"By . Mark Prigg . 3.7 million year old soil found deep in a martian crater has given researchers a tantalising clue that life could still exist on the red planet. Recent images from Curiosity from the impact Gale Crater reveal Earth-like soil profiles with cracked surfaces similar to those in Antarctic Dry Valleys and Chile's Atacama Desert, a new paper reveals. Chemical analysis shows a structure similar to soil containing microbes on Earth - with one expert proclaiming the new research shows 'there is a real possibility that there is or was life on Mars.' Scroll down for video . This recent image from Curiosity from the impact Gale Crater reveal Earth-like soil profiles with cracked surfaces lined with sulfate, ellipsoidal hollows and concentrations of sulfate comparable with soils in Antarctic Dry Valleys and Chile's Atacama Desert. Malcolm Walter of the Australian Centre for Astrobiology, who was not involved in the research, said the potential discovery of these fossilized soils in the Gale Crater dramatically increases the possibility that Mars has microbes. 'There is a real possibility that there is or was life on Mars,' he wrote. Steven Benner of the Westheimer Institute of Science and Technology in Florida has speculated that life is more likely to have originated on a soil planet like Mars than a water planet like Earth. In an email, Benner wrote that Retallack's paper 'shows not only soils that might be direct products of an early Martian life, but also the wet-dry cycles that many models require for the emergence of life. University of Oregon geologist Gregory Retallack made the discovery based on images and data captured by the rover Curiosity. The research adds to the growing body of evidence that microbial life once existed on the red planet. His analyses appear in a paper placed online this week by the journal Geology. Retallack, the paper's lone author, studied mineral and chemical data published by researchers closely tied with the Curiosity mission. 'The pictures were the first clue, but then all the data really nailed it,' Retallack said. 'The key to this discovery has been the superb chemical and mineral analytical capability of the Curiosity Rover, which is an order of magnitude improvement over earlier generations of rovers. 'The new data show clear chemical weathering trends, and clay accumulation at the expense of the mineral olivine, as expected in soils on Earth. 'Phosphorus depletion within the profiles is especially tantalizing, because it attributed to microbial activity on Earth.' The ancient soils, he said, do not prove that Mars once contained life, but they do add to growing evidence that an early wetter and warmer Mars was more habitable than the planet has been in the past 3 billion years. Moon Valley Valle de la Luna Salt Mountain Range Atacama Desert Chile: Researchers say soil on Mars has a similar chemical composition to the area . Curiosity rover is now exploring topographically higher and geologically younger layers within the crater, where the soils appear less conducive to life. For a record of older life and soils on Mars, Retallack said, new missions will be needed to explore older and more clayey terrains. Surface cracks in the deeply buried soils suggest typical soil clods. Vesicular hollows, or rounded holes, and sulfate concentrations, he said, are both features of desert soils on Earth. 'None of these features is seen in younger surface soils of Mars,' Retallack said. 'The exploration of Mars, like that of other planetary bodies, commonly turns up unexpected discoveries, but it is equally unexpected to discover such familiar ground.' The newly discovered soils provide more benign and habitable soil conditions than known before on Mars. Their dating to 3.7 billion years ago, he noted, puts them into a time of transition from 'an early benign water cycle on Mars to the acidic and arid Mars of today.' Life on Earth is believed to have emerged and began diversifying about 3.5 billion years ago, but some scientists have theorized that potential evidence that might take life on Earth farther back was destroyed by plate tectonics, which did not occur on Mars. In an email, Malcolm Walter of the Australian Centre for Astrobiology, who was not involved in the research, said the potential discovery of these fossilized soils in the Gale Crater dramatically increases the possibility that Mars has microbes. 'There is a real possibility that there is or was life on Mars,' he wrote. Retallack noted that Steven Benner of the Westheimer Institute of Science and Technology in Florida has speculated that life is more likely to have originated on a soil planet like Mars than a water planet like Earth. In an email, Benner wrote that Retallack's paper 'shows not only soils that might be direct products of an early Martian life, but also the wet-dry cycles that many models require for the emergence of life.'","Images from Curiosity show cracked surfaces similar to those in Antarctic Dry Valleys and Chile's Atacama Desert .

"By . Mark Prigg . It is a tale of two phone firms. As Microsoft confirms it is laying off 18,000 workers, mainly in the mobile phone business it bought from Nokia, iPhone maker Foxconn has confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the iPhone 6. It comes as 4.7-inch iPhone production is expected to start next week, with the larger 5.5inch version set to start three weeks later. Scroll down for video . An image last week, also leaked by Sonny Dickson, revealed the two new iPhone 6 models side-by-side . Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As . the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced . using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and . polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in . the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. The Economic Daily said Foxconn had finally confirmed the rumours it would hire a huge number of staff. The latest report appears to contradict earlier claims the larger  'phablet' sized iPhone 6 won't ship until 2015, . Analyst believed the firm has hit problems manufacturing the handset's case and screen, and would now only launch a 4.7inch version this year. The handset is expected to have a new 'indestructible' sapphire glass screen. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the problems were found while Apple produced the smaller handset, according to 9to5mac. 'Production bottlenecks on 4.7-inch iPhone 6 center on the yield rate of in-cell touch panel and metal casing,' claims . 'As in-cell touch panel becomes larger in size, the edge of the panel may become insensitive to touch. 'Meanwhile, under new manufacturing process for the iPhone 6 metal casing, color unevenness is an issue.' According to 9th5mac, Kuo says that these problems become more complicated with the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6. 'As these new concerns are coupled with earlier concerns about the production of sapphire displays for the larger device, the analyst believes that the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 may not launch by the end of 2014, or may launch after October in very limited quantities.' Kuo also believes that Apple will cut the prices of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c alongside the launch of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6. Prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). The photos suggest Apple is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5-inch phone . Previous leaks have claimed the handset will have a virtually indestructible screen made of sapphire. A YouTube videomaker claims to have acquired one of the screens - and has subjected it to a barrage of abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting it. In the video, the screen emerges totally unscathed - raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from Apple. Marques Brownlee, a popular YouTube host claims to have got the screen from well known Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who recently made his own video showcasing the screen. Models of the new iPhone 5s (front) and iPhone 5c (back) are on display at the Apple Store in Berlin. Kuo also believes that Apple will cut the prices of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c alongside the launch of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6. In the video he can be seen bending and twisting the screen. 'I slowly realized there is absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power,' he said. 'The worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much.' The glass is also extremely high-quality, Brownlee noted: 'There’s absolutely no color shift while looking through the sapphire glass.' The iPhone 6 screen being repeatedly stabbed by a knife: The sapphire glass emerges unscathed from the video trial which also sees in being bent and scratched with keys . It is claimed the screen is made from sapphire crystal. Apple already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the 'Home' button and camera lens in the iPhone 5S, but the rest of the current iPhone front display is made of Gorilla Glass. The new glass display is 'paper thin,' Brownlee said in his video. Brownlee shows his screen measures 4.7 inches diagonally, keeping with rumors that Apple will release two different-sized iPhones this year: A 4.7-inch model and 5.5-inch one. Reports Apple was experimenting with sapphire displays began last year, yet sources claimed at the time Apple found the technology ‘infeasible.’ Marques Brownlee standing on the screen and bending it. When released, it goes back it its normal shape, raising hopes the new handset will have an almost indestructible screen. The screen is also shown being repeatedly stabbed by a knife - and emerging with no scratches . This was because sapphire glass is more expensive to produce than normal screens. However, Apple recently announced plans to open a mineral plant in Arizona with sapphire glass experts GT Advanced Technologies. The facility is expected to employ around 700 people to manufacture sapphire crystal and sapphire glass, and this technology could make its way onto the screens of the next iPhone. The screen is described as 'paper thin' It also survives having keys scratched across its surface - a common problem for iPhone owners . In a statement about the announcement, GT Advanced Technologies said: ‘Although the agreement does not guarantee volumes, it does require GT to maintain a minimum level of capacity.’ While an Apple spokesman added: 'We are proud to expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in Arizona, creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering, manufacturing and construction. ‘This new plant will make components for Apple products and it will run on 100 per cent renewable energy from day one, as a result of the work we are doing with SRP to create green energy sources to power the facility.’ Earlier this week iPhone maker Foxconn revealed Apple's new iPhone 6 could be the first to be made using its 'robot army'. The firm has pledged to have a million robot workers by the end of the year - and CEO Terry Gou has revealed the robots, dubbed 'Foxbots', are in the final stages of testing. It is believed Foxconn will install 10,000 robots as a test. Workers are seen inside a Foxconn factory in the township of Longhua in the southern Guangdong province. The firm is believed to be installing thousands of robots to help build Apple's latest iPhone. Lines dedicated to Apple devices getting first priority, according to IT Home. It says Gou told a shareholder meeting that Apple would be the first company to take advantage of the new robot workers meaning that its next product - the iPhone 6 - will be manufactured in this way. Each $25,000 Foxbot can complete an average of 30,000 devices per year it has been claimed. Foxconn, which currently employs more than 1.2 million workers at its various factories across China. However, the firm's robot initiative has been delayed since it was first announced in 2011. At the time, Gou said the company had about 10,000 units already in operation, a number that was supposed to rise to 300,000 in 2012, then one million by 2014. However, the firm is also ramping up human workers for the iPhone 6, with 100,00 being hired according to some reports. Dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show Apple's iPhone 6. They all show a thin, curved device with distinctive white 'bars' across the back. However, a Japanese news agency has claimed that in fact, the finished product will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen.","4.7-inch iPhone production to start third week of July .

"By . Mark Prigg . It is the nearest there has ever been a nightclub on another planey. Nasa today revealed video footage showing its Curiosity rover firing lasers on the red planet. The ChemCam laser instrument has zapped more than 600 rock and soil targets on Mars since Curiosity landed in the planet's Gale Crater in August 2012 - but this is the first time the process has been seen. Scroll down for video . The flashes occurred while the rover's Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument fired multiple laser shots at the baseball-sized rock to investigate the rock's composition. Preliminary analysis of the ChemCam spectra from this target rock, appropriately named 'Nova,' indicates a composition rich in silicon, aluminum and sodium, beneath a dust layer poor in those elements. This is typical of rocks that Curiosity is encountering on its way toward Mount Sharp. The flashes appear on a baseball-size Martian rock in a series of images taken on Saturday by the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) camera on the arm of NASA's Curiosity Mars Rover. The flashes occurred while the rover's Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument fired multiple laser shots to investigate the rock's composition. 'This is so exciting! The ChemCam laser has fired more than 150,000 times on Mars, but this is the first time we see the plasma plume that is created,' said ChemCam Deputy Principal Investigator Sylvestre Maurice, at the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology, of France's National Center for Scientific Research and the University of Toulouse, France. 'Each time the laser hits a target, the plasma light is caught and analyzed by ChemCam's spectrometers. NASA's Curiosity Mars rover used the camera on its arm to catch the first images of sparks produced by the rover's laser being shot at a rock on Mars. The left image is from before the laser zapped this rock, called ""Nova."" The spark is at the center of the right image. 'What the new images add is confirmation that the size and shape of the spark are what we anticipated under Martian conditions.'

This pattern is typical of many rocks examined with the rover's laser-firing ChemCam. MAHLI Deputy Principal Investigator Aileen Yingst of the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona, said, 'One of the reasons we took these images is that they allow the ChemCam folks to compare the plume to those they imaged on Earth. 'Also, MAHLI has captured images of other activities of Curiosity, for documentation purposes, and this was an opportunity to document the laser in action.","The ChemCam laser instrument has zapped more than 600 rock and soil targets on Mars .

"By . Mark Prigg . Airbnb has defended its controversial new logo, claiming it will become as recognisable as the Nike swoosh. 'It’s just like: Go ahead, laugh all you want, guys,' said Airbnb co-founder and CTO Nathan Blecharczyk at a dinner in San Francisco. 'We wouldn’t want to design a logo that caters to the lowest common denominator.' Scroll down for video . Whoops! People across the Internet are saying that Airbnb's new logo looks obscene . Online users pointed out the logo is almost identical to tech firm Automation Anywhere's. The two firms told VentureBeat 'In early 2014 both Airbnb and Automation Anywhere began use of new logos that, by coincidence, have similar designs. 'Airbnb and Automation Anywhere are working cooperatively to address this issue, and Automation Anywhere is in the process of transitioning to a new logo design that is not similar to the Airbnb logo.' The new logo, created by U.K. design firm The Design Studio, drew comparisons to various body parts now only because it didn’t have the Airbnb brand attached to it yet, Blecharczyk told a reporter from tech website re/code. 'If you looked at the Nike swoosh, you might say it’s a check mark, but once you understand the context, it means something else,' he said. 'The symbol is not supposed to be a symbol, it’s supposed to be something with meaning.' The firm has even given a the logo its own name, calling it a bélo - causing more amusement on social media sites. 'The bélo is a vehicle for rich, deep, emotional, human stories,' the firm sad. Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky said the logo was inspired by famous logos from around the world, like the Olympic rings and Batman symbol. 'We’ve created a symbol for us as a community,' he said in a blog post announcing the change. 'It’s an iconic mark for our windows, our doors, and our shared values. The firm has also launched an online tool allowing users to create their own version of the logo, which it says can then be printed on mugs and t-shirts . 'It’s a symbol that, like us, can belong wherever it happens to be.' DesignStudio, the London-based team of graphic designers behind it, says on its website that the goal was to 'design a marque anyone could draw - something that transcended language and formed the foundation of a new brand.' Airbnb's co-founder Brian Chesky said the new logo represents: . 'A symbol for people who want to try a new tea they’ve never heard of from a village they couldn’t find on the map. 'It’s a symbol for going where the locals go—the cafe that doesn’t bother with a menu, the dance club hidden down a long alleyway, the art galleries that don’t show up in the guidebooks. 'It’s a symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.' Twitter user shaunpendy designed an infographic providing one possible explanation for how the logo came to be. In addition to people, places, and love, he said the final component was 'truck nuts.'

"By . Mark Prigg . Facebook's new buy button . Facebook is testing a new 'buy' button on its website that will let consumers purchase and pay for products without have to leave the site. The button wil appear in ads, and take users to a page to process their payment. The new service, which Facebook described as a test with a 'few small and medium-sized businesses' in the United States, represents the Internet social networking company's latest effort to play a bigger role in the e-commerce business. Facebook said its new Buy button will be available on the mobile and desktop PC version of its website and will allow consumers to purchase goods directly from participating businesses. 'None of the credit or debit card information people share with Facebook when completing a transaction will be shared with other advertisers, and people can select whether or not they’d like to save payment information for future purchases,' the company said in a blog post. Facebook is not currently taking any portion of the revenue for products sold with the Buy button, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Credit card transactions will be handled by a third-party payment processing company, the person said. Facebook in 2012 introduced a way for its users to buy their friends gifts such as socks and teddy bears. However, Facebook stopped selling physical goods through the service after a year, letting consumers buy only gift cards instead.

"By . Mark Prigg . Drinking frequently could improve your social standing, researchers have claimed. Researchers studied the drinking habits of people in Toronto, and said that in men in particular, heavy drinking appeared to earn them more respect. For women, any drinking seemed to result in a higher social status. Jon Hamm's character Don Draper in Mad Men famously drinks his way through the series. Now researchers say drinking frequently could improve your social standing, researchers have claimed. Drinking in excess kills about 88,000 people a year, according to the CDC. It says one in six U.S. adults binge drinks about four times a month, consuming about eight drinks per binge. Although college students commonly binge drink, 70% of binge drinking episodes involve adults age 26 years and older. Binge drinking is associated with many health problems, including an increased risk of injuries, alcohol poisoning, STDs, unwanted pregnancies and liver disease. Drinking too much, including binge drinking, cost the United States $223.5 billion in 2006, or $1.90 a drink, from losses in productivity, health care, crime, and other expenses. Dr. Tara Dumas, a postdoctoral fellow at Canada's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, studied 357 young adults in Ontario between May and July 2012. They asked participants how much binge episodes - which included the number of drinks consumed, and how often these episodes happened - influenced their opinions of friends. 'We used field methodology to recruit young adults' natural drinking groups,' the team wrote in a paper be published in the October issue of Addictive Behaviors. 'For men, more frequent heavy drinking was related to higher peer-nominated status. 'For women, more drinking in general was related to higher peer-nominated status.' The team so found that during binge drinking episodes, those who could drink the most emerged with the highest social status. 'For women, more drinking in general was related to higher peer-nominated status,' the researchers said. 'More consumption during heaviest drinking occasion also predicted higher status. 'Further, for both men and women, drinking more than one's peers during one's heaviest drinking occasion in the past year was also associated with higher status.' The team say the researcher could influence alcohol awareness programmes. 'These findings suggest that higher social status is associated with riskier drinking patterns and have important implications for prevention programming.","Researchers studied the drinking habits of people in Toronto .

The new glass surface that reduces both glare and reflection, which continue to plague even the best mobile displays today. On a very fine scale, they roughened a glass surface so it could scatter light and ward off glare but without hurting the glass’s transparency. Then the researchers etched nano-size teeth into the surface to make it anti-reflective. In addition to achieving both of these visual traits, the researchers showed the textured surface repelled water, mimicking a lotus leaf.

The firms announced an unpredecented project to release more than 100 apps aimed at everything from healthcare to banking. They will also join forces to try and sell iPads and iPhones to business users. The partnership, which was six months in the making, will offer services geared at security, mobile device management and big data and analytics. The company also plans to develop cloud services optimized for Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. The two firms will release more than 100 apps targeting industry specific issues in retail, healthcare, banking, travel, transportation and telecommunications. Until now Apple's expansion has been driven by employees bringing in their own devices and requesting corporate support, the so-called bring-your-own-IT trend. Partnering with IBM could help address lingering concerns about smartphone software security and data privacy, and help the pair wrestle business away from firms like Blackberry. The announcement, just two days before IBM releases its second quarter earnings, comes as the company attempts to shift its focus to software and services as its hardware unit continues to slump, and follows a string of mobile software acquisitions. The company hopes software sales will contribute half of its total profit by 2015. The company will release more than 100 apps targeting industry specific issues in retail, healthcare, banking, travel, transportation and telecommunications IBM said on Tuesday. 'We wanted to focus on creating an absolutely irresistible workflow and processes and a design of apps that can be used by every user in the organization,' Bridget van Kralingen, IBM's senior vice president of global business services told Reuters from Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California. 'We wanted to remove some of the existing barriers of mobile in enterprise,' she said adding that chief information officers worry about security, utilizing cloud and installing apps in mobile devices.

"By . Mark Prigg . Lesbian, gay, and bisexual people may be more likely to smoke and drink excessively, a major new study has found. The new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also found that 1.6% of Americans identified as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identified as bisexual. 'Significant differences were found in health-related behaviors, health status, health care service utilization, and health care access among U.S. adults aged 18–64 who identified as straight, gay or lesbian, or bisexual,' the report found. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also found that 1.6% of Americans identified as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identified as bisexual .

"By . Mark Prigg . Researchers have warned of an impending health epidemic caused by a huge rise in the number of students smoking hookah pipes. A new study found 18% of high school seniors have reported engaging in behavior researchers describe as 'equivalent to smoking 10-40 cigarettes in a single sitting, and then kissing everybody as well'. Researchers say the students are unaware of the potential health risks - and believe new, small hookah 'pens' similar to e-cigarettes could lead to major health problems. A new study found 18% of high school seniors have smoked hookahs - and say it could lead to a health epidemic . Hookah, an ancient form of smoking, in which charcoal-heated tobacco or non-tobacco based shisha smoke is passed through water before inhalation, is rapidly gaining popularity among adolescents in the US. The new study by researchers affiliated with New York University's Center for Drug Use and HIV Research (CDUHR), in the August 2014 edition of Pediatrics identifies how prevalent Hookah use is and which teens are most likely to be using it. The researchers found the annual prevalence (use in the last 12 months) of hookah use was nearly 1 in 5 high school seniors. 'What we find most interesting is that students of higher socioeconomic status appear to be more likely to use hookah,' said Joseph Palamar of NYU Langone Medical Center. 'Surprisingly, students with more educated parents or higher personal income are at high risk for use. 'We also found that hookah use is more common in cities, especially big cities. 'So hookah use is much different from cigarette use, which is more common in non-urban areas.' The study, 'Hookah Use Among U.S. High School Seniors,' used data from Monitoring the Future (MTF), a nation-wide ongoing annual study of the behaviors, attitudes, and values of American secondary school students. The MTF survey is administered in approximately 130 public and private schools throughout 48 states in the US. Studies estimate one hookah session can be the equivalent of smoking from 10 to 40 cigarettes. Roughly 15,000 high school seniors are assessed annually. This study examined data from the 5,540 students (modal age = 18) who were asked about Hookah use from 2010-2012. The researchers found those students who smoked cigarettes, and those who had ever used alcohol, marijuana or other illicit substances were more likely to use hookah. 'However, times are beginning to change,' said Dr. Palamar. 'Now something called hookah pens, which are similar to e-cigarettes, are gaining popularity. 'While not all hookah pens contain nicotine, this new delivery method might normalize hookah use in everyday settings and bring use to a whole new level.' Researchers conclude increased normalization might lead to increases in use, and possibly adverse consequences associated with repeated use. Studies estimate one hookah session can be the equivalent of smoking from 10 to 40 cigarettes. Dr. Richard Hurt of the Mayo Clinic said that's because of the long duration of a hookah session. 'When you smoke a cigarette, a person smokes it maybe for just a few minutes and then you're through with it. 'But hookah sessions are social and people sit there for an hour or so kind of puffing on these things, thinking that the water is filtering out all the bad stuff, when the reality is it does not do that,' Hurt said. A study funded by the National Institutes of Health reports a single hookah session delivers 1.7 times the nicotine, 6.5 times the carbon monoxide and 46.4 times the tar of a single cigarette. 'Tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke are the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the US,' said a study co-author Michael Weitzman, MD, a professor of Pediatrics and of Environmental Medicine at the NYULMC. 'Cigarette use has decreased by 33% in the past decade in the US, while the use of alternative tobacco products such as hookahs has increased an alarming 123%. 'This is especially worrisome given the public misperception that hookahs are a safe alternative to cigarettes whereas evidence suggests that they are even more damaging to health than are cigarettes. 'This portends a potential epidemic of a lethal habit growing among upper and middle class adolescents.","Study find nearly 1 in 5 high school seniors use Hookahs .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . Dogs once owned by NFL player Michael Vick and part of his dogfighting operation now have new, happier lives. Nicknamed 'Vicktory Dogs,' 22 of Vick's dogs were taken in by Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, The Bark Post reports. When the animals were first taken in, they showed extreme signs of trauma, the shelter says. 'It wasn't easy. Some of these dogs would flatten themselves like pancakes to avoid being noticed by people. Some would threaten,' the sanctuary says on its website. Transformation: Cherry the Vicktory dog is seen here with a young friend . Best friends? Cherry (left) is seen with Handsome Dan (right) All smiles: Handsome Dan is now a proud 'nanny dog' Second chance: Halle is seen here posing for the camera . 'But like all of the 1,700 or so homeless pets who take refuge here at the Sanctuary on any given day, they received every bit of training, veterinary care, compassion, and in-depth emotional healing that they were so desperately in need of.' Many of the dogs have found entirely new lives. 10 of the dogs have new homes, while seven still live at the shelter, The Huffington Post reports. Cherry was featured on the National Geographic program DogTown before getting a new family, The Bark Post reports. Now he is used for events to raise awareness about abused animals. A Facebook page, called 'Vicktory 4 Cherry,' currently has over 9,400 likes. Like Cherry, Handsome Dan has become a celebrity. The dog is now the face of rescue shelter Handsome Dan's Rescue for Pit Bull Type Dogs - and the shelter's page currently has over 464,000 likes on Facebook. Do you like my outfit? Little Red, formerly one of Michael Vick's bait dogs, is seen reclining in this pink dress . Tragic: Georgia, pictured, passed away in 2013. She appeared on DogTown as well as The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Larry King Live . Halle was adopted and now is part of a home that includes two other dogs. Owner Traci described her perseverance in a post on Best Friends' website. 'No dogs should ever be given up on just because of their past,' she said. 'I look at Halle and the other Vicktory dogs who are thriving in new homes, living with other dogs and even small children.' 'Through a lot of love, patience, and the right kind of training, these dogs really can overcome the past abuses they have endured and make wonderful pets and companions. I would not trade the experience of adopting Halle for anything.' Little Red, who served as a 'bait dog' in Vick's operation, the Bark Post notes, now 'lives a life full of treats' with new owner, Susan. Meanwhile, Squeaker was taken in by a new family that own 6 other canines. New life: Squeaker, pictured, is now part of a family that includes 6 other dogs . Rest in peace: dog Oliver (right) passed away in owner Erika's arms . Loving home: Oscar, pictured, now belongs to owner Rachel . Starting over: Mel, pictured, was adopted by a radio DJ who covered the Michael Vick scandal in 2007 . Sadly, the website notes that two of the Vicktory dogs passed away. Georgia died in 2013 due to kidney problems. An obituary from the shelter describes her appearance on DogTown as well as appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Larry King Live. Oliver died from cancer in 2009 in owner Erika's arms. Pups Mel and Oscar have also found loving homes, the Bark Post says. Mel now belongs to Richard Hunter, a radio DJ who covered the Vick scandal in 2007. Oscar reportedly belongs to a loving owner named Rachel - who told Best Friends in a 2013 post that all Oscar and the other Vicktory dogs want is love. 'These are not fighting dogs; they are dogs who were forced to fight,' she said. 'They had to fight or die.' She added, 'Sure, they may be frightened, cautious, and slow to trust, but at the end of the day, all they want is to be loved and to love in return.' A Vicktorious family reunion!

"By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporter . A family lifted from a disabled sailboat hundreds of miles off the Mexican coast with their sick 1-year-old thanked rescuers and defended their 'maritime life' in their first public comments since returning to land. Eric and Charlotte Kaufman said in a blog posting that their children have been sailing on boats for a long time and that the 'modern cruising family' dates back several decades. The Kaufmans were on a round-the-world cruise with their 3- and 1-year-old daughters when the vomiting, feverish younger girl forced them to call for help. Scroll down for video . Back on dry land: The Kaufman family are seen in this April 9 U.S. Navy photo deboarding the guided missile frigate USS Vandegrift after they were rescued with a sick baby nearly 2,000 miles out at sea in a sailboat . Eric and Charlotte Kaufman, with daughters, Lyra, 1, and Cora, 3, were rescued and returned to San Diego by a Navy warship . The couple asked critics to reserve . judgment and wait for more details. Without elaborating, they said there . were many inaccuracies reported in the news media about their . daughter's health, their vessel's condition and the 'overall maritime . situation.' The Rebel . Heart, the 36-foot sailboat that had been their home for seven years, is . at the bottom of the ocean 900 miles off Mexico, sunk by rescuers . because it was taking on water after losing its steering and most of its . communications. 'We . have been happy with the maritime life we have been able to share with . our daughters. Even as we write this, several other boats are crossing . the same stretch of water that Rebel Heart was on, with families who . seek to show their children the world,' the couple wrote in a posting . dated Thursday and titled, 'twenty four hours back in San Diego.' The . couple thanked the 129th Rescue Wing of the California Air National . Guard and the crew aboard the USS Vandergrift, saying, 'We will remember . them forever.' In . response to unsolicited offers of support, they asked that donations be . sent instead to That Others May Live Foundation, a nonprofit group that . assists families of Air Force rescuers who die on duty. Sailors from the frigate USS Vandegrift assist in the rescue of the Kaufman family with a sick infant on the ship's small boat . A . satellite phone ping from the sailboat on April 3 set off a huge rescue . effort that involved skydiving National Guardsmen, three federal . agencies, a plane, a frigate and scores of personnel. When . the family and their rescuers returned to California on Wednesday, . sailors said poor visibility, winds of 10 knots and rough seas kept them . from sending a rescue boat to the Kaufmans for hours. When . they reached the family's sailboat, 5- to 8-foot waves forced them to . offload one person at a time. The effort took two hours. The ocean rescue set off a serious debate . over parenting, and the propriety of hitting the high seas with two . kids young enough to be in diapers. In . a photo released by the Navy, the family looked like typical . vacationers, with father Eric dressed in shorts and a baseball cap while . lugging bags, and his wife, Charlotte, walking behind him, holding the . toddler in a strap-on carrier and grasping the hand of her 3-year-old . daughter. The happy . scene was a far cry from the miserable conditions described by Navy . sailors who spoke to reporters after the ship moved to the San Diego . mainland later in the day without the Kaufmans. The Rebel Heart sailboat, carrying the Kaufman family, became the site of a U.S. Navy rescue Sunday . It . was scheduled to move on to the San Diego mainland later in the day but . without the Kaufmans, who said they want to tend to their 1-year-old . daughter, Lyra, first and get some rest before talking publicly, . Charlotte Kaufman's sister, Sariah English, said. The . Kaufmans' decision to sail around the world with Lyra and her . 3-year-old sister Cora drew accusations of reckless foolishness from . some observers and praise from others for their courageous spirit. 'They'll probably go on the 'Today' show to talk about this, and write a book about it, do a miniseries and . get 15 minutes of fame because that's how our country tends to reward . people who choose recklessly to put themselves and their children in . danger,' said Margaret Dilloway, a San Diego novelist who has three children. English doesn't question the decision of her sister's family. She said sailing is their passion. It's what defines them. 'Charlotte and Eric raise their children how they see fit,' English said. 'They . are very concerned about child safety. That's their No. 1 concern, and . they did not do this blindly. They are responsible, good parents.' But . they are aware of the criticism. Eric Kaufman, a Coast Guard-licensed . captain, and his wife sent a statement from the ship defending their . actions, saying 'when we departed on this journey more than a year ago, . we were then and remain today confident that we prepared as well as any . sailing crew could.' Others . said children benefit in many intangible ways from parents who show them . the world, even when they're too young to remember it. Ivan Alba said the Kaufmans should be commended. 'I . think it's a great thing, their decision to sail around the world, and . just because their children are 1 and 3 years old doesn't mean they . can't be on a boat,' said Alba, of San Diego, who is also planning a . world trip with his wife and two daughters, 8 and 10. 'It's just too bad . what happened, but that's also life. Anything can happen, anywhere.' Four . California Air National Guard members parachuted to the sailboat . Thursday and stabilized Lyra, who responded well to medication for . Salmonella-like symptoms until the warship arrived Sunday. She . had previously had salmonella in Mexico, where the family had stopped . their voyage for her birth, but her pediatrician assured them she was . recovered and could travel, English said. But shortly into the trip, the child started showing symptoms and did not respond to antibiotics.","Charlotte and Eric Kaufman deny they put their 1-year-old girl Lyra in danger by taking her on their round-the-world trip .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . New Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond today played down his Eurosceptic credentials as he prepared to take charge of efforts to claw powers back from Brussels. His surprise promotion from the Ministry of Defence following William Hague’s dramatic decision to step down. Mr Hammond, who has previously suggested he could back leaving the EU, insisted he was focussed on renegotiating Britain's membership and would not 'threaten' other member states. Eurosceptic Philip Hammond becomes Foreign Secretary, in charge of renegotiating Britain's EU membership . Mr Hague, 53, will remain in the Cabinet as Leader of the Commons until next year’s General Election, when he will step down from Parliament. But Mr Hammond's promotion is one of the most striking in David Cameron's reshuffle, coming at such a sensitive time for Britain's relations with Brussels. The Prime Minister has promised to renegotiate the UK's membership of the EU, before holding an in-out referendum. Last year Mr Hammond said he would vote to leave the EU 'if the choice is between a European Union written exactly as it is today and not being a part of that'. Arriving at the Foreign Office to start his new job today, he told reporters: 'I'm going to focus on making sure that we have a successful renegotiation with our European partners,' he said. 'I don't think the way to enter a negotiation is to start issuing threats.' Philip Hammond is not exciting. He does not crack jokes or deliver spine-tingling speeches. He is no Boris Johnson or Ken Clarke. The 58-year-old is a money-man, with the demeanour and precision of an accountant, who has impressed with his grip on the finances at the Ministry of Defence. The new Foreign Secretary has a huge task ahead of him. With 10 months to go until the general election, he will have to start the process of David Cameron’s renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the European Union. Crucially, Hammond has said that if powers are not returned, he would vote to leave the EU. Now it is his job to make sure that does not happen. He is on the right of the party, having spoken out against gay marriage and defence cuts so vehemently last year he was said to be on 'manoeuvres' to position himself as an alternative Tory leader . The son of a civil engineer, he went to Shenfield High School in Brentwood, Essex, with TV presenter Richard Madeley, who once claimed the future Tory minister was ‘a Goth back then’ who ‘used to arrive in class in a leather trench-coat with The Guardian under his arm’. Needless to say, straight-laced Hammond dismissed it as a wind-up. After studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Oxford – the apprenticeship for most of Team Cameron – he joined medical equipment firm Speywood Laboratories, where he later became a director. He ran his own company and became a director of housebuilder Castlemead Homes, amassing an estimated wealth of more than £8million. Elected as MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in Surrey in 1997, he was given his first job on the frontbench a year later by William Hague, who he now replaces at the FCO. As George Osborne’s deputy in opposition, Hammond was expected to join him at the Treasury if the Tories won the 2010 election. But coalition meant he was shunted to transport to make way for a Lib Dem, and was promoted to Defence Secretary in 2011 when Liam Fox was forced to resign. Hammond’s ministerial career has often been buffeted by events outside his control. Now he is one of the great offices of state, life could be about to get a bit ore exciting. Tory Cabinet veteran Ken Clarke, who resigned last night after 40 years on the political frontline,  took a parting shot at the promotion of Eurosceptics like Mr Hammond. Mr Clarke has vowed to continue to argue Britain must remain in the EU. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Every government in this country is going to want Britain to stay in the European Union, it is the best way of affecting global political events and boosting our economy, the best way of protecting the interests of our citizens, it's a globalised world.' However, Mr Hague denied that naming Mr Hammond as his successor marked a more Eurosceptic approach from the Tories. He said: 'We are very clear and united on Europe. Philip Hammond, David Cameron and I all have exactly the same policy on Europe. 'We want to improve Britain's relationship with the EU and then hold a referendum on staying in or leaving the European Union. 'We are all committed to that; the Conservative Party is more united on this issue than it has been in the whole time that I have been in politics, in all that long time. 'We are all going to be campaigning for that and I know Philip Hammond will be very committed to that.' Mr Hague's decision to quit as Foreign Secretary marks the beginning of the end of a political career that began in 1977 when, at the age of 16, he impressed then Tory leader Margaret Thatcher with an impassioned speech at the Conservative Party conference. The move comes during a fraught period in foreign affairs when Iraq and Syria are in flames, Israel is on the brink, Russia is still menacing the Ukraine and Mr Cameron is engaged in a battle to keep Britain in a reformed European Union. Mr Hague faced sharp criticism last month when, at a time of such global instability, he featured in a number of photo opportunities with the US actress Angelina Jolie, who was visiting the UK for a summit on sexual violence in warfare. ‘From May 2015, after such a long period in politics, I want to embark on many other things I have always wanted to do. ‘After the General Election, I will return to my writing, while still  giving very active support to  the Conservative Party and campaigning on international causes  I believe in.’ Mr Cameron paid tribute to the man who led the Conservatives during the dark period after the 1997 landslide defeat. The Prime Minister said: ‘William Hague has been one of the leading lights of the Conservative Party for a generation, leading the party and serving in two cabinets. ‘Not only has he been a first-class . Foreign Secretary – he has also been a close confidante, a wise . counsellor and a great friend. ‘He . will remain as First Secretary of State and my de facto political . deputy in the run-up to the election – and it is great to know that he . will be a core part of the team working to ensure an outright . Conservative victory at the next election.’ Mr Hague said last night he wanted to pursue other options, including restarting his career as a political biographer. He tweeted: ‘Role as Leader of the House means I will finish in politics as I began – speaking in Parliament and campaigning among the voters. Hob-nobbing: William Hague faced criticism when he featured in a number of photo opportunities with Angelina Jolie, who was visiting the UK for a summit on sexual violence in warfare with partner Brad Pitt (left) Mr Hague’s departure after four years as Foreign Secretary will rob the Tory leadership of one of its most experienced hands. He first came to public attention in 1977 when, as a Yorkshire schoolboy, he tore into the record of the then Labour government. The speech, applauded by Mrs Thatcher, marked him for greatness and helped fast-track his career. At the age of 27, he entered Parliament for Richmond, North Yorkshire. By the age of 34, he was in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales. Two years later, when the Tories were buried by the Blair landslide, the party looked to him to perform an impossible rescue mission. Moving on: Hague told his 236,000 Twitter followers that it was time for him to go . Achievements: Hague spoke of his achievements during his time as Foreign Secretary in his message to his Twitter followers . Next step: Hague has been a key figure in the fight to end sexual violence in conflict . Starting young: Hague's announcement marks the beginning of the end of a political career that began in 1977 when, at the age of 16, he impressed then Tory leader Margaret Thatcher with an impassioned speech at the Conservative Party conference . Mocked: During his time as Tory leader he was mocked for wearing a Hague-branded baseball cap and for boasting that he had drunk 14 pints a night as a young man . Photo opportunity: William Hague with his then girlfriend, now wife Ffion at the Notting Hill Carnival in 1997 . Rumours: Speculation over Hague's future appeared to begin with a tweet from Iain Dale, the LBC broadcaster who is regarded as extremely well-informed in Conservative circles . Mr Hague, whose quick wit and humour regularly saw him best Mr Blair in the Commons chamber, fought a Eurosceptic campaign, which culminated in the warning that Britain had ‘24 hours to save the pound’ from Labour’s desire to take the UK into the euro. But he was crushed in the 2001 election by a second Labour landslide. During his time as Tory leader he was mocked for wearing a Hague-branded baseball cap and for boasting that he had drunk 14 pints a night as a young man. Bruised by the experience, he quit immediately after the election, giving way to Iain Duncan Smith. He returned to the backbenches where he wrote several well-received political biographies before agreeing to return to the front line as shadow foreign secretary in 2005. Couple@ Hague's departure will also give him more time to spend with wife Ffion (right). The couple, who married in 1997, have no children . Wedding day: Hague and his wife outside the Palace of Westminster on their wedding day in 1997 . Mr Hague is one of a relatively small number of northern Tories from ordinary backgrounds. He was born in Rotherham and educated at Wath-upon-Dearne Comprehensive in South Yorkshire before going on to Oxford University, where he emerged with a first-class honours degree. Despite his stellar political career,  Mr Hague has made little secret of the fact he believes there is life outside Westminster. He recently complained that his punishing schedule as Foreign Secretary leaves him time for nothing beyond working, sleeping and exercise. His departure will also give him more time to spend with wife Ffion. The couple, who married in 1997, have no children. But in 2010, Mr Hague – who was facing malicious rumours about his sexuality – spoke movingly of the fact his wife had suffered ‘multiple miscarriages’.","Defence Secretary Philip Hammond  becomes Foreign Secretary .

"By . Aap . The body of Dane McNeill was found charred in Sydney's south-west on Monday . The family of a man whose burned body was found in a park have expressed their horror at his death. The badly burned body of Dane McNeill, 20, was found by a council worker, who was preparing to open the gate at the Lambeth Street Reserve at Picnic Point, on a roadway just after 5am on Monday. The man's burns were so severe efforts to identify him and his age had been difficult. Police said on Wednesday a post-mortem confirmed it was Mr McNeill. Family fear the stonemason had become caught up with drug dealers. 'If you think that you can play in this world you need to think again,' his grandmother, Elsie McNeill, told the Ten Network. 'You can't even imagine how wicked these people are.' The Narellan man was reported missing last Friday. It emerged on Thursday that Mr McNeill had twice been busted for drugs. On one occasion he was caught high on ice and with three knives on a Sydney suburban street. When police on May 20 searched his padlocked bag in a car at St Andrews, they found digital scales, a black wallet with crystal methamphetamine-filled capsules and a drug tick book, with names and dollar amounts. When police searched him two weeks earlier in another car in the same south-west suburb, they found a ""nervous"" Mr McNeill with three knives and 0.22 grams of ice. Mr McNeill had pleaded guilty in Campbelltown Local Court last month to a string of drug charges, including supply and possession, stemming from the May drug busts. When Mr McNeill was granted bail following the second bust on May 20, police found there was an unacceptable risk he would offend again, court documents state. However, police decided the risk could be mitigated by the strict conditions of living with his family in Narellan and adhering to an overnight curfew. But it seems his parents were fed up. 'My parents told me to leave and I have no choice,' Mr McNeill later informed the court as to why he needed to change his bail address. The stonemason's family fears he may have got caught up in drugs . His body was found at Picnic Point on Monday morning by a council worker . Ryan McNeill, 13, said his brother's killers could hurt others. 'It was sick what they done to him,' he said. 'These people could do it to other people. Ryan also urged people with information about his brother's death to come forward. 'Tell the police what they can so those people can get locked up,' he said. Friends of Mr McNeill took to Facebook as news of his death broke. 'Can't stop thinkin about you Dane McNeill didn't deserve it, won't forget you bro,' Dom Mosca wrote on Tuesday. Other friends shared memories of Mr McNeill, while some others left simple goodbyes. 'Rest easy brother never gonna forget you,' Blake Mills said. Mr McNeill's final Facebook post was on July 16, just days before his death. 'I believe that everything happens for a reason,' Mr McNeill said. 'People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right. 'You believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.' The body of Mr McNeill, 20, was burned so badly it could not be recognised . A post-mortem done by police on the body confirmed it was of Dane McNeill (pictured left and right) Superintendent Dave Eardley confirmed the body had been burned beyond recognition on Monday. 'But other than saying it's a male person, it's very hard to expand on that at the moment,"" he told reporters. 'We are hopeful we might be able to narrow down a time-frame when the person was brought here.' Supt Eardley said police want to hear from anyone who noticed cars stopping or suspicious activity around Henry Lawson Drive during Sunday night. 'I think it would be fair to conclude that the body was brought here at some stage during the evening,' he said. Mr McNeill was reported missing on Friday and was found at Picnic Point . He confirmed one scenario would be someone carrying the body, which was found 50 metres inside the reserve boundary, to its leafy resting place. Supt Eardley said he could not fathom why someone would burn a body. 'Any time a person loses their life is a tragedy,' he said. 'This is compounded by the fact that someone has chosen then to do that to a body. 'I can't fathom that, I don't think any rational person in our community can make sense of that.' Nearby resident Sue Parmaxidis said she heard an explosion early on Monday morning. 'It was a loud noise and would have been from about 4.30am or 10 to five,' she told reporters. 'You could say it might have been an explosion, it was like a bang.' Ms Parmaxidis said the reserve was popular with families and children. Investigations are continuing.","Dane McNeill was reported missing last Friday and his body found on Monday .

Mr Lange was travelling with his partner, Jacqueline van Tongeren, who worked at the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development. Other delegates who died were Dr Lucie van Mens, who since 1995 has focused on HIV and AIDs prevention, the World Health Organisation's Glenn Thomas and AIDs campaigners Pim de Kuijer and Maria Adriana de Schutter.","Crowd gathered in Federation Square on Tuesday for a minute's silence .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Aap . George Gerbic, from the Sunshine Coast, was formally identified by police on Friday . Tributes have been paid to a 'well liked and much respected' former local football club president who has been identified as the victim of a horrific murder, almost a year after burnt remains of a headless torso were found on a Queensland roadside. George Gerbic, from Tanawha on the Sunshine Coast, was formally identified by police on Friday. This weekend his former football club Coolum FC donned black armbands in his honour. Police discovered Mr Gerbic's headless remains, with arms severed at the elbows and nothing left below the rib cage, at Cedar Point, near Gympie, last September. Detective Inspector Bruce McNab revealed a small trace of blood pressure medication in the remains had led to the identification of Mr Gerbic. The 66-year-old was described on the football club's website as a 'well liked & much respected former President of Coolum FC'. A tribute statement read: 'As a club and for those of us who knew him individually, we are incredibly sorry to hear of his tragic death and our hearts and deepest condolences are with his family and close friends at this sad time. 'As a mark of respect to George and the Gerbic family our club's senior players will be wearing a black armband for this weekends games and will be observing a minutes silence prior to kick off of their respective fixtures.' The message finished: 'Rest in peace George.' A 56-year-old named Lindy Yvonne Williams faced Maroochydore Magistrates Court on Friday charged with Mr Gerbic's murder. The torso, found on Cedar Pocket Rd, pictured, in September 2013, was able to be identified when police found the the hypertension drug Irbesartan and Quinine in the body's system . Queensland police have been investigating the murder since last September . She is also charged with interfering with a corpse. Police won't confirm reports the woman is his de-facto partner, although it has been revealed the pair lived together at Tanawha. In court, police reportedly alleged Ms Williams had been saying her partner was overseas to explain his absence, News.com reports. Their home was turned into a crime scene on Thursday - the same day police said they had identified the man and were questioning a woman. Crime scene: The area pictured, is where the headless torso was discovered . In April police revealed they had detected traces of a drug called Irbesartan in the remains. Doorknocking of prescription users in the area - following an exhaustive search of pharmacy records - had led police to the man's property.' There's been a lot of technology used but also a lot of good old-fashioned detective work, wearing out your shoe leather,' Det Insp McNab said.

But the Australian Federal Police officer had to hand over the sum to be bailed from Sydney's Central Local Court after being charged with a dozen corruption and bribery offences. Hampton faces a long stint behind bars if convicted after a 15-month investigation into allegations he sold AFP secrets to a member of the public. AFP officer Benjamin Hampton faces 10 years' jail for corruption and bribery charges . Prosecutors said Hampton was a flight risk and had booked return plane tickets to Slovenia, where his father lived. '(He) was going to a country where there is no extradition with Australia,' the court heard on Thursday. On top of the money, Magistrate Alexander Mijovich made Hampton surrender his passport and he had to report to police daily and avoid contact with others involved in the investigation. A bribery conviction carries a penalty of up to 10 years' jail, while the other offences carry penalties of two to five years each. He had to fork over $1 million to make bail, which was meant to be for a new home . Hampton's wife was by his side when he appeared in Central Local Court on Thursday . Hampton faces two charges of receiving a bribe as a commonwealth public official, two charges of receiving a corrupting benefit and two counts of abuse of public office. He also has been hit with four counts of unauthorised access to data with intent to commit a serious offence and two charges of divulging or communicating prescribed information. Hampton's lawyer earlier said his client had more than $1 million in the bank, earned from the sale of his home. 'The money in the bank account was to be used to buy another property,' the court heard. Hampton was ordered to surrender his passport as he was a flight risk after he booked tickets to Slovenia . But it has now been used to buy Hampton freedom at least until his next hearing at the Downing Centre Local Court on November 11. Hampton worked as a protection officer for the AFP and was suspended from duties in May. At an earlier press briefing, AFP Sydney commander Ray Johnson said none of the alleged information sold endangered anyone or compromised any AFP investigation. No one else has yet been charged over the allegations. 'Should it be proven, everyone [at the AFP] will be significantly disappointed,' Mr Johnson said.

"By . Aap . Dutch language teacher Dafne Nieveen was killed while flying home to Perth . A Perth language teacher who perished aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 has been remembered as a kindhearted woman who touched the hearts of many. Dutch citizen Dafne Nieveen was returning to her home of four years from an education conference in the Netherlands when she boarded the doomed flight, Fairfax Media reported. Prime Minister Tony Abbott's office confirmed on Sunday that an Australian permanent resident from Western Australia was aboard the Malaysia Airlines plane when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine. It takes the official MH17 death toll for those who called Australia home to 37, including 28 citizens. It's believed this new addition to the grim tally was Ms Nieveen. The 37-year-old Dutch citizen moved to Perth four years ago with boyfriend Werner Lupker after falling in love with Australia while travelling, Fairfax reported. Mr Lupker, of Karrinyup, led a moving tribute to Ms Nieveen on Facebook. 'MH17 was Your Last and Final Flight Home,' he wrote. 'You will never really leave us for you are everywhere that is beautiful. 'When the sun rises in the sky and sets beneath the shoreline, it shines your beauty on everything it touches.' Her boyfriend Werner Lupker led the tributes on Facebook . Friends have also turned to social media to express their grief. 'Dear Dafne, I'm going to miss you terribly ... What a sick world,' Twitter user Caroline Meijer wrote in Dutch. Perth woman Claire Geoff Westwood said she felt 'so proud' to count Ms Nieveen as a friend.

"By . Aap . Police interviewed 150 suspects over the shooting death of police informer Terence Hodson and his wife in Melbourne, an inquest has heard. In 2004, Mr Hodson was due to give evidence in a criminal trial against two drug squad members when he and his wife were shot in the head at their Kew home - in Melbourne's east. A long-awaited coronial inquest into their deaths on Wednesday heard a file containing information Mr Hodson had provided to police was circulated among criminals. The inquest is investigating the shooting death of Terence Hodson and Christine Hodson that happened in 2004 . Counsel assisting the inquest Chris Winneke said the Hodsons were victims of cold-blooded murder. 'It is unarguable that they had been callously murdered,' he said. The Hodsons' daughters Mandy Hodson and Nikki Komiazyk both wept as details of their parents' deaths were read to the court. Outside the court, Mandy told The Age the siblings found the information 'very distressing' and did not know what to expect. The couple's daughters, Nicola Komiazyk (left) and Mandy Hodson (right) wept as they heard details of their parents death at the Coroners Court in Melbourne . 'Who knows at this stage? But we thought it was going to be adjourned today and it wasn’t. We’ll press on,' she said. Mr Winneke said police had interviewed or investigated 150 persons of interest in relation to the murder. Former drug squad detective Paul Dale and convicted killer Rodney Collins were charged with the Hodsons' murder in 2009, but the charges were dropped in 2010 after the bashing death of Carl Williams in jail. Both men maintain their innocence. Mr Winneke said the inquest would focus on the adequacy of security given to the Hodsons as well as the identity and motive of their killers. He said thousands of hours of investigation had yet to yield a result. Mr Winneke said Mr Hodson had refused to join the witness protection program, but had installed security doors and a video camera at his house, carried a gun and had two German shepherd guard dogs. After the murder, one of the dogs was found to have suffered blunt trauma to its head, while tapes from the cameras had gone missing, Mr Winneke said. Mr Winneke said the inquest would also examine what inducements were offered to gangland killer Carl Williams to give evidence against Mr Dale. Before his death in 2010, Williams gave a statement in which he said Mr Dale had given him $150,000 at a home in Essendon to hire a hitman to murder Mr Hodson. Lawyers for Collins and Mr Dale will apply on Thursday for both to be excused from giving evidence at the inquest. Collins, 69, is serving two life sentences for the shooting murders of Ramon and Dorothy Abbey at their Melbourne home in July 1987.

"By . Wills Robinson . Criticised: Emily Rose Eastop, 26, has set up a 'crowdfunding' page to help pay for her masters degree - but not not everyone's impressed . An Oxford graduate who set up a fundraising page asking donors to pay for her masters degree has been branded a 'posh brat'. Emily-Rose Eastop, who calls herself a 'scientist, hula dancer, singer', has made £14,000 after turning to 'crowdfunding'. But people have condemned the move as a 'shameful ploy' and she has been told to 'get a job like the rest of us'. The 26-year-old from South Woodford, London, thought she would be snapped up by employers after graduating with a 2.1 in Human Sciences from Magdalen College, Oxford, in 2010. But she has spent the last four years living off her mother and boyfriend and living in her family's large Victorian London home. Miss Eastop has been accepted onto a MSc in cognitive and evolutionary anthropology - but with her £20,000 of undergraduate debt she says she can’t afford the £26,000 tuition fees. In a bid to raise funds she has resorted to  setting up a fundraising page and has already attracted more than 200 financial backers. She runs an anti-pseudoscience Facebook page with 79,000 likes and has garnered support from leading scientists. Harvard psychologist Prof Steven Pinker gave her £250, while another American professor of cognitive science pledged £500. Her musician . parents have also led to a generous £1,000 donation from conductor Sir . Simon Rattle and an Austrian atheist who won the right to wear a pasta . strainer on his head for his passport photo Niko Alm has also given £50. But . the move has been criticised online with one person commenting: 'You’re . a posh brat who’s too used to getting what she wants - I know your . type.' Hula dancer: Miss Eastop has been accepted onto a MSc in cognitive and evolutionary anthropology - but with her £20,000 of undergraduate debt she says she can’t afford the £26,000 fees . Getting there: She has raised £14,026 - just over half the amount she needs for tuition fees and living expenses . Another . said: 'Why don’t you get a job like the rest of us and work to get . enough money to go and get your degrees like I, and the rest of us have . done. 'Such a shameful ploy for money is very reprehensible and not . reputable for someone who calls themselves a scientist. Have they no . shame in the UK?' One . condemned her for using crowdfunding to raise cash for herself, saying: . 'If you want grant money go ask people giving a grant. Crowdsourcing = . how to be a bum in 2014. Go get a job.' Crowdfunding is a new phenomenon, but has become one of the fastest ways of making money over the internet. It is used by businesses, charities or other ventures to mobilise an army of investors, who often each put in only small sums. It can be a way for a people to obatin a share in a company but can also a way for people to donate to a cause anonymously. The first major website to take advantage of the new fundraising trend was Kickstarter. Set up in 2009, it allowed people to raise money for individual projects by setting up online accounts. For example, musician Amanda Palmer raised £700,000 from 24,883 backers in June 2012 to make a new album and art book. American Hans Fex raised a similar amount from 5,030 backers in March 2014 for his 'Mini Museum' project. In Detroit, a crowdfunding campaign is attempting to match people struggling with their bills with donors around the city. More than 1,500 donors had signed up on the website Turn on Detroit’s Water, which was created last week by Tiffani Ashley Bell and Kristy Tillman. Earlier this month, the owner of the Hard Rock Hotel Palm Springs announced that it had raised more than £880,000 in its first crowdfunding campaign. She said: 'I think I entered the job market at the worst time because of the recession. 'I . have been really open and put my heart on my sleeve. Some people may . react negatively but people who actually get you will be very generous. 'If you do not want to donate then you do not have to. It is a gesture not a tax. 'I . have had good connections to tap. I guess I am surprised that I have . raised so much so quickly. Crowdfunding is going to get bigger and . bigger. She . added: 'My parents are not millionaires. My mother was a successful . musician and she was able to pay off her house, but as she got older is . has become harder to get work. 'I am already so much in my mum's debt. I would rather not do the degree than have my mum pay for it.' 'The idea is that you do the masters with me. On the private blog I will summarise all the cruxes of what I learn and turn it into easily digestible lay person times.' In a blog post in response to hateful comments, Miss Eastop wrote: 'I cannot fathom the mindset one would need to possess to translate this frustration into spiteful comments.' 'I could possibly take out a bank loan 'like the rest of us' (there are no student loans available for masters students), but it should be clear for all to see that this solution to my problem would be far inferior to being given a large number of small, voluntary donations from people in exchange for a look-in on my area of academic interest as I study it.' So far she has raised £14,021 - just over half the cash she needs for tuition fees and living expenses. Miss Eastop has a minimum target of £14,523 to reach by August 1, her deadline for accepting the offer, so she can pay her tuition and college fees up front. A £1 donation gets you access to to her ‘exclusive master blog’. Donors who give £500 or more get a professionally bound and signed copy of Emily-Rose’s prize-winning dissertation. An Oxford University spokesman said: 'Fundraising for postgraduate scholarships is one of the University’s key priorities and this year over 1,000 fully-funded scholarships were available from the University, its colleges and supporters for new master’s and doctoral students in 2014-15, which puts us in a very fortunate position compared to our UK peers. 'But for the many aspiring graduate students who do not receive scholarships, it can be very difficult to find the money for their studies and we hope that more can be done at a national level to ensure postgraduate study is open to all.'","Emily Eastop, 26, resorted to 'crowd-funding' after struggling to get a job .

"By . Oliver Todd . Follow @@oliver_todd . Neither Arjen Robben nor Robin van Persie could get past Costa Rica's deep defence in Salvador as Holland's two key threats suffered without being able to show their usual counter attacking talents. And in the end, after failing to break down the tournament's surprise package, it came down to penalties. Both dispatched their spot kicks and then Tim Krul played hero from the bench to send the Dutch through. Robben might have made a renewed effort to stay on his feet after talk about his diving dominated the post match coverage following the 2-1 win over Nigeria, but he needn't have - Costa Rica constantly kicked him as they tried to stop his attacking runs by hook or by crook. Relief: Robben and Robin enjoy their shootout win after a tough game against Costa Rica . At last! Van Persie finally gets the ball past Navas - from the spot in the penalty shoot out . Me too: And Robben confidently dispatched his into the top corner . No! Van Persie couldn't believe his lack of luck as chance after chance went begging . Tough night: Robben was kicked all over the place as he struggled to make an impact in Salvador . Thwarted: Kaylor Navas so often stopped Van Persie during normal and extra time . Van Persie was unlucky with his finishing on multiple occasions. It was a frustrating night for the Dutch - and none moreso than their two top scorers. Both Van Persie and Robben have thrived on the counter attack in this World Cup so far but Costa Rica's defensive solidity rarely allowed them to take that sort of opportunity. In the first half's one occasion where they were able to break with pace, their opponents found another solution: bringing Robben down with a cynical challenge as he tried to break into their half. Van Persie did have one decent effort at goal but it was easily saved by the excellent Keylor Navas. Something had to change. But it didn't - the second half looked to be going even worse from the off. Costa Rica became even more willing to sit deep and frustrate their illustrious opponents. Manager Louis van Gaal kept both of his danger men on - unlike against Nigeria - and threw on reinforcements but still neither man was really firing. Robben still caused problems for the defence but he was often brought down by challenges designed to stop him in his tracks - no need to dive this time. Van Persie could have won it with two minutes left but missed the ball to waste a gilt-edged chance. But by the time the whistle blew for the end of normal time the Manchester United man must have been seriously cursing his luck after his shot was cleared onto the crossbar by Yeltsin Tejeda's misskick off the line. As a pairing - they had no luck. Two extra time shots from Robben were deflected away from goal by Van Persie, it just did not seem to be their night. And so to penalties. Van Persie then Robben both dispatched theirs, with Tim Krul saving twice to get Holland through. Both forwards will be hoping the luck that only joined their side for penalties will continue into the semi final against Argentina and beyond. 8 minutes: Robben goes on a dangerous charge down the right flank but Giancarlo Gonzalez puts a stop to him on the byline. 21 minutes: Van Persie has a great chance but he fires it with power straight at Keylor Navas who palms it away. 24 minutes: Robben runs at the Costa Rican defence and plays the ball wide to Dirk Kuyt who finds Van Persie but he's offside. 28 minutes: It's Van Persie's turn to run at Costa Rica's back five before playing it to Memphis Depay to shoot. 34 minutes: Robben leads a rare Holland counter but he is scythed down as he breaks into the opposition half. 41 minutes: The Bayern Munich winger slips Van Persie in but Navas comes and claims the ball ahead of him. 51 minutes: Robben has been staying on his feet so far but he justifiably goes down after being brought down by Junior Diaz and Michael Umana together. The latter goes into the book. 55 minutes: The winger pokes a ball through to Van Persie after considering his options on the right hand side. The recipient can't quite make up his mind what to do but he wins a corner. 80 minutes: Robben is dragged down by Gonzalez just outside the area and he took earns himself a booking. 83 minutes: Van Persie doesn't appear to be having any luck - the brilliant Navas denies him again. 88 minutes: Wesley Sneijder calls in a brilliant ball and Van Persie just has to get a touch to convert it but he completely misses the ball and the chance is gone. The best chance of the game. 90 minutes: Robben breaks past Diaz who again fouls him. He should see red but gets away with it. 91 minutes: First Van Persie hits his free kick straight at Navas, then his drive at the back post is cleared off the line and onto the crossbar by Yeltsin Tejeda - somehow the ball doesn't go in. 101 minutes: Robben is still full of steam and he runs down the right, cuts in but has his shot blocked. He ends up on the ball again and this time it's blocked by Riaz - the referee deems it to be his arm and gives another free kick. 106 minutes: Another way to stop Robben - Johnny Acosta goes in for the challenge on the Dutch right wing and it ends up with a clash of heads which brings Robben crashing to the ground for yet another free kick. 116 minutes: Robben sees his chance to win it cutting in from the right and ignores Van Persie and Klass-Jan Huntelaar in the box. In the end his shot actually hits Van Persie. 118 minutes: Sneijder hits the bar, it comes back to Robben but again his shot hits Van Persie! Van Persie's penalty: He goes low to the right and it just evades Navas' dive to nestle in the corner of the net. Robben's penalty: Sends Tim Krul the wrong way by thrashing his penalty confidently into the top left hand corner. Tricky: Robben makes one of his trademark runs, bursting past the Costa Rican back line . Hot shot: Van Persie fires in an effort in the first half that is saved by Keylor Navas . Hard work: Robben took a few kicks from the Costa Ricans as they tried to neutralise the danger .

"By . Wills Robinson . NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton has ordered all of the city's 35,000 officers to be retrained in how they use force following the 'chokehold' death of Eric Garner. The father, 43, died in Staten Island during an arrest last week after being held down and handcuffed by off-duty cop Daniel Pantaleo. Disturbing video footage shows Garner, who was accused of selling illegal cigarettes, struggling on the pavement saying 'I can't breath' before passing out. Bratton said Garner's death was 'very tragic' and ordered Deputy Commissioner of Training Benjamin Tucker to conduct a 'top-to-bottom' review of officers' training. Scroll down for video . Victim: Eric Garner, 43, died after being held in a 'chokehold' by NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in Staten Island. An initial report into his death has said he was 'not in great distress . According to the New York Daily News, Bratton is looking for inspiration from the Los Angeles Police Department's 'state of the art' training which was set up after the immigration rallies in 2007. The commissioner, who met with FBI officials following Garner's death, said he anticipated a civil suit by the family and 'would not be surprised if the U.S. attorney 'decides to open a civil rights violation investigation.' An initial report into Garner's death released earlier this week did not mention a chokehold, claiming he 'was not in great distress' and his health 'did not  get worse' as he was held down. The omission has sparked an angry reaction from City Hall, with state senator Bill Perkins shouting: 'This is murder' during a rally. In the video of Garner's death, veteran officer Pantaleo waved to the camera as the father was taken away on a stretcher. One of the witnesses asked, 'Why is nobody doing CPR?' an officer responded, 'Because he's breathing.' Demanding action: NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, pictured left with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio during a press conference this week, wants a 'top-to-bottom' review of how officers use force . Sergeant Dhanan Saminath said Garner was in handcuffs with officers 'maintaining control of him' according to the report. It also suggests that he 'resisted arrest' and failed to 'obey instructions' as police tried to handcuff him. However Sergeant Kizzy Adonis said she 'believed she heard the perpetrator state that he was having difficulty breathing'. The New York City Medical Examiner's office has not yet been able to determine what killed Garner - whether he died from a chokehold or an underlying health issue. Pantaleo, a plainclothes cop, has been forced to surrender his gun and badge and put on desk duty while the NYPD investigates the case. Disturbing footage: The father passed out after being held down by police. Minutes later, Officer Pantaleo was caught waving to a woman recording the incident (right) Treatment: A witness asked why no one was giving him CPR, to which officers respond 'because he is breathing' It has also . been revealed that he has seven civil rights lawsuit against him - . including allegations of illegal strip searches and arresting men who . were 'committing no crimes' at the time. One . resulted in the city paying $30,000 to two men who were unlawfully . strip-searched. The other lawsuit, which is still pending, alleges an . unlawful arrest. Garner's grieving son, meanwhile, has called for the New York Police Department officer who was filmed putting his father in a chokehold to be arrested and thrown in jail. This isn't the first time Pantaleo has been accused of abusing his police powers, the Staten Island Advance reports. The eight-year veteran officer has had two civil rights lawsuits filed against him. The first was the result of a March 2012 traffic stop in which Darren Collins and Tommy Rice were arrested and then strip-searched in broad daylight on a Staten Island street. Gwen, Mr Garner's mother, said she was glad the incident was recorded so police could not shy away from what happened.

"By . Wills Robinson . A woman who tried to jump over a cemetery fence to escape an alleged attacker had to be cut free after impaling her leg on an iron spike. Firefighters used saws and grinding tools to rescue the woman who tried to hurdle the perimeter of Vine Cemetery in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, because the nearest gate was locked. She was then taken to hospital so surgeons could remove the spike which was still sticking out of her thigh. Scroll down for video . Stuck: The woman tried to hurdle the 5ft perimeter of Vine Cemetery in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, because the nearest gate was locked . Trapped: The unidentified woman ended up impaled on the iron spike . Response: Firefighters used saws and grinding tools to set the woman free as a passer-by held her up . Witnesses claimed the unidentified woman was running away from someone who attacked her. During her escape, she tried to leap over the fence and got her leg trapped  in the process. Realising she was stuck, she began to wave her arms frantically in a bid to track down a motorist who called 911. When fire crews and paramedics arrived, they draped a white cloth over her head to shield her from sparks flying off the saw blade. The woman remained conscious and alert, talking to the emergency crew throughout the ordeal. Amber Judge and Dorothy Molion dialed 911 when they saw the woman. 'She was crying big time,' Judge told the Standard Speaker. 'We helped to hold her up because her other leg was getting numb,' Molion added. 'We were trying to keep her calm because if she panicked, it would have been worse.' 'She wanted me told hold her hand. She wanted me to stay with her.' Within 30 minutes of the 911 call, a section of the fence was cut free and crews lifted the woman off the fence with a 5-foot length of iron post still protruding from her leg. 'We removed a section of the fence and sent it with her to the hospital. It was the only way to prevent her from bleeding to death if the spike cut through an artery,' said Fire Chief Brian Mandak. A police investigation into the incident is underway. Rescue operation: Using the machinery, they cut out a section of the fence so she could be treated . Protection: A white sheet was placed over her to stop the sparks from the saw flying into her face .

"By . Wills Robinson . Drivers using their cellphones at the wheel does not affect the number of crashes, according to the results of a recent study. Researchers at the University of Colorado looked at more than a million accidents over six years on highways in California and found that a state ban had not reduced the number of collisions. The researchers chose a window of six months before and after the ban to eliminate other factors such as the production of safer cars, the recession and changes in other  traffic laws. Road safety: A study by the University of Colorado claims that a ban on using cellphones in cars has not led to a drop in the number of accidents (file picture) The results appears to contradict previous research which suggests using a phone at the wheel is as dangerous as drink-driving. Thirteen states currently ban handheld-cellphone use for all drivers, and 10 other states have some form of ban either just for younger drivers, a ban in school zones or as a local option. The findings published in the journal, Transportation Research, said: 'We find no evidence of a state-wide decrease in accidents as a result of the ban. While our results are specific to California, cell phone bans in other jurisdictions that have similar enforcement and penalty parameters could be expected to have similar effects.' University of Colorado associate economics professor Daniel Kaffine, one of the study's authors, said: 'If it’s really that dangerous, and if even just a fraction of people stop using their phones, we would expect to find some decrease in accidents. But we didn’t find any statistical evidence of a reduction.' 'Disentangling these effects will be useful for policymakers in other states who are considering policies to address distracted driving,' Kaffine added. 'However, our results suggest that simply banning hand-held cellphone use may not produce the desired increase in traffic safety.' However, Kaffine said it is not conclusive proof the laws do not work, pointing out that some people may have already switched to handsfree devices such as Bluetooth before the ban. Crashes related to distractions caused by cellphones are said to be one of the most common causes of deaths among young people.

"By . Wills Robinson . A prized possession of one music's biggest petrolheads, Elvis Presley, is set to fetch up to $300,000 at auction next month. Elvis bought the Rolls-Royce Phantom V brand new in 1963 and had it custom-fitted with the latest gadgets including a telephone, electric windows and a microphone. The car was initially midnight blue, but he was forced to have it re-painted a lighter silver because his mother's chickens would repeatedly peck at their reflections when he visited her. Rock and rolls: Elvis's 1963 Royals Royce Phantom will go under the hammer next month and is expected to fetch between $200,000 and $300,000 . Luxurious: He bought the car in 1963 and sent it to a coach builder to have it equipped with the latest gadgets. The car was initially midnight blue, but he was forced to repaint it light silver because his mother's chickens kept pecking at it . Elvis was renowned for his love of cars, especially Rolls Royces. He is pictured here with another Phantom he bought in 1961 outside his Graceland mansion . When his new purchase arrived, he sent it to Britain where coachbuilder James Young installed the newest gadgets including a Blaupunkt Koln radio, parking and flashing lights and air conditioning. The car will go under the hammer next month at a Bonhams sale in The Quail, California and is expected to sell for between $200,000 and $300,000. The centre rear armrest featured a writing pad, mirror and clothes brush while a fitted cabinet contained cut glass decanters and crystal glasses. Under the bonnet was a 6.2-litre, V8 engine which gave the 2.6-ton car 200bhp and a top speed . of around 100mph. Elvis, then a 28-year-old global sensation, had the 20-foot long car shipped out to his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, where he entertained the likes of The Beatles. Memphis's most famous son held on to the Rolls-Royce for five years before donating it to charity, where it sold for $35,000 (£20,500). It then disappeared for the next 20 years until it was bought by its current owner at a memorabilia auction in London. They have kept it in a private museum and used it sparingly, with the car regularly maintained by English Rolls-Royce restorers Frank Dale and Stepsons. Bonhams yesterday described the Rolls-Royce as 'one of the more significant Phantom V's to have come up for sale in recent years'. The auction house added: 'It is a most interesting model of this highly desirable motorcar complete with undisputed Elvis provenance . 'It is offered with copy of its original chassis card confirming the original owner as well as his exacting specifications. 'This important and significant Rolls-Royce Phantom V, with its undisputed place in pop culture history, will surely be jewel in the crown for any Elvis collector.'

"By . Wills Robinson . A Chinese spy ship has been spotted off the coast of Hawaii during a giant U.S.-led naval exercise. The vessels crashed the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) drill which involves 22 countries, 40 ships and more than 250,000 soldiers. Despite the potential threat to U.S. security, Beijing's defence ministry said they had the right to send in the intelligence boats, even though four ships and 1,000 of their soldiers were already part of the operation. Warfare: The Chinese vessels were spotted at the  Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) drill where the U.S. Navy was showing off one of its new amphibious vehicles (pictured) Presence: The Chinese naval destroyer Haikou (left) and frigate Yueyang were already involved in the drill . The Navy played down any intelligence risk associated with the vessels and noted that China also sent a similar ship to monitor the same exercise two years ago. 'We've taken all necessary precautions to protect our critical information,' said Captain Darryn James, chief spokesman of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. 'We expect this ship will remain outside of U.S. territorial seas and not operate in a manner that disrupts the ongoing Rim of the Pacific maritime exercise.' In a statement, China's Defence Ministry, said its naval vessels had the right under international law to operate 'in waters outside of other country's territorial waters'. 'China respects the rights granted under international law to relevant littoral states, and hopes that relevant countries can respect the legal rights Chinese ships have,' it added. U.S. officials hope China's participation in RIMPAC will help resolve tensions but analysts believe their presence may  help Beijing strengthen its naval capability, . Military might: The drill off the coast of Hawaii involves 22 nations, as well as 49 surface ships (including new U.S. machinery), and more than 200 aircraft . The U.S. also conducts surveillance operations in international waters and airspace and the Navy did not voice protest over the appearance of the vessel. Still, James said he was unaware of any participant doing something similar since the RIMPAC drills began in 1971. 'To my knowledge, this is the first time a nation has ever sent a surveillance ship near Hawaii while also having invited ships participating in the RIMPAC exercise,' James said. The Chinese ships participating in the drills are missile destroyer Haikou, missile frigate Yueyang, supply ship Qiandaohu and hospital ship Peace Ark. Future of warfare: The US displayed a prototype of its new amphibious transport vehicle, the Ultra Heavy-Lift Amphibious Connecter (UHAC). It can drive onto the shore and scale objects up to three metres high on land . The exercises come at a time when tensions are high between Beijing and U.S. allies such as Japan and the Philippines over China's pressing of territorial claims in the South and East China Seas. They also come after a dispute between China and Vietnam that led to one of the worst breakdowns in ties since they fought a brief war in 1979. During the drill, the U.S. Marines displayed  a prototype of its new amphibious transport vehicle. The Ultra Heavy-Lift Amphibious Connecter (UHAC) concept is designed to power across the water with a payload of nearly 200 tons at up to 20 knots (23 mph). It is capable of driving up on to the shore and over the top of obstructions up to 10 ft (3 m) high.","Ship ventured into America's 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Three men believed to have been held as ‘slaves’ were rescued in police raids yesterday. Officers stormed three traveller sites, a business unit and two homes as part of an investigation into forced labour and human trafficking. Three alleged victims – one in his 30s, one in his 40s and one in his 50s – were taken  to safety. Their identities have not yet  been revealed. Abuse: William Connors was caught on camera attacking one of the 19 slaves at his caravan site . Rescued: Three men believed to be victims of slavery have been rescued following a series of police raids across South Gloucestershire and Bristol (file picture) Two people were arrested on suspicion . of having committed slavery offences, and five others were held on . suspicion of crimes including cannabis production, money laundering and . handling stolen goods. Police . said a ‘significant quantity’ of cash was found at one address, and a . suspected stolen trailer and cannabis plants were seized from a farm. Chief . Superintendent Julian Moss, head of CID at Avon and Somerset Police, . which launched an investigation into forced labour and human trafficking . five weeks ago, said: ‘This is an ongoing and dynamic inquiry – our . primary aim is to safeguard and protect vulnerable victims. Chief Superintendent Julian Moss, head of CID at Avon and Somerset Police, said the force launched Operation Wanderer five weeks ago . ‘Victims in such cases are often forced to live and work in poor and unsanitary conditions, sometimes with little or no pay. ‘Some . will not view themselves as victims and, even if they do, may have been . unable to speak to the police or any other authorities for a variety of . reasons.’ Mr Moss added: . ‘To the outside world, the fear and intimidation faced by victims of . forced labour on a daily basis are difficult to comprehend. Today’s . operation is a very visible statement of our intent to protect people . from this type  of exploitation.’ Last . December, William and Mary Connors and three members of their family . were jailed at Bristol Crown Court for keeping 19 slaves at a caravan . site in Staverton, Gloucestershire, to carry out building work. The . traveller family, who made hundreds of thousands from the enforced . labour, got sentences ranging from two to six years. Yesterday’s . raids took place in south Gloucestershire and Bristol. They were . planned with organisations including the National Crime Agency, the . anti-trafficking charity Unseen, the Red Cross and the Salvation Army. Arrangements have been made to help the alleged victims with  medical treatment, accommodation and employment. Mr . Moss said: ‘It’s important to recognise that the actions of a small . minority of people are not reflective of the wider travelling community. 'Similar investigations in other parts of the country show the issue of . forced labour, domestic servitude and human trafficking is prevalent in . many areas of society.’ 'Some of those affected will not view . themselves as victims and, even if they do, may have been unable to . speak to the police or any other authorities for a variety of reasons.'To the outside world the fear and intimidation faced by victims of forced labour on a daily basis are difficult to comprehend' - Chief Superintendent Julian Moss . Amanda . Deeks, chief executive of South Gloucestershire Council, said the . authority had worked closely with police through the investigation. ‘Our focus is to ensure that the victims will be given the help they need now that they are in a place of safety,’ she added. Kate . Garbers, co-founder of Unseen, said the Bristol-based charity had been . approached by the police and asked to help with the operation. ‘The . police had intelligence and wanted to act on it. Unseen were able to . use their involvement in previous operations, along with their . experience of working with survivors, to help develop that response,’ she said. ‘It’s encouraging to see such a proactive approach from the police and to be involved in a multi-agency approach. ‘From . working with the police, I commend their in-depth approach to planning, . and it’s clear that they appreciate the seriousness of these crimes and . are taking action.’ Avon . and Somerset’s police and crime commissioner, Sue Mountstevens, said the . operation ‘clearly highlights the unacceptable and illegal crime of . human trafficking’.

"By . Wills Robinson . Grimsby was first targeted by Benefits Street producers as the setting for new a welfare scroungers documentary. Now the Lincolnshire fishing town has been given the Borat treatment  - becoming the inspiration for Sacha Baron Cohen's new film about football hooligans and binge drinkers. The comedian, who rose to fame after playing fake rapper Ali G, has started production for the new project which is set to be released in 2015. But the move has prompted criticism because locals believe the town's name is being used in 'bad light' and will have a negative impact on the local economy. Scroll down for video .

Scenes from Sacha Baron Cohen's new film Grimsby shows a man urinating . out of the window onto the street below. The blockbuster is based in the . Lincolnshire town and is about football hooligans . The 42-year old actor, who has also played the controversial roles of Bruno and The Dictator, has been spotted around Tilbury with film crews. The Essex town has been transformed into Grimsby for filming, with road signs and restaurant names being changed and mock discount shops being set up to represent the Lincolnshire community in the 1980s. The plot is based on a covert agent who is forced to go on the run and join his brother, who happens to be a footballer. Scenes with men urinating from windows and scantily-clad women swigging from beer cans on the street have already been completed. Children are also filmed being offered beer cans while wheeling drunken men in their prams outside boarded-up store fronts. North East Lincolnshire Councillor Matthew Brown told Mail Online he is 'disappointed' with the project because anything associated with football hooligans is negative. He said: 'It is using the town's name in potentially a poor light. What also worries me is that there is no benefit to the local economy which is carrying the town's name. 'Anything that you associate with football hooliganism is going to be negative, but I hope people will be open-minded when they watch the film. He added that depicting Grimsby as a town which has a history of football violence is wrong. 'My view is quite simple. We don't have a massive issue with hooliganism. There is very good stewarding at the ground. In general we are not in the same category as other clubs like Millwall who have a history of it. 114939 . 151186 . 146054 . 75744 . 54614 . 83128 . 109877 .

'Sacha Baron Cohen visited the area when he watch Grimbsy Town and I understand the fans treated him well. 'We cannot comment until we have watched the film. But I hope those fans are not abused.' Residents in Grimsby have recently risen up against Channel 4, after their attempt to make it the new location of 'poverty porn'. Camera crews from the producers of controversial series Skint were seen scouting and 'test filming' on the Nunsthorpe estate since before Christmas. It followed the first season of Benefits Street which last year caused great upset in nearby Scunthorpe, where drug users and benefits claimants were filmed on the town’s Westcliff estate. In 2012, the Surrey town of Staines officially changed its name to Staines-upon-Thames in an attempt to boost its image after one of Baron Cohen's films. Councillors voted for the change after the area became synonymous with spoof rapper Ali G. Spelthorne Borough Council made the change to attract more business to the town, which sits on the banks of the River Thames. The long-debated revamp of the Surrey town prompted a day of celebrations from maypole dancing to a regatta as the town set out to prove it was more glamorous than its M25 commuter-belt image.

Elton John once sang: 'Oh England you´re fair. But there´s none to compare with my Grimsby.' It was once the biggest fishing port in the world, but the EU Common Fisheries Policy meant production slowed and now only a handful of boats travel from the docks. The town on the banks of the Humber was founded by Danish fishermen in the 9th Century and grew to become the world's largest fishing port in the 1980s. It benefited from the industrial revolution in the 19th Century, with train links making it easier to transport goods to and from the port. In 1970 around 400 trawlers were based in the port, by 2013 only 5 trawlers were based there, three times less than the number which maintain offshore wind farms in the North Sea. The industry was killed by the Icelandic cod wars of the early Seventies and the EU’s legilstaion. The town still has the largest fish market in the UK, but most of what is sold is now brought overland from other ports or . Of the 18,000 tonnes of fresh fish sold in Grimsby fish market in 2012, almost 13,000 tonnes, mainly cod and haddock came from Iceland.","Sacha Baron Cohen is shooting new movie, based on 1980s football violence .

"By . Wills Robinson . As he arrived by helicopter to pick up his £200million super-yacht, the Aga Khan would have hoped he could have sailed off into the sun. But as the 77-year-old, who is worth nearly £500 million, touched down at Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth, Devon, he was greeted by torrential downpours and choppy seas. The 164ft luxury vessel, named the Alamshar after his retired Irish Thoroughbred racehorse, was commissioned in the 1990s and was destined to be the world's fastest yacht with a top speed of 70 knots (80mph). Luxurious vessel: The £200 million yacht, the Alamshar, set sail from Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth, Devon, in torrential downpours and choppy waters . Ambitious: Named after the Prince's Irish Thoroughbred racehorse, the yacht is 164ft long and was commissioned in the 1990s in the hope it might be the world's fastest super-yacht with a top speed of 70 knots (80mph). However it has been revealed it can only reach 45 knots . But the over-ambitious project has only just been completed and the leader of the world's 12 million Ismaili Muslims has been left with the fact it can only travel at a mere 45 knots (51.7mph). Originally named Project 305 - it was hoped the Alamshar would break the world speed record for super-yachts as well as beat the transatlantic record he set - two days, ten hours and 34 minutes. Manufacturer: Babcock International Group . Length: 164ft (49.9m) Breadth: 36.7ft (11.2m) Speed: Up to 45 knots (51.7mph) Range: 700 nautical miles at speeds of 45 knots, 950 nautical miles at speeds of 35 knots and 1040 nautical miles at 15 knots. Engine manufacturer: Pratt and Whitney (used primarily by the Norwegian Navy) Propulsion Machinery: Six gas turbines and 112 water jets . Built under a veil of secrecy by Babcock International Group, it was intended to be a superstar among super-yachts. One source involved with the project told The Sunday Times that the Aga Khan was disappointed his dream could not be achieved following years of efforts. The project was mired but setbacks from an early stage. In 2008 during sea trials, it was forced to return to the docks as it could only travel at 35 knots (40mph). According to a statement released by Babock and the Aga Khan, the project took so long because the mechanical targets were 'challenging'. It said: 'State-of-the-art shipbuilding and systems integration technology required to deliver the vessel to specification would have doubtless proved demanding even if employed in a commercial or military vessel.' Even though the speed has not reached its admired heights, guests on the boat will be given a comfortable ride, because of the gas turbine design. According to the manufacturer's website, it eliminates all mechanical vibration, and counters the effects of pitch and roll. In 1992, he managed to cross the Atlantic in a record two days, 10 hours and 34 minutes with another of his vessels, the Destriero. However, the speed of the Alamshar may mean he is not able to repeat that achievement. The Aga Khan, whose ancestors fled Persia for India two centuries ago, was born in Switzerland, and now spends most of his time in France, despite having British citizenship. He inherited his title from his grandfather in 1957 and is believed by his followers to be 'the bringer of life'. In spite of his sometimes turbulent private life he remains revered for the worldwide charitable works he has directed funds to. He also owned the infamous racehorse Shergar, who was stolen by gunmen in Ireland in 1983 and never seen again. Arrival: The Aga Khan (pictured left at the 2013 French Derby ) is said to have flown to Britain in a private helicopter (right) to pick up his luxurious purchase . Slowed: The Alamshar was intended to be a superstar among super-yachts, powered by engines capable of blasting it to more than 70 knots. Guests will however enjoy a comfortable ride because of the gas turbine design . Name of a champion: The super-yacht was named after the Aga Khan's retired Irish Thoroughbred racehorse. He won five of his nine races in a career which lasted from September 2002 to September 2003 .","The Alamshar set sail from Devonport Dockyard in Devon during torrential downpours and choppy water .

"By . Wills Robinson . Crime Boss: Terry Adams, 59, arrived at the High Court, wearing a suit he designed, to answer accusations he is using criminal proceeds to fund a luxurious lifestyle . A notorious gangster has told a judge he feels like a 'ponce' because he is living off of his wife and working for free as a 'creative' clothes designer. Terry Adams the founder of London's Clerkenwell Crime Syndicate, told the High Court today he was 'frustrated' by his lack of income. The 58-year-old, who arrived in a blue suit he had designed himself, is accused of using criminal profits to fund a luxurious lifestyle. The crime boss, who headed the organisation nicknamed The Adams Family, said he had been treated to four meals at The Ivy and three trips to The Royal Opera House. But he claims he can not afford the £750,000 confiscation order that was imposed alongside his sentence for money laundering in 2007, suggesting that his wife Ruth his is only source of income. He is now trying to have all of his debts - £600,000 worth - eradicated on the grounds of 'poverty'. Adams's court appearance today came after his conviction for breaching a financial reporting order which began when he was jailed seven years ago. It required him to report all spending over £500 to the Serious Organised Crime Agency over the next 10 years. The court heard that he had enjoyed massages at The Dorchester Hotel, was given pricey meals at Browns in Mayfair, and is normally seen driving around in a BMW or Mercedes. According to the Evening Standard, his new job as a designer involves him looking at fashion magazines and 'tweaking' their appearances. Adams claimed fashion is his 'one love' and had followed the career path after struggling to find work in the jewellery industry. He told the court: 'The only source of income I get is from my wife. I feel like a ponce. I get frustrated because I’m not bringing in any money. 'She’s the breadwinner. It’s difficult for me. It causes no end of arguments in our flat. It doesn’t stop.' Explaining his trips to high-class restaurants and hotels, he said they had been paid for by 'others' including his sister-in-law's boyfriend. Kennedy Talbot, representing the CPS, suggested to Mr Adams at London's High Court today that loans said to have been taken out by his wife because times were hard were not genuine. Cross-examining Mr Adams he said: 'These are not genuine loans at all. This is just your money being routed to you through fabricated arrangements.' Denying the accusation, Mr Adams replied that he had said all along, from the time when he was in prison, that he had no money. Mr Adams said to Mr Talbot: 'Now we are here and you are saying we have this money I have not got, but how do I prove this to you?' New career: The crime boss (left) claims he is working for his wife Ruth (right) for free as a 'creative' clothes designer. He also told the court that he was 'frustrated' about his lack of income . The CPS says Mr and Mrs Adams' average 'identifiable' spending in the three years from September 2010-2013 was £97,000 per annum - 'nearly four times the national average'. The type of spending was 'inconsistent' with his claim of having no assets and of being reliant on friends and family loans for living expenses, Mr Talbot has told the court. The CPS said Mrs Adams had spent £12,044 on dental treatment, and £2,500 on a dietary programme during three months in 2013. In June 2010 she bought a spa membership at a North London country club for £3,850. Lavish: He told the court he was treated to four meals at The Ivy in west London (pictured) as well as a massage at The Dorchester Hotel . The couple had also spent nearly £15,000 on flights, hotels, restaurants and entertainment from August 2009-September 2013. Another £5,351 had gone on parking charges, fines and the congestion charge. Mr Talbot argued that the evidence showed a pattern of behaviour that was 'entirely consistent with the original criminal case against (Mr Adams) of concealing his assets through associates and using sham companies to provide an apparent form of legitimate income'. Adams and his brothers Sean (known as Tommy) and Patrick rose to power in the 1980s and were linked to drug trafficking, extortions, hijackings, security fraud and large-scale operations including the Brinks Mat robbery at Heathrow Airport in 1985. Based in Clerkenwell, North London, they evaded prosecution for years by running their syndicate at arm's length but were once described as 'worse than the Krays'. Music fan: The notorious gangster also enjoyed three trips to The Royal Opera House in London, which he told the court his wife had paid for . Claims: He said he is too poor to pay £750,000 as part of a confiscation order and wants to have the debt cleared on grounds of 'poverty' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The gangster claims he is working for his wife, Ruth, as a clothes designer .

"By . Wills Robinson . In 1943, British troops commandeered the hamlet of Imber on Salisbury Plain to prepare for the D-Day landings. Seventy years on, a new group of residents have taken it over - a colony of 8 million bees. Commanded by retired Army major Chris Wilkes, 61, the insects are given the opportunity to thrive in one of the last wilderness area in the UK. With permission from the Ministry of Defence, he watches over 150 hives dotted across the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) that has never been treated with modern pesticides. It is the perfect spot for the beekeeper, who wants to reintroduce Britain's population of indigenous bees, as it is five miles from the nearest colony of foreign insects. 'The area is very rich in wild flowers,' he said. 'Eighteen of the 22 top nectar producing plants in the UK are right here, including clover, sainfoin, viper’s bugloss, knapweed and melilot. There is also no interference from the public.' About 95 per cent of bees in the UK are non-native and were introduced here in the 1920s after a disease virtually wiped out the population. Having  are thriving. The hot summer, following on from the wet winter and dry spring, have created a cornucopia of the top nectar flowers in the UK, producing a honey with the distinctive flavour of one of Britain's last wilderness areas.

"By . Wills Robinson . The ticket wartime Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain used on his symbolic trip to secure peace with Adolf Hitler has emerged for sale at £15,000. Chamberlain waved the ticket as he boarded the British Airways flight from Heston Aerodrome in London to Munich on September 29, 1938. The aim of the trip was to hold crisis talks with the Fuhrer following Germany’s invasion of Czechoslovakia. Fearing war, Chamberlain agreed to allow Hitler’s occupation of part of the country in return for the assurance that peace and stability in Europe would continue. 'Peace in our time': The ticket Neville Chamberlain used to board a plane to Munich for a meeting with Hitler in 1938 is expected to fetch £15,000 at an auction later this month . Symbolic: The wartime leader waved the Anglo-German declaration on his return from the crisis talks. But just a year later he was forced to announce that Britain was at war following Germany's invasion of Poland . Along with Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier, Chamberlain and Hitler signed a pact that became known as the Munich Agreement. On his return to Britain the following day, Chamberlain triumphantly declared that war had been averted and he had secured 'peace for our time'. As he waved the Anglo-German declaration above his head, he told reporters waiting on the runway that the pact was 'symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again.' But just a year later he was forced to make the embarrassing announcement that Britain was at war with Germany following Hitler’s continued invasion of Poland. The reaction set the grounds for Chamberlain’s political demise and by May 1940 he had been replaced by Winston Churchill as Prime Minister. The paper ticket carried the number BA/WS 18249 and under 'passenger name' is written 'The Rt Hon Neville Chamberlain'. It notes that he left from Heston Aerodrome  and in the box marked 'Fare' it is written 'Special Flight'. Historic: Chamberlain, pictured boarding the plane on September 29 1938,  met with the Fuhrer alongside Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier in a bid to secure peace in Europe . Support: A crowd of supporters and reporters gathered at the Heston Aerodrome to see the Prime Minister off . Farewell: Chamberlain embarks on the crucial journey to Germany . After the flight it was saved by British Airways founder George Denny and was found among his possessions following his death. It is believed he kept the ticket as a souvenir as he would have appreciated the historic importance of the flight. The ticket is tipped to fetch £15,000 when it goes under the hammer at London auction house Spink and Son on behalf of a private collector. It is only the second time the ticket has been offered at auction. Neill Granger, a specialist at Spink, said: 'This plane ticket is quite exceptional. 'Neville Chamberlain’s visit to Munich in 1938 was an iconic moment in history. He thought he had solved the problem of Hitler and returned triumphant. 'But famously things didn’t turn out the way Chamberlain expected and a year later we were at war with Germany. 'What Chamberlain had intended to be a landmark moment ended up being one of the nails in his political coffin. 'The flight ticket was issued on September 28, 1938, the day before the flight. 'It was found among the personal possessions of George Denny, one of the founders of British Airways. 'Normally these tickets were thrown away but he obviously decided this one was one to keep. 'It is one of those items that if two people decide they want it could see bidding go far beyond our estimate.' The auction will be held on July 18.","Wartime Prime Minister waved the ticket before boarding a plane to Munich .

"By . Wills Robinson . Fitted with laser-guided bombs and Hellfire missiles, these are the RAF's newest Reaper Drones which are being used in Afghanistan . Their main role is to gather intelligence and carry out surveillance for forces on the ground, but they can also be armed with deadly weapons. Pictures released today show the unmanned aircraft being assembled and flying from Kandahar airfield on missions which will help Afghan, UK and ISAF forces. Air support: The newest Reaper drones fly from Kandahar airfield on missions which will aid Afghan, UK and ISAF forces. The Ministry of Defence say they are key in maintaining security in the country . Information gathering: Their main role will be to gather intelligence and carry out surveillance operations . The deployment of five new Reapers means there are twice as many in Afghanistan operating alongside the Army’s Hermes 450 unmanned aircraft. Their ability to provide real-time video to commanders on the ground is said to be vital to efforts to cement security in Afghanistan as allied forces pull out of the country. The aircraft, dubbed by some as 'eyes in the sky', will be operated by XIII Sqn from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, and 39 Squadron at Creech Air Force Base in the USA. The MoD has been keen to step away from the term 'drone' when talking about unmanned air systems, because it elicits ideas of unaccountable computerised technology. In December the MoD said there had been more than 54,000 hours of operations using Reaper in Afghanistan, with only 459 weapons fired - less than one weapon for every 120 hours flying - while non-armed reconnaissance Unmanned Air Systems had flown almost three times as many operations, flying over 160,000 hours.

Announcing the latest Reapers, Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology Philip Dunne said: 'These new aircraft give the RAF enhanced Force Protection capability in support of UK, ISAF and Afghan troops. 'As we focus on the drawdown of UK forces from Afghanistan, the ability to provide force protection will become increasingly important and Reaper allows us to provide this assurance, remotely and without significant ground presence.' Air Commodore Al Gillespie, who is responsible for the command and control of UK Air assets over Afghanistan, added: 'These aircraft will support UK, ISAF and Afghan forces as they work to protect the people of Afghanistan. 'They provide vital intelligence and precise strike capability without putting our servicemen and women at risk. 'As we drawn down from Afghanistan it is precisely this technology that will keep us one step ahead and allow us to combat internal security in the country.'

"By . Wills Robinson . Victory: Michael Morpurgo led the successful campaign to stop the wind turbine being built in his home village . Plans to build a 15-storey wind turbine in the middle of the countryside setting which inspired  War Horse have been thrown out after opposition from author Michael Morpurgo. The writer was joined by dozens of people who fought plans to install the 145ft tower in the picturesque village of Iddesleigh in Devon. He argued the 225 kilowatt device would 'despoil' the rural community made famous by his First World War novel. The story, about a young farmer and his horse Joey, spawned a West End play and a Hollywood blockbuster directed by Steven Spielberg. His supporters also argued the £600,000 turbine would tower over the famous Tarka Trail, which is not far from the hall which sets the scene for the story of a young farm boy and his horse, Joey. West Devon Borough Council rejected the Coombe Farm planning application last October but that decision was appealed. However the Planning Inspectorate sided with villagers and reinforced the original decision on Monday, ruling that the development would harm the 'appearance and character' of the local landscape and listed buildings in the area. Inspector Janice Trask said: 'The proposal would provide a valuable contribution to cutting greenhouse gas emissions and this warrants great weight. 'However, this would not outweigh the significant harm I have identified. Mr Morpurgo, 66, who lives in Iddesleigh, wrote to the council last year saying the turbine would 'cast a shadow' over the village. He said: 'As a result of the recent film and play based upon my book, War Horse, many more people are discovering the unique character of this corner of England, the farming country where Joey grew up before he was taken off as so many farm horses were to the First Word War. 'However, the proposed wind turbine threatens to despoil the entire area - it will be intrusive to eye and ear, it will disturb the tranquillity and cast a shadow over all who come here, city child or visitor, and over those of us who live here and love this place.' Edward Sweet, chairman of Iddesleigh Parish Council and one of nearly 300 people who wrote letters of objection to the turbine, said: 'It was obvious from the amount of people that objected to this turbine that this decision would be taken. We are really happy about it. ' Idyllic: The 15-storey tower would have been built on the hills surrounding the village Iddesleigh, Devon. It inspired the setting of Morpurgo's First World War novel War Horse . Generally people come down to Devon for the countryside and the peace and quiet. They don't really want to be surrounded by these turbines. 'Plus the fact is, you could put thousands of turbines up in Devon and it would only produce five or six percent of the energy people need.' Penny Mills, Chairman of CPRE Devon (Campaign to Protect Rural England) said she was delighted with the decision to stop the building of the turbine which would have overshadowed 'War Horse Valley. She said: '​Iddesleigh and the surrounding area is a particularly beautiful and tranquil unspoilt part of Devon. Spoiled: West Devon Borough Council said the £600,000 tower would have harmed the 'appearance and character' of the local area . 'This 150ft noisy, rotating machine would have been totally unacceptable in this location, which is why we objected to the proposal. 'The benefit in terms of electricity generated and emission savings would have been insignificant from this proposal and this insignificant benefit does not outweigh the harm in terms of adverse impact on the local amenity. 'However, there are already 95 turbines permitted, another 37 in planning and 18 in appeal ​in  West Devon and Torridge alone including in this area around 'War Horse Valley' - Winkleigh, Dowland, Hatherleigh . ​'If all were approved this would mean more than one turbine to every square mile and a quarter. 'The numbers are staggering and these commercial ventures are fundamentally changing our once beautiful landscape here - a countryside and landscape which is valuable with tourism so important to our economy. 'We are all now living in a giant wind farm here, which nobody asked for and only a handful of people benefit from. 'The area continues to be bombarded with these proposals, so this beautiful part of Devon is still under enormous threat.'

Pupils at St John Fisher Catholic High School were left horrified after two stowaways tried to get on their coach during a trip to France . Both of the suspects were arrested in front of the horrified children during the £300 four-day trip.

"By . Wills Robinson . Hundreds of Michael Jackson fans have paid tribute to the iconic singer on the fifth anniversary of his death. Around 100 loyal followers, some dressed as the self-proclaimed King of Pop, arrived at the Forest Lawn cemetery outside Los Angeles yesterday to pay tribute to the singer, who died in 2009 while rehearsing for a comeback tour. Fans travelled from Britain, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the United States and many other countries to the cemetery, the final resting place of generations of Hollywood celebrities. Impersonators also gathered to re-enact some of his iconic hits, including Smooth Criminal and Thriller, while flowers were laid on his pavement 'star' along Hollywood Boulevard. Scroll down for video . Tribute: Michael Jackon fans gather in Los Angeles to remember the star, five years on from his death . In loving memory: Flowers and candles were laid on the singers star on Hollywood Boulevard . 'We love you Michael,' read a banner on a giant red heart placed outside the small mausoleum where he is interred in Glendale, north of Los Angeles. Another message said: 'Five years without you - we love you more,' while others said simply: 'We miss you' or 'Thank you for continuously giving us reason to smile.' Mikie, who came with a group of girlfriends from Japan all dressed in Jackson T-shirts, said it was her second time at the neatly-tended cemetery. Yesterday, Conrad Murray, speaking to CNN on the anniversary of his patient's death  voiced remorse but insisted he was not to blame. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter after Jackson died. 'I am very remorseful that Michael has passed,' he said. 'Michael was a friend. I felt like a father figure to Michael. He added that he treated Jackson not because of the $150,000 a month he was going to be paid, but as a result of his 'love' for the musician.

Peace: An admirer and an impersonator pose for a photo at the Forest Lawn Cemetary in LA . Jackson died on June 25, 2009 of an overdose of the clinical anesthetic propofol, administered by his doctor to help treat insomnia as the singer prepared for ""This is It"" shows in London. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 over the star's death and jailed for four years. He was released in October after serving two years. On Wednesday, he recounted the final hours as he gave Jackson a series of drugs to help him sleep. But he insisted he did not know that another doctor had been giving the singer another drug, Demerol, for years to treat pain. 'Michael Jackson lived a life of pain, for so many years, decades .. I could not help but be sympathetic to this man,' said Murray, who added that he plans to appeal his conviction to the Supreme Court if necessary. Tandem: Impersonators Rem Garza (left) and Lorenzo Coleman (right) perform in front of fans at the cemetery . Remembering: Tourists used their phones to take pictures of the tributes on the world-famous thoroughfare . 'I have suffered a lot ... my life is certainly a struggle. I'm doing my best to put it back on track,' he said, adding: 'I grieve for Michael every day.' Jackson was planning a global comeback tour to help him stave off bankruptcy, five years after being acquitted of child molestation charges that left his career in tatters. He had debts of up to $500 million before his death, but in the five years since, his executors have earned more than $700 million, according to the recent book 'Michael Jackson Inc.' Money-making ventures have included the 'This is It' movie of rehearsals for the doomed tour, a touring Cirque du Soleil stage show and two posthumous albums so far, with more to come.

'It's a sad day for most of us, but we decided to celebrate who the man was, and celebrate his legacy,' said Melanie Freeman from New York. 'Five years later, it just grows, it's not diminished at all,' she told AFP, adding: 'All the things that MJ used to do, we do it for him now.'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Smokers are more likely to commit suicide than those who never take up the habit - and the chemicals in cigarettes may be to blame. Previous research has indicated that smokers are more likely to take their own lives - but it was thought this was because people with psychiatric disorders also tend to smoke. Now new research suggests the nicotine in tobacco . could trigger psychiatric disorders - or make . them more severe. The study compared U.S. states that have increased tobacco taxes and banned . smoking in public to those that have not. Suicide rates in the U.S. declined in states that enforced higher taxes on cigarettes and stricter policies to limit smoking in public places - and increased in those that were more lenient. Map shows the range of state cigarette taxes from the lowest (lightest blue) to the highest (darkest blue) Suicide rates were . lower in states that were 'anti-tobacco', the researchers from Washington University, St. Louis, discovered. Those that had increased tobacco taxes . and banned smoking in public places between 1990 and 2004 had saw suicide rates decline by up to 15 per cent compared to the national average. Since, then states such as New York, Illinois and California have enforced smoking bans in public places. The conclusions were drawn after analsying the different smoking policies adopted by different states, such as approaches . to taxing cigarettes and limiting when and where people could smoke. Using . statistical methods, the researchers compared rates of suicide in . states with stricter tobacco policies to rates in states with more . lenient laws and lower taxes. They say their findings show more policies to limit smoking should be introduced for mental health reasons as well as physical. Richard Grucza, assistant professor of psychiatry at the university, said: 'Although scientists . have known for years that people who smoke have a higher risk for . suicide, they had assumed the risk was related to the psychiatric . disorders that affect many smokers. 'These new findings, however, . suggest smoking may increase the risk for psychiatric disorders, or make . them more severe, which, in turn, can influence suicide risk. One theory is that the nicotine in tobacco could trigger psychiatric disorders - or make them more severe . 'We . really need to look more closely at the effects of smoking and nicotine, . not only on physical health but on mental health, too. 'We don't . know exactly how smoking influences suicide risk. It could be that it . affects depression or increases addiction to other substances. The numbers show it clearly does something.' Nicotine is likely to be the key culprit, he added. 'Like . any other addicting drug, people start using nicotine to feel good, but . eventually they need it to feel normal. And as with other drugs, that . chronic use can contribute to depression or anxiety, and that could help . to explain the link to suicide. 'If you're not a smoker, or not likely ever to become a . smoker, then your suicide risk shouldn't be influenced by tobacco . policies. 'So the fact that we saw this influence among people who . likely were smokers supports the idea that . smoking itself is linked to suicide - rather than some other factor . related to policy.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Becky Liddle was also left temporarily unable to speak after collapsing at school due to a stroke . A nine-year-old schoolgirl has been left paralysed down her right side after suffering a stroke. Becky Liddle, from Hull, also was unable to speak in the first few days after the event and has spent the last month being tube fed in hospital. Her mother Michelle claims doctors originally thought Becky was suffering a huge migraine - but tests later revealed she had sufffered a stroke. Mrs Liddle, 45, said: 'The first I heard was when the school called me to say Becky had passed out. 'As I walked outside I saw an ambulance go past with the blue lights on and I just knew it was for her. 'I don’t drive so a teacher came and picked me up and when I arrived at the school I could see Becky being taken off in a stretcher. 'She couldn’t move her right side and her face had dropped and I just knew she had had a stroke. 'Her father Andrew had one seven years ago and I recognised the symptoms. I was really shocked it could happen to someone as young as Becky.' Becky was rushed to Hull Royal Infirmary where inconclusive test results led doctors to think she may have suffered a severe migraine. But her mother remained unconvinced. 'I had seen my husband suffer a stroke and my mother’s instinct was telling me it was something more than a migraine.' And two days later doctors confirmed her fears after scan results revealed she had a blood clot, which had caused the stroke. Doctors have been unable to confirm whether she will regain movement, her mother said. Becky has spent the last month being tube fed in hospital and doctors have been unable to confirm whether she will regain movement in her right side . 'She is so young but she has made a . steady improvement over the past few weeks,' said Mrs Liddle, who works . as a lollipop lady. 'We are staying hopeful.' While people over 65 are at higher risk of stroke, a person of any age can have a stroke, including teenagers, children, newborns and unborn babies. It is estimated that stroke affects about 6 in 100,000 children. According to the National Stroke Association, symptoms in younger people and children include: . Sudden difficulty speaking, slurring of words or trouble understanding speech . A weakness on one side of the body . Sudden loss of vision or abnormal eye movements . Sudden loss of balance or trouble walking . Worsening or sudden headaches . Seizures, especially in newborns . She added: 'Doctors think Becky had some sort of neck trauma that tore an artery in her neck a week or so before it happened.' One cause of stroke after trauma is a tear in the head or neck blood vessels that lead to the brain, which can be a source of blood clots that cause a stroke. 'We have no idea how she suffered the neck trauma,' said Mrs Liddle. 'The doctors asked me if she had been on any rollercoaster, but she definitely hadn't.' She and her husband Andrew, 54, now want to raise awareness that anyone can suffer a stroke, no matter what their age. Michelle said: 'Before this happened to Becky I would never have thought someone so young could suffer in this way, but the symptoms still apply for youngsters and we have found out anyone can suffer a stroke. 'We are just hoping for a speedy recovery for Becky, so she can get her life back on track.' And despite spending the last month being tube fed in Leeds Royal Infirmary, Becky has not shed a tear, her mother said. 'She has been so strong so, I have to be too. If Becky isn’t crying . then how can I? She has been so brave it’s incredible,'","Becky Liddle was unable to speak in the first few days after the event .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Bob Day, 83, waited a year to have the tumour investigated - by which time it was the size of a football . A grandfather had a tumour the size of a football removed from his scrotum after waiting a year to see his doctor about it. The 9lb (4kg) growth was so bad that Bob Day’s relatives could spot it though his clothes and told him to go to the doctor. Today the retired butcher from Speke, LIverpool, praised surgeons at the Royal Liverpool Hospital who managed to remove the huge growth. Mr Day had a sarcoma - a rare type of cancer that affects soft tissues, muscles and bone. He is now urging others not to wait so long before being investigated. The 83-year-old noticed the swelling in his groin area but didn't want to make a fuss - so left it. But over the next 12 months it gradually got bigger and bigger. He said: 'You could see it in my trousers. The tumour was getting bigger and bigger but I kept putting it off - I don’t like a fuss. 'I wasn’t in pain. If I had been in pain, I probably would have gone earlier. I was still doing the gardening and doing everything as normal.' It was his daughter Jennifer, 54, and son Stephen who spotted the lump - and the fact their father was getting tired and sleeping in his chair more often. Mr Day's GP referred him to a urologist at Liverpool's Broadgreen hospital last December and after a series of scans, he was booked in for surgery in February. His daughter Jennifer, 54, added: 'With the size of it, I thought they were going to say it’s too late, there’s nothing we can do. 'When you think of cancer, you think that’s it. It is remarkable what they have done for him.' Mr Day will have more scans every three months to make sure he remains cancer-free. His surgeon, Mr Coonoor Chandrasekar, said: 'Lumps and bumps are common. One in 100 turn out to be a sarcoma. 'Sarcomas are treatable and if people come forward for treatment earlier, it can be easier.' 'If Bob hadn’t had it checked, because of the way tissue breaks down, it could have spread to his lungs which can prove fatal.' Mr Day was diagnosed with sarcoma. These are rare cancers that develop in the muscle, bone, nerves, cartilage, tendons, blood vessels and the fatty and fibrous tissues. His tumour was found to weigh a staggering 4kg .","Bob Day, 83, waited a year to see his GP about the growth .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and Associated Press Reporter . The DMV has rejected demands from a gender non-conforming teenager in South Carolina to be allowed to wear make up for a driver's license photo. Chase Culpepper, who wears androgynous clothing and make up, had requested a new photo after staff in the Anderson office in March ordered him to look less like a girl. A Transgender legal group wrote a letter of complaint, but the DMV has said that it will not bow to pressure to change its rules. Before and after: Chase Culpepper wore make up, left,  to have his photograph taken, but was asked to remove it, right, before the DMV would take his license photo . Chase says . staff claimed that DMV rules stated that the photo needed to show the . person as they appear normally, and banned pictures taken in 'disguise'. 'This is who I am and my clothing and make-up reflect that,' Chase said. 'The Department of Motor Vehicles should . not have forced me to remove my make-up simply because my appearance . does not meet their expectations of what a boy should look like.' However, a request to the DMV from the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, which asked if the teenager could have his photo retaken, has been turned down. Michel Silverman, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense, said: 'Chase's freedom to express his gender should not be restricted by DMV staff. 'He is entitled to be who he is and express that without interference from government actors.' Upset: Chase wanted to have the license picture, above, retaken after he was forced to remove his make up . Denied: A request to let Chase, a gender non-conforming teenager, get a new picture has been turned down . But Beth Parks, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that the DMV will be sticking to its rules. Ms Parks said that since 2009, the policy for driver's license photos had been that 'at no time will an applicant be . photographed when it appears that he or she is purposely altering his or . her appearance so that it the photo would misrepresent his or her . identity'. She added that law enforcement agencies relied on the photos to identify people and said Chase's requests for a new picture would be denied. 'If it's Thomas Jones on the license and . yet it looks like a female, that is very confusing for them. They want to know what the identity is,' she said. Big day: Chase had been excited about applying for a driver's license, but left the DMV offices upset . Complaint: The Transgender Legal Defense wrote to the DMV after staff allegedly told Chase that wearing make up was a 'disguise' Chase's mother, Teresa Culpepper, told WYFF4: her son had been upset by his experiences at the DMV. 'They said he was wearing a disguise. It was very hurtful. He was absolutely devastated. That’s who he is 24/7,' she said. Mrs Culpepper said the DMV policy had ruined what should have been an exciting day for the teenager. 'Instead, . he was singled out and discriminated against because he did not meet . the DMV’s expectations of how a boy should look,' she told Pink News. 'I want my son to be able to be himself without discrimination or harassment. I love him that way and the government should not be telling him that he’s not OK the way he is.'","Chase Culpepper was forced to remove make up for photograph .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and Associated Press Reporter . A picture of Aaron Hernandez brandishing a gun may show the weapon that was used to kill Odin Lloyd, prosecutors have claimed. The photo of the New England Patriot, taken in 2009 and published in TMZ last year, shows the football player posing with a Glock pistol. At a court hearing on Monday for Hernandez, who is trying to have a murder charge dismissed, prosecutors said the gun appeared to be the same type as the weapon used to kill Lloyd. Scroll down for video . Questions: This 2009 photo of Hernandez posing with a gun could show the weapon used to kill Lloyd, prosecutors claim . The picture, taken in an apartment Hernandez used to live in, was part of the evidence put forward as to why the charges should still stand. 'It was consistent with the ballistic . evidence in this case, projectiles recovered from the body of Odin . Lloyd, as well as the shell casings that had distinct markings that at . least were consistent with the markings from the Glock manufacturer,' prosecutors said. Hernandez's attorneys had asked a judge to throw out one of the former NFL star's murder cases, saying prosecutors lacked evidence. Prosecutors countered that they can tie Hernandez to Lloyd's shooting and that the killing was part of a pattern of Hernandez committing acts of violence following nightclub disputes. Also during the court hearing, Hernandez pleaded not guilty to charges that he attacked a handcuffed inmate and threatened to kill a guard and his family while at a county jail in Dartmouth. Former New England Patriots NFL football player Aaron Hernandez's attorneys challenged the evidence in one of his murder cases, arguing at a pretrial hearing that prosecutors have not established probable cause .

Hernandez faces murder charges in the June 17 slaying of Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, as well as a separate case in which he is accused of shooting two men in Boston from inside a SUV in 2012. He has pleaded not guilty in each case and is being held without bail. The former New England Patriot sat passively in a blue blazer and khaki dress pants as his attorneys argued that the charges in the Lloyd slaying should be dismissed. Defense attorney James Sultan said the prosecution might be able to prove Hernandez was with Lloyd the night he was killed, but he argued that does not make Hernandez culpable. 'You can't throw a bunch of stuff at the wall. That's not probable cause,' Sultan said. Terri Hernandez, mother of former New England Patriots NFL football player Aaron Hernandez, stands up at the conclusion of  her son's hearing . Prosecutors said their evidence includes a flurry of phone calls and text messages among those involved and the fact that Lloyd's body was found about 1,000 yards from Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, where Lloyd didn't know anybody but Hernandez. Prosecutor William McCauley also said the state's investigation into incidents in Boston, Providence and Florida show a 'common pattern' of allegations of violence against Hernandez following disputes at nightclubs.

"By . Wills Robinson . Second chance: Benefits cheat Gerald Baalham, 41, was accused of 'spitting in the face' of staff at Culford School in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk . A school IT technician who was given his job back despite stealing £56,000 in benefits has used a staff credit card to purchase thousands of pounds worth of computer equipment to sell on eBay. Gerald Baalham, 41, was given a second chance by management at the £20,000-a-year Culford School in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, after he was convicted of fraud last year. But he has now been accused of stabbing his fellow employees in the back after spending £32,000 on computers and then selling them over the internet. He also snapped up £1,000 worth of computer equipment for himself at the school’s expense. The judge at Ipswich Crown Court accused him of 'spitting in the face' of those who had kept him on, after he was given a 26-week suspended prison sentence for benefit fraud last year. Judge David Goodin accepted Baalham had become trapped in a 'vicious cycle' of dishonesty which he had found hard to break. The technician did not use the money to fund and extravagant lifestyle and was shocked when he was informed of all the full amount he had used. Judge Goodin said: 'It’s plain that you were in my judgement ill. You were under stress and you were dealing with a great deal more than your particular personality was able to deal with.' Baalham was given a two-year suspended prison sentence, after he was found guilty of abusing his position as head of the IT department. He also ordered Baalham to attend a Thinking Skills programme and gave him a 13-week curfew between the hours of 8pm and 6am. Robert Sadd, prosecuting, said Baalham was in charge of IT at the independent school and was not a teacher. Mr Sadd said the benefit fraud for which Baalham had been given a suspended prison sentence last year related to his failure to notify the authorities of a change in his circumstances while claiming Disability Living Allowance. He said that when he was quizzed by police about the computer equipment fraud he had expressed surprise at the amount involved. Claire Furlong, defending, said Baalham had been a technician at Culford School and was 'out of his depth' when he was promoted to head of department. Miss Furlong branded his scam 'unsophisticated' and said he had committed the offences after getting into debt. She said Baalham had suffered a mental breakdown and contemplated suicide.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . As scientists mark the 45th year since the Apollo 11 lunar landing, a lesser known anniversary last week quietly passed the world by. Almost one hundred years ago today, Massachusetts-born Robert Hutchings Goddard received a revolutionary patent for a liquid-fuelled rocket. The patent, which was ridiculed by journalists at the time, paved the way for the Apollo moon landings and helped bring about the dawn of the ‘space age’. Pictured is Dr Robert Goddard’s first patent for a multi-stage rocket which was received on July 7, 1914 . Dr Robert Goddard was advocated exploring space with rockets, for which he was ridiculed, which turned Goddard into something of a recluse . Dr Robert Hutchings Goddard - today considered the father of modern rocket propulsion – was a modest man who went largely unrecognised for his early work. He first caught the attention of academics as a student in 1907 after a cloud of smoke from a powder rocket fired in the basement of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute physics building. In 1914, Goddard received two U.S. patents. One was for a rocket using liquid fuel. The other was for a two- or three-stage rocket using solid fuel. Dr Goddard’s liquid-fuelled rocket, patented July 14, 1914. By 1916, he had developed the mathematical theories of rocket propulsion . Dr Robert Goddard, in Ford Model A truck, tows a rocket to its launch site 15 miles northwest of Roswell, New Mexico . By 1916, he had developed the mathematical theories of rocket propulsion. Toward the end of a 1920 report, Dr Goddard outlined the possibility of a rocket reaching the moon and exploding a load of flash powder there to mark its arrival. The media picked up Goddard’s scientific proposal about a rocket flight to the moon, however, and created a journalistic controversy concerning the feasibility of such a thing. Corey Powell, writing for the Discover blog, notes that The New York Times ridiculed his ideas about rocketry at the time. On the left is Dr Goddard with his complete rocket in 1925. His ideas helped launch the Apollo 11 spacecraft 45 years ago (right) A close-up of a gyroscope on one of Robert Goddard's New Mexico rockets. The gyroscope was used in stabilisation . They said, his claim that a rocket could fly in the vacuum of space would ‘deny a fundamental law of dynamics, and only Dr Einstein and his chosen dozen, so few and fit, are licensed to do that.' However, by 1926, Dr Goddard had constructed and successfully tested the first rocket using liquid fuel based on these patents. For astronomers, the flight of Dr Goddard’s rocket on March 16, 1926, at Auburn, Massachusetts, was as significant to history as that of the Wright brother’s first flight. As Apollo 11 was racing moonward, the New York Times published a correction: 'Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error. As Dr Goddard once said: ‘It is difficult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.’ Dr Robert Hutchings Goddard (1882 – 1945) Explored the practicality of using rocket propulsion to reach high altitudes, even the moon (1912) Proved that a rocket will work in a vacuum, that it needs no air to push against .

It typically attracts more than 200,000 trade and public visitors over the course of seven days, and this year featured more than 1,600 exhibitors. During this year’s event, British engineering firm Parajet was showing off its flying 'car' that is a quick as a Porsche, but can also take to the air. The SkyRunner is billed as 'part buggy, part aircraft' and claims to be the 'ultimate recreational vehicle'. It is powered by a one litre Ford EcoBoost engine that provides 123 brake horsepower and 147lb/ft of torque. This gives the unusual vehicle a 0 to 60mph time of just 4.3 seconds - the same as a mid-range Porsche 911. The vehicle can also take off and fly at 55mph (88km/h) in the air. The SkyRunner goes from buggy to aircraft in around three minutes and can take off on fields, grass strips and secluded beaches. When in the air, it uses paraglide technology, in the form of a large parachute-like wing, to reach a maximum altitude of 15,000ft (4,750 metres), although it is restricted to 10,000ft or 3,000 metres, which is a popular height for a sky dive and can still be above the clouds. Tuesday saw the ‘world premiere’ of what’s been dubbed the most advanced active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, called the Captor-E, installed on Eurofighter Typhoon prototype IPA5. The firm announced at the show the radar is now ready to starting testing.

Executives from Eurofighter and Euroradar explained how matching Captor-E with the Typhoon jet delivers a ‘paradigm shift’, adding that ‘we believe now we are at the forefront of this technology’. The Captor-E AESA radar is unique because it combines a wide-field of view, with a repositioner, tilt Transmit/Receive Modules (TRM) and antenna aperture. This gives jet pilots an advantage because it means they can crank and notch 90 degress while keeping keeping the enemy tracked on radar. BAE Systems used the event to announce cutting-edge technology previously used only by military pilots will soon be available in commercial cockpit.

This means pilots (pictured) can 'fly by touch', which revolutionises how commercial flights will handle plane problems, for example . The firm’s Active Inceptor Systems (or Active Sticks) have been used by fighter jets for decades, and offers pilots tactile cues that allow them to feel feedback from the plane, including the way it is being flown and if they are reaching the limits of the aircraft's capabilities. They also provide linking between the two pilots, to increase awareness across the cockpit, and therefore, safety. Aero Sekur presented its latest flexible fuel tanks (pictured) made from rubber and Kevlar. This makes it half the weight of existing designs . This means pilots can ‘fly by touch’, which revolutionises how commercial flights will handle plane problems, for example. The reduced mechanical complexity of BAE Systems' Active Sticks is also said to reduce maintenance costs, and the potential for mechanical failure. BAE also announced its Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle demonstrator Taranis has successfully completed a second phase of flight testing. During tests, Taranis flew in a fully ‘stealthy’ configuration, making it virtually invisible to radar. In order to achieve this level of stealth, the team changed all antennas on the aircraft to signature control variants, and the air data boom on the nose of Taranis was removed. Following these modifications Taranis used a specially-designed system that allowed the aircraft to generate a full set of flight data, without the use of an external probe or boom. Meanwhile, Italian firm Piaggio used the international air show as the opportunity to show off its P.1HH Hammerhead drone craft. It carried out successful tests in February and is designed to perform intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions at 45,000 ft (13,700 metres) Taranis also used latest stealth communication systems to stay in touch with its mission commander without revealing its position to the enemy. Elsewhere, Aero Sekur presented its latest flexible fuel tanks to trade visitors at the International Air Show. Aero Sekur is already known for is flexible structures, including Mars landing bags, and its latest is a fuel tank that uses two layers of rubber and Kevlar. BAE also announced its Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle demonstrator Taranis has successfully completed a second phase of flight testing. During tests, Taranis (pictured) flew in a fully 'stealthy' configuration, making it virtually invisible to radar . Taranis (graphic pictured) is named after the Celtic god of thunder and designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design.

"By . Wills Robinson . During a typical English summer, there are very few opportunities to lie on the beach and feel the hot sand beneath you. So when families in Torquay, Devon, visited what they thought was a golden stretch of shoreline to relax in the glorious sunshine - they were furious to find Preston Beach covered in seaweed. But instead of heading home, many decided to dig their way through four inches of slippery, stinking sludge on the half-mile stretch of coast, determined to relax on the bright green beach. Green with envy? Sunbathers were forced to clear away a carpet of seaweed on Preston Beach in Torquay, Devon which was four inches deep in some places . Some people did give up though, blaming the council for failing to clear the seaweed which regularly coats the beach. Local resident Carol Greechan, who headed to the popular sunspot on Monday with her two grandchildren, said: 'I’m been going there for 30 years and I’ve never seen it so bad. 'It was crispy on top and slimy underneath. The smell was absolutely revolting but the colour was remarkable. 'It was heart-breaking, we had to dig a little hole to find some sand in a pool of seaweed. We have got beautiful weather but you can’t go on the beach.' Response: Torbay Council, which says the occurrence is a natural phenomenon, cleans the beach on a rota three times a week. However this stretch of coast was not scheduled to be cleared that day . Torbay Council said it cleans its beaches on a rota and it just so happened that Preston hadn’t been scheduled for a clean-up that day. A spokesman said: 'There is a rota for beach cleaning - usually three beaches each day - and Preston is cleared on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Fridays, depending on the suitability of the tides and how busy the beach is. 'This year there has been one complaint from a member of the public about seaweed on beaches. 'It is widely understood that the tide and the sea will generate this natural occurrence, especially in the summer, and that Torbay Council has a reliable and appropriate system in place for its removal with minimal disruption to beach users.' The council have since cleaned up the beach. However, the overcast conditions meant there was only one sunbather - with a tent and a windshield - on the beach. Cleared: The council has now removed the carpet of seaweed that covered Preston Beach.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Archaeologists in Norway have unearthed what they believe to be a skull 8,000 years old that could contain the oldest remnants of a human brain. The discovery was made at a dig site in Stokke, southwest of Oslo. Initial findings suggest the skull belonged to a child no older than ten years old, while an adult was also buried in a fetal-like position in the grave. Archaeologists have found what they think is an 8,000 year old human skull in a dig in Norway. Shown here is the skull embedded in soil, but the team did not dare to scrape all the loose sand from it in fear of destroying the surface of it. It is thought to have belonged to a child of under ten years of age . The investigation took place due to a planned building of a big conference centre called the Oslofjord Convention Center. The skull was found with a gray, clay-like substance inside it and is believed to originate from about 6,000 BC, about 8,000 years ago, in the Mesolithic era. If confirmed as a human brain this would be one of the oldest brains ever found. Finds of the sort are very rare because brain tissue typically breaks down rapidly after death. It can be preserved, however, in certain conditions. Studying the brain could reveal insights into ancient diseases or pathological conditions. The excavation project involves two sites from the same interval of the Mesolithic era, about 6,000 BC, approximately 8,000 years ago. Little is known of this period of the Stone Age in eastern Norway, making the sites of particular interest. Gaute Reitan of the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo, who led the excavation, told MailOnline that normally on sites like this the team finds tools, weapons and production waste - but finding organic material is very rare. ‘We thought it was too good to be true,’ said Reitan. ‘Locally geologically favourable conditions had preserved the bone material. ‘We discovered what turned out to be what we think is a human skull.’ The top of the skull was badly preserved and the inside was partly exposed, showing the grey, spongey and clay-like matter. ‘We are definitely not sure yet, but I cannot imagine this matter being anything else than brain,’ Reitan continued. The investigation took place due to a planned building of a big conference centre called the Oslofjord Convention Center. The excavation project involves two sites from the same interval of the Mesolithic era . The suspected organic matter at the dig site (pictured) is thought to originate from about 6,000 BC. Researchers think the 'brain' belonged to a child no older than ten. An adult in a fetal position and deer antlers were also found in the grave . The team thinks the skull is too small for an adult and is instead probably from an infant of a maximum of ten years of age, which explains the thin and poorly preserved top of the skull. ‘As the skull is badly preserved, we had to be very gentle, using small tools that we seldom use on Stone Age sites,’ Reitan explains. ‘Having spent nearly 8,000 years in the pit, we had to keep it from drying out quickly. Then it would have turned to dust.’ The team took the skull in a ‘big lump’ with the soil surrounding it, and have so far only examined the parts of the skull that are exposed , which is why they are not 100 per cent sure if it is human. They also say the pit was probably a grave, with a number of other bones found inside from another individual, most likely an adult. ‘The arm length is roughly the same as mine, I am 1.79 metres [5 feet and 10 and a half inches] tall, so it was probably a man,’ Reitan said. The adult had been deposited in a fetal position while there were also suspected deer antlers found in the grave. Reitan explains how the material from the grave was saved preliminarily, piece by piece, as partly cleaned bones on sandy soil, to be excavated indoors. Along with the supposed infant's skull were also found bones from an adult man and suspected deer antlers . ‘There has evidently been a lot of effort constructing the grave, but we cannot tell whether the grave has had some sort of marking on top of it, over the ground,’ Reitan said. He added: ‘This is definitely an archaeological sensation.’ The next step will be to get bone experts to examine the find closely to determine the age, sex and more of the individuals. ‘Through DNA and various analysis we are hoping to get information about where the individuals grew up, and kind of food they normally ate and more,’ explains Reitan. 'Not least we get a glimpse into people's minds, literally, meaning how they treated their dead, religious belief systems and so on.'","Archaeological dig near Oslo, Norway may have found an ancient brain .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A woman so inspired by the plight of a young girl dying from cancer shed 11st in order to help other people battling the disease. Encouraged by a tweet from terminally ill Alice Pyne, Karen Mitchell created her own 'bucket list', which included losing weight and . saving lives. Pride Of Britain winner Alice, who had fought Hodgkin's lymphoma from the age . of 12, took to social media to urge people to join the bone marrow . register. Karen Mitchell shed 11st 7lb after promising a dying teenager she would join the bone marrow register . After seeing it - and being deeply moved by the teenager's blog - Ms Mitchell decided she too would sign up to donate her stem cells . and save lives. But at 25st and with a BMI of 60 - well above the healthy limit of 25 - she was rejected. Determined to fulfill her pledge, she even sent Alice a tweet, promising she would lose . weight to join the register. Alice replied, urging her not to . give up  - and Ms Mitchell has since lost 11st 7lb. She said: 'I thought Alice was incredibly brave and inspiring and when I read her tweet encouraging people to join the bone marrow register, I knew straight away that I wanted to do something for . her. 'Being rejected was a turning point because here . was this amazing young woman who was terminally ill yet doing all she . could to help others – and I was just wasting my life being fat. 'I couldn't even walk up the stairs at work without becoming out of . breath. I felt useless. Now my weight was stopping me doing one thing . for Alice.' Next week she will make a life-saving donation in memory of Alice, who died in January 2013. 'Alice told me not to give up and I . didn't want to let her down,' said Ms Mitchell. 'Her amazing legacy can go on . saving lives and I hope everyone reading this will donate as well – not . for me, but for Alice.' Ms Mitchell's weight loss was inspired by the Alice Pyne, who was dying from cancer and urging people to join the bone marrow register. But at 25st, she was too fat - so tweeted Alice promising to lose weight . Ms Mitchell, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, had battled with her weight for as long as she could remember - spending her teenage years wearing size 18 clothes. 'I longed to wear trendy clothes like the other girls at my school but I could only shop in the 'fat' section of shops,' she said. By the time she married at 27, she walked down the aisle in a size 28 wedding dress - but says she knew the five-year marriage was doomed. 'In my heart I knew I wasn't right for him and he wasn't right for me. But I was a big girl and I told myself it would probably be my only chance to get married and settle down. I hoped we could make it work.' She went on to find love again - but blissfully happy with new partner Dan Hague, she piled on even more weight. After four years together, by 2012 her weight had peaked at 25st and Dan's had rocketed up from 14st to 19st 8lb. 'We were just so happy together,' she says. 'We enjoyed going for drinks and meals and cooking together, but it was always really high-calorie, bad foods.' Ms Mitchell had battled with her weight all her life - and by the time she promised to join the register she was 25st with a BMI of 60 . After meeting partner Dan Hague, she piled on more weight due to the couple's love of fatty food and drinks . ogether they weighed a whopping 44st 8lb and attracted cruel insults wherever they went. But Ms Mitchell, who works in a fizzy drinks factory, was still shocked when she tried to join the bone marrow register after reading about Alice and was turned down. To join the register, donors needed a BMI below 30, but hers was 60. So she sent Alice a tweet that read: 'I promise to lose weight so I can join the register'. And to her total surprise, Alice tweeted back, saying 'please do it'. Spurred on, Ms Mitchell said: 'I told myself that this time I would lose the weight. But it felt like such an impossibly huge mountain to climb. 'I wanted to lose 11st, so that meant more than half my body weight had to go. I wondered how on earth I could ever manage to do it.' The couple embarked on a weight loss challenge and between them, have lost 17st . She joined a local Slimming World group and swapped takeaways for vegetable stir-fries, salads and fresh fruit for chocolate bars and crisps. And as the weight slowly started to fall off, she continued to follow Alice on Twitter as she ticked off all the wishes on her bucket list, which included meeting Take That and whale watching. 'I followed her doing all the incredible things she had on her list and, like all her thousands of followers, I just thought her courage and bravery were amazing.' To keep on track, she decided that she too would write a list containing all the reasons she wanted to lose weight. Dubbed the 'Belly Bucket List', objectives included being able to climb the stairs at work, wear high heels, see her nieces grow up, fly in a plane without a seat belt extender and fit into a chair. She also started her own blog to keep her motivated and began to upload the photographs of every healthy meal she ate. By January 2013, when Alice tragically died, aged just 17, Ms Mitchell had lost 5st. 'I was devastated to hear the news - but all I could do was vow to carry on dieting until I could join that register as I had promised.' To speed up her weight loss, she began also took up running - and before long, partner Dan also joined the weight loss challenge. 'There was some healthy competition between us, which definitely helped,' said Ms Mitchell. 'We had a scoreboard in the kitchen and . whoever lost the least weight that week had to cook for the other. By last summer, she was able to cross off number 14 on the Bucket Belly List - sitting in a deckchair. She said: 'It might sound a bit daft, but just to be able to sit down without . worrying if I would fit into the chair or not felt really fantastic. 'I'd never been able to just sit down in a chair before because usually I wouldn't fit, especially if it had arms.' Another milestone moment came when she was able to buy tights that were labelled 'one size only'. Now, 18 months after Alice died,she has lost 11st 7lbs and weighs 13st 7lbs. Her BMI is now 31. Mr Hague has gone from 19st 8lb to 13st 8lb – a loss of 6st, . While Ms Mitchell is too old to be a bone marrow donor for the Anthony Nolan charity -the limit is 30 - next week she and Mr Hague will be donating their bone marrow stem cells via the National Blood Service. 'One thing Alice used to say that has stuck with me is, "" You only have one life, so live it"", and, thanks to her brave example, that is exactly what I am doing,' she said. 'Her courage and optimism not only inspired me, it transformed me and I hope to encourage people to sign the register like me just as Alice wished.'

"By . Annabel Grossman . A Government minister has backed a campaign to save horses from pain by allowing top-level riders to compete using bridles without the traditional metal bit. Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat minister for care services, wants a change to the rules for dressage competitions. At present, the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) demands that Olympic dressage riders use bitted bridles that go between the horses’ teeth. The horse on the left has a bit while the one on the right is bitless . The same rule is enforced at a national level in the UK and in most regional events. But many riders prefer to use bitless bridles, arguing that the bit can cause severe nerve pain, tongue lacerations, pinching and breathing problems for horses. In a letter to the national governing bodies, including the British Equestrian Federation, Mr Lamb lends his support to a campaign against bits by the Norfolk Horse Training and Equitation Club (NHTEC). The Norfolk North MP writes: ‘A constituent showed me photographs where it appeared to me the horses [with bitted bridles] were clearly in pain. The request is for people to have the choice. I cannot really see the argument against.’ The traditional bit has been used by riders since ancient times. But an internet debate about the safety of bitless bridles was sparked in March when Prince Edward’s ten-year-old daughter Lady Louise Windsor was pictured riding a pony using one. Campaigners argued that if a young Royal could ride a horse without a bit, it must be safe. NHTEC secretary Johanna Macarthur said: ‘In some ways, we haven’t moved on since Bronze Age people were riding horses with these devices wedged in their mouths. 'Metal bits can be very painful for many horses, particularly those put under pressure to perform in competitive events. It’s high time riders were allowed to choose more horse-friendly bridles.’ British Dressage issued a statement supporting the FEI rules. It said: ‘A fundamental requirement in the education of the horse is the concept of submission and this includes the willing acceptance of the indications of the rider. This also means the acceptance by the horse of the bit in its mouth, just as much as the acceptance of the rider’s weight on its back.’ British Olympic dressage gold medallist Carl Hester wrote on Facebook in December: ‘I wouldn’t mind in the slightest if I competed against a bitless competitor. It’s a personal choice.’","Norman Lamb, MP wants a change to the rules for dressage competitions .

But the Kosovan-born singer might want to be a little more careful with her outfits after a pair of trainers landed her in the centre of a £100,000 legal battle. As the face of the spring/summer 2013 campaign for sportswear brand Superga – a label owned by Scottish firm GL Dameck – Ora agreed not to be seen wearing any trainers other than the company’s footwear. Kosovan-born singer Rita Ora might want to be a little more careful with her outfits after a pair of trainers landed her in the centre of a £100,000 legal battle . But in April 2013 the singer was spotted in a pair of grubby white Converse trainers as she left Mayfair haunt Mahiki with her celebrity friends Cara Delevingne and Ellie Goulding. GL Dameck claimed this was a breach of Miss Ora’s contract and cited the Converse incident as a reason for withholding the third and fourth instalments of the singer’s £180,000 fee. Court documents show that on May 1, 2013, Jason Fairclough of GL Dameck emailed Miss Ora’s representative, saying: ‘Anyway, how do we square this? I guess we could go heavy on public events. 'Get Rita to wear the product as much as possible over the summer? Ask Rita to tweet pics of her in the product, name-checking the brand? ‘This should be happening regardless but we could crank it up.’ Then on June 17, he emailed another one of Ora’s representatives, writing: ‘We need to get Rita seen out and about in the shoes.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . One of Snapchat’s biggest issues to date has been how to make money. The firm famously turned down a $3 billion (£1.75 billion) from Facebook last year, and the reason for doing so may now have been uncovered as trademarks reveal the company is developing a payment system. The move suggests Snapchat may be considering allowing people to transfer money to others within the app in a move to take on services such as Paypal. Los Angeles-based Snapchat (headquarters pictured) is apparently planning to introduce payments. That's according to two trademarks spotted being filed by the company. Exactly what they are planning to do however is not yet known . The two trademarks were uncovered by Tech Crunch. Trademark Serial # 86335306 . 'Computer application software for processing electronic payments to and from others that may be downloaded from a global computer network.' Trademark Serial # 86335307 . 'Electronic transfer of money for others; providing electronic processing of electronic funds transfer, ACH, credit card, debit card, electronic check and electronic, mobile and online payment.' One refers to software that can send and receive payments from a ‘global computer network.’ The other concerns the processing of electronic funds. The trademarks were filed on 11 July by Snapchat’s law firm, Cooley. Snapchat has so far refused to comment on the move. Some had previously thought that the company would introduce advertising and in-app purchases in order to monetise the app. This new move, however, suggests they may instead enable people to make payments through Snapchat, perhaps to other users or companies. By taking a small amount of commission from each transaction, the company would then be able to make money from the numerous transactions. The move could indicate they will allow users to send money to each other. The company has been trying to find ways to monetise their app. By taking a small amount of commission from each transaction, like PayPal does (stock image shown) the company would then be able to make money from transactions .

The new smart filters don’t offer any photo-editing effects, and are clear filters with a graphic overlay. They look similar to they type of stickers that have been popularized by stand-alone photo editing applications. ‘Swipe right on the preview screen to check them out – they’ll change depending on which neighborhoods you’re in!’ the company wrote in a blog post and video announcing the new feature.

"By . Annabel Grossman . A valet driver was clocked going 98mph in a Mercedes SLK minutes after it was dropped off at an airport, and another car hit 88mph in a 50mph zone, according to a damning Which? report into parking services. The watchdog fitted GPS and speed monitors to luxury cars before leaving them at airports. Meteor Meet and Greet at Stansted, Essex, has suspended one of its drivers as a result of the SLK probe. And iPark Airport Parking at Heathrow, where a Porsche Boxster was driven at 88mph on an A-road, said: 'Any negligence in following the company rules will lead to serious consequences.' With a professional chauffeur collecting your car direct from the terminal, meet-and-greet services seem to offer the perfect solution to the nightmare of airport parking. But if car owners knew their pride and joy was then going to be driven at speeds of up to 100mph or dumped in the corner of an industrial estate rather than a secure compound, would they be quite so willing to hand over their keys? The investigation by consumer watchdog Which? has found that not all meet-and-greet services live up to the promise of 24-hour security and professional drivers when entrusted with a £40,000 car. Of the three top-end cars Which? handed to private meet-and-greet services, one sped off from the terminal at nearly twice the 50mph speed limit, a second clocked 88mph and the third was left on an industrial estate. Nearly one in five of the consumers Which? interviewed who had used meet-and-greet said they had encountered problems, mostly involving cars returned late. In response to the concerns, Which? fitted GPS trackers and speed monitors to three luxury cars before leaving them in the care of separate private companies at UK airports for six days. The investigation came about after nearly one in five consumers industry watchdog Which? spoke to said they had encountered problems with meet-and-greet services . Meteor Meet and Greet at Stansted Airport, pictured, suspended one of its drivers after the investigation . Meteor Meet and Greet at Stansted Airport, Essex, claims to have ‘built our reputation on giving travellers peace of mind, confident that they’ve handed over their keys beside the terminal to our trained uniformed drivers’. But within minutes of being handed the keys to a swish Mercedes SLK, the Meteor chauffeur made the most of his brief drive in the car by accelerating up to 98mph on Terminal Road South - where the speed limit is 50mph. After Essex police were informed of the findings, Meteor suspended one of its drivers as a result of the investigation. It said: ‘The security of our customers’ vehicles is our main priority, and our drivers must abide by strict codes of conduct. We take any allegations of misconduct very seriously.’ A driver from iPark Airport Parking at Heathrow was clocked doing 88mph in the A30 - the company said it had requested further details from Which? magazine about the claim and were awaiting the response . iPark Airport Parking at Heathrow was entrusted with a pricey Porsche Boxster, which the trackers show stayed on site for the full six days and was returned undamaged. But the chauffer who returned the car to Terminal 5 was clocked driving at 88mph on the A30, where the speed limit was also 50mph. iPark said: ‘We recruit the drivers having the clean UK driving license without any convictions. Also, during the training we also mention that they need to drive the customer’s vehicle responsibly and within the legal limits. ‘Any negligence in following the company rules will lead to serious consequences. ‘We are still corresponding with Which? magazine for further details of the claim and awaiting the response.’ At Gatwick, RS09 promises a ‘safe and secure storage area’, where ‘you can be sure that your pride and joy is in safe hands’. But Which? noted that the scruffy area where its £37,000 Mercedes E250 was parked had been left unlocked and the security barrier raised. The vehicle was left on an industrial estate with what appeared to be a pile of car parts, a caravan and some tyres. RS09 offered to remove the promotional car park image from its website – as Which? felt it was misleading – but insisted barriers were only open during business hours and the yard was equipped with floodlights and CCTV. It added: ‘We believe the service was as advertised and your car was parked safely and securely.’ Matt Stevens, senior researcher at Which? Travel said: ‘Meet-and-greet companies need to be honest about where our cars are parked and they need to drive them responsibly. Drivers should not think they can break the law by speeding, and descriptions of car parks need to match the reality.’","Undercover probe found of the three top end cars entrusted to private meet-and-greet services, two sped off while third was left in industrial estate .

And the owners of a nearby stables have also hit out at the ‘unnecessary’ deaths. Police were called to Leavesden Country Park in Hertfordshire following reports of loose horses. Upsetting scene: Police were called to Leavesden Country Park in Hertfordshire following reports of loose horses, and both were shot dead . A local farmer said: ‘I saw it all. The police and council didn’t know what they were doing. ‘They spent two hours chasing the horses about which just made them more agitated. ‘Had they just left them to calm down they would have been fine eventually. ‘Instead they brought this man in who was following the horses around on a quad bike. He shot both animals in the head. It was wicked. He killed one on the football pitch and the other in the old cemetery.’ Mother-of-three Sally Weston, 44, who lives nearby, said she saw the horses while walking her two dogs. ‘I’m so shocked that the council ended up shooting them – there was absolutely  no need,’ she added.

Incredibly, it may have worked, with viewer ratings shooting up by 70,000 on Thursday - a 15.3 per cent share of the audience - and remained steady on Friday. However, it still trailed behind BBC Breakfast, which holds more than 36 per cent of the audience with 1.5million viewers. Brighter: On Thursday, Ms Reid debuted the more laid back look, presenting in a pink dress on the riverside. Executives now monitor Ms Reid's skirt length to an nth degree and tell her to nod like Holly Willoughby . Success? Figures suggest the new look has worked after 70,000 more viewers tuned in on Thursday . An ITV source told the Sunday People: 'Susanna has been told to nod more, look more sympathetic and engage. 'Even her dresses are analysed to the nth degree.' Head of daytime Helen Warner, who is said to be spearheading the changes, has also suggested lightening Ms Reid's hair as most of ITV's top presenters - Holly Willoughby, Anthea Turner, Fiona Phillips - are blonde. And steps are being taken to soften the interviewer's attitude. 'A lot of people think she's too harsh and intense,' the source told the paper, adding: 'Holly Willoughby is held up as the perfect nodder during interviews and she's as opposite to Susanna as you can get.' Last chance: ITV bosses are hoping a 'less intense' Susanna can salvage the new production, which has fewer viewers than the flop breakfast show Daybreak - which it was brought in to replace in April . Ms Reid was lured over to Good Morning Britain from BBC Breakfast with £500,000 after winning the nation's hearts on Strictly Come Dancing. During its launch week, the ITV show had an average of about 690,000 viewers, while BBC Breakfast maintained a steady 1.5million. But within one month, the figure had plummeted by more than 400,000. A senior source at ITV admitted that the programme would be unable to continue unless viewers returned.","Good Morning Britain has struggled to meet 15% audience share minimum .

"By . Annabel Grossman . You know a relationship is getting pretty serious when a woman asks the man in her life for advice on a subject as sensitive as lingerie. Pippa Middleton and stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson certainly looked like a couple in love when she playfully pulled him into high-end boutique Petits Bisous during a shopping spree in Chelsea. The 30-year-old sister of the Duchess of Cambridge spent some time browsing the store with Nico, 36. Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico popped into an exclusive lingerie shop while strolling through Chelsea . He seemed taken with a turquoise ‘body’ with matching silk night robe in the shop window, which he smilingly pointed out to Pippa as they left the store. The Bisou Bisou body from Mimi Holliday would set banker Nico back £96, while he would need a further £116 for the matching Beautiful Bottoms georgette Night Robe. The couple, who have been together for about 18 months, kissed and cuddled outside the store before heading hand-in-hand down the King’s Road. A relaxed Pippa was dressed casually in black ankle boots, dark Stefanel coat and a polka-dot top - also by Stefanel, and she was carrying a cappuccino-colour Milli Millu Vienna bag. Rumours are rife that the Duchess of Cambridge's sister, left, could be close to marrying her boyfriend . Nico, 36, seemed to be pointing out this turquoise 'body' as the couple left the store . Petits Bisous – French for ‘little kisses’ – claims to provide a personal and private service specialising in ‘made-to-measure lingerie, corsetry and swimwear to fulfil your every desire’. It also offers wedding day lingerie and nightwear. Last month the couple holidayed with Nico’s grandparents at luxury ski resort Lech in the Austrian Alps, as suspicions grew that an engagement may not be too far off. Pippa revealed during her first public speech earlier this year how the figure-hugging gown she wore to her sister’s wedding in 2011 – after which she was nicknamed Her Royal Hotness – transformed her life. ‘As I have found out, recognition has its upside, its downside and – you may say – its backside,’ she joked at a dinner at London’s Savoy Hotel.","Pippa Middleton popped into the shop with her boyfriend Nico Jackson .

However, although her father performs in Hollywood films and mingles with the likes of Johnny Depp, his daughter is begging in Britain.

Her parents had a seven-year affair before they married but the relationship was short-lived. While her father then went off to play in the 2000 movie The Man Who Cried - and then perform privately for stars including Tom Cruise - Ramona claims she was left with nothing.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Rolf Harris's daughter Bindi emerged from court with an apparent smile today moments after fighting back tears when her father was sentenced to five years and nine months in jail. Bindi Nicholls, 50, has stood by her father throughout his eight-week court case, giving evidence in his defence and holding his hand. Today, she could not hide her emotion as the judge ordered him to a minimum of three years behind bars. Leaving court: Bindi Nicholls emerged with an apparent smile moments after weeping as her father was jailed . Rock: She supported her father throughout the eight-week trial, giving evidence and holding his hand . The trial heard Harris 'took advantage' of young girls between 1968 and 1986, including Bindi's best friend. He ‘got a thrill’ from abusing children, the judge said, and clearly ‘fancied’ his daughter’s best friend when she was 13 and he was 48. The jury also heard extensive details about Harris's turbulent relationship with Bindi, as the prosecution accused her of supporting him so she could hang on to her inheritance. Leaving court this afternoon, she appeared to have recovered from her tears, casting a smile at the crowds as she battled through photographers. Privacy: The intimate details of their turbulent relationship were laid bare in the trial as she defended her father . Emotional: Bindi had been seen to wipe away tears in Southwark Crown Court after her father was jailed for a string of sexual assaults, including abuses of her best friend on holiday when she was 13 . The trial laid bare the strained . relationship between the star and his only child after rows over his . child abuse, infidelity and whether she would inherit his £11million . fortune. Southwark Crown Court in London heard how Bindi Nicholls considered suicide when the star admitted he had an affair with her best friend. She then smashed her father's art, 'banged her head against the wall' when she was told her 'b******' father abused the same girl from the age of 13. The prosecution also accused Mrs Nicholls of 'colluding' with her father because she was 'financially' dependent on him, producing an email where she described her possible inheritance as like 'winning the lottery'. Dispute: Mrs Nicholls, 50, was accused of supporting her father in a push for inheritance. She said the letter referred to was taken out of context and continued to stand by him until he was taken to his cell (pictured) Escorting: She accompanied him in a boat down the River Thames from his house in Bray, Berkshire, to court . Support: Harris was flanked by his wife Alwen and daughter Bindi when the jury found him guilty of all counts . Family: The trial heard Harris cheated on his wife Alwen (left) and had explosive rows with his daughter Bindi . But she said the message, which was released by the judge after being shown to jurors, was being taken out of context - and denied 'helping' her 84-year-old father for any other reason than to tell the truth. Mrs Nicholls routinely escorted her father in and out of court hand-in-hand. Today she took him in a boat from his house in Bray, Berkshire, up the River Thames to hear his sentence, while her mother Alwen stayed at home.","Bindi Nicholls, 50, emotional as her father Rolf Harris was jailed today .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Rolf Harris' victims gave agonising accounts of their abuse at the hands of the entertainer which left them unable to move on before he was jailed for five years and nine months. As part of the sentencing process of the star, Southwark Crown Court heard Victim Impact Statements from the four women that Harris has been convicted of indecently assaulting. The 84-year-old listened solemn-faced as he approached the moment when he would be jailed for his crimes. He was given a small reprieve when prosecutor Sasha Wass QC confirmed that Harris will not stand trial over 33 sexual images of children found on his computer when his home was searched. Scroll down for video . 'Haunted': Bindi's friend said Harris' actions crushed her dreams of having a career and a family . Harrowing: Harris left the best friend of his daughter Bindi feeling 'dirty, grubby and disgusting' after his abuse . In a statement read by junior prosecutor Esther Schutzer-Weissman, the former friend of his daughter Bindi said: 'The attacks that happened have made me feel dirty, grubby and disgusting. 'The whole sordid saga has traumatised me.' She said the effects of Harris's abuse had been with her for many years, and had been the cause of a drinking habit she developed at an early age. 'As a young girl I had aspirations to have a career, settle down and have a family,' she said. 'However, as a direct result of his actions, this has never materialised. 'The knowledge of what he had done to me haunted me. However, his popularity with the British public made it harder for me to deal with.' The statement went on: 'Rolf Harris had a hold over me that made me a quivering wreck', adding: 'He made me feel like a sexual object, he used and abused me to such a degree that it made me feel worthless.' The woman said she had been convinced nobody would believe her, but her family had when she finally told them. She said she had been 'dry' since 2000 but still suffered panic attacks and severe anxiety and was unable to communicate and socialise with people outside a small circle, making her world 'very small'. She said: 'Rolf Harris, knowing what he had done to me, put me through the ordeal of appearing in court,' saying she felt he had tried to humiliate her by getting her to talk about the abuse in a public arena. Sentence: Harris sat solemn-faced in the dock with a suitcase awaiting sentence for 12 counts of abuse . 'Suffered in silence': One victim told  how she struggled to cope with the abuse as Harris 'got away with it' 'I believe he thought he could make me crumble which I used to, but I am better than I was.' She said she had suffered abuse at the hands of someone who thought he could get away with it, but said she had 'suffered in silence' for years, causing a detrimental effect to her life. Another victim, who was assaulted by Harris when she visited England as a teenager, said the incident was a 'turning point' in her life that she had never recovered from. She said: 'I have never felt safe since, I life in a constant state of anxiety.' Her statement added: 'What Mr Harris took from me was my very essence, I believe that it was for Mr Harris a forgettable moment but it was something for me I will never move on from. 'I know the person I am today is not the person I should have been.' Impact: One victim's statement explained how Harris 'had a hold over me' and drove her to alcoholism . She said she became an angry and confused child, unable to express herself and unable to trust men. 'When Jimmy Savile was exposed I had the courage to tell people I felt I would be believed. 'I felt so much guilt that I had not said anything earlier, this was made worse when I read that Rolf Harris had abused others, I again blamed myself for not having the courage to say something sooner. 'I carried what Rolf Harris did to me for most of my life, it took away my childhood.' A fourth victim who was assaulted at a celebrity event in Cambridge when she was a teenager, said Harris took advantage of her, making her feel ashamed. She said the star 'treated me like a toy' that he could play with for his own pleasure.","Statements from four of Harris' victims read to court before sentencing .

"'Digital surgery' also used to replace wrinkles on stars who have . Botox . By . Laura Cox . First it was the airbrushed models, doctored to appear impossibly thin. Now Hollywood moguls have been criticised for stretching actresses to make them longer and leaner. Last night, body image campaigners said it was another example of young girls being encouraged to seek perfection that doesn’t exist. Hollywood film makers are apparently using a post production technique to stretch actresses, making them taller and slimmer. The new enhancement fad has been revealed after singer Britney Spears appeared in a documentary about her Las Vegas show, looking remarkably taller and slimmer . ‘Digital surgery’ as it has been . labelled, is already used to add lines on the faces of stars who have . had Botox, with Martin Scorsese complaining that the injections leave . them unable to show emotion. It . is thought Wolf of Wall Street star Margot Robbie may be among those . doctored, after fans noticed the 5ft 6in actress looked unusually leggy . in the film. Miss Robbie recently criticised the Hollywood pressure for . women to be ‘gorgeous and thin’. The . practice first came to light in a Britney Spears documentary, when the . 5ft 4in singer gained three inches to meet the ‘showgirl minimum’ for . her Las Vegas concerts. She also appeared thinner in the documentary . than in a promotional clip for it. How Kim Kardashian may look if she was subject to the digital surgery. Post production sources at a studio which uses the technique, compared it to a 'fun house mirror' How Mariah Carey might appear of she was digitally stretched to make her appear taller. The technique is being branded 'digital surgery' and is also being employed to replace lines and wrinkles on the faces of stars who have had Botox . Pippa . Smith, of pressure group Safermedia, said: ‘These films are role models . to young girls and as such should have a responsibility towards society . rather than cynical commercialism – in fact I can see no reason why it . is necessary to change women’s natural beauty in such ways. It’s hideous . and wrong.’ Mrs Smith . said it could lead to women going for painful surgery to make their legs . longer. ‘I actually knew a young Chinese woman, highly educated, who . had her legs lengthened – a very extreme thing to do,’ she said. Kate Hardcastle from the Positive Image campaign accused film producers of promoting unhealthy ideas about beauty. Film . producer Gavin Polone said it was typical of female film executives to . have actresses digitally altered but he had never heard of a male . executive doing so. He told the Sunday Times: ‘On many occasions I’ve . heard female producers ask to have an actress digitally stretched. ‘I am not going to say which actresses are stretched – and it’s always about women, which is unfair – but it is very common.’ Australian bloggers suggested actress Margot Robbie appeared 'impossibly long-legged' in one of the main scenes in The Wolf of Wall Street .","Cinematic equivalent of Photoshop used to digitally extend the women .

"By . Laura Cox . Empowered women may be a theme of her songs – but when you’re Beyoncé Knowles, it seems empowerment involves striking suggestive poses and gyrating around the stage in a sheer leotard. Within minutes of the singer appearing at the Grammy Awards, her routine with husband Jay-Z was denounced as ‘vile porn’ by horrified parents. Opening the show for a global audience of millions, Beyoncé performed a series of provocative dance moves, including writhing against her husband – who was fully clothed – as they sang X-rated lyrics. Provocative: Beyonce on stage at the Grammy Awards wearing a sheer leotard and tights . At one point, the mother-of-one straddled a chair and was seen running her hands up and down her thighs in a suggestive manner before leaning back to drape herself seductively over her seat. Many of her other poses were too risque to be shown in a family newspaper. Viewers condemned the sexually charged display as a step too far for the annual music ceremony, usually regarded as family entertainment. One noted that it is ‘sad when our children can’t even watch the Grammys’, a sentiment that was echoed by hundreds of others who took to the internet to express their disgust at the performance of Drunk In Love which opened the ceremony in Los Angeles. Yesterday campaigners also accused Beyoncé, who has a two-year-old daughter called Blue Ivy, of being a ‘dangerous role model’ and a ‘disgrace’ to thousands of young girls who would have been watching. Margaret Morrissey, of Parents Outloud, said: ‘It is time Beyoncé realised she is offending every decent person in this country who I hope in future once they hear her name will switch off their TV.’ The mother-of-one drapes herself on a chair during the show-opening performance . The singer continues to writhe around on stage in a series of sexual moves . Pippa Smith, of SaferMedia, added: ‘There is something rotten at the heart of this so-called “music” industry when young women celebrities and now a husband and wife start to behave in such an obscenely sexual manner at events popular with all ages. They are doing enormous harm to children’s perception of what is normal behaviour.’ The Grammy Awards, which is in its 56th year, was broadcast on Sunday evening on US channel CBS and repeated in the UK last night on Freeview channel 4music. And while it was aired here at 9pm – just after the watershed – many children will already have seen video clips and images on the internet of Beyoncé, 34, and Jay-Z grinding against each other. The singer and her husband Jay-Z in an intimate embrace on stage . For the rest of the evening, the singer wore a white and nude cut-out design dress . Campaigners and parents expressed . dismay that the singer – who champions female independence – was . semi-naked, while her 44-year-old husband remained fully dressed. Vivienne Pattison, of Mediawatch-UK, said: ‘In this footage Beyoncé is wearing a really skimpy outfit but Jay-Z is not. ‘If girls and women are seen exclusively as sexual beings rather than as complicated people with many interests, talents and identities, boys and men may have difficulty relating to them on any level other than the sexual.’ The latest furore comes just weeks after fans turned against the former Destiny’s Child singer over the X-rated lyrics and ‘pornographic’ videos that feature in her self-titled album, released last month. In the videos, she is seen scantily dressed and adopting provocative poses as she repeatedly refers to sex and alcohol.","Singer performed provocative routine at Grammy Awards last night .

"By . Laura Cox . Bending down for those household chores was causing her elderly mother some pain. But rather than employing a carer, Kathryn Hoffman found another way to help 94-year-old Elsie Talbot - of the four-legged variety, that is. And Mrs Hoffman, 66, has trained her dog Fergus to lend a hand - or, rather, paw - whenever her aging mother comes to stay at her house. Kathryn Hoffman and her Labradoodle, Fergus who are both appearing in Superstar Dogs on Channel 4 . It means Mrs Talbot, whose 95th birthday is not far off, needn't stoop to pull a load out of the washing machine. Nor should she fret if she forgets where she left her keys is - a simple call to Fergus will see the missing item come running. And in those moments when the television remote control is just out of reach, the gentle-natured dog is there to help and stop her stretching to the point of pain. Of course, it was never planned this way. And Mrs Hoffman and her husband Bob first got the four-year-old Labradoodle as company for their lonely German Shepherd after another dog died. But when the inquisitive pup kept on sticking his head in the washing machine, and slobbering over household appliances, it dawned on Mrs Hoffman that she could put him to good use. Fergus the Labradoodle has been trained to take washing out of the machine for his owners . 'My mum is elderly and I thought actually he could, say she was staying here and I'd gone to work he could do things for her,' the retired probation service worker explained. 'She's almost 95 so some things are a bit difficult so I thought it would be a real help if he could do things like empty the washing machine.' So she set to work, and with some gentle coaxing - in the form of chicken-flavoured nugget treats – she taught him to pull socks and pants from the bowl and drop them into a laundry basket. Inspired, no doubt, and sensing an opportunity for more, Mrs Hoffman tried it out with some keys, this time coating them in cat mint - a special scent that is familiar to hounds. Low and behold, Fergus was soon able to delve into her handbag and find them, at the simple command of 'keys'. Fergus means that Kathryn hasn't had to get a carer for her mother Elsie . And his skills transferred to remote controls, newspapers and slippers, which Fergus will place - slightly slobbered - into an outstretched hand. Mrs Hoffman said: 'She could say ""I've dropped my paper, Fergus, bring it"", and he'd bring it to her. Or if she needed the remote passing or couldn't find her slippers or keys, she could ask Fergus for them.' Of course, whetting Fergus' appetite for household objects has had its ups and downs. And curiosity got the better of him one day last year when he happened upon a mobile phone in Mrs Hoffman's bag, while she was getting ready to visit her daughter. 'He went into the handbag, took my mobile out, and when I came back in it was open, the whole thing,' she said. 'So I snapped it shut, put it in my bag and drove off.' John Barrowman is presenting Superstar Dogs on Channel 4 . At the time she didn't think anything of it, and it wasn't until the phone failed to function the following day that Mrs Hoffman discovered the battery was missing. When she returned home to search for the lost piece, however, it appeared to have vanished. But a trip to the vets soon solved the mystery - Fergus had swallowed the battery. 'Thankfully, before I'd even realised that he'd swallowed it, it had passed through him,' Mrs Hoffman said. 'Otherwise it would have been an extremely big operation.' Since then, however, Fergus has learned his lesson. And his seemingly endless appetite – which has seen him reach 35kg - is now reserved for the treats he gets for the successful completion of a trick. And in recent weeks he has scoffed even more than usual, learning new skills as part of Superstar Dogs - a TV show seeking to find the country's most able hound. The show, which started last week on Channel 4, is sponsored by Be Lungworm Aware and hosted by former Torchwood actor John Barrowman. The series will see dog pairs compete in events such as swimming, jumping and agility. The successful dogs will go through to the semi-final and final next week to compete for £1,000 in reward money.","Kathryn Hoffman has trained Fergus the dog to help her mother .

"By . Sam Creighton . The case of Muhammed Ejaz, the Pakistani paramedic who murdered three gay men he met online - has sent shockwaves through the country's already persecuted gay community. Ejaz, a 28-year-old father-of-two, was arrested last week and confessed to three brutal murders, saying he wanted to send a message about the 'evils' of homosexuality, though police insist he had sex with his victims first. The killings have sent shockwaves through the underground gay community in the eastern city of Lahore, which fears Ejaz could be lionised as a hero in a conservative Islamic society where homosexuality is stigmatised and sodomy is punishable by up to 10 years in jail. Some members of the gay community are worried he could be held up as a hero in a society where homosexuals are persecuted and sodomy carries a 10-year prison sentence . The 28-year-old paramedic admitted to the brutal murders after being arrested by police last week . In an interview with AFP from his prison cell Sunday night, Ejaz expressed remorse over the killings but said he was acting to stop wrongdoing. 'My way was wrong. It is tragic that the families have lost their relatives but they were spreading evil in society and I had to stop it,' said Ejaz, who is due to appear in court on Monday. 'I wanted to warn them to stay away from this evil.' It is claimed that Ejaz was an sexually active gay man even though he said he killed his victims to stop them 'spreading the evils of homosexuality' Ejaz broke the necks of his victims. He expresses regret but continues to claim he did it to prevent wrongdoing . The killings happened in March and April, according to police officer Asad Sarfraz, who headed the investigation. The victims were a middle-aged retired army Major and two other men, both in their twenties. All three were found with their necks broken and had been sedated. After examining their mobile phone call logs, police were able to identify Ejaz's number and found another former lover whom they used to lure him to a meeting a week ago, where they arrested him. Ejaz, who married in 2011 and has two infant children, said his family knew nothing of what he had done and insisted that he was not gay himself. 'I started going on Manjam two months ago using my mobile phone, and found that the gays are everywhere in Lahore,' he said, referring to a popular social networking website. 'They are spreading evil and transmitting diseases. They cannot control themselves,' he added. Ejaz said he was the victim of sexual abuse by an older boy when he was around 10 and had led a deeply unhappy childhood. 'I have hated them ever since for what happened to me,' he said. A court in Lahore remanded Ejaz in custody at a hearing last Monday. Ejaz has been remanded into custody and is expected to appear in court on Monday . Ejaz claims he was sexually abused when he was a child and that this fuels his homophobia . The case has shone an unwelcome spotlight on Pakistan's closeted gay community, who are often afraid to come out to their families. In the absence of gay venues they rely on the Internet and mobile apps to arrange clandestine dates. Manjam, the gay social networking and dating site which Ejaz is said to have used to meet his victims, has closed to new members in Pakistan. 'To increase your privacy and security, we have decided to close Manjam to non-members in Pakistan until further notice,' it said in a statement. One member of Pakistan's gay community said he was worried Ejaz could be hailed as a hero by some conservative Muslims. 'The problem is that paedophilia and homosexuality are often conflated, so people think eradicating homosexuality means eradicating child abuse,' he said. Ejaz had been a sexually active member of the gay community for several months, the man claimed. 'It seems he was motivated by self-hatred and internalised homophobia,' he said. 'The worry is - will it inspire others to do the same?'","Muhammed Ejaz, 28, confessed to killing the three men he met online .

"By . Steve Hopkins . A Californian man said to be desperately in love with his former army veteran roomate has been convicted over her death. Kwang Choi 'KC' Joy, 55, was yesterday found guilty of second-degree murder of California State Fullerton student, Maribel Ramos. The 36-year-old's body was found badly decomposed near Modjeska Canyon in the Santa Ana Mountains last year, two weeks after her family had reported her missing. Kwang Choi Joy, left, has been convicted of second-degree murder over the death of his former army veteran roommate Maribel Ramos, right . Ms Ramos had served in Iraq before she returned to Santa Ana to study at California State Fullerton . Exactly how Ms Ramos, who served in Iraq before returning to Santa Ana to go to college, died remains a mystery. Prosecutors said Joy, who had surgery to make his eyes look younger, bought Ms Ramos a ticket for a cruise, but panicked after she told him to move out of their apartment when he couldn't pay the rent. Orange County Deputy District Attorney Scott Simmons told the jury last week: 'Maribel was his life, and the opportunity for him to be with the love of his life was coming to an end,' NBC Los Angeles reported. Ms Ramos body was found near Modjeska Canyon in the Santa Ana Mountains last year, two weeks after she was reported missing, but her cause of death remains a mystery . Ms Ramos was last seen on CCTV, dropping off her rent on May 2, 2013. Earlier that day she had argued with Joy over rent, a fight that led to her death, prosecutors said. The jury also heard that less than two weeks before her death she had called emergency services saying she was 'afraid' following an argument with Joy. Joy attended vigils for Ms Ramos and spoke of his affection for her before his arrest . The court was shown evidence that Ramos had gone to a public library and researched how long it takes for a human body to decay, and the location where Ms Ramos' body was found. Joy, who had attended vigils for Ms Ramos, spoke to several media outlets about the woman he described as his 'best friend' before his arrest. He is due to be sentenced on September 12 and faces 15 years to life in prison.","Kwang Choi Joy's victim was described as 'the love of his life'

"By . Steve Hopkins . The family of a young mother who was stabbed to death after the 999 emergency system failed her are seeking a landmark ruling over the right to claim damages for police negligence. Joanna Michael, 25, made two desperate calls to the emergency service before being murdered by her ex-boyfriend Cyron Williams, 19, in August 2009. But 'individual and systemic failures' by the police meant the emergency services arrived too late to save her life, the Supreme Court was told. Joanna Michael's family is suing police for negligence after they failed to respond to her calls for help quickly; she was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in August 2009 while she waiting for police to arrive . Ms Michael, from St Mellons, Cardiff, was heard screaming during her second call to police before the line went dead. The Independent Police Complaints . Commission has already ruled Ms Michael was failed by both the Gwet and . South Wales police as well as the 999 system. The commission said officers should have . been able to respond to her call within five minutes. By the time they . arrived at her home 22 minutes later she was dead, having been stabbed . 72 times. Cyron Williams, 19, was jailed for life for murdering Ms Michael by stabbing her 72 times in a 'jealous rage' The highest court in the land is hearing a challenge by Ms Michael's family against a Court of Appeal ruling in 2012 that the police have an 'immunity' from being sued for negligence under the common law for the actions of officers during 'the investigation or suppression of crime'. At the same time, the chief constables of South Wales and Gwent Police are cross-appealing against the appeal judges' linked ruling that the family should be allowed to go ahead with a claim that their Article 2 rights under the European Convention on Human Rights were breached by a police failure to protect Ms Michael's life. Nicholas Bowen QC, appearing for Ms Michael's family, said the case was 'desperately important', particularly with regard to cases of domestic violence. He told seven Supreme Court justices: 'There is a need for a heightened accountability of the police in the light of recent scandals and investigations which have had a very serious detrimental affect on public and political confidence in police services.' Mr Bowen said the family's claim was 'not just about money' but also a 'determination to find out really and truly what happened'. Williams attacked Ms Michael, whose children were home at the time, after breaking into her house 'in a mad fit of jealous rage' after discovering she was in a new relationship just weeks after they had broken up. The court heard that Ms Michael made her first 999 call on a mobile phone at 2.29am and told the Gwent Police operator that Williams had come to the house and found her with someone else. He had bitten her ear hard and taken the other man away in his car - saying he would return to kill her. Ms Michael, 25, called police twice and was heard screaming before the phone went dead. She made it clear her life was in danger but police didn't appreciate the urgency of the situation. She was dead when they arrived . Mr Bowen said the 'urgency was absolutely plain' and an immediate response could have meant police reaching her in five minutes. But the call had gone through Gwent - 'the wrong police force' - and not South Wales, as it should have done. The Gwent operator told the mother-of-two to 'stay put' in the house and keep the phone free as South Wales Police would want to call her back, said Mr Bowen. According to the appeal court judgment, the Gwent operator spoke to her South Wales Police counterpart and said Williams had threatened to return to 'hit' Joanna but did not refer to 'the threat to kill'. The call should have continued to be graded as requiring an immediate response, but was instead downgraded. A further 999 call was received by Gwent Police from Ms Michael at 2.43am and she could be heard screaming before the line went dead. Police officers arrived at 2.51am to find her dead. Williams was sentenced to life in jail in 2010 after admitting murder at the Cardiff Crown Court. Mr Bowen told the court that the 'factual picture' revealed there were 'crucial legal duties owed to Ms Michael's estate by the police'. He argued officers had failed to arrive in time and possibly save her life because of unacceptable delays. These were caused by individual and systemic errors of the police which justified them having to face damages claims for negligence, he said. Ms Michael's family are being supported by Welsh Women's Aid and the charity Liberty. Director of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti said: 'Joanna could be alive if the authorities had fulfilled their duties under the Human Rights Act. 'They can’t be allowed to hide such failings under the cloak of police immunity.'","Police should have got to Joanna Michael's Cardiff home within five minutes .

"By . Steve Hopkins . London's department stores are bracing themselves for a 'Middle Eastern gold rush' as scores of rich Arab shoppers are expected to hit the tills in what has become known as the 'Ramadan rush'. Middle Eastern shoppers are expected to increase their summer spend by a quarter over the next three days on a quest to 'out-shop and outspend' each other as Eid al Fitr celebrations - which mark the end of the 29-day fasting period of Ramadan - begin. Around 69 per cent of the total Middle Eastern spend in August 2013 was in major department and clothing stores, like Harrods and Selfridges. Wealthy shoppers from the Middle East are expected to spend-up large in London department stores like Harrods, over the next few days in what has become known as the 'Ramadan rush' Middle Eastern visitors spent an average of £152.40 per transaction in August last year with many of the purchases being made at high-end department stores like Selfridges, above, which specialise in luxury brands . Figures from Worldpay show that Middle Eastern visitors spent an average of £152.40 per transaction in August 2013 with visitors from Qatar topping the list by handing over an average of £288.17 on each trip to the till. Shoppers from Saudi Arabia were next, spending £199.87, followed by those from Bahrain, £189.29, and those from the United Arab Emirates, £188.29. In comparison, European tourists spent just £49.00 per sale during the same period. American shoppers spent slightly more at £65.41. Shoppers from Qatar, pictured, spent the most money out of all Middle Eastern visitors, with an average spend of £288.17 on each trip to the till , in August last year . Worldpay said given the number of visitors from Gulf Cooperation Council countries had jumped by 11 per cent between January and April  - compared to the same period last year - retailers needed to be well prepared. Tourists from the UAE led the charge with 262,000 visitors in 2013, with Kuwait in second place with 110,000 visitors. Qatar shoppers - £288.17 each purchase . Saudi Arabia  - £199.87 each purchase . Bahrain shoppers - £189.29 each purchase . UAE shoppers - £188.29 each purchase . U.S shoppers - £65.41 each purchase . European shoppers - £49 each purchase . Dave Hobday, Worldpay UK managing director, said Britain has some of the best shopping in the world but retailers needed to 'wake up' to the fact that the biggest spenders were not British. He said: 'There’s a Middle Eastern gold rush underway and millions of pounds are at stake as tourists from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE flock to the UK to out-shop and outspend the rest.' Mr Hobday said the 'pressure' was on retailers to go beyond simply offering great service. He said: 'Winning retailers must work harder than ever to make Middle Eastern shoppers welcome.' High-end retailers and boutiques are now employing multi-lingual staff and giving shoppers the option to pay by card in their own currency, Mr Hobday said. 'We’re on the eve of Eid and this spending frenzy is a gift retailers just can’t afford to miss.'","Middle Eastern shoppers to increase their summer spend by 25 per cent .

"By . Steve Hopkins . Andrew Douglas has been sentenced to 12 months jail, suspended for two years, after being found in possession of almost 700 child sex images . A primary school teacher found with almost 700 child abuse images and banned from working with children has been told his offending would 'send a shudder down the backs' of parents. Andrew Douglas, who now lives in Norwich, admitted making and possessing illegal images of children and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with supervision. The father-of-two must sign the sex offenders register for 10 years and abide by the . terms of a sexual offences prevention order for five years. Newcastle Crown Court heard Douglas, 30, confessed to having a 'dark secret' for half a decade after being found in possession of 696 child abuse images, some of which were the worst of their type. Judge Guy Whitburn told him: 'The very concept of a primary school teacher being in possession of images such as these would send a shudder down the backs of most who send their children to primary school.' The court heard there had been no complaints about Douglas' behaviour in the classroom at a Tyneside primary school, but his activities had been tracked online. Douglas, who had one child and another on the way, has never been allowed to meet his new baby, born after his arrest, the court was told. His ban from working with children signals the end of his career. After being caught with the images, Douglas confessed to having had a 'dark secret' for half a decade (file picture).

"By . Steve Hopkins . Ukraine's parliament erupted into a brawl yesterday after a decision to send more reserve soldiers to battle separatists near the Russian border was approved. Nationalist and pro-Russian lawmakers were seen swinging at, and wrestling one another, in scenes more fitting of a bar room brawl than a debating chamber. Members of the nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) party and politicians from the Party of Regions clashed after 232 deputies voted in favour of the decision - an extension of an earlier plan that had expired. Scroll down for video . Nationalist and pro-Russian lawmakers came to blows after a decision to send more reserve soldiers to battle separatists near the Russian border was approved . The politicians could be seen taking swings at one another and trying to wrestle each other to the ground . Fighting continues in the separatist-controlled Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. In the nearby Lukansk region, the national military has reportedly made some gains against pro-Russian militants, the Moscow Times reported. This is not the first time fists have flown in the Ukranian parliament. In April, a fight broke out after communist leader Petro Symonenko accused nationalists of having surrendered the country to Russia. The fights come as tensions continue over the handling of last Thursday's MH17 crisis which claimed 298 lives - including 10 Britons. While the first bodies of those killed in the crash arrived in the Netherlands today, there was fresh anguish amongst grieving relatives as it emerged that as many as a third of the passengers could still be missing. The politicians had to be pulled apart after charging at one another and trying to get each other in a head lock . The decision which sparked the brawl was an extension of an earlier plan that had since expired . This is not the first time The Ukrainian parliament has erupted into a fist fight; in April politicians came to blows after communist leader Petro Symonenko accused nationalists of having surrendered the country to Russia . Yesterday, 200 bodies were released by the rebels and taken by train to the Ukrainian government-controlled city of Kharkiv, raising questions about the condition of the remaining 98. Rebel commanders claimed the makeshift morgue contained 282 bodies and 87 body parts from an additional 16 people. This would have accounted for all of the passengers killed when the Boeing 777 was shot down by an anti-aircraft missile, however, after carrying out a body count last night, Dutch forensic experts found the number to be ‘significantly less’. The head of the Dutch team leading the investigation, Jain Tuinder, said he estimated just 200 bodies had arrived in Kharkiv as well as a number of unidentified body parts. Dutch air safety officials leading the investigation into the disaster also said today that they still had not got safe access to the crash site in eastern Ukraine.","Brawl sparked by a decision to send more troops to battle separatists .

"By . Steve Hopkins . An angry schoolboy wrote to his mother’s killer to tell him he had ruined his life. David Wilder was jailed for life for murdering his former girlfriend Kerry Power in December 2013 . A court heard 10-year-old Olly Power sent the letter to David Wilder who choked his mother to death as he slept in their home just before Christmas last year. Part of his letter was read to a court by his grandmother Stephanie: It said: 'I feel very angry. If I was you I would be ashamed. I have a sad miserable life. You have ruined my life and my family’s life. It was nearly Christmas and we were happy.' Yesterday . tearful bus driver Wilder admitted murdering Kerry Power, 36, at . her home in Plymouth, Devon and was jailed for life. Judge . Graham Cottle said Olly heard the life being strangled from his mother . but ‘mercifully did not come downstairs to witness the act itself or the . immediate aftermath’. He said: 'It is entirely likely that he will be haunted by his memories of that night for a very long time if not forever.' The judge said the murder was a ‘dreadful act’ and when Olly did see his mother under a duvet he did ‘not realise she was dead’. He said Wilder, who must serve a minimum of 17.5 years, was a man ‘who liked to dominate and control women’. In . the days before the murder, Wilder, 42, bombarded Ms Power with texts and phone . calls, stalked her, and turned up drunk at her house after she ended their two year romance. Police . were called to Ms Power's house twice in the days leading up to her . murder and officers told her to call them if Wilder turned up again. The . judge said Kerry dialled 999 at 1.10am as she was being attacked. It was . almost a silent call but police could later hear her say: 'You have to . leave. I don’t know how you got in here but I need you to leave, you . have to leave.' Wilder then strangled her as Olly heard noises which the judge said were his mother ‘struggling for life’. Kerry Power, 36, had ended her two year relationship with Wilder before he strangled her to death . Taunton . Crown Court heard that Olly was disturbed in the middle of the night . when he heard his mother making ‘strange noises’ like she was being sick . and Wilder making ‘muttering noises’. Early . that morning Olly got up and found his mum - now dead - lying under a . duvet in the front room of the house with Wilder lying next to her. The . court heard Wilder strangled the primary school assistant to death four years after he had nearly killed his ex wife Kelly . in a similar attack. 'I . feel very angry. If I was you I would be ashamed. I have a sad . miserable life. You ruined my life and my family's life. It was nearly . Christmas and we were happy' The . judge was told Wilder was given two police cautions for a series . of domestic abuse incidents against his former wife, including one when . he tried to throttle her. The . court heard in 2005 he threw a beaker at his ex-wife and then bent her . legs so that her right hip came out of it's socket. And in 2009 he broke into his ex’s home through a window and climbed on top of her as she lay in bed. Wilder’s own barrister Michael Fitton QC described him as ‘possessive’.

"By . Steve Hopkins . Parents will be forced to shell out more than £100 a week to keep a child occupied and cared for during the six-week summer holidays, according to new research. It found that holiday childcare is becoming increasingly expensive and that one in six parents had to call in sick last year in order to look after their children during the summer break. And other parents had to give up jobs altogether, due to a lack of childcare. In Britain the average cost of one week's full time, 50 hours, holiday childcare - including holiday clubs and play schemes - now stands at £114.51, according to the Family and Childcare Trust's annual holiday childcare report. A survey of parents found that around 17 per cent had to take days off work sick last year to cover childcare during the summer holiday period while others had to give up jobs . Overall, the cost of holiday care is about 1.7 per cent more expensive than last year, the survey found. Prices dropped 3.1 per cent in the maintained sector - childcare run by local councils and other public sector bodies - but increased by 2.7 per cent in the private sector, including private clubs and play schemes. The findings show that in England alone, full-time holiday childcare costs on average around £116.18 a week. Prices are the highest in the South East, with an average weekly cost of £140.88, whilst families in the North West have the cheapest weekly bill at £103.38. More than a third of those surveyed said it was difficult to find care they could afford during the holiday period, and two thirds, 66 per cent, said that the summer holidays is the most difficult time to find it . In Wales holiday childcare costs £109.66 on average, and in Scotland it is £104.28. A . survey of parents conducted by website Netmums and the trust found that . around 17 per cent had to take days off work sick last year to cover childcare. This represents almost a million working days lost, the trust said, which it claims costs the economy almost £100million each year. Family and Childcare Trust chief executive Anand Shukla said parents should not be forced to take sick days to manage their childcare needs . A quarter of the parents questioned said that they had been forced to cut their working hours during the school holidays, and one in eight said they had given up jobs because they could not find childcare. More than a third of those surveyed, 35 per cent, said it was difficult to find care they could afford, and two thirds, 66 per cent, said that the summer is the most difficult time to find childcare. Family and Childcare Trust chief executive Anand Shukla, said: 'A combination of unaffordable prices, lack of holiday childcare and inflexible employers is not only causing stress for parents, but it's bad for the economy. 'Most parents have no choice but to work, and should not have to take sick days to manage childcare. This is not the way to operate a modern economy.' Mr Skukla said the trust is calling on employers and head teachers to help parents manage the school holidays, and for the government to develop a new childcare stratedy that 'properly represents the realities working families face today'. The study was based on data collected from local authorities and a survey of 1,587 parents.","In Britain the average cost of one week's holiday childcare is £114.51 .

"By . Steve Hopkins . A nurse who used donations to her ward to buy alcohol for patients and pay for staff parties has been allowed to keep her job. Audrey Marshall, 43, was cleared of misconduct by the Nursing and Midwifery Council after admitting accepting money from four patients families but failing to record them. The hearing revealed it was quite normal for hospital workers to informally hold cash donations. Nurse Audrey Marshall used donations to her ward to buy alcohol for patients and to pay for staff parties . Ms Marshall was backed by the council who said any fair-minded observer would be unconcerned by her conduct. Her colleagues told the hearing she was a well-respected nurse. Ms Marshall declined to comment after the hearing on Friday, but, in a statement submitted to the council she said: 'I've punished myself more than anyone else could and lost a huge part of who I am.' The nurse worked at an unnamed hospital in the NHS Lothian area between 2009 and 2011 when her spending was discovered. She was later demoted and given a warning. The case was referred to the police and after appearing in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court in 2012 Ms Marshall was acquitted of both theft and embezzlement. The sheriff said it was clear that although Ms Marshall had broken hospital accounting rules she was not dishonest. The Nursing and Midwifery Council, seen here in London, cleared Ms Marshall of misconduct but said all donations handed to staff in NHS Lothian must be passed to the foundation . An investigation by the Nursing and Midwifery Council also found Ms Marshall had not acted dishonestly. However, it pointed out spending donations on staff parties and nights out was serious enough to constitute misconduct. At the hearing, NHS Lothian was said to have changed its approach to donations and had offered an amnesty to staff who held on to cash gifts without recording them. A letter from the clinical director of gynaecology at NHS Lothian stated that from 2007 to the beginning of 2013, 'I was aware of a number of similar funds' held informally by ward and department staff in the same way as Ms Marshall had. Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw voiced concerns over the case, saying: 'When money is donated to wards, the last thing families expect is for it to be blown on a staff night out. Now this case has come to light, there is no excuse for it to happen again.' The council boards Jane Ferguson said all donations handed to staff in NHS Lothian must be passed to the foundation. NHS Lothian told the hearing it did not know how much donated money staff held informally.","Hearing told it was quite common for staff to informally hold donations .

"By . Steve Hopkins . A soured business deal between a suspect in the case of a missing Calgary boy and his grandparents, is now at the centre of a hunt for the trio. Nathan O’Brien, five, and his grandparents Alvin and Kathryn Liknes were reported missing last Monday and were last seen at the Liknes Arkhill home on June 29. On Saturday police took Douglas Garland in for questioning. It was believed the 54-year-old, from Airdire, Alberta, was driving a green Ford F-150 pickup seen near the Liknes family home on the night they disappeared. Nathan O'Brien, five, and his grandmother, Kathy Liknes, who are missing along with  her husband Alvin Liknes, seen here in a picture released by Calgary police . Police are said to be looking into a dispute over a business deal several years ago between Garland - who is related to the missing trio through a sister's comnon-law marriage - and Mr Alvin, according to the National Post. Officers focused their hunt for the missing family members at three Airdrie locations on Monday. One centred around a slough and a field near the home of Mr Garland's parents, Archie and Doreen Garland. Garland once operated a drugs lab at the property which police searched over the weekend. A 'person of interest': Douglas Garland (left) has been questioned over the disappearance of Nathan O'Brien (right) and his grandparents (below) while officers searched his family farm for clues . Not suspects: Alvin and Kathryn Liknes are not considered suspects in the case, since investigators found signs of a struggle in the their Arkhill home . After being questioned by police Garland was released the following day. He . was then remanded in custody for two days for possessing the . identification of Matthew Hartley, a teenager who had died in a car . crash in 1980. He had previously assumed the identity to avoid authorities and gain employment. Garland . made a brief appearance in court on Monday, via closed circuit . television, and was remanded in custody for an additional 48 hours, in . which time police could continue to interview him. 'You're our superhero': During a press conference, Nathan's mother Jennifer O'Brien told her son to stay strong . Garland's criminal history dates back to 1992 when police raided his parent's farm on suspicion he was producing drugs. They found ingredients to make crystal meth, but no final product. Drug charges were filed but Garland skipped town and lived on the run for seven years. He . was discovered in 1999 living in British Columbia under the name of the . dead teenager, and later served 39 months jail after being convicted of drugs charges. The truck in question: Canadian authorities said this green late 1980s - early 1990s Ford F-150 pickup was circling the house where the missing trio was before they went missing . Garland . had used the fake identity to gain employment as a chemical mixer, but . that ended in 1997 after a promotion led to him suffering a nervous . breakdown. He then filed for unemployment benefits under the assumed name, but that was denied after his true identity was revealed. Garland, who also dropped out of medical following a nervous breakdown, then sued in the federal tax court and won. His last encounter with the law was a traffic offence in 2009. Mrs O'Brien described her son as a chatterbox who loved superheros. Pictured above, Rod O'Brien (left), Jennifer O'Brien (second left), Maximus O'Brien (center), Nathan O'Brien (second right), Luke O'Brien . Monday's search involved forensics investigators and fire personnel who scoured a waterway in a rapid deployment craft. Green . ribbons have now appeared around the close-knit Airdire community, a . symbol of hope that the trio will return home safe and sound. On . Friday Calgary police Staff Sgt. Doug Andrus spoke about the . significance of locating the truck seen near Liknes family home on the . night they disappeared. Police swarmed on the Garland family farm after neighbours reported seeing the Ford F-150 there . He . said: 'We just believe given the area the vehicle was in, and the fact . that it was the night of the incident and that it drove in the area . several times, that there's a good possibility that the individual, or individuals, may have information.' At . the press conference police confirmed a 'violent crime happened in that . residence', but said they remained hopeful 'we will find them alive'. The . missing boy's grandparents are not considered suspects as investigators . found evidence that all three left the home against their will. Rod O'Brien, seen here with his wife Jennifer, broke down in tears when he spoke about his missing son . Nathan's father Rod O'Brien cried as he spoke of his beloved son last week. He . said: 'To whoever has Nathan, please find it in your heart to drop off . our little angel Nathan, so he can be rescued and reunited with his . brothers and his family.' Jennifer O'Brien told her son to have courage. She said: 'Stay strong, Nathan. We know you are our superhero and I just need you to stay strong and we are going to see you. No stone unturned: Officers are walking every inch of every field on the farm after tips led them to the property . 'We can't be with you right now, but the best people who can be with you other than us are your grandparents. 'I know Grandma is holding you so tight right now, and they are doing everything in their power to keep you safe.' Mrs O'Brien last saw her son Sunday night, after helping her parents all day with a garage sale. Mrs O'Brien and her son spent the day prior helping her parents with a garage sale at their home . She left her parents home around 10pm and Nathan stayed behind to have a sleepover. When she returned 12 hours later in the morning, all three were gone. An Amber Alert was issued for Nathan later that evening.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Every bride hopes to impress her groom when she first appears at the head of the aisle, and in this instance, she certainly succeeded, judging by a touching set of wedding photos currently making the internet rounds. Groom Jai Kamat, 26, an artist based in New York, is captured displaying a roller coaster of profound emotion in response to his bride Julie Kamat, also 26; from tension, to delight, to all-out tear-suppressing joy. 'That’s just how I am,' Mr Kamat told ABC News. 'Seeing it plastered on the Internet is kind of strange.' Magic: This is the heart-warming moment that Jai Kamat (left) first sees his bride, college sweetheart Julie Kamat (right) walk down the aisle towards him . The tear-jerking photos were snapped by Lauren Benson, the groom's cousin, who says she had her shutter going 'rapid fire' to capture his colorful array of expressions. Mr Kamat married his college sweetheart on Memorial Day in May, at Orlando's Disney World Florida. For the proud new husband, it was perhaps the end to his year-long wait to see the wedding gown Julie had settled on, which brought on such a on overwhelmed reaction. Here she comes: Mr Kamat, an artist based in New York, is seen quickly tumbling through emotions of trepidation, excitement and wonder, as the spectacle unfolds . Jaw-dropping: 'That's just how I am,' Mr Kamat says of his new-found fame. 'Seeing it plastered on the Internet is kind of strange' Still reeling: The happy couple were married on Memorial Day in May, at Orlando's Disney World Florida . Married: Mrs Kamat (pictured) had kept the details of her dress a secret from her fiance in the lead up to the wedding, and when he finally saw it, he says it was 'surreal' 'We’d been planning the wedding for about one year and Julie had been holding out on what her dress looked like,' he explains. 'I was really happy and trying to hold back tears at the same time' 'When those doors opened and she walked out it was kind of surreal. Everyone was there, all our friends and family, and I was really happy and trying to hold back tears at the same time. 'It was a lot to take in at once.' Down to earth: Mrs Kamat wasn't surprised by her now-husband's wedding performance, or his subsequent internet fame . You might expect his new wife Julie to be exceptionally smug with her husband's outburst of loving appreciation at their wedding, and his subsequent internet fame. Not entirely. 'She sort of rolled her eyes because she’s used to it,' Mr Kamat says.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Advertising and PR managers, event planners, and education administrators are all titles which are considered the ‘best’ jobs for women in 2014. According to a new study based on data from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, which ranked the top 12 'best' jobs for women this year, dental hygienists and physical therapists are also rated highly as female-driven jobs. The top 12, which is listed alphabetically rather than ranked in order, was compiled by CareerCast, and is based chiefly on the average salaries women can expect to earn in various jobs, coupled with each professions’ 'projected hiring outlook' - but it also takes into account factors including stress, physical demands and the percentage of women working in each field. Female-friendly careers: CareerCast has ranked its take on the top 12 'best' jobs for women in 2014, based on average salaries and the 'projected hiring outlook' for various professions in the U.S. At the top of the salary scale - just one deciding factor - was the role of an advertising and promotions manager, which earns women an average salary of $115,750. The projected hiring outlook however - calculated by comparing the number of women in that job in 2012 to the expected number in 2022 - is relatively low, at 12per cent. Physical therapy, on the other hand, is described as 'an especially promising' profession, with a projected hiring outlook of 36per cent, and an average salary of $79,860. At the lower end of the salary scale is event planning, with an average expectation of $45,810 a year, but with a high projected hiring outlook of 33per cent. The study also points out that 74.7per cent of event planners are women; a factor that pushed certain professions up the scale. Other job titles which women appear to dominate in terms of numbers versus men, according to the figures, include speech pathologists (93.4per cent of whom are female), dental hygienists, (98.3per cent) and occupational therapists (88.4per cent). A job as a computers systems analyst, with a salary of $79,680, was also hailed as promising, for being 'one of many fast-growing jobs where gender takes a back seat to skill, experience and passion.' Other jobs on the list in which women are reported to be earning 'compensation comparable to their male counterparts' include human resource managers, education administrators and actuaries. To look purely at women's salaries and the issue of the gender pay gap, Forbes recently published a list - also using data from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics - which ranks the top 20 'best-paying' jobs for women in 2014. The most lucrative job title was found to be chief executive. Although female chief executives make an average salary of $94,172, they only make up only 21per cent of the profession in total, and earn 20per cent less than men at exactly the same level - which closely reflects the current average gender pay gap across all professions in the U.S. CareerCast's top 12 list of best jobs for women has drawn some criticism based on its subjective nature. Refinery29 considers: 'The angle of which jobs are best “for women” is offensive no matter what positions are listed,' and points out that none of the jobs listed reach $100k, or surpass middle-management level. On a lighter note, regardless of skill-set, more and more women in today's America are choosing entrepreneurship as a career path. The U.S. Small Business Administration estimates that last year, 10.6 million women owned their own businesses, a significant jump from the 1990s, the study points out. Actuary . $93,680 . 26% .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . It’s official: money can indeed buy happiness - but you don't need to be anywhere near a millionaire to be content in life, finds a new study. CNN Money's recent American Dream Poll found that just over half of its 1,000 people surveyed said that an annual income of under $100,000 would be enough to make them 'happy.' Ten per cent of those questioned said they would be happy earning under $30,000, and only six percent staunchly stated that 'money can't buy happiness.' Happy days: A new survey has found that 51per cent of those polled said an annual income of under $100,000 would be enough to make them happy, while a quarter would settle for $50-75,000 . Apparently then, most of us agree that the amount cash we have to throw around does make a difference to our happiness in life. Nearly a quarter of those polled were happy to settle with between $50,000 - which is the average American's household income, according to the latest census data - and $75,000 a year. And this quarter may be on to something. A separate study on close to half a million people, conducted by Princeton University in 2010, found that our 'happiness' does rise in line with how much money we are making, but only up to an annual income of about $75,000. After that, higher incomes certainly buy 'life satisfaction' - leading people to view their lives as a whole in high regard - but it doesn't buy happiness, which was quantified more on people's day-to-day emotional well-being. That study did concede that the inevitable trials and tribulations of being less fortunate does cause people to feel both unsatisfied by their lives, and unhappy emotionally. According to U.S. census data, 'poor' is defined as a four-person family living on under $23,000 annually, which includes around $46.2 million Americans. And what do the respondents of CNN's American Dream poll quantify as being wealthy? Sixty per cent would call themselves 'rich' earning under $250,000 annually, and the most typical answers fell between $100,000 and $200,000. Eleven percent said they'd need over $1 million to truly call themselves rich. In summary then, perhaps Woody Allen had it right when he once said: 'Money is better than poverty, if only for financial reasons.'","CNN Money's poll found most of us are indeed willing to put a number on happiness .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Good Morning America host Amy Robach has revealed that the memory loss she suffered from her recent eight rounds of chemotherapy was so profound, to this day she can't remember much of her time on air. The 40-year-old mother-of-two, who continued to appear on her ABC show for the duration of her entire eight month ordeal, admits she was often 'afraid' she would 'do or say something stupid' on air, such were the cognitive effects of her treatment. 'The chemo brain, the chemo fog, is a real thing,' she told The New York Daily News. 'I would have conversations with people, they would take pictures with me after the show... it upset me tremendously because I actually wouldn’t be able to remember.' Scroll down for video . Brave front: Amy Robach, pictured on Good Morning America in February while undergoing intense chemotherapy, says she still can't remember filming many of her segments due to the 'chemo fog' Ms Robach points to one occasion on which she was filming a segment about hit AMC show Mad Men, and was dressed in 1960s attire. The following day, when she saw photos of her unusual outfit, she says it 'bought tears' to her eyes because she no recollection of any of it. In another instance, her husband of four years, actor Andrew Shue, wrote her a 'beautiful' letter after she underwent her first round of chemotherapy, which she read and then promptly forgot about. 'For me those were very, very difficult moments,' she says. 'Because you just realize the impact of what is being pumped inside of you and you feel so incredibly vulnerable, physically, mentally. And those were the days I was just so afraid of what was happening to me.' No recollection: Ms Robach recalls nothing of the Mad Men segment she filmed earlier this year (left) but managed to keep it together on air (right, in April) despite fears she would 'say or do something stupid' Still, Ms Robach soldiered on, finding solace in the distractions of the job she 'loves,' and drawing strength from staying on air to prove that she could 'overcome her fears.' Following her shock diagnoses in October of last year, she turned to co-host and fellow breast cancer survivor, 53-year-old Robin Roberts, for support. Ms Roberts, who helped persuade Ms Robach to undergo the routine on-air mammogram in the first place - an action that would later 'save her life' - advised her to have her chemo sessions on Thursdays, because her 'worst days' would be over the weekend, leaving her enough recovery time to be 'halfway decent' for work on Mondays. Support: Ms Robach (center right), pictured revealing her diagnosis on air in November, received advice from co-host and fellow breast cancer survivor Robin Roberts (center left) about how to manage at work . Of these dreaded treatment sessions, Ms Robacah said: 'Those moments in the chemo rooms were very intense for me. When I was in that room, in that chair, I broke down every time. 'I was mad that there were toxins surging through my body, I was mad that I felt like I was gonna vomit and that I was losing my memory' 'The rest of the time I could kind of pretend and forget... I was mad there was a needle in my arm, I was mad that there were toxins surging through my body, I was mad that I felt like I was gonna vomit and that I was losing my memory.' Ms Robach also touched on the negative attention she received from some outlets which claimed she was holding back certain details of her diagnosis from the public, and compromising her journalistic 'ethics' in discussing other aspects on television; accusations she says 'makes steam come out of [her] ears.' The news anchor mentions eight instances in which women have written to her, thanking her for inspiring them to get themselves checked and ultimately catching cancer sooner than they otherwise would have done. On the mend: Ms Robach, pictured on May 27 having completed her chemo treatment, says she has received letters from eight women who caught their own cancers early, all thanks to her example . She also recalls the day, soon after her first scans, when her insurance company informed her they wouldn't be paying the $800 for her next round of imaging because they didn't consider it 'necessary.' Thankfully, she paid the fee herself and she says she is 'lucky' she was able to, although this wouldn't have always been the case. 'There were times in my life that that could have been my rent money, that could have been the money I would need to spend on groceries,' she admits. 'How many millions of Americans would just at that point say thanks but no thanks?... Because treating cancer is an expensive undertaking and I know how it financially destroys families.' She says she now wants to get involved with organizations that assist families with financial barriers to their health options. Journey: Ms Robach was open with her fans throughout her ordeal, pictured counting down her eight chemo sessions, which she completed on April 24 . Ms Robach has been very transparent with fans and viewers about her cancer battle, right from the moment it began; when, last October, her routine mammogram revealed she had a malignant tumor in her right breast. It was only after she had her first surgery - a double mastectomy in November - that doctors realized there was a second tumor in the same breast and some abnormal cells in the left breast. After the surgery it also became clear that the disease had spread to her sentinel lymph nodes, meaning that the mastectomy was far from the final step. Due to the location and size of the tumors, surgeons were able to save her nipples and insert expanders that were placed where the removed breasts once were. The expanders stayed in place behind the chest muscle in an effort to stretch it out before implants were put in during a second surgery, which took place earlier this month. Family focused: Ms Robach has two daughters - 11-year-old Ava and eight-year-old Annalise - with her ex-husband Tim McIntosh and three stepsons with her current husband Andrew Shue . Sharing her journey with fans every step of the way, she celebrated the end of her chemo treatment on April 24 by posting a collage of photographs from the past six months depicting her counting down with her fingers the number of sessions she'd had. 'Today is my final round of chemotherapy,' she tweeted. 'I wanted to share this moment with you to encourage anyone facing this battle.' Ms Robach has two daughters - 11-year-old Ava and eight-year-old Annalise - with her ex-husband Tim McIntosh and three stepsons with her current husband Mr Shue.","The Good Morning America host also reveals how she 'broke down' every time she was in the chair for chemo sessions .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A man who weighed a whopping 800lbs when he was just 16 years old has shed almost 600lbs over the space of a decade; almost 75per cent of his body weight. Justin Willoughby, now 27, based in Bradford, Pennsylvania, lost the weight without any assistance, drugs or surgery; simply by eating smaller, healthier meals and by very gradually building up an exercise routine, he tells Samantha Guthrie on the Today show. 'My first exercise was just standing up and sitting back down,' he explained. 'That was very painful. My back started hurting, my legs started hurting. That was a workout for me.' Unrecognizable: Justin Willoughby weighed 800lbs by the time he was 16 (left) and was told he would die if he didn't shape up, so he gradually managed to lose almost 600lbs over the space a decade (right, now, at 235lbs) Mr Willoughby says he struggled with stress and 'severe anxiety,' as a teen and turned to food as a source of comfort. 'I was starting to get addicted to food. I loved food. If I could do anything, I’d marry food. I loved it that much,' he admits. His breaking point came when, at the age of only 16, his doctors informed him he would die if he didn't lose weight, according to an account he wrote for The Huffington Post. 'I just knew that I had to focus on the day I was living. I had a “lose weight or die trying” mentality,' he wrote. Then and now: Back when he was obese (left), Mr Willoughby (also right) says he was 'addicted to food,' because it eased his chronic anxiety, but eventually snapped and adopted a 'lose weight or die trying mentality' Total turnaround: 'My first exercise was just standing up and sitting back down,' he recalls, which was 'very painful,' but he built strength over time and now exercises and lifts weights for 90 minutes a day . After Mr Willoughby had mastered standing for a couple of minutes at a time, then taking more steps each day, he achieved a one mile walk, which took him 33 days to complete. Then, he joined his local YMCA - Mr Willoughby says his 'belief in God' played a 'significant' part in his transformation - and started walking for up to an hour, five or six days a week. Eventually, he was running 5k's. After reading up on portion control on the internet, he turned his eating habits around too: 'I went from eating white breads, processed meats, and other high-fat, high-sugar foods to more natural foods, like egg whites, whole-grain breads, whole-grain cereals, milk, cheese, fruits and vegetables.' Taking it on: Mr Willoughby (left, in his youth) says his 'belief in God' played a 'significant' part in his transformation to the happy, healthy man he is today (right) Won't be needing those anymore: Mr Willoughby (right) is now a passionate healthy-living coach, motivational speaker, and author . On Jan 1 of this year, Mr Willoughby, who has undergone skin-reduction surgery, gave up 'sweet junk food,' as well. His weight loss has been gradual, but consistent. At his lowest, he weighed 207lbs, but he has since taken up weightlifting to build lean muscle mass, and now weighs 235lbs - working out for about 90 minutes every day. These days, there doesn't appear to be a trace of the anxious, unhappy teenage boy he left behind. Mr Willoughby is now a passionate healthy-living coach, motivational speaker, and author, whose latest eBook is entitled Overcoming The Monday Mentality.","As a teen, Justin Willoughby, now 27, was told by doctors that he would die if he didn't lose weight .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . With only six weeks left until the birth of her first child, Savannah Guthrie is letting the weight-gain rules fly out the window. The 42-year-old NBC host reveals in her Today.com blog that after gaining 30lbs since falling pregnant last November, she sought advice from her OB/GYN, worried she was in 'weight-gain overtime.' 'I asked my doctor: Should I worry that I've already whizzed past the recommended 25-30lb weight gain? ""You're pregnant,"" he shrugged. ""Don't worry about it.""' Scroll down for video . No weight worries: Ms Guthrie, pictured earlier this month, recently revealed that she has so far gained 30lbs during her pregnancy, which her OB/GYN advised her not to 'worry' about . Ms Guthrie, who stands at a statuesque 5'10, writes that, for her, one of the 'joys' of being pregnant is the relief of putting her weight-worries to bed for a while. 'Unbutton those jeans and glory in the elastic waistband. There is no point in sucking in your stomach, or squeezing into a dress, or trying to look good in a bathing suit,' she muses. Ms Guthrie admits, however, that she is still well-aware it 'isn't healthy' to pile on too much blubber during pregnancy, and furthermore, that she doesn't want to 'dig a weight gain hole so deep' that she can't exercise her way out of it once the baby is born. Burgeoning bump: Ms Guthrie (pictured Wednesday on the Today show with John Kerry) says, 'There is no point in sucking in your stomach, or squeezing into a dress' during pregnancy . The expectant mother notes that the average unborn baby weighs between 2-3lbs at 30 weeks old, the stage of her own pregnancy. 'The other 28 pounds is boobs, clearly, and who knows what else: blood and fluid and placenta and what have you,' Ms Guthrie speculates, adding that the pregnancy weight-gain rule is only a 'recommendation,' and that if a woman looks and feels healthy, perhaps she should relax. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy . increases the risk of various complications, including gestational . diabetes and high blood pressure.It can also increase the baby's risk of health problems at birth and childhood obesity.Women . of a normal weight before pregnancy are advised to gain about 25 to . 30lbs, according to The Institute of Medicine, but for overweight or . obese woman, that recommendation falls to between 11 and 25lbs. 'You know what we don't need?' she writes. 'Another big heaping serving of guilt weighing us down.' Ms Guthrie didn't go public with her pregnancy announcement until March, when she was already five months along. One of her first tasks when she returned from her 'Babymoon' to her job at the Today show, was to talk about her changing body. As she looked at herself in a mirror, Ms Guthrie said: 'I love my baby bump. I love the fact that I'm 42 years old and lucky enough to get this chance, and the human body is remarkable. 'I'm divinely inspired, I think, to be able to create life. So right now, I'm just loving that my body is able to do this and produce life.' Earlier days: On a Today show appearance soon after she broke the news of her pregnancy, Ms Guthrie said, 'I love my baby bump.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A pre-teen girl attempts to fake her first period, using glitter no less, in a hilarious new ad for Hello Flo's Period Starter Kit- but her mother teaches her a lesson she'll never forget. In 'First Moon Party' Katie's scheme is brilliantly foiled by her mom, who throws an excruciatingly embarrassing 'first period party,' eventually leading her daughter to fess up. The bash features cringe-inducing activities, such as a 'uterus piñata' and  a 'pin the pad on the period' game. There’s even an allusion to 'vagina cake.'  Unsurprisingly, the video has garnered more than 1.8 million views since it was uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday. Not buying it: Hello Flo's new ad sees a pre-teen fake her first period by painting a sanitary pad with red nail polish, not fooling her mother (pictured) for a moment . Katie opens the ad lamenting the fact that she has yet to start her period. 'First, Jenny got it. Then, stupid Vicki got it. And I tried everything to get my period,' says Katie. 'Nothing. So, I faked it.' Katie's masterful plan involves dotting a sanitary pad with red glittery nail polish and the young girl appears quite smug with her handiwork; bragging to her friends on the phone and leaving the pad lying around for her mother to find. 'Hey Katie, what's this?' her mother asks, waggling the item in question. 'What do you think it is?' responds Katie sarcastically. 'I'm on my lady's days.' 'What do I think it is?' her mother says, speaking to the camera. 'Rubylicious nail polish. But she doesn't need to know that.' Never mess with mom: Katie (left) is horrified when her mother (right) throws an impromptu 'first moon party' to celebrate her daughter's 'milestone' Everyone's invited: Hordes of guests show up to the hilariously embarrassing soiree, including Katie's grandpa (center) and school friends (right) Katie's mother then informs her daughter that, as per 'family tradition,' she will be throwing a 'first moon party' to celebrate this momentous stepping stone in her path towards womanhood. After she calls to inquire as to the availability of a 'vagina cake,' the front door flies open and the party begins. 'This party is a hit. Your grandpa is bobbin' for ovaries like a champ' 'You're so grown up!' squeals Katie's grandfather with an animated embrace. 'There she is! I got you the super pack,' offers one of her mother's 'co-workers,' handing Katie an auspicious looking package. 'These are coffee filters,' Katie responds dejectedly. 'Yeah, I wasn't sure what brand you liked,' chortles the man. Highlights: What period-themed party would be complete without a 'uterus piñata' (left) and a 'pin the pad on the period' game (right) Marshmallow anyone? Katie is scarred by the party's inclusion of a bright red confectionary dipping fountain (pictured) An outlandish series of period-themed children's games ensues, including 'pin the pad on the period,' a 'uterus pinata,' a 'vagician,' and a bright red marshmallow dipping fountain. 'I used to like marshmallows,' the poor girl mutters. 'Not anymore.' 'You need to stop this! No one is having fun,' Katie implores to her mother. 'What are you taking about?' her mother returns. 'This party is a hit. Your grandpa is bobbin' for ovaries like a champ.' The life of a tween: Katie begs her mother to end the horrendous party, to which her mother responds, 'This party is a hit. Your grandpa is bobbin for ovaries like a champ' The stuff of nightmares: When Katie's father pops out of a giant cake like a jack-in-the-box (pictured), she reaches her cringe-threshold, and finally comes clean to her mother . The traumatized girl finally caves and confesses she's been faking her period, at which point her mother presents her with a Hello Flo period starter kit, presumably for when Katie does eventually reach the day she's been waiting for. 'What'd she think, I wouldn't know?' quips the mother. 'Periods don't have glitter in them.' The ad has drawn overwhelmingly positive responses from viewers. 'I used to like marshmallows. Not anymore' 'Oh my god, this is brilliant. Why you never lie to your Mom!' comments one. 'Oh, honey. Wait till you find out this... is actually a real thing in some parts of South India. I had it. I wanted to hide my face and die,' writes another. Even a few men chimed in, with one commenting: 'I know nothing of this particular topic, but... I actually laughed out loud. Co-workers looking at me funny and everything.'","The video, titled First Moon Party, has amassed more than 1.8million views in only two days ."
"By . Mark Duell . A group of travellers have set up camp around a war memorial, with children reportedly seen clambering up the structure and a poppy wreath cast aside. A local Royal British Legion branch member hit out at the travellers near the Cenotaph in the Low Moor area of Bradford, West Yorkshire, saying he was ‘very disappointed’ at them. Despite initially agreeing to move on after claiming not to realise they were on a war memorial site, the travellers could still be seen on the site yesterday. War memorial: The Royal British Legion has hit out at the travellers near the Cenotaph in Low Moor, Bradford . Jeffrey Long, a member of the Bradford Central branch of the British Legion, said: ‘One cannot describe the feeling, really. What words can you say? ‘I am very disappointed, after they apologised and said they would move. The word is gutted - I really am gutted. I was so relieved they apologised.  I just have no time for them now.’ The travellers arrived on the site on Tuesday, when four caravans suddenly appeared. A man among the group, who would not give his name, said they had not known the significance of the memorial. He added: ‘When we were told what it was, we apologised. If we did know what it was we wouldn't have gone on there.

He said: ‘We were speaking to the cops and we apologised. We do have a bit of respect. We are keeping the kids away from it and we are going later on. We are keeping it quiet and clean.’ Setting up camp: The travellers arrived on the site on Tuesday, when four caravans suddenly appeared . But Labour councillor David Warburton condemned the travellers, calling the move ‘disgusting’. He said: ‘I think it is absolutely . disgraceful. It is bad enough they go on council land, but council land . that is a memorial to the dead, people who have fought for this country, . it is absolutely disgusting. 'One cannot describe the feeling, really. What words can you say? I am very disappointed' Jeffrey Long, Royal British Legion member . ‘Clearly they have no morals, and no understanding and no care for people of this country or this area… It is a public nuisance. It is something we do not tolerate. ‘We thought it would have been a site that would have been safe. We have done lots of protection round local sites such as village greens - but we thought this would have been safe.’ Because of the traveller’s actions, locally-based Clayton Primary School and Nursery has been forced to postpone its summer fete, which was due to be held yesterday. One man claimed that none of the travellers could read or write, but insisted they would clean up any rubbish on the site before they left tonight . Defence: A man among the group said they had not known the significance of the war memorial . Headteacher Joanna Kurasinski said: ‘The school and the Parents, Teacher and Friends Association have taken the joint decision to postpone our summer fete until September 13. 'When we were told what it was, we apologised. If we did know what it was we wouldn't have gone on there. We didn't know what it was' Traveller . ‘The decision has not been taken lightly but we consider it to be in the best interests of the school community to ensure we have a successful event. We are continuing to work closely with the local authority to resolve the current situation as soon as possible.’ John Major, Bradford Council's assistant director for environmental health and regulatory services, said: ‘We are aware of these sites and will be visiting them. ‘If they are on council-owned land we will be starting the court process as quickly as possible to obtain a possession order to remove those camped on it.’ A council spokesman warned the court process could take up to ten days.","Royal British Legion branch member hits out at the travellers in Bradford .

"By . Mark Duell . An unemployed chef won £2,500 after betting £5 on Germany to beat Brazil 7-1 in the World Cup. John Moore, 28, of Woodford, east London, claims he had a ‘premonition’ the day before Tuesday’s semi-final match and had ‘the numbers one and seven in my head’, before deciding to place the bet. The aspiring DJ and Arsenal fan claimed he had received signs such as the time on the clock being 17:17 and a package being delivered with ‘71’ on the slip - rather than his actual flat number. Winner: John Moore, 28, of Woodford, east London, claims he had a 'premonition' the day before Tuesday's semi-final match and had 'the numbers one and seven in my head', before deciding to place the bet . He said: ‘I had this premonition the day before and had the number one and seven in my head. There was a lot of signs, I remember looking at the clock and the time being 17:17. ‘[Also], we live in a block of flats and someone had put a note through the door saying we had a package to collect from the front desk - but they had put number 71 on the slip, not our flat number. ‘I like putting bets on big scores and this whole tournament I have been trying for 4-2s and 3-2s but I never thought the one I’d get would be Germany 7 - Brazil 1. ‘But when I saw the odds of 500-1 I thought “why not?”. I knew Brazil didn’t have Diego Costa and Neymar was out - I thought it was worth a punt. ‘And as an Arsenal fan I don’t rate David Luiz - and he was exposed in the game. (Chelsea manager José) Mourinho must be thinking he’s quids-in selling him for £50million.” Germany . swept aside Brazil in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday night to qualify for . Sunday's final against Argentina, and were astonishingly 5-0 up at . half-time - a scoreline they reached in just 29 minutes. Mr Moore even admitted cheering when Arsenal favourite Mesut Özil missed an eighth chance to keep the score only at seven in the second half of the match. And when Brazil snuck in a 90th-minute consolation goal, Mr Moore said he must have been the only person in the world in carnival mood.

Moore - who had the biggest win in Britain on a correct score bet for . the game - said he was planning on spending his winnings on a street . food business as well as buying some DJ equipment. A . Paddy Power spokesman said that three other people had correctly . predicted the score, adding: 'A 7-1 prediction was a long shot - but John definitely deserves to take a bow for that one now.' However, Mr Moore was not the biggest UK winner on the game, after Formula 1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone made a profit of £14,250 after betting £15,000 on Germany going through at 19/20. According to the Daily Mirror, the delighted model, 30, later tweeted: ‘Think it's safe to say my investments for tonight are safe!’ In addition, online gambling website Betfair said three English gamblers had correctly predicted the 7-1 score and won a total of nearly £6,500 from only £6.50 of bets. But a spokesman said: ‘I feel sorry for the punters who had £31 at 999-1 on 7-0 Germany.’ Meanwhile, a student in Altrincham, Cheshire, staked 80p on Germany taking a 5-0 advantage into the break at odds of 300/1 and claimed £280 for their troubles. A William Hill spokesman said: '5-0 was such an improbable scoreline that someone probably placed the remaining 80p in their account in hope rather than expectation on the most unlikely of halftime scores, but that punter is now £280 better off.'

All wrong: Some 121,026 bets being placed with William Hill, but not one managed to predict the correct score . Despite 121,026 bets being placed with William Hill, not one managed to predict the correct score. The spokesman added: 'It’s the first time since 1999, when we introduced online betting, that not one William Hill punter has predicted the correct score in a football match.' But some people got carried away in the middle of the game, with a Coral spokesman revealing one online punter placed a £2 bet on Germany winning 13-0, when they were 6-0 up, at odds of 300-1. Elsewhere, a Brazilian woman Anna Guerra, 44, won her office sweepstake after successfully predicting that Germany would thrash Brazil 7-1. The artist only came up with the idea of betting on that scoreline because her sleep-walking husband told to her to when she confronted him. 'He said Germany,' said Mrs Guerra. ‘I asked him what the score would be and he said ""7-1"".’ The woman scooped around 200 Brazilian real (£55) from her colleagues for her 10 real bet.","John Moore, 28, of Woodford, east London, says he had 'premonition'

"By . Richard Spillett . A teenager severely burned in a house fire which killed her father has said she has forgiven her stepmother who deliberately starting the blaze. Josefina Vilela was lost both of her legs below the knee and part of her left arm after the fire at her home in Walsall, West Midlands in 2011. The blaze - which left Josefina with 60 per cent burns and killed her father Carlos - was started by her stepmother, Georgina Vilela, who has since been jailed for murder. Josefina, who was just 14 years old when the fire took place, spent 18 months in hospital and has since learned to walk again using two prosthetic legs. But despite the horrific events which tore the teenager's life apart, she told this week how she has now forgiven her father's killer. Scroll down for video . Josefina Vilela had both legs amputated at the knee and lost part of her left arm following an arson attack by her stepmother on her West Midlands home in 2011 . Josefina's stepmother, Georgina Vilela (left), was jailed for a minimum of 23 years for the arson attack, which killed Josefina's father, Carlos (right) Josefina, now 17, said: 'Although she took a very special person away from me, my dad, I don't want to lose a second's happiness by hating her. 'I feel sorry for her. She destroyed her own life, I've moved on with mine. I hold no grudge against her. She has claimed the life of a man who was dearest to me but I forgive her. Horrific: The blaze left Josefina with 60 per cent burns . 'She has lost everything including her freedom and her family but I have the love of my sisters and that is all that matters. 'I don't really think about the negative side of what has happened to me. I am so glad to be alive and I just channel everything into the positive.' Stepmother Georgina is currently serving a minimum 23-year jail term for murder and arson with intent to endanger life. She poured petrol over Carlos as he lay in bed and the resulting fire quickly engulfed the house where then-14-year-old Josefina and her three sisters were asleep. Josefina told how of her forgiveness on the day she was reunited with the fire crew who saved her from the burning building. The inspirational teenager wept as she was given a bouquet of flowers by firefighters at Walsall Fire Station earlier this week during a visit organised by sisters, Maise, 24, and Carina, 16. She said: 'I've been wanting to meet these men ever since the night of the fire to tell them how amazing they are. They saved my life. They are my heroes.' Firefighter . Rob Hamer, who was one of the team who brought the teenager out of the . house, said: 'It was one of the worst house fires I've been to. 'Josefina . was wrapped in a duvet when we found her, you couldn't tell how bad her . burns were at the time. Our main priority was to get her breathing . again. She's made a fantastic recovery.' His . colleague Carl Warburton added: 'We never get people coming back to . thank us so this has been a bit overwhelming for us too.' Josefina was this week reunited with the Walsall fire crew who saved her life and called them her 'heroes' She wept as firefighters, who said the fire was one of the worst they've attended, told of their joy at seeing her . Josefina says she now hopes to compete in the Paralympic Games in either swimming or track and field. She said: 'I have become an ambassador for sports for young people and want to show people that, no matter what happens to you in life, you can go on and achieve things and live life to the full.' In court two years ago, her HIV-positive stepmother, Georgina Vilela, was described as a wife with a terrible 'temper'. The court heard she had suffered from depression and felt 'like an incomplete woman' as a result of not being able to bear her husband children. Josefina's three sisters escaped the building with less serious injuries. Josefina's stepmother poured petrol on her father in frustration at not being able to bear children .

"By . Richard Spillett . Wayne Ronayne has resigned as Mayor of Gosport after he was barred from the town's pubs over a row . A mayor has been forced to step down after he was banned from all his town's pubs following a alcohol-fuelled row on his first day in the job. Wayne Ronayne quit as Mayor of Gosport, Hampshire after he and partner Paula Carter, both 54, were barred from every local pub. It comes after he and Ms Carter were caught up in a row in a bar just hours after he took office, when the mayoress allegedly threatened to get a Wetherspoon's pub 'shut down'. He announced his resignation just 40 days into the job, after being barred from the town's 36 pubs, bars and taverns. Ronayne is believed to be the first mayor in the town's history to leave the civic position before his year-long term was up. He denies any wrongdoing and blames social media for his damaged public profile. Ronayne said: 'My decision is not based on any admission of wrongdoing or my inability to undertake the role. 'It is based on the now-damaging public perception of me that has been vigorously generated by certain members of our community. 'I do not wish to bring the position of the mayoralty into disrepute nor tarnish the good reputation of Gosport.' Tory councillor Ronayne was given a six-month ban by local organisation Pub Watch, and his partner, Ms Carter, was barred for 12 months after police were called to a pub on June 4. Speaking at the time, Stephen Brown, duty manager of the town's Nelson's pub, said: 'Ms Carter said to me ""do you know who I am?"", I said ""no, I don't"" and she said ""I'm the mayoress of Gosport I can have you closed down"".' Ronayne and mayoress Paula Carter were asked to leave The Star pub before he was banned from other bars . Ronayne, pictured celebrating his election with Tory colleagues, has denied any wrongdoing over the row . The pub manager added: 'I politely said she still wouldn't be coming in, she was clearly drunk and then continued to be rude and had to be dragged away by one of the other members.' Gosport Pub Watch defended their action to bar the former Royal Navy warrant officer. Chairman Phil Cox said: 'Everybody is treated the same. People need to be treating licensees and staff with respect. 'But we don't expect the mayor of Gosport, who represents our town, to be involved in incidents like this.' Ronayne will remain as a councillor on the town council. Lib Dem rival councillor Peter Chegwyn said: 'He's done the right thing and the public will recognise that. But he should have done this a month ago.' After continuing in the post for 40  days, he says he is resigning so as not to bring the 'mayoralty into disrepute'","Mayor and mayoress involved in argument shortly after he was installed .

"By . Richard Spillett . Joyce Sale was hit with a £70 fine after stopping her car outside a school for just seven seconds . A grandmother of six was hit with a £70 fine by her local council after stopping her car outside a school for just seven seconds. Charity worker Joyce Sale, 71, from Birmingham, West Midlands pulled up on zig-zag lines outside a school in the city as she searched for a parking space. She has been left furious after her seven-second stop led to her being filmed by a nearby CCTV van and sent a parking fine. Mrs Sale, who does charity work for the Birmingham St George's Day Association, had been trying to drop leaflets off at St Benedict's School to promote a musical event. She didn't even turn her engine off or get out of the car as she peered past the school gates through her driver-side window. She said: 'I had barely stopped the car. It was pouring with rain and I was just looking to see if there was somewhere to park on the school grounds. 'I am responsible driver, and because it was pouring down with rain I just wanted to have a look and see if there was anywhere I could park. 'A passerby kindly tapped on my window to notify me that a council van was filming me, so I waved and then moved on. 'It was all over in a few seconds - and now I've been left with a huge bill. 'When I found out I had been fined I was appalled - it's just another way of churning money.' Mrs Joyce wrote to Birmingham City Council asking for them to waive the fine, but the widow lost her appeal at an independent hearing. She said: 'It is ridiculous - because I stopped for such a tiny amount of time, I would have hoped the council would have the decency to waive the fine. A video of the incident taken by the CCTV van shows Mrs Sale's car outside the school at 12:02 and 21 seconds . After looking inside the school gates for a place to park, she then pulls away just seven seconds later . 'Anyone can see it is ridiculous and I argued my case because of the principle. 'I will admit that I stopped outside the school, but if you look at the incident as a whole, it is truly unnecessary and ridiculous. 'If people don’t challenge these fines on the principle, what else will the council try and get away with?” A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: 'Drivers have the right to appeal against any notice they feel is issued unfairly. In this case, that process has been followed and the notice has been upheld. 'We would also point out that the safety and wellbeing of those travelling to and from schools is paramount and that parking restrictions, including zig-zag lines, are important safety measures.'

"By . Richard Spillett . Foxes and hounds are supposed to be sworn enemies, divided by years of hunting history. But nobody told these two creatures, who have been getting on like a house on fire since they started living under the same roof. Like a real-life version of the animals in Disney cartoon The Fox and the Hound, they became best of friends after both being adopted by a family in Cornwall. Scroll down for video . Best of friends: Fox cub Forrest and family pet Barney have become close pals after they were both adopted by Gary Zammit, a wildlife ranger at Feadon Farm near Redruth, Cornwall . Cartoon: Their story mirrors that of The Fox and the Hound, where fox Tod and hound Copper become friends . Fox cub Forrest was taken under the wing of Gary Zammit, a wildlife ranger at Feadon Farm near Redruth, Cornwall, after he was found lost in a puddle earlier this year. A touch of rivalry might have been expected between the young fox and the family's pet dog, Barney, but the pair have become the best of friends. Mr Zammit said: 'It really was love at first sight with them both. Barney is so . gentle with him and they play for hours and hours. They are exhausting . to watch.' Both the animals were adopted by the family after being found seemingly abandoned, and, amazingly, both are missing their tails. Mr Zammit added: 'I think they might be kindred spirits - even without tails to wag you can tell they are happiest when they are together. 'It’s . excellent news as Forrest will never be able to go into the wild now. We plan to give him a home here at the farm with our other foxes. Playmates: The unlikely friends spend hours together playing and scrapping in Mr Zammit's garden . Catch me if you can: Barney chases little Forrest during one of the creatures' games of chase . 'The more time he spends with Barney and with us at home the easier it will be for him to fit in.' The fox cub's lack of tail led staff at Penmellyn Vets in St Columb Major, Cornwall, to give him his name, 'Forrest Stump'. Commenting on hiow he was found, Mr Zammit added: 'He was . in an awful state when they found him and it was touch and go for a long . time. 'A fox this young can go downhill very quickly, so he needed round . the clock care. It’s a bit like having a new born with night time feeds and constant attention.' The pair are now popular with visitors to the neighbouring Gwel an Mor resort, which runs wildlife activities for tourists. The story almost perfectly mirrors that of 1981 film The Fox and The Hound, in which a young fox is adopted by a family and befriends a neighbour's dog. Ouch: Forrest - who like Barney was found missing his tail - nips at the much bigger dog as they play .

"By . Richard Spillett . Parents have slammed ITV for showing a graphic scene from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes during the semi-final of the World Cup. Football fans were left shocked after the clip - which showed a computer-animated chimpanzee viciously shooting a man with a machine gun - was screened during a half-time ad-break. The trailer for the new film was shown after the 9pm 'watershed', but upset viewers said they had let youngsters stay up late to watch Holland play Argentina and thought the advert was 'inappropriate'. Scroll down for video . ITV viewers have hit out at the channel after an advert for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, in which a chimpanzee shoots a man, was screened during an advertising break in the World Cup semi-final . The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) today confirmed it has received more than 100 complaints from TV viewers. Many also took to Twitter to criticise the channel for screening the trailer. Mother Claire Reidlinger posted: 'Furious at @ITV for shocking my children (and me) last night. After 9pm maybe, but during the football?? Poor show.' Colin Bridgford ‏tweeted: 'Is it me? I thought the 1st promo Ad on @ITV of Rise of Planet of Apes was completely inappropriate & unacceptable. Kids watching Football!' And Sean Cleaver wrote: 'Just seen an ape gun down a man in cold blood in an advert mid-football. I know it's post 9pm but that's horribly misjudged and awful!' In the clip, the monkey is shown performing acrobatics as it enters a room where two armed men are sitting on a sofa. After . drinking with them and smiling, the animal suddenly turns angry, . picking up a machine gun and firing at one of the men, killing him. The advert ends with the ape pointing the gun at the other man, who is shown pleading with the creature to spare him. The advert encouraged viewers to go on Twitter and give their opinions on what they had seen . But the stunt backfired when many hit out at ITV for screening the trailer when children were watching . Many website users said the violent images of a murderous chimpanzee would give them nightmares . Some suggested the footage glamourised guns and should have been banned under advertising guidelines and one woman said her child had difficulty sleeping after unwittingly seeing the commercial. But other website users backed ITV for showing the advert, joking that it was more exciting than the football, which remained nil-nil for 120 minutes before Argentina won on a penalty shoot-out. A spokesman for the ASA said today: 'I can confirm that we've received around 100 complaints overnight about the TV ad for the film Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which appeared on ITV yesterday at around 10pm. 'Complainants are concerned that the ad shows an ape grabbing a gun and shooting a man with it, during the broadcast of the World Cup semi-finals, which children would have been watching. 'We're logging these complaints, we'll access them before making a decision as to whether we will investigate or not.' ITV have yet to comment on the controversy.

"By . Richard Spillett . Tackling 'accentism' - discriminaton against people with regional accents - is as important as the fight against racism, ageism and sexism, it has been claimed. Prejudice against certain accents is the 'last taboo', according to Manchester University linguist Dr Alex Baratta, who says people are made to feel 'fake' when they have to 'posh up' while talking. Dr Baratta is calling on employers to promise that job applicants' accents will not be used against them in the same way as gender, sexual orientation, religion, age and race are ignored. He said: 'We should acknowledge that any form of workplace discrimination, to include accentism, should not be tolerated in a society which seeks to be more inclusive. 'This is why ""accentism"" should be taken seriously as a problem which affects many of us. 'Clearly, most people modify their accent not because they lack pride in it, quite the opposite in fact. 'It's actually because they fear the negative perceptions others might have of them if they don't.' Dr Baratta, who is from originally from Los Angeles, added: 'George Bernard Shaw's said; ""It is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him."" 'I don't know if one prejudice is better then the other, you're the wrong colour, the wrong sex, wrong age, wrong accent.' His call to battle accentism comes after his research showed many people feel they have to change the way they speak to fit in. Though accent modification is common, Dr Baratta said it can threaten the way we feel about personal identity, often causing anger and frustration. Meetings at work with 'posh' sounding senior managers, he says, can be especially stressful for an individual with a more pronounced regional accent along with job interviews and even speaking on the phone, he said. Research shows people with strong accents feel they've 'sold out' if they change the way they speak at work . Dr Baratta's research is based on an ongoing survey of children, students and staff from different institutions and schools. It reveals that while most people accept the practice and accent modification, a third of respondents say they feel like a fraud when they consciously change the way they speak. Though accent modification and the relationship between accent and identity are well researched, it is the first time anyone has attempted to investigate how accent modification in Britain affects the way we feel about ourselves. George Bernard Shaw's claim that 'It is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him,' is still true, according to one academic . Dr Baratta added: 'Many Brits consciously modify their accent in social situations as a means to create a better impression. 'While this is a common practice, we should not assume that it is accepted by all speakers without issue. 'As part of my ongoing research, many participants see accent modification as synonymous with selling out and a clear threat to their sense of self. 'This is especially true in education, where teachers in particular may feel pressure to modify their regional accent in order to be perceived in a more positive light by students and fellow staff alike. 'My point is perfectly illustrated by an Ofsted inspector who last year told a Cumbrian teacher working in a Berkshire school to sound ""more southern"".' Examples revealed by Dr Baratta's research include a teacher from Rossendale, Lancashire, who 'felt disgusted' with himself for modifying his accent at a job interview, a Mancunian woman who felt 'fake, angry and upset' for modifying her accent with her lecturers, and believes she is 'betraying' who she really is, and a Liverpudlian who stated that accent modification, mostly practised in business contexts, leaves him feeling 'whipped'.","People with strong regional accents feel pressure to 'posh up', study reveals .

"By . Richard Spillett . One of the most prestigious five star hotels in Britain has been hit by smash and grab robbers for the second time in four weeks. A gang of six men on three mopeds pulled up outside the Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair, central London, in the early hours of this morning before three of them smashed their way through the front door and broke into display cabinets. The luxury venue was hit in exactly the same way last month, when watches and jewellery were stolen in what police called a 'well-planned' heist. London's famous Dorchester hotel in Mayfair was hit by its second smash and grab raid in four weeks . Screens were put up at the site on Thursday as workmen moved in to repair damage caused by a gang of six men . In today's robbery, the thieves all fled the scene within minutes and no one has yet been arrested. Detective Sergeant Mark Staples said: 'We continue work towards establishing those responsible for carrying out not only the robbery which took place in the early hours of this morning but the robbery which took place last month. 'We have yet to make arrests in relation to either incident and we urgently require the support of the public with providing us with any information no matter how small. 'There may be people who know who is responsible and I am keen for those with any information to come forward and assist us with our investigation.' Police have yet to reveal the value of items stolen but it is thought it could run into many thousands of pounds. A guest at the hotel on Park Lane, said: 'I woke up early, so I went down to the lobby at about five, maybe six in the morning. 'There was quite a bit off commotion. Police were there and speaking to the staff and it looked as if a few things had been smashed.' CCTV images from the raid in June show hammer-wielding robbers in motorbike helmets leaving the hotel . During the first raid in June, three of the gang were spotted waiting outside the hotel on their bikes . She added: 'Apparently, one of the doors had been smashed but it was being cleared up and their was a screen around it. 'We . had been told that there was an incident, but nobody was hurt and the . police had it under control. But I spoke to another guest who said the . people who smashed it were driving mopeds, or motorbikes.' A spokeswoman for the hotel said: 'We can confirm there was an incident at the hotel early this morning and we are assisting the authorities with their inquiries. 'The hotel security team were quick to respond and no-one was hurt. The comfort and security of our guests and staff is our top priority.' On June 10, a gang of six men pulled up on three mopeds outside hotel at around 1.30am. On that occasion, they smashed five glass display cases in the foyer and stole watches and jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds. As the gang escaped last month, one of the bikes hit a 25-year-old woman in nearby Cambridge Circus, leaving her with leg injuries that required hospital treatment.","Gang raid Mayfair's Dorchester hotel, stealing goods from display cases .

"By . Richard Spillett . Channel Tunnel services have returned to normal after operators repaired around half a mile of overhead power lines in the tunnel. Passengers have endured two days of delays and cancellations after the overhead problem led to the breakdown of a French-bound shuttle train at around 7.30am yesterday. This led to evacuation of nearly 400 passengers, plus four dogs, who were taken on to France by another shuttle train via the service tunnel. Scroll down for video .

Eurostar said passengers who had a . booking on a cancelled train could exchange their ticket, free of . charge, for another available service within the next four months. Meanwhile, thousands of people on domestic services were late for work today because of a rail track defect, just 24 hours after Network Rail was fined for missing punctuality targets. Packed trains into Waterloo station in London were delayed because of the problem at Surbiton in Surrey. South West Train station services from Surrey were among those disrupted. There were also delays to CrossCountry and London Midland services in the West Midlands due to a broken-down train. It came after 382 passengers were forced to walk down a service tunnel after their train broke down . The incident blocked one of the channel tunnel's two tracks yesterday, throwing travel plans into chaos . The Channel Tunnel is about 40 metres below the sea bed, has two main tunnels and a central service tunnel connected to both. The south tunnel goes from France to the UK and the north from the UK to France . The south tunnel takes trains from France to the UK and the north tunnel from the UK to France. A smaller service tunnel runs between them and is connected to both at 375 metre intervals. This allows access for maintenance and emergency services and also serves as a safe haven if . passengers need to be evacuated from their train in an incident. In order to deal with blockages, the two main tunnels are each split into three 'intervals'. These . are designed in a way which means that if a train breaks down inside, . services can still run through the length of the tunnel. The tunnel's interval system allows trains to pass through even when one tunnel is blocked . This . is possible because the Channel Tunnel has two undersea crossovers . allowing trains to pass from one tunnel to the other to avoid and . isolate a section of tunnel that is blocked. Yesterday, almost 400 people were walked from interval two in the north tunnel . into the service tunnel and then into a train waiting in interval one in . the the south tunnel. The . train then used a crossover to take it back into interval four and then . along the correct tunnel that nearly always takes services to France. Trains from France to Britain have been taking the same route for ninety . minutes but are then forced to wait as trains from Britain to . France do the same, causing the delays.","Power line problems in the tunnel had led to second day of disruption .
Eurostar services from London had experienced one hour delays .

"By . Richard Spillett . and Andrew Levy . An unemployed couple who live off benefits with their 13 children have had hundreds of fish killed in their garden pond in a suspected grudge attack. Tim Fisk, 44, and Mandy Ball, 41, first attracted attention last year when their council house was combined with the one next door to create a seven-bedroom home. Last month they appeared in a television documentary where Mr Fisk threatened to have another child just to spite critics who accused them of sponging off the state. They have since complained of being subjected to verbal abuse and death threats because of their taxpayer-funded lifestyle. Scroll down for video . Tim Fisk says the fish pond at his family's six-bedroom council house has been poisoned in a hate campaign after his local authority were forced to knock two homes together to accommodate his brood . And it has now emerged that someone managed to break into their back garden in Ipswich, and poured a toxic chemical into their ornamental fish pond – killing 300 koi carp. The attack happened during the night of July 1, just eight days after the family appeared on Channel 5 programme Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole. Mr Fisk said: ‘The children went to play around the back garden and they saw all the fish were dead. Someone had chucked a load of bleach in my pond. ‘I just started crying because I love my fish. It’s disgusting to take it out on the poor fish. I’m upset about it and the children are as well.’ Mr Fisk has claimed that the fish were paid for when he worked as a security guard – and said he refused to be intimidated, adding: ‘I’m going to stand my ground. I have got a few more children – so what?’ But a neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It’s wrong for anyone to kill innocent fish but you have to wonder how someone on benefits can afford to keep 300 koi carp.’ Angry locals launched a petition to stop Mr Fisk and his family receiving the massive taxpayer-funded home . The father . of 13 insists that he is still unable to work as he has to care for his . 15-year-old son Daniel, who is blind in one eye and has learning . difficulties, and his partner Miss Ball, who suffers from depression. The . couple currently receive £53,000 in child tax credits, disability . living allowance, carer’s allowance, housing benefit and council tax . benefit every year. They . live with Sadie, 16, Daniel, Lauren, 13, Callum, 11, Kyle, ten, Elektra . Mae, five, Serenity, four, Jayden, three, Starlight, two,  14-month-old . Neatheus and Satin-Tia, seven months. Their . oldest daughters Charlie, 20, and Ashley, 18, have now moved out. During . the documentary, Mr Fisk said he was not going to be ‘dictated to and . told how many kids you can have'. The family, some of whom are pictured on holiday in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, say they've been abused after appearing in Channel 5 show 'Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole' He added: ‘Do you know what? I . think I’ll have another one.’ He also complained that the council had . not moved them to alternative accommodation while the £36,000 worth of . building work was being carried out. But dozens of locals have . petitioned Ipswich council to complain about the house, which also has . two bathrooms, a games room and a wet room. Police have been informed . that the fish were worth £1,000 and said they were treating the matter . as criminal damage. A Suffolk Police spokesman said: ‘It is believed . that a chemical substance was put in the pond water. As a result, 300 . koi carp died.’ He added: ‘There were bubbles on top of the water, . indicating that a chemical had been added. We are investigating and . appealing for any witnesses.’ According to members of the British Koi Keepers Society, koi carp can be bought for as little as £10 each in bulk, but for rarer varieties, owners can pay up to £20,000. An avid koi keeper in Malaysia recently paid around £180,000 for one fish, thought to be a record. To build and fit a fibreglass pond with heaters and filters can require as much as £15,000 and the extra cost of water and electricity to keep the pond heated and clean can put around £800 to £1,000 on top of owners' bills. Unheated pools cost less to maintain, but can still see water bills rise by about £400 a year due to the cost of changing 10 per cent of the water once a fortnight, as is recommended. The fish also need to be fed, with 15 koi eating their way through around £100 of pellets a year. The water should also be treated with medication, which costs around £50 to £100 a year.","Tim Fisk and his family sparked anger by getting six-bedroom council house .

"By . Richard Spillett . A mum who released a harrowing picture of her son as he lay dying from a legal high is spearheading a campaign get the shops which sell them closed down. Jimmy Guichard, 20, suffered a heart attack and severe brain damage within hours of taking one of the herbal rushes. His mother Karen Audino made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life-support machine after he was found unconscious next to an empty plastic bag from controversial shop UK Skunkworks. As part of her campaign to shut down shops like UK Skunkworks, she then released a photo of her son's last moments in hospital to show the damage the drugs can do. The mother-of-three now wants authorities to enforce trading laws which force shops to know the ingredients of the drugs and the dangers they pose. The mother of Jimmy Guichard released his  heartbreaking picture of her son last October. She hopes it will highlight the damage that so-called legal highs can do to those who take them . Karen Audino, pictured with Jimmy and daughter, Sam, is now heading a campaign to get authorities to enforce trading laws which could crack down on sale of the dangerous drugs . It would be the first time in the UK that current customer laws have been tested and could force sellers to clearly display all ingredients on packets or face closure and possible prosecution. Ms Audino, 42, said: 'Anything that protects people and stops families like mine from being torn apart by these so-called legal highs is a good thing. 'I don't believe any of these products are safe and now that Medway Council is telling these shops that they must operate within the law I hope it will go some way to forcing their closure. 'My son's life just slipped away and that is something I want no other mother to have to go through. 'It's terrible that people can just go into a shop and buy these products as easily as sweets or a newspaper. 'I hope the action taken today will help put an end to these awful products. They destroy lives and destroy families.' Jimmy Guichard, pictured with his niece Zoe, six, was found unconscious next to an empty plastic bag from controversial legal high shop UK Skunkworks . Keen sportsman Jimmy, who had applied to join the army, had recently moved from Ireland to Gravesend, Kent to care for his cancer-stricken father Martin. He bought the legal high from UK Skunkworks shop in Chatham, Kent, on October 2 last year and was found collapsed on his bed at home in nearby Gravesend just hours later. He regained consciousness after a heart attack but his brain swelled causing bleeding and severe brain damage. His mother, a fast food restaurant manager, dashed from Ireland to be at his hospital bedside and he was pronounced dead on October 3. Legal highs bypass drug laws by being sold as 'not for human consumption' and are often advertised as plant food or research chemicals. They are designed to flout drug rules by possessing chemical compositions that differ from those already prohibited. Jimmy's mother wants trading standards to close down shops which sell the drugs under existing laws . But now trading standards officers have said the products could be restricted by the General Product Safety Regulations 2005. The legislation prohibits any unsafe product from being supplied to members of the public. It means to comply with consumer law traders must know precisely what is in each of the products they sell and what risks are associated with the ingredients. Ms Audino's campaign has already had an effect, with Medway Council in Kent sending letters to the 14 legal high shops in Kent setting out checks distributors should complete before selling legal highs. On Sunday three legal high shops in the area were raided and samples were seized. Trading standards officers hope to discover whether the shops are following the new guidance. If they are not, the council could seek court action to see the items withdrawn from sale and ultimately force the shop's closure. Trading standards officer Ian Gilmore said: 'We want the shops to know that we are prepared to take robust enforcement action to ensure they are operating within the law. These are not legal highs, they are lethal highs.'","Jimmy Guichard, 20, died in hospital within hours of taking a legal high .

"By . Kate Lyons . Created: . 20:42 EST, 24 June 2014 . Ex-employees have slammed the safety practices of the tour company that conducted the bushwalk at a popular tourist destination in central Australia, which resulted in the death of a UK backpacker two weeks ago. A 23-year-old British woman was killed when she fell 30 metres at Kings Canyon, 450km west of Alice Springs, while doing the rim walk with The Rock Tour. It is believed she fell while posing for a photograph at the edge of the canyon, though the specific circumstances of the incident are unknown. Scroll down for video . The Rock Tour conducted the walk at King's Canyon that resulted in the death of a female backpacker two weeks ago. One of their guides is pictured here leaning over the cliff edge next to a warning sign in August 2013 . Left: a tour guide holds a tourist over the edge in November 2013. He previously worked for The Rock Tour, but had left the company at the time this photograph was taken. Right: two tourists pose at the spot in February 2014 . Former employees of The Rock Tour in central Australia have told MailOnline that the company has a reputation for being 'cowboys' and that 'it was only a matter of time' before a death like this happened. Their criticism comes as photos have emerged of tour guides skylarking at the edges of Kings Canyon – posing close to the edge and standing on small ledges above 50 metre drops. Adam Cooper, who was a tour guide with the company from March 2011 to April 2012 and returned in March 2014 for five weeks, said he left the company this year because of concerns about their safety practices. He told MailOnline that at Kestrel Falls, the area of the walk where it is believed the woman died, walkers regularly pose on a thin ledge, only a metre wide, above a 50 metre drop. 'There's actually a bit up near the waterfall where... guides encourage people to take a photo off the ledge, it's so dangerous, if you fell that'd be falling 50 metres,' he said. Three tourists pose on the ledge, above a large drop at Kestrel Falls in the rain. The photo was posted to The Rock Tour Facebook page on April 12 this year . A tour guide pretends to stomp on the head of a tourist as he stands on the ledge above a large drop . Numerous photographs of The Rock Tour guides and walkers posing on the ledge or posing close to the edge of the canyon, even in the rain when the sandstone would be slippery, have been posted to the Facebook pages of The Rock Tour guides, and some have been posted to the company's Facebook page. They have since been taken down by the company. Managing director of The Rock Tour, Rob Cowan stated that photographs are uploaded to the company's Facebook page by employees and the page is regularly monitored by company management. Whenever management sees a photograph depicting inappropriate behaviour they remove the picture and talk to the guide in question, he said. 'We have a three-strikes-you're-out policy,' he said and commented that two of the tour guides depicted in the photographs obtained by MailOnline had since been fired or encouraged to leave the company. Adam Cooper added: 'I'm not surprised there's been a death on the tour. Rock Tour has a really bad reputation out there.' He claimed that tour guides at the company were given limited training – shadowing another guide for only three tours before they are sent out on their own. The itinerary guides follow is also unsafe, he said, with guides required to drive hundreds of kilometres each day and conduct physically demanding walks on five hours sleep each night. The Rock Tour is based out of Alice Springs and has been operating tours in the area since 2007 . A tourist (left) and a Rock Tour guide (right) poses on a ledge while doing the Rim Walk at Kings Canyon . Another former employee of The Rock Tour, who preferred not to be named, told MailOnline that the company 'operated like cowboys' and staff were 'encouraged to be party animals'. He said when he worked for the company last year he had conversations with management about their safety practices but 'it was laughed off'. 'We would never laugh off any concerns about safety,' Rob Cowan told MailOnline. 'In eight years of operation we have taken over 3,200 tours to Uluru, that's in excess of 82,000 people and until June 15 we were yet to have a fatality,' he said. He disputed the claim that his company is unsafe as the allegations of 'disgruntled ex-employees.' Mr Cowan said that guides at the company received excellent training, completing four training trips, and receiving a Certificate III in tour guiding, their senior First Aid certificate and a light rigid vehicle license before they were sent out alone. He also disputed Mr Cooper's claims about the safety of the itinerary. 'Nowhere during the itinerary is there a five-hour sleep. If there is a five-hour sleep it's because the guide's not doing the right thing,' he said. On May 8, a Rock Tour bus tipped on its side while travelling on sand at Curtin Springs. 21 people were on board but no one was injured. Police investigated the incident but said that there was no sign of negligence from the company. The Rock Tour operate three-day tours from Alice Springs that take travellers to Kings Canyon, Uluru and Kata Tjuta.

"By . Kate Lyons . Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan was sentenced to four years in jail in Texas for a string of offences . The executive whose false CV caused Myer to hire him in a senior position also fooled several other leading Australian retailers who met with him about jobs. Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan, was fired from Myer on Monday, on his first day as general manager of strategy and business development after the company discovered he had lied on his resume. He claimed he had held the position of managing director and vice-president of Asia Pacific for Inditex, the Spanish company that owns popular fashion chain, Zara. However, Inditex contacted Myer on Monday, just hours after Mr Flanagan started work at the company, to inform Myer that Mr Flanagan had never worked for them. It has since been revealed by the Quest Personnel, the recruitment company that introduced Mr Flanagan to Myer, that several other retailers met with him on the strength of his falsified resume. 'Mr Flanagan was interviewed at length by several leading retailers, all of whom were interested in employing him,' Lorrain Tribe, managing director of Quest told MailOnline. Mr Flanagan was interviewed by the recruitment company several times and transcripts of those interviews were sent to Myer. Quest also conducted reference checks, contacting local and overseas referees. It is unclear how Mr Flanagan fooled Myer, Quest and the other companies interested in employing him. The Australian Financial Review reported that Mr Flanagan seems to be from Searcy in Arkansas and to currently live in Melbourne. Myer hired Mr Flanagan as general manager of strategy and business development and he began working for the company on Monday, but was fired before the end of the day . Myer CEO Bernie Brooks was not the only one to be fooled, several other companies considered Mr Flanagan for roles at their companies on the basis of his falsified resume . Last night Mr Flanagan resigned from a volunteer position assisting the board of the Nunawading Swimming Club in Melbourne's east. His nine-year-old son Christopher swims at the club and Club CEO Gary Barclay said Mr Flanagan was 'just a regular dad'. 'His son swims here, in October last year he put his hand up to volunteer to help us with the strategic plan,' he said. 'He's volunteered his time, he's helped out with the club. He put his hand out to help in a specific role.' Mr Barclay said that Mr Flanagan's resignation was his decision. 'We wouldn't have asked him to step down. He called within half an hour of us becoming aware of [Mr Flanagan getting fired from Myer]. There wasn't time to have a conversation.'","Andrew Flanagan was fired on his first day in a senior role at Myer .

"By . Richard Spillett . Headteacher Anne Lakey leaves Durham Crown Court today after the jury in her sexual offences case failed to reach a verdict . A jury has failed to reach verdicts in the trial of an acclaimed headteacher who was accused of having sex with a 13-year-old in the late 1980s. Anne Lakey, 54, from Stanley, County Durham, denied four counts of indecent assault and two of indecency with a child which were said to have happened when she was in her late 20s. The jury, which deliberated at Durham Crown Court for 10 hours, was discharged by Judge Christopher Prince after failing to agree verdicts. Prosecutor Caroline Goodwin indicated that the Crown would be seeking a retrial. The complainant, who was not one of Mrs Lakey's pupils, wrote an accusing email to her school in December 2012 after he came across a web page on which she said her aim was to give young people the best start in life. That led him to write that she was a 'disgusting sexual monster' who had sex with him when he was only 13. The school called in the police and she was suspended from her role. He claimed they played a dare game at her home and she allowed him to fondle her breasts. Later, he chatted to her as she bathed, he told the jury, and after one such occasion he said they had sex while he was still in his school uniform. The alleged victim said their relationship continued for several months, and claimed she rang his school, pretending to be his mother, when he played truant to be with her. The prosecution alleged Mrs Lakey, who was then a history teacher at a school in Sunderland, groomed the boy, who was one of a group of teenagers who would visit her marital home. Mrs Lakey, who has been married to her husband David for 20 years, strongly denied all the allegations against her and thought the accusing email was a hoax when she heard about it. The mother-of-one told the jury: 'When I was first made aware, it was just utter disbelief. It was not true, therefore (I was) shocked and horrified.' She could only speculate that the complainant’s motive was to gain compensation. Mrs Lakey, who was described to the jury as a 'visionary' school leader, denied the allegations . Prosecutors told Durham Crown Court (pictured) that they may apply for a re-trial at a hearing next week . A character witness said Mrs Lakey had been described as a 'visionary leader' by the Department for Education after she oversaw massive improvement at one school. Paul McHugh, a national educational leadership consultant, said he met Mrs Lakey in 2006, when she had recently taken over Fyndoune Community College in Sacriston, near Durham. He said: 'The school went from failing for three years to being one of the most improved in the country. 'I put that down to the drive of Mrs Lakey and the senior team. She was described in a DfE (Department for Education) pamphlet as a visionary leader and that is certainly the way I see it.' Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of education, said she was 'inspiring' and she was appointed on the National Leaders of Education body which helps struggling schools. After the judge discharged the jury, Miss Goodwin told the court: 'It is likely there will be a retrial. I’m not going to make that decision today.' Mrs Lakey was told the case will be back before the court next Friday, when the CPS decision will be announced. She said 'thank you' to the judge as she left court.

"By . Jennifer Newton . This is the touching moment a kindergarten teacher gave a heartwarming graduation address to his first ever class and stunned them by breaking out into song. Jeff Berry began his kindergarten teaching career 13 years ago in 2001, just two days before the 9/11 attacks. His first ever class remained so important to him that he was invited to Lawrence High School, New Jersey to give the graduation address as some of the students from that group were receiving their diplomas. Scroll down for video . Kindergarten teacher Jeff Berry, who was invited to give the graduation address at Lawrence High School . Mr Berry taught some of the graduates and were in his first ever class at the start of his teaching career in 2001 . During his speech he fondly talked about his first days as a teacher standing in front of the young students and how what they learned in kindergarten can also help them in adult life. But what the audience didn't expect was for Mr Berry to break out into song, singing 'Kindergarten Wall' a strangely fitting song for the occasion by John McCutcheon, which reminds youngsters to 'share everything' and 'play fair'. Mr Berry starts his speech by recalling how when the children first started at kindergarten 13 years ago, they still tattled on each other, cried and some didn't even listen to direction. He also reminisced how some of the children would 'openly pick their noses with an amazing sense of purpose' much to the delight of the audience. During his speech and much to the delight of the audience, Mr Berry broke out into song giving a rendition of the song 'Kindergarten Wall' But he explained that much of what the graduates would have learned in kindergarten still applies in adult life. He said: 'These are just simple truths that remind us all how we should conduct ourselves, whether we are 6, 16, or 60. 'Share everything. Play fair. Don't hit people. Be aware of wonder. Remember that little seed in the paper cup? He accompanied his song with the actions as the graduates gathered clapped and cheered their former teacher . 'First the roots grow down and then the plant grows up?' Mr . Berry then amazes the audience and starts to sing the 'Kindergarten . Wall' song with the graduates gathered clapping and cheering as he . breaks into song. During . the tune he evens demonstrates the actions, by pointing at the audience . before inviting them to join in with the last chorus. He . then finishes the song with a clap in the air, before saying: 'God . bless you all and congratulations', while he is applauded and cheered by . his former students. Kindergarten teacher Mr Berry, singing 'Kindergarten Wall' at the Lawrence High School graduation ceremony . When I was a little kid not so long ago, I had to learn a lot of stuff I didn't even know . How to dress myself, tie my shoes, how to jump a rope, how to smile for a picture without looking like a dope . But of all the things I learned my favourite of them all, was a little poem hanging on the kindergarten wall, . Of all you learn here remember this the best, don't hurt each other and clean up your mess, . Take a nap everyday, wash before you eat, hold hands, stick together, look before you cross the street, . And remember the seed in the little paper cup, first the root goes down and then the plant grows up! Well, it was first, second, third grade, fourth grade, too, where I had to learn the big things the big kids do . To add, subtract, and multiply, read and write and play, how to sit in a little uncomfortable desk for nearly half a day . But of all they taught me my favorite of them all, was the little poem hanging on the kindergarten wall . But lately I've been worried as I look around and see, an awful lot of grown-ups acting foolish as can be . Now I know there's lots of things to know I haven't mastered yet, but it seems there's real important stuff that grown-ups soon forget .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A highway department worker who rescued his girlfriend's cat which was stuck up a tree has been sacked after using his town's bucket truck to save the pet. Jim Mackie, the highway superintendent of Phillipston, Massachusetts went to the aid of Jackie Prime, whose ginger cat Kaboodle, was stranded at the top of a tree in her backyard in nearby Westminster in May. Ms Prime had called the town's fire department and several tree companies but they were unable to help free Kaboodle. Jim Mackie, who has lost his job as a highway department worker after using his bucket truck to rescue his girlfriend's cat . At a last resort she called Mr Mackie, who used a town of Phillipston fire truck to bring down the cat, who scampered up the tree during a storm. But during the rescue, the truck became stuck in the muddy garden and Mr Mackie summoned another highway worker in a dump truck to free the vehicle. A complaint was then filed against Mr Mackie for using Phillipston town equipment in Westminster on non-official business. He was suspended on two week’s pay and was effectively fired after the Board of Selectmen chose not to re-appoint him as highway superintendent. The cat, called Kaboodle, became stuck at the top of a tree after bolting from the house after being scared by a storm . Mr Mackie told CBS Boston: 'I was just trying to help her out — period. Nothing more. Nothing less. I would have done the same thing for any Phillipston employee.' Ms Prime says she only called her friend after becoming exasperated after nobody would help rescue her pet and can't believe it cost him his job. She added: 'I reached out to a friend. I never thought it would cost him his job. Mr Mackie's girlfriend, Jackie Prime, pictured, who said she only asked for his help to rescue the cat after the town fire department couldn't help . 'I just can’t believe they would derail a man’s life over something like this. If this is just about a cat then the punishment doesn’t fit the crime.'

"By . Jennifer Newton . Robert Downey Jr was well aware of his son's struggle with drug addiction and has tried everything to help him, according to a family friend. Now Downey is making sure Indio Downey is getting the treatment he needs. Indio chas entered a rehab facility in Malibu following his arrest for possession of cocaine on Sunday. The 20-year-old was pulled over in his car by the L.A. County Sheriff's deputy while driving in West Hollywood. The illicit drugs were found during a search of the vehicle. Devoted dad: Robert Downey Jr. has placed his son in a Malibu rehab center. He says he  believes that Indio will conquer his addiction . The Iron Man star's son was booked in L.A. County jail and released early on Monday morning on $10,250 bail. Downey has since issued a statement, thanking the police for their intervention, while expressing the belief that his son can be a 'recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale.' According to sources, Indio is receiving treatment for drug addiction at Cliffside in Malibu. Indio has been to rehab in the past but a family friend says they are hopeful the treatment he will receive at Cliffside will work. 'Bob not only knows about Indio's struggles, he's tried everything, as all parents do, including kicking Indio out of the family home, followed by boundaries and tough love. None has worked,' the friend explained. The 20-year-old was pulled over in his car by the L.A. County Sheriff's deputy while driving his car in West Hollywood and was arrested for possession of cocaine . 'Cliffside may work because it's got an approach that Indio will hopefully not resist. Indio is his father's son. They both don't go for controlled orders about praying to a 'god' for help and the 12 steps, the way Downey sees it, is requiring you to believe in God, and though both Downeys may believe, they don't want it forced on them for sobriety purposes. Cliffside uses a different model in it's attempts to help addicts recover that does not involve the 12 steps. Billed as Malibu's exclusive alcohol rehabilitation program and drug rehab center, Cliffside says it teaches patients to 'Live the Life You Were Always Meant to Live' Past celeb patients include Lindsey Lohan. The center offers 'cutting-edge, evidence-based, life-saving, holistic treatment in a luxury estate setting', run by 'industry leading professionals'. Each patient is given a dedicated therapist 'helping you uncover the deep underlying issues that caused addiction in the first place, and healing your mind, body and spirit along the way' 'That's why Bob put Indio in Cliffside,"" says the friend. But, and there's a big 'but' here, Indio didn't go into rehab completely willingly. 'His dad's lawyers are insisting in hopes of a plea bargain when court time comes. This means that since Indio is not choosing to get clean on his own but is somewhat forced to, the sobriety may not stick.' The friend added that Indio has been using drugs for eight years but hasn't been able to stay clean. 'Indio's been using drugs and hard drugs as well for eight years so there's been a million interventions and conversations and threats and AA meetings and sponsors. The list goes on. In 2005, Indio appeared in his father's 2005 film 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' when he was 12-years-old . 'None of it took, for the simple fact that Indio enjoys getting high and he found no compelling reason to not get high. It hasn't effected his health yet, and he's never going to find himself homeless, penniless and on the streets so the boy hasn't hit the preverbial 'bottom.' 'It's a tough road and Bob kicked Indio out of the house a few years ago, on the tough love principal, and that didn't work, either. So we'll see.' After his son's arrest Downey issued a statement, thanking the police for their intervention, while expressing the belief that his son can be a 'recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale.''Unfortunately there’s a genetic component to addiction and Indio has likely inherited it. 'Also, there is a lot of family support and understanding, and we’re all determined to rally behind him and help him become the man he’s capable of being,' the 49-year-old actor said. Indio is the son of Downey and his ex-wife Deborah Falconer, left, pictured in 2007. The couple split in 2001 . But according to the family friend its now up to Indio to give rehab a go. 'Bob doesn't feel guilty. He knows Indio is doing this by choice. 'I can promise you that Bob is blessing those arresting officers because he knew that the only way to help his son at this late stage is for law enforcement to intervene and for Indio to get into the legal system. 'Bob also knows that if it takes jail time for Indio, so be it. Right now, Bob bailed him out, put him in a $45,000 a month rehab in the Malibu hills, and has given his son the leg up he needs to either make it or break it on his own. Now, it's up to Indio.' Downey's reps did not respond to requests for comment.","Indio Downey has entered Cliffside rehab facility in Malibu .

The 23-year-old told officers that she put the medication in his water and juice, eventually giving him more than a bottle of the eye drops, according to her arrest affidavit. Both children became sick earlier this year, with the older boy requiring several visits to hospital. At one point he was airlifted to hospital by the emergency services because his pulse had become dangerously low. Doctors at the Hershey Medical Center in Pennsylvania suspected the child had been poisoned and tests found the substance in the three-year-old's urine. Ms Unger lived in Orrtanna, outside Gettysburg at the time but has since moved across the state line to Thurmont, Maryland. The 23-year-old told officers that she put the visine eye drops water and juice . Her public defender did not return a phone message left on Tuesday. A judge set bail at $50,000 two weeks ago and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for later this month. Adams County District Attorney Shawn Wagner said Ms Unger was not charged with attempted murder because that requires an element of intent. Mr Wagner explained: 'We could not show that intent, given her actions in this case.'

"By . Christian Gysin In Valparaiso . and Jennifer Newton . He has been to war zones, flown helicopters and been known to enjoy a late night party. But to one family in Chile, Prince Harry will always be known as the man who fixed their telly. On a visit to a slum outside the former capital, Valparaiso, the Prince showed his practical side by mending the family’s television just in time for them to watch the Brazil v Chile match in the World Cup. Scroll down for videos... Prince Harry is shown the devastation left by forest fires in Valpariso, which burned down many homes in the poorest area of the Chilean city . The prince has tea with some of the residents who lost their homes in the fires. One shows Harry a picture on his phone of the devastation left by the disaster . Prince Harry joked and laughed with well-wishers who turned out to greet him when he visited a fire station in Valparaiso, Chile today . Crowds gathered outside the fire station in the west of the country to greet the prince, who was clearly delighted with the reception he received . The Prince was in the village of El Vergel, one of the many slums that cling to the hillsides overlooking the city, to see how the community is being rebuilt following a forest fire in April that destroyed nine in ten of the self-made homes. The charity Techo is helping the villagers to build new homes out of chipboard and corrugated iron, and inside one of the shacks, home to Coca Perez, 50, and her teenaged son and daughter, the Prince noticed their television was not working properly. 'He looked at it and he started to fiddle with the cable,' said Mrs Perez. 'He managed to get it working so we could watch Chile playing Brazil later. Now I can tell everyone that Prince Harry is my TV repair man!' Outside, the Prince looked at the thousands of blackened tree stumps on the sides of a valley that runs beside the slum, and was told that Techo had reinstated electricity, installed portable toilets and communal water tanks so the villagers have access sanitation. He told Mrs Perez: 'The worst seems to be over and now it’s just a case of waiting.' During his visit to the fire station Harry met with firefighters, who were also laughing along with the prince . Harry was introduced to firefighters from the 11th Fire Company, which included British volunteers . Prince Harry doesn't forget the younger well-wishers who turned up to greet him as he bends down to shake their hands through the safety barriers . A lady in the crowd presents Harry with his very own beer-shaped hat in the national colours of Chile while the prince greets the crowds at a fire station . The Prince looks pleased with his brand new hat in the shape of a beer tankard, but stopped short of trying it on for size after being presented with it . Mrs Perez replied: 'We just have to wait and be patient. We have no choice.' The Prince was shown around the slum by Pia Mundaca, 24, the social director of Techo, who explained that 10,000 people had been affected by the fire, including 20 per cent of all those living in slums. A total of 15 people were killed, though none died in El Vergel. In the first house the Prince visited, Carolina Guzman, 33, became emotional and wiped away tears as she recounted the day the fire swept through her community. She chatted with the Prince for 10 minutes in her cramped two room home with her son Gerald Perez, aged seven. She said: 'My husband was on another hill and I phone him and said should I leave but he said 'no don't worry the fire is on the other side’."" But the flames arrived at the settlement and she had to shout for help to move her father-in-law who is bed-ridden. Still smiling and joking, Prince Harry lines up alongside some of the volunteer firemen who work from the fire station in Valparaiso . 'I yelled and four of my neighbours came to help move him out. When my husband arrived our home was burning and he tried to put out the flames on our son's bed but we had to leave. 'I feel really moved to have met Harry and thankful and happy. I feel like crying.' The Prince then went to the home of Adriana Jimenez Castillo, 58, who lives with her husband and 18-year-old granddaughter. Because the hut is so much smaller than their original home, just 15ft x 12ft, it is crammed full of possessions donated to them by local charities. Mrs Castillo told the Prince: 'We lost everything in the fire. All we could save was the dog and a handbag with our identity papers in it. 'I had saved up 2.5 million pesos (£2,500) to buy new living room and kitchen furniture, and I lost it all in the fire.' The Prince asked: 'If the government built new houses somewhere else, would you move?' She replied: 'No, because this is my home, I have lived here for 38 years. Even if they built me a palace I wouldn’t want to move.' Earlier in the day, Prince Harry didn't disappoint the crowds who came to see him on a trip to a fire station in the city of Valparaiso. Last night, Prince Harry gave a speech at a Queen's Birthday Party event at the British ambassador to Chile's residence in the capital Santiago . Fiona Clouder, right, the British ambassador to Chile hosted the party, which was in honour of Harry's grandmother the Queen, whose photograph is behind the prince . The prince mingled with the various guests invited to the party, taking time to chat to them. He even had a joke, left, with members of the Chilean military . There he met firefighters at Valparaiso fire station, who were involved with dealing with devastating forest fires. And crowds gathered outside the station in the west of the country to greet the prince, who was clearly delighted with the reception he received. Harry appeared to be relaxed as he joked with the well-wishers who turned out catch a glimpse of the prince as he shook hands with many of them. He even bent down to shake hands with children through the safety barriers who were at the front of the crowd. The prince was also presented with his very own beer-shaped hat in the traditional red, white and blue colours of Chile and looked to be happy with his new gift. Harry was then introduced to firefighters from the 11th Fire Company, which included British volunteers as well as representatives from the city's other fire services and members of the British community in Valparaiso. His visit to Valparaiso comes after he attended a Queen's Birthday Party in Santiago last night hosted by the British ambassador to Chile at her residence. During his speech, Harry joked that he would be speaking in English, as his Spanish wasn't so good and wished Chile well for their World Cup last-16 match against Brazil today. On his arrival at the party, the Prince met with Chilean fireman. He even took time out to inspect one firefighters medals that were pinned to his chest . The prince travelled to Santiago, the capital of Chile, after a four day visit to Brazil earlier in the week .","Prince visited the coastal city of Valparaiso on day two of a three-day trip to Chile after visiting Brazil .

Although the roads look empty, they are well travelled and are often used by truck drivers. In order to get his shots, Mr Salvans decided to disguise himself when taking the images.

In this photograph, a woman stands on a roundabout, hoping that she will stop passing traffic . Some might assume that it is a thing of . the past for a sex worker to aimlessly walk up a busy highway in hope of . someone pulling over. However many sex workers still wait for their next customer on deserted roads, which can often leave them in unsafe hands. Mr Salvans explained: ""The tragedy is not so much in the fact of prostitution, because if you decide to be a prostitute and you can control with which clients and the environment in which you work, and the rates you wish to charge, that is your own decision. 'But these girls don't even decide, and the tragedy is in the environment in which they work. They are absolutely unprotected.'

"By . Jennifer Newton . Lying in a bridal gown friends gather around the open casket of a teenage AIDS victim in the sewers below Bucharest. Catalina collapsed and died in the tunnels below the city last week and friends and family came to pay their last respect to the 18-year-old, who was dressed in a wedding gown, as is the custom for Roma girls who die before they marry. The extraordinary pictures of her wake and funeral procession in the underground tunnel system, which is home to a gang of drug addicts, were captured by Channel 4 News reporters Paraic O'Brien and Jim Wickens. The reporters exposed the underground world in the Romania in a film last month, but they returned to city following the death of Catalina, a drug addict who featured in the report. This is their story. Victim: People gather around the coffin of 18-year-old Catalina, an AIDS victim, who died in the underground tunnels of Bucharest . Last respects: Friends gather around the casket of Catalina, who is dressed in a wedding gown, as is custom for Roma girls, who die before they marry . Burial: A small crowd, weeping and placing flowers over the casket surrounded the final resting place of Catalina as her coffin is lowered into the ground . Deep beneath the streets of Romania’s capital, a living hell exists. The last time we met Catalina had been underground, deep in the Bucharest tunnel system that Bruce Lee and his gang of homeless drug addicts call home. She was in the queue to buy drugs, perched on one of the heating pipes in front of an icon of the Virgin Mary. The ring of infected syringe sores around her neck a jagged reminder of her drug-addicted life in the sewers. 'This is where I destroyed myself', she had told us almost prophetically that day. She featured as one of the main characters in our film broadcast on Channel 4 News last month. A story that has shocked over two million people who have viewed it around the world and has ramped up the pressure on authorities charged with managing Romania’s homeless youngsters. Catalina, before her death, who featured in a Channel 4 News report exposing the underground world beneath the streets of Bucharest . Fellow inhabitants of the sewers hold up a picture of the 18-year-old, who was born into acute poverty and abandoned by her parents as a baby . Over two million people watched the original film on Romania's homeless youngsters and the authorities are facing pressure to do more for those in the underground world . Mourners taking part in Catalina's funeral procession led a slow march to through Bucharest to Gare du Nord . The mourners carried photographs of Catalina, as well as a cross and religious imagery during her funeral procession . But it is . too late for Catalina. She is dead. She collapsed and died in the . tunnels last week after suffering from AIDS, chronic pneumonia and heart . failure which cut short her painfully short life. She had just turned . 18. Channel . 4 News was invited back to Romania and to her wake. We were ushered . through the cobble stones and courtyard, past children playing in the . dust and adults weeping by the door of the tiny tin roofed shack. Catalina . lay in the open casket veiled in a bridal gown, as is custom for Roma . girls who die before their wedding day. A priest stood to one side, . chanting prayers as her sisters stood over her, fussing over the veil, . or rearranging her beloved pink CD player that they had stuffed under . her pillow, music to keep her company in the grave. During the procession, mourners stopped at the at the sewer entrance, which led to the place she once called home . The sewers are home to hundreds of homeless people, with many HIV positive and drug addicts . The so-called 'king of the sewers' Bruce Lee, right, attended Catalina's funeral with his head painted in Aurolac, a bright silver paint that the addicts sniff . Authorities in Bucharest say Bruce Lee has been removed from the city several times by the police but keeps on returning faster than the police return to take him away . As the . candles flickered late into the night, Catalina's friends began to . arrive in the house, familiar faces from her home in the tunnels coming . to pay their last respects. We . found Eliza, one of Catalina's best friends whom we filmed joking . around in the tunnels weeks earlier. 'We met in a foster house named . Pinocchio. I hanged out with her everywhere. She was like a sister to . me,' she told us tears streaming down her face. One . of five siblings born into acute poverty, Catalina's parents had . abandoned her as a baby, sending her to live in a children's institution . on the edge of Bucharest, for the first years of her life. It was a factor we were told later by the head of the institution that had impacted deeply upon her life, a lifetime lacking in love that had drawn her deeply into life within the sewers. Bruce Lee and the tight knit gang underground she said had become the family Catalina had never had. 'For her getting some attention was an extraordinary experience,' said Carmen her sister, 'because now she felt valued in those moments. She was happy if anybody was looking out for her or giving her any attention,' she said. The underground world of homeless people living in the sewers and tunnels beneath Bucharest was exposed by Channel 4 News last month . Everyone living in the sewers is HIV-positive and a quarter have TB, yet they are left to rot in the darkness, huddling against heating pipes and sniffing glue to stay warm . Some even keep pets such as this dog in the tunnels, even though there is barely enough room for all the people living beneath the city . The procession of mourners continued to stream in, silent faces, clutching her hand, kissing her forehead, whispering their goodbyes. The following morning, the day of Catalina’s funeral, it was the turn of Bruce Lee – the self-styled 'King of the Sewers'. Never shy of a spectacle, he arrived barefoot with his head painted in Aurolac, a luminous helmet of bright silver paint that the addicts sniff. A stark reminder of the crazed drug-infested atmosphere where Catalina had died. A window was removed from the house and the coffin was pulled out amidst wails and mournful chaos. Carried in the back of an open transit van, a small gaggle of mourners led a slow march to the Gare Du Nord, stopping at the sewer entrance, the hole she had once called home. For a hearse, a black transit van. Then a procession through the city, where the pallbearers were drug addicts. Many of the drug addicts sniff . a metallic paint called Aurolac and the smell of the substance is overpowering in the tunnels . One of the underground residents inspects a needle ready to inject containing a synthetic drug similar to methadone . The same sewer entrance we had disappeared into weeks earlier appears empty. Nobody stirred until her sister calls down into the tunnel: 'Catalina is here, this is where she lived with you, come and see her for the last time.' Gradually they begin to emerge, weary-eyed in the bright light above ground, clutching Aurolac bags to steady their nerves. A gaggle of diseased and destitute individuals who have lost their way in life, gathering around the body of one of their own who had lost her life. We followed the group to the funeral where Catalina’s coffin was lowered into the ground. A small crowd surrounded her coffin, weeping and placing flowers over the casket. Her family she was torn from as a baby and the homeless family that had welcomed her in - briefly united in a moment of tragedy. The next day we interviewed Cosmina Nicolescu, the Director General of the Social Assistance in Bucharest who told us: 'For them life no longer matters. They are outcasts, renegades that are avoided and they are primarily lacking love and understanding.  It wasn't their fault that they were born into this situation, or that they ended up in this situation.' The homeless and drug gangs enter the underworld via a hole in the pavement on a traffic island in front of the station . We asked why more wasn't done to intervene before Catalina's death: 'As far as we know from the tunnels she didn't want to be brought in the daylight. Her dying wishes, to die in the place where she had found family.' Ms Nicolescu says that they can't close the tunnels, for fear of pushing the vulnerable people who find sanctuary underground, into ever-more precarious places and situations. But she claims that Bruce Lee is banned from Bucharest, and has been removed several times before by the police. He just keeps on returning faster than the police return to take him away. Today the tunnels alongside Bucharest's central station remain open for both business and sanctuary, attracting youngsters like Catalina, who struggle to exist at the very bottom of Romanian society. Drug addiction and premature death the price paid for those who choose to live underground. Watch 'Catalina: A Life Lost in the Tunnels of Bucharest' in a special report on Channel 4 News tonight at 7pm. The leader of the underground world, Bruce Lee, pays protection money to a local gang and also says addicts are less likely to die down in the tunnels because he offers them a sort of safety .","Drug addicts paid their last respects to Catalina, an AIDS victim who died in the underground tunnels below Bucharest .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A dog has found a group of unlikely admirers in the form of four amorous ducks who can't help but follow his every move. The animals' owner Ulrike Kersjes from Berlin says the four male Indian runner ducks have fallen in love with her pet Labrador retriever Miedosos. She says that whenever the rowdy ducks see the shy dog, they immediately bundle on top of him and try to mate. Scroll down for video . Two of the rowdy ducks can't help but bundle on top Labrador retriever Miedosos in their hunt for puppy love . There's no escape for Miedosos as the four ducks follow the dog wherever he goes, much to his bemusement . Miedosos only wants to have a quiet lie down in the sun but there's no chance of that when the four amorous ducks are on the loose . But despite their unwanted affections, Miedosos takes it in his stride remaining calm with infatuated birds. Ms Kersjes said: 'The ducks are so in love with the dog, it can be exhausting for him sometimes. 'But he's very patient and calm, so most of the time there is no stress - except when they try to steal his bone.' The dog looks less than impressed with one of the ducks attempting to climb on his back, especially as he is trying to enjoy chewing on a bone . The pets' owner Ulrike Kersjes says she sometimes has to rescue her dog by bringing him into the house or to the other side of the garden, so he can get some peace . When Ms Kersjes first introduced then then ducklings to her dog in her suburban home, she was scared loyal Miedosos might have harmed then. But after their initial meeting, it soon became clear that it was Miedosos who had the real reason to worry, as with no females for company, the ducks turned to him for love. The 49-year-old added: 'Some of them jump onto Miedosos' back while the others go for his bone. But despite having to constantly fend off their attention, Ms Kersjes believes they are good friends really and all love each other . 'Sometimes we even have to rescue him by bringing him into the house or to the other side of the garden. 'After a while they stop, but when they are ready again they quack to each other and start to plan new things to bug the dog. 'But now they are good friends. I think they love each other.'","Four Indian runner ducks are infatuated with golden Labrador Miedosos .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A senior British military figure has branded the UK's 2003 invasion of Iraq 'a cock-up we will be living with for the next 50 years'. Major General Julian Thompson, who commanded Plymouth-based 3 Commando Brigade during the 1982 Falklands War, spoke out as Isis militants seized three cities in Iraq and seem to be heading towards the capital Baghdad. And Major General Thompson says he blames UK politicians for the 'complete mess' in Iraq and now fears for the future. Major General Julian Thompson, pictured,  says he blames UK politicians for the 'complete mess' in Iraq and now fears for the future . Major General Julian Thompson led 3 Commando Royal Marines during the 1982 Falklands War. He is pictured with his family at Buckingham Palace . The 79-year-old said: 'Iraq was a strategic error of gargantuan proportions. I was against us going in from the very beginning in 2003. 'I didn't say so at the time with the boys going in but it was wrong. 'The effects of what we did will be felt for a very long time. 'It was not the right thing to do. This was not a military cock up, it was a political cock up. And it is a cock up we will be living with for the next 50 years. The Major General says Tony Blair, pictured with former U.S. president George W. Bush, is guilty of getting us into a position we shouldn't have got into . 'Saddam Hussein was not a nice guy but he kept the lid on extremism. ‘He held the balance of power between the Iranians and the Arab World.’ ‘People are far worse off now than they were when he was there. I don't care what Tony Blair says, these people are not better off. Blair is guilty of getting us into a position we shouldn't have got into.’ The deepening crisis in Iraq has prompted U.S President Barack Obama to say last night that he wouldn't 'rule out anything' as he searches for ways to help the ailing Iraqi army push back the terrorist horde. Major General Thompson says former Prime Minister Tony Blair, pictured with troops in Basra, Iraq in 2006, is wrong when he says people in Iraq are better off . But Major General Thompson believes it wouldn’t be wise to intervene in the country again. He added: ‘We will not go back in - at least I certainly hope not. We couldn't sort it out the first time, we'd just make it worse if we went back. ‘Rather like a disease we need to rope it off do it doesn't affect us. We have to be cold blooded. Our security must come first. ‘However sorry we may be for the people of Iraq, there is nothing we can do. We do not want to reinforce failure.’","Major General says he blames UK politicians for the 'complete mess' in Iraq .

His girlfriend at the time, McDonough 20, is the key witness against her ex and has already been sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty in a plea agreement to charges including witness tampering and hindering the investigation. Yesterday, Strafford County Superior Court in Dover, New Hampshire, heard that McDonough witnessed Mazzaglia strangle Miss Marriot but didn't get help or call the authorities because she was scared she would come to harm. According the Union Leader, she said that there were so many weapons in the apartment she shared with her ex-partner, she knew he knew how to fight. But public defender Joachim Barth, who is representing Mazzaglia, told the court: 'Your instincts for survival did not prompt you to scream out the open window as you stood in front of it ... Your instincts for survival did not prompt you to try to get the attention of neighbors directly across the river.' The court was also shown a video of McDonough during a visit to Mr Barth's office in the days after Mazzaglia was arrested, while the pair were seeking legal representation. Defense attorney, Mr Bartha, holding up a picture of the alleged crime scene, questioned McDonough at the trial yesterday . It shows McDonough describing the sexual activities that took place on the night of Miss Marriot's death, and she demonstrated how she touched her. However, during the trial, she has denied having any sexual involvement with Miss Marriot on the night she died saying she lied to Mr Barth to protect Mazzaglia. Mr Barth then attempted to clarify if Miss Marriot lied in the video and to investigators but was now telling the truth. She replied saying: 'It’s just me trying to tell the truth as best I can.' Earlier in the trial, McDonough denied she was controlled by multiple personalities after Mr Barth said she had a real problem and had five voices in her head. He told the court McDonough was secretly recorded telling a friend that the night Miss Marriott died one of the personas took control and McDonough blacked out. Seth Mazzaglia, who has been charged and is on trial for the first degree murder of Miss Marriot . Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriot was allegedly raped and strangled in October 2012. It is thought her body was dumped in the river but it has never been recovered . But on cross-examination, she disputed that her reference was to the night Marriott died. She said that she told Roberta Gerkin that the persona was taking over during that conversation and blocking her memory. She has also said that she had lured Miss Marriott, her co-worker, to the apartment with the promise of watching a movie or playing a video game. In reality, McDonough testified, she was offering Miss Marriott as a sex partner for Mazzaglia, who was angry that McDonough had left him alone for 12 days. Searches of the Piscataqua River have taken place to try and locate Miss Marriot's body but nothing has ever been found . Miss Marriott had transferred to the University of New Hampshire only weeks earlier to major in marine biology. She had been in a committed relationship with Brittany Atwood, who lived in Massachusetts. On the night she died, Miss Marriot text messaged Miss Atwood minutes before 9pm to let her know she was going over to 'Kat's' to watch a movie. Atwood testified she was happy for her because she was finally making new friends. The text message was Marriott's last communication. Her body has never been found and prosecutors believe Mazzaglia and McDonough dumped it in a river.","Kathryn McDonough says she was scared to call for help after murder .

She complained constantly to forestry officials in Choraipung but her pleas to capture the animal fell on deaf ears. Ms Gogoi then decided to take matters into her own hands and come up with her own plan to capture the leopard. She then fashioned a cat trap using items from her around her house which managed to lure and trap the leopard.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A literary magazine launched a scathing Twitter attack on the CIA for its alleged use of 'torture' techniques just hours after the agency launched its first official account. The organisation sent its first tweet on Friday with a humorous post saying 'We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet.' But two hours later the official Twitter account of the New York Review of Books posted a succession of nine tweets taking the agency to task on accusations that they use controversial interrogation techniques. The New York Review of Books sent their first tweet, bottom post, just two hours after the CIA set up their official Twitter account . The first tweet, which was directed at the agency's twitter handle @CIA linked to a blog post on their website from earlier this year by David Cole, which discusses the CIA's alleged interference with a Senate torture investigation. What followed was then a barrage of eight posts fired off in quick succession linking to a 2007 report by the International Committee of the Red Cross, . The report was on the 'Treatment of Fourteen ‘High Value Detainees’ in CIA Custody', which came to light in 2009 in a New York Review of Books article by Mark Danner. The magazine's account continued to send the tweets in quick succession, linking to a report about the CIA's alleged use of torture . But despite their persistence, the CIA did not reply to any of the tweets, which take aim at the agency's alleged controversial history. The CIA launched the social media account on Friday and even though they were hesitant to reveal their identity, Twitter did it for them by verifying their account. The infamously secretive organisation then let hundreds of thousands into the fold at an astonishing rate. About 30 minutes after the account went live, they had 26,900 followers; that number doubled in the next 10 minutes and it continued to rise ever since. A total of nine tweets aimed at the CIA were sent but the intelligence agency did not reply to any of them . Robert B. Silvers, the editor of the New York Review of Books, which took the CIA to task on Twitter . They are currently sitting at 582,000 followers even though they have only sent three tweets. The social media account is just the latest attempt by the federal government to improve transparency within the nation's intelligence programmes. Their practices came under severe scrutiny last summer when consultant Edward Snowden leaked thousands of documents proving that the NSA was running a massive phone and email surveillance programme. The CIA launched their Twitter account on Friday as part of a government-wide effort to be more transparent . The White House approved the launch of a Tumblr called IC (Intelligence Community) On The Record last August as the first step in winning back some public support. That site, and the associated Twitter account, has been used to release documents and statements pertaining to news matters when they occur. Most recently, the NSA used IC On The Record to release the only email they claim to have from Edward Snowden, which theoretically contradicts a claim he made in a televised interview.","Magazines posts nine tweets in quick succession after CIA account appeared .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A British mother who was jailed in the Dominican Republic for killing her husband is back home in Britain today after she was let out of prison and jumped bail. Nicole Reyes from Rumney in Cardiff, was given a 12-year prison sentence in February for the voluntary manslaughter of her husband Jorge on the island in July 2012, after he died in a car crash. Her family in Britain raised the £62,000 needed for her to be released on bail and it was posted to authorities on the Caribbean island. Nicole Reyes, right, on her wedding day to Jorge. She was jailed earlier this year after being convicted of killing her husband in a car crash . But as they freed her without confiscating her passport, her friends in the Dominican Republic kept her in a safe house while they arranged for her to fly home. She is still officially on bail pending an appeal against her conviction, but now she is back in Britain, her family believe her ordeal is over. The 38-year-old, who has two children, has now been reunited with her family in Wales and was checked over by doctors after spending two years in a cramped cell with 15 other women. Her mother . Jeannette Clements, 62, who has campaigned tirelessly for her daughter's . release said it was the end of a 'hellish nightmare' for the family. She explained: 'We scraped bail money together from wherever we could - we borrowed from family and sold our furniture. Mrs Reyes' family in Britain raised the £62,000 needed for her to be released on bail . 'Nothing mattered as much as getting Nicole home. 'When we had the £62,000 we handed it over and waited. It was all in the hands of our lawyer and that was so hard. 'We waited for news and then finally heard that Nicole was free. 'She was taken to a safe house in the Dominican Republic while we organised her a flight out of there. The mother-of-two was being held at this prison in the Dominican Republic, where she spent two years before being released . 'She didn't have to hand over her passport or sign a form to say where she'd be. 'All the prison authorities wanted from us was the money.' Mrs Reyes was accused of deliberately running over her husband in her SUV as he rode beside her on a motorbike after a night out. But she claimed she accidentally hit his motorcycle as he swerved out of the way of an oncoming car in July 2012. Police arrived on the scene and are said to have told Mrs Reyes they would take her to hospital, but took her to a prison instead. She was facing 30 years in jail for murder but at her two-and-a-half hour trial in February, the charge was reduced to voluntary homicide and she was sentenced to 12 years in prison. But her family was told Mrs Reyes, who has a serious kidney illness, could still be freed on bail for a sum of £62,000 pending her appeal. Mrs Reyes mother Jeannette Clements, right, has campaigned to bring her daughter home. She is pictured with and Leah Jackson, Mrs Reyes' and her young son Antonio . Mrs Clements and Mrs Reyes' stepfather Mike, who live in Cardiff raised the money and she was let out of prison last week. She was reunited with her children Leah, 19, and Luke, 18, who had visited her while she was held in a 15 foot square cell on the holiday island. The former holiday rep has also become a grandmother since her imprisonment but had only ever seen pictures of her baby grandson. Her mother added: 'We got her through the door after midnight on Saturday and drank champagne together and cried tears of relief. 'I didn't want her out of my sight. I could hardly take it in. 'Seeing Nicole with her baby grandson for the first time was the most beautiful blessing. 'After a long and hard battle to get her home my mind is struggling to keep up. 'She's stood in front of me but I can hardly believe my eyes. Mrs Reyes first went to the Dominican Republic on holiday and later took a holiday rep job. She lived in this house with her husband Jorge . 'Two weeks ago she was curled up in a ball crying to me that she thought she was going to die. 'Now she is home we can get her the medical attention she has been so desperate for. 'I can't tell you what it means to me that she is back where she belongs. 'We are all walking around dazed, it feels like a miracle after the journey we've had."" Mrs Reyes first went to the Dominican Republic on holiday and later took a holiday rep job with Thomas Cook where she met Jorge, a 37-year-old coconut water salesman. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware that a British National has been released from prison in the Dominican Republic pending a further appeal. 'We continue to provide consular assistance.'","Nicole Reyes was convicted for killing husband Jorge in Dominican Republic .

Twenty firefighters along with police and an ambulance were called to Henley Bridge in Henley-on-Thames following a report that a lorry had crashed and spilled its load. A member of the public told the emergency services that 'chemical waste', which was 'bubbling' was covering the road outside the Angel on the Bridge pub, which overlooks the River Thames.

A recovery team was then dispatched to scrape the mashed potato from the road and hose it down. Mark Dunlop, landlord of the Angel on the Bridge pub, said 'It was a hell of a mess out there. 'It was obviously the worst place it could happen in the town, on the crossroads over the bridge.' To alleviate the traffic congestion, local boat firm Hobbs of Henley ferried about 100 stranded people across the river free of charge while the bridge was close. Pensioner Frederick Nead, 77, from nearby Charvil, got off a bus that was stuck in the traffic and walked half a mile to the river where he caught the boat. He said: 'I only came into town for some bread and they haven't got any!'","Lorry crashed in Henley-on-Thames spilling its load across the bridge .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A court in Egypt has sentenced 10 Islamist supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood to death for inciting violence and blocking a road. The men were sentenced in absentia at a court in the Nile Delta town of Banha following the incident last July. Judge Hassan Fareed, presiding over the court, referred the sentence to the Grand Mufti, the highest Islamic authority, which is a legal requirement usually considered a formality. Scroll down for video . Supporters of Egypt's ousted president Mohammed Morsi, who have been charged with violence pictured earlier this year. Today ten supporters were sentenced to death for inciting violence and blocking a road last year . The remaining 38 on trial in the case will be sentenced at the next hearing next month. Among them are Brotherhood supreme guide Mohammed Badie and former Brotherhood lawmaker Mohammed el-Beltagy. They also include Salafi preacher Safwat Hegazy and Bassem Auda, the supplies minister under the former president, who was overthrown by the military last year following massive protests against his year-long rule. The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's most well-organised opposition movement during decades of autocratic rule, was propelled to power by the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak. The 10 Islamists were supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, led by ousted president Mohammed Morsi, pictured . The trials are part of a fierce government crackdown in the months following Morsi's overthrow, during which the group was outlawed and then declared a terrorist movement. Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been killed in clashes with police, at least 16,000 have been detained by the military-backed government and hundreds referred to trial. Elsewhere, an appeals court today overturned the sentences given to four police officers over the deaths of 37 detainees, most of them Morsi supporters, Egypt's state news agency MENA reported. The prisoners suffocated in an overcrowded police truck where they had been packed for hours when the police threw tear gas canisters into the cramped space.

The court had handed a 10-year prison term to one officer and one-year suspended sentences to three in March, a verdict that outraged lawyers and families of the victims. The court said the case will be referred back to prosecutors and a retrial will be held after an appeal by the convicted police officers. It was the first trial and conviction of police officers in connection to a crackdown on Islamists since Morsi was ousted. Brotherhood supporters have witnessed a series of mass trials, the largest of which saw 529 sentenced to death in one session in southern Egypt. Under Egyptian law, those sentenced in absentia will have a new trial if they are arrested or surrender to authorities.

"By . John Hall . Accused: Ben Blakeley is on trial for allegedly murdering his ex-girlfriend Jayden Parkinson . A former binman has told a court that he deserves the death penalty for killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Ben Blakeley, 22, strangled 17-year-old Jayden Parkinson in countryside near Didcot, Oxfordshire, in December last year, shortly after she told him she was carrying his child. Days . later - with the help of a 17-year-old boy - Blakeley buried Ms . Parkinson's body in the established grave of his uncle in the nearby All Saints’ churchyard. Giving evidence at Oxford Crown Court, Blakeley told jurors: 'I deserve a death sentence for what I've done.' He also said that he relives the night he killed Jayden over and over again in his head, describing it like a 'video'. The jury heard that Blakeley was obsessive and controlling and after he and Jayden split. He . had threatened to post intimate naked videos and photographs of her on . Facebook - hoping that she would kill herself as a result, they were . told. Jayden was last seen alive with . Blakeley on the afternoon of December 3 last year in Didcot, . Oxfordshire, having met up to discuss her pregnancy. When . she had broken the news to Blakeley 24 hours’ previously in a telephone . call he became angry, denying he was the father, prosecutors allege. On December 19 her body was recovered from the grave of Blakeley’s uncle, Alan Kennedy, at All Saints’ churchyard in Didcot. In . the graveyard, Blakeley and his co-accused, who cannot be identified . for legal reasons, buried Jayden’s body in the grave of Mr Kennedy, who . died in 2006. Blakeley told the court he had dug two . shallow graves for Jayden - one in the countryside close to where he . killed her - and the second in the graveyard. Under . cross-examination from prosecutor Richard Latham QC, Blakeley said that . when he buried her the first time - two days after he killed her - she . was cold. Mr Latham replied: . 'She was more than cold, the body would have been stiff... There came a . time when you had to manhandle her into the hole the two of you had . dug.' Victim: Jayden Parkinson, 17, was last seen alive when she went to meet Blakeley to tell him she was pregnant. Blakeley buried Ms Parkinson's body in the established grave of his uncle in a nearby churchyard . 'Was the hole you dug the length of a body?,' Mr Latham asked. Blakeley replied: 'I can’t tell you the f****** size.' Mr . Latham said: “You were digging a hole the size and length of a grave... It was hard to dig, it was so hard to dig that you needed to enlist . (the youth) to help. It was a big undertaking.' 'What did you tell him [the co-accused] the hole was for?' The defendant replied: 'I said to him it was either for weapons or an animal... You are trying to get at that [the youth] knew.' 'He and Jayden were friends... I didn’t tell anybody... The very [first] person I told was my solicitor,' he said. '[The youth] was trying to help the police. He didn’t know nothing,' Blakeley added. Mr . Latham said: 'You were digging something the size of a grave and you . were doing it with (the youth) and to say you were doing it to bury . weapons or an animal is nonsense.” Blakeley . replied: “If you are trying to say that [the youth] knew about it, he . didn’t... I either told him it was for an animal or a weapon... That’s . the fourth time I have said it and I am not saying it again.' Blakeley, pictured arriving at court, said he deserves the death penalty for killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend . Mr Latham asked Blakeley how he was . able to get Jayden, who was 5ft 6in tall, into a large suitcase less . than 3ft in length and suggested he was going to do some 'dreadful . things to her body' to get her into the suitcase. 'There was no nice way of doing what I was going to do... There was no way of doing things respectfully, Blakeley insisted. Mr Latham said: 'You were capable of doing it... You had to ram her body into the suitcase.' 'When you got stuck on that track you rang for a taxi and you were as cool as a cucumber when that taxi driver turned up.' Blakeley said: 'I had to act normal.' Mr Latham said: “You are cold, calm and calculating when you want.” Blakeley . replied: “You said I was a cold, calculating killer... I think about . that night every day. I think about it in my dreams. I hear them . noises.' 'It’s like a video in my dreams... That means I’m not a f****** killer. Since I have been in prison I have met real killers.' The defendant also insisted that when he cried giving evidence last week, they were not 'crocodile tears'. 'I am not the type of person to cry. I am not a f****** woman,' he said. 'I . am responsible for all of this...That night is like a video in my head . and I see it and it doesn’t fade away. I just remember more f****** . detail,' he added. Blakeley, of Christchurch Road, . Reading, Berkshire, has denied murdering Jayden but has admitted her . manslaughter and attempting to pervert the course of justice. But the prosecution refused to accept his plea and he has now gone on trial alongside his 17-year-old co-defendant. The . youth has also pleaded guilty to attempting to pervert the course of . justice but denies a charge of preventing a lawful burial. A post-mortem examination found that Jayden died as a result of pressure to the neck. There . was also evidence of 'relatively widespread' areas of bruising to her . face and scalp which was indicative of being caused by a fist or foot. The teenage co-defendant in the Jayden Parkinson murder trial has said he was tricked into digging the 17-year-old's grave. The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told Oxford Crown Court that Ben Blakeley told him it was 'not relevant' when he asked why they were digging a hole above an established grave in the All Saints’ churchyard in Didcot. Shortly after killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Blakeley enlisted the help of the 17-year-old co-defendant to help bury her body in the same grave as his late uncle, Alan Kennedy. A court sketch of Blakeley and a defendant (obstructed by pole) who cannot be identified due to his age . Mr Steen, defending, asked the youth: 'How did he react if you asked Ben Blakeley his business?' The youth replied: 'He wouldn't tell me or say its not relevant.' He also told jurors that Blakeley told him he needed his help to tidy up Mr Kennedy's grave in time for Christmas. 'He said it was evil to dig in a graveyard so we have to do it at night and I didn't know anything about that, so I went along with it,' the youth said. 'I thought we were digging about an inch and put down some new stones and the next day Ben was going to take me to Abingdon to get a headstone.' The youth said he got one spade from a relative's house and Blakeley got one from a shed at a nearby allotment, along with some string and nails. Mr Steen asked: 'Did it occur to you you were digging Jayden's grave?' 'No,' the youth replied. Mr Steen asked: 'Would you have been prepared to dig a grave for Jayden?' 'No,' he replied again. The youth then told jurors that Blakeley left him to carry on digging and said would be back in 30 minutes.  But he took several hours and the youth said he became 'annoyed' and tried ringing Blakeley to find out where he was. Mr Steen asked: 'Did you have any idea that he was going to get a body?' 'No,' the teenager replied. Mr Steen said: 'The prosecution say you knew precisely what he was doing, that he was going to pick up a body. Would you have been helping if you had any idea?' 'No,' the teenager replied for a final time. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.

"By . John Hall . It is estimated that a billion people watched the World Cup Final last night, but the way they tuned-in varied massively depending on where they were based. From huge fan parks in Berlin and army camps in Afghanistan, to the war-torn back streets of Aleppo in Syria and entire communities gathered around a single television in the favela districts of Rio de Janeiro - the World Cup Final had a truly global audience. During the match, 32.1million tweets were posted relating to the clash between Germany and Argentina - with a surprisingly large number posted outside the stereotypical footballing hotspots of Europe and South America - proving once and for all that football the ability to bring the entire world to a temporary standstill, from expensive restaurants in the wealthiest cities, to run-down cafes in a war zone. Massive turnout: One of the biggest single gatherings anywhere on earth took place, unsurprisingly, in the German capital Berlin, where 250,000 fans came together to watch the match on huge screens in an area dubbed the 'Fan Mile', close to the famous Brandenburg Gate . Jubilation: Germany fans on holiday in Palma de Mallorca, Spain celebrate their nation winning the World Cup for the fourth time . One of the biggest single gatherings anywhere on earth took place, unsurprisingly, in the German capital Berlin, where 250,000 fans came together to watch the match on huge screens in an area dubbed the 'Fan Mile', close to the famous Brandenburg Gate. Flares illuminated the stage and sent plumes of smoke into the sky as Mario . Goetze took the ball on his chest and let fly inside the far post from a . narrow angle to win the match in its closing stages. Fans cheered, clapped and shouted, with . large groups of strangers hugging and jumping into the air together, . making so much noise the commentary on the large screens could no longer . be heard. 'We're . going to be world champions! We're going to be world champions!' yelled . the compere of the public viewing event, even before the second period . of extra-time was over in Brazil.

The . youths, many of them with their faces covered and drinking heavily, . responded by hurling rocks, destroying store fronts, tearing down street . lights and even breaking into a theater. Police said 20 officers were injured and at least 60 people were arrested. The chaotic situation marred what was an otherwise spontaneous show of support for Argentina's national team. The . centre of festivities was the Obelisk, where fans traditionally gather . to celebrate victory, not defeat. Cars honked staccato rhythms, . firecrackers were tossed into the air and fans of all ages jumped in . place shouting 'Argentina! Argentina! Argentina!'

"By . John Hall . Having good manners is more important as good grades when it comes to forging a career, the editor of society bible Tatler has told an audience of public schoolgirls. Speaking to pupils at £30,000-a-year Westonbirt School for Girls in Gloucestershire, Kate Reardon, 46, said young women should focus on good impressions rather than good qualifications. She told the girls: 'It doesn’t matter how many A-levels you have, what kind of a degree you have, if you have good manners people will like you. And, if they like you, they will help you.' Advice: Kate Reardon (centre), who was educated at elite schools herself, told pupils at Westonbirt School for Girls that getting top grades is not as important as making a good impression . Top tips: Kate Reardon said it was easy to avoid face-to-face contact in the modern digital age but urged the public school pupils 'never hide behind a computer or mobile phone' Speaking to pupils at £30,000-a-year Westonbirt School for Girls in Gloucestershire (pictured) Kate Readon said 'It doesn't matter how many A-levels you have... if you have good manners people will like you' Ms Reardon, who was educated at the elite Cheltenham Ladies College and Stowe Schools, rejected a place at the University of Exeter in order to become a journalist at the age of 19. Now she is suggesting to other public school girls that getting top grades will not necessarily guarantee a top career. Ms Reardon said it was easy to avoid face-to-face . contact in the modern digital age but urged the pupils 'never hide behind a . computer or mobile phone'. According to Ms Reardon - who launched her own website TopTips.com in 2007 and released the acclaimed book 'Top Tips for Girls' a year later - good manners are the key to success. 'I’m not talking about manners about using the right spoon for soup or eating asparagus with your left hand.. I’m talking about being polite and respectful and making people you interact with feel valued, she told Westonbirt School for Girls pupils. Kate Reardon, who became editor of Tatler (right) in 2010, was speaking at £30,000-a-year Westonbirt School for Girls. Last year actress Joanna Lumley (left) asked pupils there to promise never to rely on benefits . Background: Kate Reardon, who was educated at the elite Cheltenham Ladies College and Stowe School (pictured), rejected a place at the University of Exeter in order to become a journalist at the age of 19 . Kate Reardon told the students she felt completely unprepared for her first job at Vogue . Kate Reardon was born in New York in 1968 but describes her own education as 'thoroughly British.' She attended several elite establishments - including Garden House School, Bute House Prep School for Girls, Cheltenham Ladies' College and Stowe School. But aged 19 she rejected a place at the University of Exeter in order to pursue a soon-to-be glittering career in journalism. That year she became U.S. Vogue's youngest ever fashion assistant staying at the company for two years. At 21, she was named the youngest ever fashion editor at Tatler - a role she kept for nine years before becoming contributing editor at Vanity Fair. She spent 11 years at the pop culture magazine, before eventually being appointed overall editor of Tatler in 2010. In 2007 Ms Reardon launched her own website, TopTips.com, which was released as a book titled 'Top Tips for Girls' the following year to much acclaim. She is the 17th editor of Tatler since the high society magazine's launch in 1909. Ms Reardon told the girls that, although they have all grown up in the digital age where avoiding 'eyeball-to-eyeball' interaction is easy, it is important to maintain a real-world persona. 'Never hide behind a computer or . mobile phone if you want to communicate your truth - they need to know who . you are and they need to understand you,' she said. Organisation is a key part of success, Ms Reardon said, insisting 'chaotic isn't cute' - especially when it comes to applying for jobs. Last year actress Joanna Lumley told girls at the £9,990-a-term Westonbirt School for Girls that they should stay in work and never rely on benefits. 'You must swear never to go on the dole, find something to do,' she said. 'By . doing you become employable. It doesn’t matter what the job is, by . working you learn new things, meet new people and are exposed to new . ideas,' the Absolutely Fabulous star added. Westonburt . is described as one of the country’s leading same-sex schools with the . vast majority of girls winning places at their chosen universities every . year. Last year half of all pupils received A* for GCSE English and 36 per cent of all A levels achieved the same grade. The pass rate was A level exams was 100 per cent. Speaking to the girls, Tatler editor Ms Reardon admitted she felt completely unprepared for her first job at Vogue. She said: 'I was entirely unqualified for life at American Vogue. 'If you've ever seen The Devil Wears Prada you'll know what my life was like. 'I was the fat, badly dressed one. They used to take bets in front of me on how long I was going to last. But they were right. 'I'd come from a culture which placed no value in work for its own sake. 'There's a particularly British wariness of appearing to try too hard. It's somehow distasteful. Everything should come to us seamlessly and, if you have to work at it, you're somehow a loser.' But she told pupils how she quickly learned the 'American work ethic', was helpful getting her the job as Tatler's youngest ever fashion editor, aged 21. She added: 'When I first got there, I really struggled with Tatler's position of immense privilege. 'It has the wealthiest readers of any magazine in England and so deals with the concerns of the very rich. 'Then again, the business model of this very successful glossy magazine which employs many people and has the power to promote so many brilliant businesses is built on exactly that premise and so it's nothing to be ashamed of. 'I have a career I love more than I can tell you and I have it because I work incredibly hard pretty much every single day. 'And you know what? I'm really proud of working hard - not just the level of sucking up and free handbags I now get because of my job, but because it's an achievement in itself.' Ms Reardon - pictured at work in her pyjamas for comic relief - was Tatler's youngest ever fashion editor at age 21 . Kate's final parting advice to the 'younger generation' was to work hard and be ready to seize opportunities. 'Luck is going to play a huge part in your life,' she said. 'Do the work, read the books, be prepared, but also embrace luck when it comes your way. Constantly look out for it and grab it.' Natasha Dangerfield, headmistress of Westonbirt School, said she agreed with Kate. She said: 'Good communication skills and good manners are vital for getting on in life, whatever we do. 'Kate is absolutely right and she is a great role model for the girls. 'There is only one secret to success and that is hard work. 'I didn't get my job because of connections. I got it because of my skills, my experience and my hard work. 'We aim to instill that work ethic and attitude in all our students.'","Tatler editor Kate Reardon, 46, was speaking at Westonbirt School for Girls .

Manuel Pellegrini admitted that some of his World Cup stars could miss the start of the Premier League season after seeing Manchester City lose in a penalty shootout to Liverpool in New York. Joe Hart, James Milner, Edin Dzeko and Yaya Toure all played a part at Yankee Stadium after joining up with City’s squad in the United States last Thursday along with David Silva. But Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Fernandinho and captain Vincent Kompany are not due to report back for pre-season training until Monday after reaching the latter stages of the World Cup in Brazil, and Pellegrini knows they will have less than two weeks to get fit for the start of the Premier League season. Captain fantastic: Vincent Kompany could miss the start of the season after his World Cup exertions . Delay: Sergio Aguero (left), Martin Demichelis and Pablo Zabaleta have yet to report back for pre-season . Arsenal, City’s opponents in the Community Shield in 10 days’ time, have already written off some of their key players for the big kick-off and Pellegrini may have to do the same. He said: ‘The five players who arrived last Thursday, Hart, Milner, Yaya, Silva and Dzeko, I think that they will be ready for the Premier League. ‘We will with see the rest of the players who arrive next Monday. Can they be fit in 15 days? Maybe not all of them will do it. ‘We are trying to prepare our team in the best way. We’ve had a very good pre-season with part of the team. We had another five players playing some minutes today. The rest of the squad arrive next week we are preparing well for the Community Shield and Premier League. ‘We have a very good squad but this pre-season we have a lot of players who cannot play. We’re happy with the squad, not only the team. That’s why it’s important for all these players to take their chance when they get it.’ On form: Stevan Jovetic (left) has impressed for City this pre-season, scoring two against Liverpool . Get in: City celebrate Jovetic's goal against Liverpool but would go on to lose on penalties in New York . The Premier League champions led twice through Stevan Jovetic goals in the second half but were pegged back and beaten in the shootout by the team they tipped to the title on the final day of last season. ‘It was a very useful game for both teams,’ added Pellegrini. ‘We played better than Liverpool in the first 45 minutes and 0-0 wasn’t exactly what happened. ‘In the second half we continued playing well. Joe Hart made some very good saves and we also missed some goals especially at 2-1. Finally, the penalties. One team must win and on this day it was Liverpool’s turn. ‘Liverpool are a very good team, today they played very well. Last season they had a very good season and I’m sure that this year they be fighting for the title again. ‘We’re trying to continue in the same way we started last season. It was a very good season but that season has finished. We must now start fighting again for every competition we play. Back of the net: Lucas sends Joe Hart the wrong way as Liverpool beat City 3-1 in the penalty shoot out . ‘I hope we have the ambition to do it and that’s why I’m happy with the way we have prepared in pre-season. We will continue being an important team. Of course other teams want to win as well but I trust a lot in my players.’ The City boss also paid tribute to Jovetic who has now scored four goals in the last two games after an injury-hit first season in England. ‘I’ve already said that Stevan is a very important player for us, that’s why he came into the squad last year,’ said Pellegrini. ‘He had different kinds of injuries but at the moment he is working normally and I’m sure if he continues in this way he will demonstrate why he is here. ‘He’s a top player and he has scored in every game in pre-season. If he’s fit all the year he will be a very important player for us.’","Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin .

Navas was devastated to be left out of the Spain squad along with Alvaro Negredo, and could only watch as many of his City teammates endured a disappointing tournament in Brazil. David Silva was unable to prevent the holders going out at the group stage, Joe Hart and James Milner also made an early exit with England, Yaya Toure disappointed for Ivory Coast, and Fernandinho was caught up in Brazil's disastrous collapse. Ready to roll: Spanish winger Jesus Navas in the new Manchester City away kit . Even though Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis reached the final with Argentina, it ended in tears with a heartbreaking extra-time defeat to Germany. 'Certainly I think there will be more hunger for us to win things this season now,' said Navas, who modelled City's new away kit which was unveiled in New York on Friday. 'We've got enough talent in the team to win the Premier League again and hopefully the Champions League as well. The quality is there and that will show. Focused: Jesus Navas is eager to make an impression after missing out on the World Cup . 'Winning the title in my first season at City was a dream come true but the downside was not being selected for Spain's World Cup squad. I was extremely disappointed and for me it's very important to have this season to keep playing and be selected for Spain going forward.' Navas revealed that the Premier League champions have placed particular importance on Europe this season. Manuel Pellegrini led City past the group stage for the first time in his first year at the club but they were beaten by Barcelona at the first knockout stage. Heartache: Sergio Aguero's Argentina were beaten in the World Cup final by Germany . 'Obviously we need to aim higher and the Champions League is the next step,' said the Spain winger. 'It would be great to win the title again but obviously the Champions League is the target this year. We went past the group stage of the Champions League last season so the aim is to go as far as we possibly can.' A number of City’s World Cup contingent, including Toure, Hart, Milner and Edin Dzeko, returned to training at the team’s New Jersey base on Friday.

Manuel Pellegrini paid tribute to Kelechi Iheanacho after he starred in Manchester City’s win over Sporting Kansas City but admitted that the Premier League champions may struggle to secure a work permit for the teenage Nigerian striker. Iheanacho, 17, capped an impressive appearance by scoring the last of City’s goals in a 4-1 win at Sporting Park and Pellegrini is convinced he has a bright future in the game. City beat a host of European clubs to sign Iheanacho after he scored six goals in seven games to claim the Golden Ball at last summer’s Under 17 World Championship.

He said: ‘Kelechi is just 17 years old and he’s a very important player for us in the future. He demonstrated today what he can do in the future. It depends on the way he takes this profession, but I think he’s a good talent. ‘We’ve not decided yet (what the plan is for him) because it’s not easy. He’s just 17 and sometimes that’s the problem.

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . For those who expected Louis van Gaal to blow into English football like a whirlwind, the man they call the Iron Tulip made a surprisingly quiet start to life as Manchester United’s new manager. There was no rousing speech to his players at the club’s Carrington training complex yesterday, no  laying down of the law, just polite introductions at lunchtime and a watching brief over his first  training session on Wednesday night. New beginning: New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal meets Ryan Giggs and Edward Woodward . Time to work: The trio have a big job on their hands if they are going to make United competitive again . Fifty-eight days after he was . officially confirmed as manager in May, Van Gaal finally touched down in . Manchester at 11.50am aboard a private jet charged with putting United . back on their perch, to use Sir Alex Ferguson’s terminology. That . the 62-year-old turned up for work just three days after returning from . the World Cup in Brazil with Holland says everything about his . determination to drag United from the mire of the post-Ferguson era. Some . might question his choice of attire — a blue suit and sky blue and . white striped tie — given the contrasting fortunes at neighbours . Manchester City, but this is not a manager who cares about conforming. Half . an hour after he was driven from the airport in a club car, Van Gaal . arrived at Carrington for the first time to be met by No 2  Ryan Giggs . and club executive  vice-chairman Ed Woodward. He . was shown to his office and then given a tour of the complex by Giggs, . who has been running things in Van Gaal’s absence along with Dutch . coaches Marcel Bout and Albert Stuivenberg. Walk this way: Giggs gave Van Gaal a guided tour of United's Carrington training complex . Write caption here . They . will update Van Gaal on every member of his squad before United leave . for their pre-season tour of America at lunchtime on Friday. Van . Gaal joined the players at 1pm in the Carrington dining room where . chicken and duck were on the menu. The manager introduced himself to . each one individually and spoke with them for a couple of minutes before . sitting at a  separate table with his Dutch backroom team and Giggs. The . squad had already trained in the morning and been told to report for a . second workout at 5.30pm — their fourth double session in 10 days since . returning for pre-season work. Incoming: Juventus and Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal has been linked with a transfer to United . Good omen: Van Gaal has had a successful summer with Holland at the 2014 World Cup . Van . Gaal had been expected to speak to them and outline his vision for the . club, but instead he stood back and observed while Stuivenberg and Bout . took the session. It is . understood that Van Gaal will wait until more of the club’s World Cup . contingent, including England internationals Wayne Rooney, Danny . Welbeck, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling, join up with the squad on Friday . before addressing the players. They . have been given Thursday off to spend with their families while Van . Gaal faces his first official news conference at Old Trafford at 3pm. Despite the softly-softly start, one thing is clear — Van Gaal’s word . will be law. ‘He’s got his . own management style which has thrown up a few difficulties along the . way wherever he’s been because of the way that he is, the way he puts . himself in front of players,’ said fellow  Dutchman and former United . first-team coach Rene Meulensteen on Wednesday. ‘Players accept it or players sometimes don’t. If they don’t accept it then, yeah, you probably have a problem.’ Van . Gaal’s arrival in Manchester coincided with an announcement that United . have tied up a long-term sponsorship deal with a Japanese noodle . company. Even for a coach whose vast experience takes in Barcelona, . Bayern Munich and Ajax, the next chapter of his distinguished career . promises to be something else altogether. A fortnight before the World Cup, Van Gaal took the stage in his native Holland, addressing an audience of business experts to outline his leadership vision. Van Gaal on arrogance: . The national coach sees opportunities because he believes in vision and  structure. When I say that, I mean my vision and my structure. Yes, that is arrogant. I bet you hear that people find me arrogant. It does not bother me. I am not arrogant but I do believe in my vision, so the people who work in my organisation have something to hold on to. That is what I believe in.Van Gaal on preparation: . I see chances because I believe in preparation. That is half the job. My mum used to say that and she only went to primary school. You don’t think I would be standing here without preparing? Training. You recruit people and do you train them to create the best product? I do.Van Gaal on backroom staff: . I can’t do it on my own because I don’t know everything, do I? I know you start laughing because I am portrayed that I do know everything. I listen to the specialists. When I became national coach, the whole world thought I was going to pick the players to get us to the World Cup. No! First the staff! We have to surround players with quality.Van Gaal on being the boss:Vision is not just about the game. My vision also stands for my vision on each person, on society, on the way I speak. My tone of voice —  if I leave gaps between my sentences there is always a reason. It always comes back to my football team. Van Gaal on the Spain model:When I saw the Holland squad for the first time, I showed them Barcelona, who play with the triangle midfield with the point directing to the defence — one controlling midfielder. But I also showed the players the Spain team. Otherwise they would say: ‘Yes boss, but how can we adapt when we only meet up eight times a season?’ The boys knew from day one what the vision of Van Gaal stood for.

The players were put through two double sessions during their first week back and were then called in for a workout on Sunday. ‘I don’t need a holiday,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It’s great to have such an exciting challenge. To work daily with young people is something I don’t need time off to rest for. I’ve only met two people from the daily management, the chief scout and the chief executive officer.

Reactions: Neuer flings out his right arm to stop it . Matuschak’s prediction has come true and on Sunday night, in the iconic Maracana Stadium, 28-year-old Neuer hopes to get those famous hands on the World Cup. He has been the outstanding goalkeeper of the tournament, brilliant against Algeria and Brazil, unbeatable against France. Now it’s the turn of Lionel Messi and Co to try and find a way past Germany’s imperious 6ft 4in ‘sweeper keeper’. Alongside Neuer in Rio will be Mesut Ozil, Benedikt Howedes and Julian Draxler, three other graduates of Gesamtschule Berger Feld comprehensive who went to school in the shadow of Schalke’s old Parkstadion. Neuer could see it from the window of his house in the Buer district of Gelsenkirchen. He was given his first ball at the age of two and had signed up for Schalke when he was four, initially as a striker. ‘The coach put me in goal and back then we were playing on bone-hard ground,’ he recalls. ‘Red ash, we even trained on black ash, which was worse. Au revoir: Neuer's fine save from Benzema was France's last chance of the game as Germany held out . ‘That’s not easy for a goalkeeper. My mother was always taking out her sewing kit for the countless holes in my training pants. For a long time I had to buy my own gear. Prospect: Neuer in 2004 as a Schalke youngster . ‘I used to cry when I let in a goal. I always thought I was to blame because I was the last man.’ Neuer, a promising tennis player until he gave up the sport in favour of football at the age of 14, has developed an altogether tougher mentality over the years. Former German international Mehmet Scholl refers to him as Icecube Neuer and Andreas Kopke, Germany’s goalkeeper coach at this World Cup, believes the Bayern Munich star is one of the finest exponents of nervenstarke — strength of nerve. ‘This is the quality that makes him stand out,’ says Kopke. ‘If something goes wrong for him during the game, he can put it aside immediately. Analysis can wait. He embodies exactly the goalkeeper we want to see in the national team. He’s not only an excellent keeper, but also a good footballer who can participate in the build-up play.’ If Neuer isn’t keeping the ball out of . his goal — the nonchalant one-handed block from France’s Karim Benzema . in the quarter-finals was reminiscent of Robocop deflecting a bullet — . he is charging out of his box to break up an attack or venturing forward . with the ball.

Neuer’s brother Marcel, who is one year younger, is a referee who officiates fixtures up to the fourth tier of German football. Neuer will be operating on a different level against Argentina. The hopes of a nation could rest on his shoulders. ‘He has proven at this World Cup that he is the world’s best goalkeeper,’ says Germany’s legendary keeper Oliver Kahn. ‘Everyone knows he is a wonderful footballer but what is crucial is that in important situations he can rescue the win. That is what he’ll be measured by.’ Back then: Neuer thwarting Chelsea's Joe Cole during his days with Schalke .","The German stopper was once just a thin 14-year-old, recalls Schalke's veteran goalkeeper coach Lothar Matuschak .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Coat slung stylishly over her shoulders and wearing a short cream dress, Novella Benini slipped almost unnoticed into Italy’s official World Cup dinner in the team’s quiet coastal retreat of Mangaratiba at the weekend. This is the woman who has put the smile back on Cesare Prandelli’s face. Whatever the result against England in Manaus on Saturday, the Italy coach will have no problem putting it into perspective. Because for Prandelli, World Cup disappointment would pale into insignificance compared with the heartache of losing Manuela, his beloved wife of 25 years, to cancer in November 2007. Heartbreak: Prandelli lost his wife Manuela to cancer in 2007. The two met when he was 18. Progressive: The Italian coach has got his team playing more progressive football than Macello Lippi managed . The 56-year-old father of two has since found love again with Benini. The couple live together in Florence and the 42-year-old Novella is regularly seen at Italy’s games. ‘The main objective for a man is happiness,’ says Prandelli. ‘I told my children (Nicolo and Carolina) that with Novella’s presence they haven’t lost a father but they have gained a person who is richer again. 'I have met someone who has filled me with the desire to try the joys of love again — and without love I cannot live.’ The people of Italy mourned with Prandelli after Manuela’s early death, and there is a wave of support for him to succeed in Brazil. The couple first met when an 18-year-old Prandelli was coming home from playing in a Serie B game with Cremonese and dropped into a cafe in his hometown of Orzinuovi near Brescia for a hot chocolate. ‘We never left each other’s side from then on,’ he recalls. ‘We got married in 1982 and in 30 years we only fought once, over a tennis racket if I remember correctly. She taught me everything I know about life.’ Down to earth: Prandelli's humility and dignity has endeared him to the Italian public . Results: Prandelli led Italy to the final of Euro 2012 before their eventual defeat to Spain . With Manuela at his side, Prandelli moved to Atalanta and then Juventus where he played in the same team as Michel Platini. Later, as a coach, he worked his way up at Lecce, Verona, Venezia and Parma before getting his big opportunity at Roma in 2004. However, Prandelli stepped down just six weeks into the job when his wife’s breast cancer, first diagnosed several years earlier, became more aggressive. ‘Her life was my life,’ he says. ‘I told her that when the treatment got really invasive I would be by her side every minute, so I went back to Orzinuovi. 'People were surprised by my decision to leave Roma but to me it was natural.’ A year later, Prandelli returned to work and took over at Fiorentina, transforming the club into a Champions League team, but Manuela’s health was failing fast. ‘In those last hours, me and my children lay in bed beside her,’ he recalls. ‘We gave her hugs and kept talking to her. The doctors told us the last thing terminally-ill people lose is their hearing. 'They usually recognise their family’s voices. I will always carry her last words inside me but cannot repeat them. It’s too hard.’ Discipline: The coach has brought the best out of the likes of Mario Balotelli by insisting he modifies his behaviour . The dignified way that Prandelli conducted himself, combined with his growing reputation as a top coach, made him a popular choice to replace Marcello Lippi after Italy’s disastrous performance at the 2010 World Cup. He guided his country to the final of Euro 2012, modifying a traditionally rigid style in favour of a more positive approach with players encouraged to be more creative. ‘Prandelli is a very good guy and a clever coach,’ Napoli boss Rafael Benitez told Sportsmail. ‘He came to meet me in Naples to talk about possible selections for Italy’s squad. 'He knows his players well. They play good attacking football under him but also keep to the Italian roots of a strong defence.’ A man whose quiet lifestyle has earned him the nickname Il Prete, The Priest, has introduced a strict code of ethics, refusing to pick players like Mario Balotelli, Daniele De Rossi and Mattia Destro when they were suspended for their clubs. He has also urged his players to be more humble towards their fans and invited a local priest to attend Italy’s World Cup training camp at their Coverciano headquarters near Florence last month. The four-time world champions might welcome some divine intervention after failing to win any of their last seven internationals. Ever composed and dapper, Prandelli does not seem unduly concerned. ‘History shows us that we have been able to overcome difficulties,’ he says. After all, he has overcome far worse.","Manager's wife Manuela died from cancer in 2007 .

England are unlikely to retreat to a monastery again if they fail to beat Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday night, even though you might think Roy Hodgson and his players would need a little divine intervention to qualify from Group D. Worry not. They were in a tighter corner than this and reached the quarter-finals at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico when, ultimately, the Hand of God was not quite so kind to them. That was the last time England lost their opening group fixture, going down 1-0 to Portugal in Monterrey. World Cup bother: Roy Hodgson is in need of a result against Uruguay on Thursday in Group D . Spirit of 86: Gary Lineker scores against Poland during a crucial 3-0 win in Mexico . It went from bad to worse in the second game when captain Bryan Robson dislocated his shoulder and Ray Wilkins was sent off for throwing the ball at the referee in the first half of a goalless draw against eventual group winners Morocco. ‘It was clear the balance wasn’t right in the team,’ said Peter Reid, one of four players called into the starting line-up for the make-or-break encounter with Poland. ‘Where we were in Monterrey, it was like a desert and Bobby Robson decided to take us up into the hills to a monastery for a team meeting. ‘We had a frank and open chat where everyone gave a view on what was wrong or right. Peter Shilton spoke up and said his piece and I suggested a few things to Bobby, too. ‘He took it all on board and then came up with a system to put Trevor Steven on the right, Steve Hodge on the left and Peter Beardsley in the hole playing off Gary Lineker. I came in alongside Glenn Hoddle and it all seemed to fit in training. ‘We didn’t have the extra social media to contend with, like today’s players. But we knew from being able to get the BBC and through messages relayed from home that the pressure was on and people had been disappointed by what they’d seen. Experience: Peter Reid speaks about one of the best performances from England under pressure . Despair: Carlos Santos scores the winner as Portugal beat England in the first group game . ‘We expected as much  anyway but it helped us grow very focused. The win was everything. ‘The players who weren’t playing like Mark Hateley and John Barnes were really getting behind the lads who were picked and we developed not just a good team spirit but squad spirit, a real unity. That was vital.’ What followed was one of England’s greatest World Cup performances. The partnership of Lineker and Beardsley blossomed immediately, Lineker bagging a first-half hat-trick as Robson’s new-look team blew away the Poles and pipped their opponents to second place on goal difference. The situation in Brazil is not as serious — yet — after the opening defeat by Italy in Manaus last Saturday but Hodgson is already facing calls to drop Wayne Rooney or switch him from the left to a more central role against Uruguay. Key man: Gary Lineker celebrates after helping the Three Lions qualify for the next round against the odds . ‘I suppose there are a few similarities in how the current team shapes up,’ added Reid. ‘Firstly, I think our two top  players — Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney — need to turn up for the party and step up their game. ‘As good as  Andrea Pirlo is, I  still think Steven should have dominated him better and will want to impose himself on  Uruguay with more potency. ‘You couldn’t wish to set up a better goal than the one Rooney put on for Daniel  Sturridge, but he would benefit from playing in that Beardsley role rather than left wing. ‘England didn’t do an awful lot wrong against Italy and there’s no doubt they have enough to beat Uruguay. ‘They can’t afford to lose and focusing the mind on needing to win may give them the extra push they need.’ Pressure: Things aren't as bad for England yet... they just need to replicate their Italy display .

But as England prepare to face Ecuador tonight, Charlton, whose international record of 49 goals puts him 11 ahead of Rooney, thinks that the Manchester United striker is the only truly world-class player in Roy Hodgson’s squad.

Time to impress: Rooney will look to get on the score sheet against Ecuador . ‘Wayne Rooney will have to play,’ Charlton told Laureus.com. ‘He’s got that something extra.

If it’s any consolation to Roy Hodgson, the man he will face in the suffocating heat of Manaus a week on Saturday touched down in Brazil in the early hours on Friday with enough problems of his own. Cesare Prandelli’s Italy have not won in seven games since beating the Czech Republic in Turin in September. Even for a country renowned for coming to the boil slowly before major tournaments, it is a worrying scenario. ‘Italian Mystery’ was the main headline in the Corriere della Sera after Wednesday’s shock 1-1 draw with Luxembourg, ranked 112th in the world. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Mario Balotelli's reaction to Italy's drab draw with Luxembourg . Down but not out: Mario Balotelli falls to the floor during Italy's draw with Luxembourg . ‘Same Italy before the World Cup, one goal and a draw even against Luxembourg’ declared La Repubblica. ‘Where will victory come from?’ was the simple question on the front page of La Gazzetta dello Sport with a picture of Mario Balotelli with his eyes squeezed shut. A more pertinent question might be: where will the goals from? Plenty to think about: Cesare Prandelli's side have not won in seven games, leaving Balotelli frustrated . Much depends on Balotelli but the Italians know enough about their combustible striker to realise that is dangerous, not least because rumours persist that the former Manchester City man is struggling with a groin problem. Hodgson is certainly not the only one wrestling with issues over his strikers. Prandelli’s decision to omit Giuseppe Rossi from his squad and include Lorenzo Insigne has sparked a national debate. Of his others front men, Ciro Immobile is considered too inexperienced and Antonio Cassano unpredictable. Dejected: Antonio Cassano is slumps on the deck after Italy were helf by Luxembourg . Midfield, arguably Italy’s strongest area, has been hit by the broken leg suffered by Riccardo Montolivo. Prandelli has been forced to ditch his 4-3-1-2 formation — with Montolivo sat behind the front two — and go back to the drawing board. On Wednesday, he tried  4-1-4-1 for the first time but it clearly did not work, with Italy’s midfield failing to get forward to provide enough support for Balotelli. Italy have been here before, underachieving before a World Cup only to find their form at the right time. But the pain of an early exit in South Africa four years ago is too fresh for their fans to take anything for granted.

In Haworth, the village made famous by the Bronte sisters, the world-famous museum in their honour will close on Sunday because of the huge crowds expected along Main Street to see Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish climb up the cobbles. ‘The sisters would have found it exciting — not a lot happened in Haworth in their day,’ says museum director Ann Insdale. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tour de France stages preview . Tour fever: Chris Froome (front, right) leads Team Sky during a practice run in Haworth .

Backing: A model supporting the Tour on a house in North Stainley . ‘Charlotte in particular loved anything to do with France. She studied in Brussels and spoke fluent French. She’d have enjoyed having such an iconic event here.’ It seems Yorkshire’s current generation feel the same. Everywhere you look, the white rose county is turning yellow to mark the greatest endurance test in sport. Police anticipate at least a million people will turn up to watch Saturday’s opening 118-mile stage between Leeds and Harrogate — known as Le Grand Depart — and Sunday’s York-Sheffield leg, which measures 124 miles. A statue of Edward the Black Prince in Leeds’ City Square has had a yellow jersey planted on it. Raring to go: Team Sky are presented to the public . Defending champion: Chris Froome waves to the crowd at the team presentation . VIDEO Chris Froome & the Tour de France . Gripped: More than a million fans are expected to turn out for the event . Warm welcome: Mark Cavendish and the rest of his team during the presentation . And if the major population centres are getting excited, ‘real Yorkshire’ is beside itself as the world’s greatest cyclists speed through places such as Kettlewell and Cragg Vale against the breathtaking backdrop of the Yorkshire Dales. Yellow-painted bikes, flags, pennants and model riders have sprung up everywhere, from  outside schools and pubs to shop windows and even cemeteries. As Gordon Love, from Swaledale in the north of the county, puts it: ‘For anyone who doesn’t understand the fuss, these are roads I have grown up cycling on. To have the Tour riding on them is unbelievable. 'If you are a football fan, it is the equivalent of the World Cup coming to play on your local Sunday League ground. There’ll be chaos, and no doubt rain, but, all in all, fantastic.’ In arty Hebden Bridge, the enterprising manager of the Blazing Saddles bike shop, Alan Boult, has attained a special alcohol licence to allow his garage to become a makeshift pub. Not that the straight-talking Yorkshire public will put on airs and graces because Froome and Co are in town. Where's Wiggins? Bradley Wiggins was dropped by Team Sky . Boult says: ‘One of my customers saw a guy on a flash bike, wearing all the gear and said: “Who does he think he is . . . Bradley Wiggins?” It was only when he went by he realised it was Bradley Wiggins out training!’ Wiggins’ absence from the tour after being dropped by Team Sky is a disappointment, but it’s unikely to keep many away. There are still four British riders including Cavendish, whose mum comes from Harrogate. The peloton won’t face any climbs like those in The Alps, but the locals in Cragg Vale are proud to have the longest continuous hill in England — nearly six miles long and taking riders from residential homes up into farmland and eventually on to the exposed moors. Support: Addingham gets ready for the Tour . Boosting trade: Gloria at Cafe Solo in Hebden Bridge gets ready for a busy weekend . Roger Wood, landlord of the Robin Hood pub halfway up the climb, is excited, if a little daunted. ‘The council have said there might be 35,000 people visiting Cragg Vale. If that’s the case, it might get a little awkward — my pub gets crowded if there are any more than a hundred people in it.’ His customers knew the Tour was on its way when French cycling legend Bernard Hinault popped in and supped a pint of Abbeydale Bitter during a recent fact-finding mission. He declared himself satisfied and told locals: ‘This tour is going to be a big party.’ A few hundred yards up from the pub, Cragg Vale infant school is bedecked in yellow, with four bikes — complete with scarecrow-style riders — tied to the railings. It is as if each village is keen not to be outdone by another. Trial run: Chris Froome and Richie Porte (far) go for a ride during training . Addingham, seven miles east of Skipton with a population of just 3,500, has the privilege of having the cyclists go through on both Saturday and Sunday. A giant flag pinned up next to the road  proclaims: ‘Addingham 2014: So good, it’s coming twice.’ All over Yorkshire, people will throw off their traditional caution. Many hotels and bed-and-breakfasts were fully booked shortly after the announcement was made about the Tour 18 months ago. Nobody knows the exact size of crowds expected across the region but they are going to be huge. Feeling the love: Mark Cavendish looks relaxed with his family for the event . Temporary campsites have been set up along almost every route so people can get a good position early. But Sir Rodney Walker, chairman of the company formed to oversee Grand Depart, warns: ‘Do not expect to wake up on a nice sunny day in early July and say “Shall we go and watch?” It won’t happen.

It included cash handouts and expensive gifts for some members, and the offer of US college tuition for their children.

"By . Joe Bernstein . The good people of Yorkshire weren’t exactly shy about their contribution to the last Olympics where they won as many gold medals as Australia. So while the rest of the country reflects on England’s World Cup shambles, those in the white rose county can claim bragging rights if Argentina go all the way under a manager who was made in Sheffield and Leeds. Alex Sabella, the man in charge of Lionel Messi and Co in Brazil, spent three-and-a-half formative years in Yorkshire between 1978 and the end of 1981; two seasons at Bramall Lane with Sheffield United and 12 months at Elland Road. Made in Yorkshire? Argentina boss Alejandro Sabella had spells in England as a player . Although he didn’t have the same meteoric impact as Tottenham’s two Argentinians, Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa, Sabella’s team-mates and managers from that era believe his years in England helped him develop the  managerial skills now being seen in the World Cup. Professional, popular and strong-willed, Sabella also had a twinkle in his eye. His Sheffield United team-mate Simon Stainrod recalls with a smile: ‘He would stitch me up like a kipper so I’d be blamed for little tricks he’d played.’ Sabella also received advice passed down from Don Revie, one of English football’s great managers, via his Leeds manager Allan Clarke. Welcome addition: Sabella moved to England after joining Sheffield United in 1978 for two seasons . ‘The gaffer (Revie) always used to say if a player’s wife was happy, the player would be happy and he’d be at his best,’ said Clarke. ‘It’s something I told Alex and he isn’t daft, he will know the key to Argentina is keeping Messi and the others happy. Then the talent can take over.’ And Messi has sparkled so far at this World Cup, with Argentina playing Belgium on Saturday for a place in the semi-finals. Sabella was 23 when he moved from Argentina to Sheffield. The myth is that Sheffield United manager Harry Haslam refused to pay £500,000 for Diego Maradona on a scouting trip to South America and bought Sabella as a cheaper option. In reality, Haslam was never going to get near Maradona, who was already tipped for superstardom at 16. The Blades boss was happy to land another talented left-footed midfielder for £160,000. Leaders: Sabella (right) and Lionel Messi (left) have guided Argentina to the World Cup quarter-finals . Stainrod was in awe of the exotic South American who was suddenly training alongside him. ‘Alex was a really good player,’ he says. ‘I learned a lot from him. No matter what the condition of the pitch, he’d wear rubbers on his boots rather than screw-in studs, which was an eye-opener to me. Even on a wet muddy pitch.’ Sabella learned his first word of  English, ‘backheel’, at training and picked up the language from there. He quickly cottoned on to English dressing-room culture, to Stainrod’s cost. ‘He was the first player I’d ever seen who wouldn’t go out to warm up on the pitch before matches,’ recounts Stainrod. ‘He’d stay in the dressing-room and do his own stretches there. ‘Before a game at Preston I stayed inside with him. At one stage I had to pop to use the loo. After the game the lads came in and when they tried to put their shirts on, the sleeves had knots in them. When they put their socks on the toes had been cut off. I got the blame for it because I was a bit of an idiot in those days but it was Alex. ‘He’d set me up and nobody believed me. He’d even cut the ends off his own socks to make it look like he was a victim, too. Brilliant. He still doesn’t own up to it but there’s a cheeky smile when it’s mentioned.’ Cheap as chips: Blades boss Harry Haslam (left) signed Sabella (right) for £160,000 . Even as a young man 7,000 miles from home, Sabella had the natural authority and strength of character which are hallmarks of successful managers. Team-mate and neighbour Tony Kenworthy said: ‘He wouldn’t train on a Friday which would cause a few arguments between him and the coach Danny Bergara. It was to do with Alex’s culture — he didn’t want to run the slightest risk of injury. ‘The players took to him easily. He was humorous, intelligent and quickly picked up the banter. He would knock on my door and we’d spend evenings together watching football videos. He was very serious about the game.’ Club legend: Sabella's (right) displays for Sheffield United soon endeared him to the fans and his team-mates . United didn’t have a good team and were relegated from the old Second Division. But Sabella was their best player and after a season in the Third Division he was snapped up for £400,000 by Leeds, who were in the top flight. ‘Some fans gave him a tough time when he joined Leeds. He was spat at in Sheffield when he was out shopping with his family,’ says Stainrod. ‘Despite that he loved England and our football. He still speaks excellent English. I saw him in Argentina a few years ago and he asked about getting a manager’s job here. Then he went to Estudiantes as manager, did well and the rest is history. ‘He was a great player. He would have won 50 caps for Argentina but unfortunately for him he was in the era of Maradona.’ Pastures new: Sabella joined Leeds in 1980 for £400,000 after United were relegated to the Third Division . While Sabella is still regarded as a Blades legend - his defence-splitting pass for Peter Anderson’s goal against Sunderland in 1978 made it to video as one of the greatest goals seen on Match of the Day - he struggled at Leeds. He was tough enough for the old First Division but probably not quick enough. The club had sacked the manager who signed him, Jimmy Adamson, and replaced him with club legend and former England World Cup striker Clarke. Sabella’s wife felt homesick. ‘He came to see me and said his wife was unhappy, and she wanted to go back home,’ said Clarke. ‘I did what Don Revie would have done. I didn’t want Alex to go, he was a very good player with an excellent left foot, but keeping him when his family were unhappy wouldn’t have worked out for anyone. So I helped him find a club and we let him go to Estudiantes. When I heard he’d got the Argentina job, I thought: “Blow me, it’s him!”’ Hard graft: Argentine Sabella struggled at Top Division outfit Leeds as his family became homesick . Even in the early 1980s there were signs Sabella was an educator who took people with him. ‘Alex was a big influence on me, the way he’d do extra training sessions, treat the game properly,’ says Stainrod. ‘And he wasn’t soft. The game in Argentina might be more open than in England but you still get tackles flying in. ‘Most importantly, he understood footballers. He knows when you’ve got someone as outrageously talented as Messi, you are obliged to get the best out of him and build your team like that. If he was able to help me to be decent, he’ll be able to turn Messi into a world champion.’","Argentina boss Alejandro Sabella is hoping to guide his side to World Cup glory this summer .

Dzeko was heavily criticised at home after a series of missed chances in Bosnia's second game against Nigeria saw them eliminated. But the 28-year-old fared rather better on Wednesday when his opening strike helped ensure his proud nation wouldn't finish bottom of Group E and without a point in their debut World Cup.

Roma's Miralem Pjanic  effectively sealed the points with a second goal after an hour that also ended Iran's slim hopes of getting through to the last 16. Charlton's Rez Ghoochannejhad gave Iran some hope late on by scoring their first goal of the World Cup but Bosnia immediately extended their two-goal advantage with a fine effort by Avdija Vršajević. After a frustrating opening, Dzeko found himself free of white-shirted defenders for once as he picked up the ball midway in the Iranian half and buried a low left-foot finish from 22 yards. The nature of his subdued reaction to scoring underlined what a difficult campaign he's just been through, including a goal wrongfully disallowed against Nigeria. Iran needed to win to retain any hope of reaching the knockout stages as group runners-up to Argentina - but you wouldn't have known it as they began with a rigid 4-1-4-1. Their manager Carlos Quierioz, formerly Sir Alex Ferguson's No 2 at Manchester United, masterminded one of the best-organised defences in the tournament, but they were also lightweight up front and the last team in Brazil to score. Clash: Bosnia team-mates Muhamed Besic (front) and Toni Sunjic (centre) writhe on the ground after colliding with each other . Winded: Dzeko lifts Sunjic after the Bosnia pair came together in the centre of the pitch . Back to his feet: Despite looking worse for wear, both players were back in action within moments . Slotted: Roma midfielder Miralem Pjanic takes his chance to put Bosnia and Herzegovina 2-0 up against Iran . Cool and calm: Pjanic shoots as Bosnia go 2-0 up at Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador . Despair: Iran's Andranik Teymourian covers his face as Iran's chances of advancing evaporate . Often, Ghoochannejhad - who missed a chance to give Iran a famous result against Lionel Messi's Argentina - was left on his own up front and his goal record of one in 17 games for Charlton last season didn't inspire confidence either. Salvador had become known at this World Cup as the ""City of Goals"" - with the three previous games staged there yielding 17. After Dzeko had scored, Iran were unlucky when a shot by Masoud Shojaei beat Asmir Begovic and crashed off the underneath of the crossbar. Goal-line technology was called for and showed the ball clearly hadn't crossed the line. With Nigeria losing to Argentina, Iran knew they could qualify if they overturned Bosnia's advantage. Back in it: Iran were given a glimmer of hope for Reza Ghoochannejhad finished on the far post . Broken down: The Charlton striker scored Iran's first goal of the tournament past Stoke's Asimir Begovic . Get on with it: Javad Nekounam grabs the ball quickly for the restart as Iran chased a victory . Back of the net: Ghoochannejhad's celebration is muted as Iran still need to score two goals to progress . But that became an impossible task when Jalal Hosseini needlessly gave the ball away and Dzeko reacted quickly to play in Pjanic, who was level with last defender and scored with ease. Ghoochannejhad finished smartly from six yards to briefly reduce the scoreline to 2-1 but within 120 seconds, the overlapping Vršajević fired in his first international goal to atone for an earlier miss from Dzeko's pass. For a country of just four million people, Bosnia and Herzegovina can go home feeling prouder of their performances in Brazil than England for example. Their real achievement was qualifying for the finals after a tragic recent history that saw 200,000 people killed during a brutal war in the 1990s following independence.

If Dzeko had been luckier and more clinical against Nigeria, it probably would have been them progressing to the knockout stages rather than the Africans. Iran will lament a lack of firewpower up front. With a World Cup record of one win in 12 - against the USA in 1998 - they lack belief to go with their technical ability, and Querioz will now step down and seek a new challenge after being in charge for three years. But anyone who saw their effort against Argentina which they only lost 1-0 to a brilliant Messi goal will know their trip to South America has been worthwhile.","A win for Iran would have put them in the last-16 ahead of Nigeria .

"By . Joe Bernstein . Just seven weeks ago, Steve Peters seemed to be a cure for all sporting ills. A quiet word from the good doctor in your ear and you’d be strong, focused, a winner – like his clients Steven Gerrard, Luis Suarez or Ronnie O’Sullivan. How things can change. In this World Cup, Peters’ famed 'inner chimp' has fallen from the highest branches and hit the ground with an almighty crash. The first alarm bells rang out on April 27 when Gerrard committed Premier League title suicide against Chelsea. The following week, Peters’ greatest supporter O’Sullivan surrendered his world snooker title to Mark Selby. VIDEO Scroll down for Steven Gerrard: The World Cup has left me a broken man . Who let the chimp out? England captain Steven Gerrard chats to sports psychiatry guru Steve Peters . Disappointment: Peters was mooted as the man who could cure England's World Cup woes . Since then, things have gone from bad to worse for Peters in Brazil. The England squad he was to work with have looked uncomfortable under pressure – something Peters was meant to put right. In fact, results have got even worse. And on Tuesday night, his influence hit rock-bottom when star pupil Suarez unlearned everything he was supposed to have taken from regular contact with Peters and bit Giorgio Chiellini in a moment of utter madness. It was Suarez’s third offence and the Uruguayan’s reputation and career now hangs in the balance, probably to the discomfort of his eminent English sports psychiatrist. Eye witnesses said Peters – revered in British cycling as the reason they dominated the world at the London Olympics –  did not strike a confident or assertive figure during his time with the England squad as if the whole World Cup circus was a bit of a culture shock. Certainly, there was no obvious advantage in terms of results to having him in the 72-man England back-up party. Wayne Rooney didn’t stay calm or confident enough to take a good chance against Italy when it came along and England lost. When the Uruguay match reached its conclusion, Gerrard made a costly error and the defenders didn’t react quickly enough to cover. Peters was trumpeted as someone who could make the difference in penalty shoot-outs but England didn’t even get that far. Disappointment: Peters was working with Liverpool before he joined up with the FA and England . Gurus: Peters with former British Cycling chief Sir Dave Brailsford in 2011 . It’s the first really difficult spell Peters has endured in sport after a long run of success – he is consultant to Team GB’s cyclists and the physciatrist for Team Sky who boast Chris Froome and Sir Bradley Wiggins -  and it will be interesting to see how he handles it. Peters became celebrated with his book The Chimp Paradox, modestly described on its own website as ‘a groundbreaking mind model’. The testimonies from Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and Gerrard are gushing. ‘Steve's been excellent. He is a specialist in what he does and a genius in that field, and is such an understanding guy.’ Gerrard said about his new guru: ‘He is the best. I’ve played my most consistent form for Liverpool and England since seeing Steve.’ Apart from slips and backward headers, presumably. Peters inspired the GB cyclists who dominated the London Olympics and O’Sullivan credited him with turning his career around after bouts of depression. At Liverpool’s training ground at Melwood, Rodgers would speak enthusiastically and at length about the methods Peters used to help Suarez with his severe anger management problems. It involves controlling the part of the brain that works on animal instinct – the inner chimp – with the part that is rational. Peters is hailed as a ‘mind mechanic’ but in Natal, his efforts to change Suarez looked rather hollow and empty. RONNIE O’SULLIVAN . Gifted snooker star who turned to Peters after depression left him unable to compete properly. Peters was in O’Sullivan’s dressing-room during this year’s world championship final against Mark Selby, which the underdog won 18-14 . STEVE GERRARD . Always prone to self-doubt, Gerrard found Peters’ calm reassurance helpful as he reached the twilight of his career. But high-profile and important mistakes for club and country, against Chelsea and Uruguay, have left the Liverpool and England captain “broken” by his own admission . LUIS SUAREZ . Looked at one stage like being Peters’ biggest success. Suarez overcame racism and biting bans to be the Premier League’s star player last season. But now back to square one after sinking his teeth into Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. Resurrection: Ronnie O'Sullivan is another who credits Peters with helping to rejuvenate his career . Hunger: Peters also worked closely with Luis Suarez during his time with Liverpool . SIR BRADLEY WIGGINS . Helped Wiggins become Britain’s first Tour de France winner and Olympic champion in 2012 but since then the rider has been riddled with injury and loss of form, and has been supplanted by Froome as the main rider for Team Sky . VICTORIA PENDLETON . British cyclist who was going to retire after the 2004 Olympics until she was persuaded otherwise by Peters. ‘I’m not a natural optimist, but Steve showed me there’s a positive in everything if you look for it,’ she said. Pendleton  went on to win Gold at the London Olympics . SIR CHRIS HOY . Peters was known as ‘head coach’ to the British cyclists at Beijing and London, such was his influence. Hoy won three golds in China at the 2008 Olympics and said: ‘""Without Steve I don't think I could have brought home triple gold.’ Spin doctor: Steve Peters also helped Victoria Pendleton during her cycling career . Golden boy: He also significantly helped Britain's most successful Olympic Sir Chris Hoy .","Sports psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters couldn't help England at the World Cup .

"Queiroz was Sir Alex Ferguson's No 2 at Manchester United . By . Joe Bernstein . Carlos Queiroz quit as manager of Iran on Wednesday night after a Bosnian side inspired by Edin Dzeko ended their hope of progressing into the knockout stages of the World  Cup. Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko ensured already-eliminated Bosnia secured the first World Cup victory in their history by scoring the opening goal and setting up a second for Roma's Miralem Pjanic in Salvador. Iran fought back to score their first goal of the tournament through Charlton's Reza Ghoochannejhad but Bosnia quickly restored their two-goal advantage with a fine effort from Avdija Vršajevic to leave Queiroz's side bottom of Group F. Sir Alex Ferguson's former No 2 at Manchester United confirmed afterwards his stint in Tehran was over after three years. Gone: Iran coach Carlos Queiroz quit his role after their defeat by Bosnia and Herzegovina in Salvador . Heated: Former Manchester United No 2 Queiroz says he'll always have Iran football in his heart . Lonely job: Queiroz kicks a water bottle after Bosnia midfielder Miralem Pjanic put his side ahead 2-0 . He said: 'I've shown my commitment to this project, but I haven't received any new contract offer. 'It's been an honour for me to work for Iran, I've fallen in love with the country. But you can't have a marriage when only one side wants to commit. 'I waited for them to make an offer, but I haven't received anything, so today I've come here to say 'thank you' to those who gave me the opportunity to do this job. 'I will always have Iranian football, my players and the fans in my heart.' Bosnia didn't want to end their debut World Cup without a point after narrow losses to Argentina and Nigeria. Dzeko had seen a goal wrongly disallowed and also missed several chances in that game so he was relieved to shoot Bosnia ahead after 23 minutes with a left-footed strike outside the area. Deadlock broken: Edin Dzeko is muted in his celebration after opening the scoring for Bosnia and Herzegovina . Precision: The Manchester City striker put his nation in the lead with a sublime left-footed strike . Out of reach: Iran goalkeeper Alireza Haghighi is given no chance as Dzeko's shot goes in off the post . Finally: Dzeko scored with his 12th shot of the tournament after Bosnia's losses to Argentina and Nigeria . Rain on his parade: Queiroz said he hadn't been offered a new contract by Iran football . For once, he was left free by white-shirted defenders and took full advantage with a clinical finish that clipped off the inside of the post. Iran have been one of the best teams in Brazil in terms of defensive organisation but toothless up front which cost them in a 1-0 defeat against Argentina when Lionel Messi scored late on. The irony yesterday was that when they tried to push forward seeking the win to take them into the last 16, Jalal Hosseini needlessly gave the ball away and Dzeko reacted quickly to play in Pjanic to score. Ghoochannej finished smartly from six yards after good work from Javad Nekounam down the left to briefly give Iran some hope. Slotted: Roma midfielder Miralem Pjanic takes his chance to put Bosnia and Herzegovina 2-0 up against Iran . Cool and calm: Pjanic shoots as Bosnia go 2-0 up at Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador . Despair: Iran's Andranik Teymourian covers his face as Iran's chances of advancing evaporate . But that evaporated 120 seconds later when the overlapping Vršajevic fired in his first international goal from a tight angle to atone for an earlier miss he'd made from Dzeko's through-ball. An emotional Queiroz added: 'We pushed ourselves to the limit, mentally and physically and I'm very, very proud of them. Despite all our difficulties, we kept pushing and created some good chances, but Bosnia-Herzegovina were better today.' Bosnia's win was a great source of pride. A new nation of just four million people, their real victory was to reach the finals having overcome a war in the 1990s that killed 200,000 people. Even so, their goal celebrations were subdued as if they realised they should have probably been in the last 16 themselves. Back in it: Iran were given a glimmer of hope for Reza Ghoochannejhad finished on the far post . Broken down: The Charlton striker scored Iran's first goal of the tournament past Stoke's Asimir Begovic . Get on with it: Javad Nekounam grabs the ball quickly for the restart as Iran chased a victory . Back of the net: Ghoochannejhad's celebration is muted as Iran still need to score two goals to progress . Dzeko was criticised for wastefulness against Nigeria but he blamed the New Zealand referee Peter O'Leary for Bosnia losing that key game. Even so, several of their players will have enhanced their reputations in South America including £15million-rated Stoke City goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. Meanwhile, Iran will lament a lack of firewpower up front. With a World Cup record of one win in 12 - against the USA in 1998 - they lack belief to go with their technical ability. Salvador  maintained its reputation as the Brazilian venue for goals - four matches there have yielded 21.

"By . Joe Bernstein . The foreboding message on the door reads: Warning  - Reduced Oxygen Levels. Inside, warm air gusts out at 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) with 80 per cent humidity, as strength and conditioning coach Ian Aylward orders everyone to pedal harder and faster on their state-of-the-art Wattbikes, used by Team GB’s cycling champions in their training. Welcome to England’s special World Cup humidity chamber, their secret weapon in how to cope with the heat of the Amazon jungle when they face Italy on Saturday night. Conditions: England's Adam Lallana mops the sweat from his head in the heat and humidity of Manaus . Humidity: Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein (right) samples the Manaus-like conditions in the chamber . Thanks to this tiny room inside England's national training centre at St George's Park, manager Roy Hodgson is in charge of the best-prepared group of sportsmen ever to have left these islands. Wayne Rooney, Steve Gerrard and the rest of the 23- man squad were virtually encamped in there for four days up to the start of last week to undergo the physical preparation that could make the difference between glory and disaster in Brazil. There is just enough room to fit six bikes, a generator and the gadgets needed to set the temperature and humidity levels to replicate exactly what they can expect in their first game of the World Cup. ‘By the time the England boys had finished working, the glass was totally steamed up and people outside couldn’t see in through the window,’ said an impressed Aylward. ‘I think this chamber has been a massive help in preparing for the World Cup. The more you can be exposed to the environment that you are going to compete at, the better.’ Ready: The England squad train in Manaus ahead of their World Cup opener with Italy this evening . Pondering: England manager Roy Hodgson (right) looks on as Gary Cahill prepares for the match . Medical specialist Michael Davison, who runs a London Fifa medical centre of excellence, concurs: 'England have trained in five locations across four countries for the World Cup. But it's only the bike sessions in the 35 degree (Celsius) chambers that will have given the players the body shock of a wall of heat.' To try and illustrate the benefits, Aylward this week put a middle-aged and unfit hack- me - through my paces at the humidity chamber this week, accompanied by a proper former professional footballer, former Everton and Republic of Ireland footballer Lee Carsley. Able to regulate conditions inside the chamber, Aylward ordered us onto the bikes and to start pedaling at 70% per cent humidity – sweaty indeed, but still below the 80 per cent that England can expect in Manaus when the game kicks off at 6pm local time. After 95 seconds, the first bead of sweat appeared on my face. After three minutes, my heart rate was noticeably higher and there was a first overwhelming urge to swig at the cool bottle of water I was allowed as a non-athlete to take in for safety reasons. As breathing became a heavier, an unsympathetic Aylward only increased the temperature and humidity, perhaps remembering the local saying in Manaus: 'We’ve got two seasons here – summer and Hell'. Sweltering: The Group D opener between England and Italy takes place at the Arena da Amazonia . Hydrated: England's Ben Foster takes on fluids during training in Manaus ahead of the Italy match . The effect was like running in a sauna. I was glad Carsley was sweating even more than me, though to be fair he was peddling a lot harder too. The hard work that Hodgson's men put in before crossing The Atlantic will pay off according to Aylward, whose company Perform is based permanently at St George's Park. ‘I think it’s safe to say this is the best-prepared England team ever to go to a tournament because sports science in itself has developed massively even over the last four years,' he said. ‘No stone has been left unturned so the lads are in the best possible condition. We’ve studied conditions in Manaus because with any sport you need to spend time understanding the physical demands so you can set training parameters - physiological, duration, intensity and environment. 'And obviously in Manaus, environment is going to be key. ‘Normally it takes seven to 10 days to acclimatise to any sort of environmental changes so the work they have done here is certainly going to benefit the team and the medical staff.’ Afterwards, a profusely-sweating Carsley had some encouraging news for England fans as he clambered off the bike: 'That was tough - I wasn't one of the best at Everton at fitness and aerobic tests, but Wayne Rooney was very good. Maestro: England will have to deal with the class of Andrea Pirlo (centre) in the sweltering conditions . Hot and bothered: Italy's Mario Balotelli wipes his wet forehead during training in Manaus . 'Alan Stubbs was probably the best, some of the foreign lads, but Rooney was fine. He was a fit lad.' The level of detail in England’s planning before they left St George’s Park for their final warm-up games in Miami is astonishing. Every individual player has been tested and given their own sweat profile. It helps determine how much liquid, and exactly what kind, each of them will be given during the Italy game. Aylward explains: ‘Everyone has a separate sweat profile and different electrolyte balance. Whilst it is important to balance the water intake to the amount of water you’re losing through sweating, the most important thing is the electrolytes that we lose as part of that sweat. ‘We need vital things like sodium chloride, potassium, magnesium, they all play a part in how the nerves conduct.From a cognitive point of view, a mental point of view, once those stores diminish, it can massively effect your performance.’ The general advice for players is to refuel little and often, around 200mls every 20 minutes. Too much in one go and you’ll get cramps. Up to speed: England's players are prepared for the conditions after using the humidity chamber . Fitness: England are taken on a warm up session in Manaus as they familiarise themselves with conditions . Fifa will allow three-minute water breaks once temperatures go above 36 degrees but different players will get different drinks, depending on how well they retain sodium chloride and other electrolytes in the body. The Wattbikes has the facility to determine how strong the right side of each player’s body is compared to the left and what needs extra work. Near to the chamber and other cardiovascular gym equipment, a £250,000 underwater treadmill at St George’s gave extra help to any players who ended the season with particular aches and pains. Mercifully, Aylward allowed me to stop pedalling after 20 energy-sapping minutes in the humidity chamber. One trusts the England players managed a longer spell than that if they’re expected to chase Andrea Pirlo for 90 minutes on Saturday.","England used the humidity chamber to replicate conditions of Manaus .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Sergio Garcia could look back on a battle well fought throughout Sunday: ‘It looks like I’m finally growing up now,’ concluded the 34-year-old Spaniard. It sounded like even he would agree that the process had taken some time. But this was one of his Major near-misses from which he could genuinely take pride, certainly more than was the case when he was in contention at this same course eight years ago. It was on that sunbaked afternoon at Royal Liverpool that he came out dressed from head to toe like a canary and subsided woefully as Tiger Woods romped to the title. Afterwards the American is said to have texted to a friend that ‘I just bludgeoned Tweetie Pie’. VIDEO Scroll down for highlights . Appreciative: Sergio Garcia acknowledges the crowd during the final day of the Open at Royal Liverpool . Garcia was not there to be swatted away this time, and he never allowed Rory McIlroy to relax, to the point where he forced himself from a starting point of seven shots back to get within two on the 13th and 14th holes. His closing 66 ensured this was never a procession as fortune favoured the brave, and he rode the odd decent bounce to make life uncomfortable for McIlroy playing in the pair behind. ‘I wanted to make him feel it a little bit and see how he would respond,’ said Garcia. ‘Every time I got closer he kept making one more birdie. ‘It’s not easy when you know you can’t make any mistakes, there are so many things that need to go right for you to shoot at least eight or nine under. But at least I’m proud of the way I played and I’m happy.’ Hand on heart: Garcia was proud with how he played and happy with his performance . VIDEO The Open Championship: Final Round . He also admitted that he had the odd lucky break, such as when his ball rebounded off the grandstand on the 12th and fractionally missed the bunker on the 13th. It was a far cry from some of the self-pitying inquests he has conducted after coming close in the Majors, when either the world seemed to have been against him or he had declared that he was simply not good enough, as happened at the 2012 Masters. Garcia is from the Jimmy White school of sporting bridesmaids and this was the 19th time he has finished in the top ten in what is already his 63rd appearance at one of the big four championships. In golf, specifically, he belongs to the same bracket as Lee Westwood and Colin Montgomerie, particularly as all three have contrastingly excelled under the steamhammer pressure the Ryder Cup brings. Unlike the latter for sure and, you now suspect, the former, he still has a chance of breaking his duck when it comes to the pursuit of the highest individual honours. Up and over: Garcia plays from a bunker on the 17th green in Hoylake on Sunday . Garcia emerged with far more credit than his playing partner Dustin Johnson, who not only failed to mount a charge in shooting level par but spat his way round this corner of the Wirral Peninsula, just as he had done on the putting green. The Spaniard signalled his intention with two birdies in the first three holes, and then allowed himself a glance at the scoreboard on the eighth as McIlroy wobbled behind him. A 12-foot putt helped him eagle the tenth and his challenge only expired when went into the bunker on the 15th, and his first attempt to get out hit the wall and rebounded back in. His problem going forward is that, having been denied by Woods in his pomp, he now has to confront another outstanding rival in McIlroy. But it may be time to start loving Garcia, even at those times when he is not wrapped in Europe’s Ryder Cup flag.","Sergio Garcia pushed eventual Open winner Rory McIlroy close on Sunday .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . At this most democratic of Open Championships, the warm connection between Phil Mickelson and the fans is quite something to see. ‘All right there Phil, lad,’ was one greeting shouted from Hoylake’s bulging galleries on Friday morning as his lolloping stride came down the sixth fairway in his stellar grouping that also featured Ernie Els and Bubba Watson. Mickelson is from southern California but . has sufficient understanding of the Merseyside accent to recognise . cordiality when he hears it, and responded with a smile and a ‘How ya . doin?’ Upbeat: Mickelson played with the purpose that suggests he believes he is capable of repeating 2013 triumph . In many sports, defending champions are less preferred than underdogs but not the 44-year-old American, whose general willingness to engage adds to the perception that with the advent of middle age he has matured into a good egg. He has a man-of-the-people quality that particularly resonates in an area where golf has a strong blue-collar following. The Cinderella story of local qualifier John Singleton being a factory worker has attracted worldwide attention, but there are plenty of men on the shopfloor who enjoy the sport in these parts. Mickelson got huge support from the bumper crowds, but then he hardly failed to entertain, mixing dazzling mastery of the gusty winds with the odd basic error that showed that he is human like the rest of us. While Els laboured and Watson spent much of the time with a quizzical look on his face, Mickelson played with the purpose that suggests he believes he is capable of repeating his triumph of Muirfield 2013. Focused: Bubba Watson and Phil Mickelson tee off on the fifth during the second round on Friday . His morale going into the weekend was lifted by draining a 10-foot putt for birdie on the 18th. Of rediscovering his best form, he said: ‘It’s really close to being good. I’m striking it so good. And if I putt the way I putted the last nine holes then this weekend I’m going to have a good chance. If the wind stays up then I absolutely have a chance.’ Mickelson hit a miraculous second shot to within an inch on the fourth, but his mood had darkened after the seventh, where he missed a birdie putt, and he was still spewing on the next hole, which led him to make a hash of a chip that also cost him. Consequently there was not much banter around the turn, especially after he lost his ball off the tee on the 10th, Hoylake’s best birdie chance. Amends were made when he made an eagle from his provisional, thus saving his par. He carded a two-under 70, leaving him level par after the first two rounds. The years, the victories and the vagaries of life outside golf have, he said afterwards, made it easier to come to terms with not getting the better of the draw. ‘You accept that as part of the tournament. The conditions I had didn’t allow for it and, rather than force it, I have to play as well as I can with the conditions. ‘I might be seven or eight back but if I try to force it then I’m going to be missing the cut.’ That was the fate of Els, whose Open looked ill-fated from the moment on Thursday’s opening hole when he struck an elderly spectator. Trying to come to terms with the switch back to an orthodox putter from the ghastly broomhandle is not proving easy, and the previous evening he did not leave the putting green until 7.30pm, long after his finish. Struggle: Ernie Els and Bubba Watson failed to make the cut after two disappointing rounds . His drive off the fifth could have caused a similar accident to day one, because it was so far left it only just cleared the stand for the seventh green before landing in the gorse, sending him back to try again. Before the tournament Els was effusive about his love for Royal Liverpool, a place where he won as a junior, but he skulked off last night without explaining himself, having scored a 73 for a two-round eight-over 152. Watson rarely got out his pink driver and a bogey on the last was likely to mean him missing the cut, despite being level for the day and four over for the tournament. He pledged to go back to his digs and commiserate with housemate Webb Simpson, another early departure. ‘I can’t wait to get back home to see my wife and child,’ he said. Unlike Mickelson, who prepared at last week’s Scottish Open, Watson has been out of America for all of seven days. That is clearly more than enough.","Phil Mickelson drained a 10-foot putt for birdie on the 18th .

For this is a mini-museum in the immaculately refurbished clubhouse that pays tribute to its most famous son, who on Sunday was crowned Open champion at Hoylake. Somehow they now need to find space in the shrine to McIlroy’s career for a replica Claret Jug to go alongside that of the US Open trophy, his Ryder Cup golf bag, MBE medal and the picture of him winning the World Under-10 Championship. VIDEO Scroll down the watch The Open Championship: Final Round . Aloft: Rory McIlroy holds the Claret Jug after winning the Open Championship at Hoylake on Sunday . Sealed with a kiss: Rory McIlroy finally gets his hands - and lips - on the Claret Jug . VIDEO The Open Championship: Final Round . Young champion: McIlroy grew up playing at the Holywood Golf Club in Northern Ireland . Yet, nobody was getting carried away here, not even down in the pleasant town he calls home, nestled by Belfast Lough, where the only signs of celebration were montages of the local hero in the hardware store and estate agent’s window. Back at the club, members reminisced not just about the young Rory but the whole McIlroy clan who, over three generations, have become deeply woven into its fabric. Jimmy Curtis was a close friend of Rory’s grandfather, Jimmy, who worked the cranes at the Harland and Wolff shipyard. ‘We were in the club’s snooker team together and we got our picture in the paper because all seven players were called Jimmy,’ recalled Mr Curtis, the team’s only survivor. Jimmy McIlroy died suddenly after his retirement, leaving three sons - Brian, Colin and Gerry, the latter the father of Rory who also worked behind the club bar. Chip out: McIlroy in the rough during his fourth round at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club . Lead from the font: The Northern Irishman finished the week on -17, two shots clear of his nearest rivals . Colin and Gerry are both up on the board as past club champions, as is a 16-year-old Rory. Past president Barry Dobbin showed the area by the bar where Rory, aged just two, would chip balls with a tiny club. ‘He was quiet and very well mannered - a nice boy,’ said Dobbin. ‘He was already good at seven and his father wanted him to join. I proposed him but the problem was that at the time the minimum age limit was 12. 'We had to change the club’s constitution to allow him to join, but it was a very close vote.’ A legacy of that was the large number of schoolchildren playing competitions there yesterday. ‘It seems to be a magnet for young golfers now,’ added Dobbin. ‘We also have a lot more Americans visiting here. They want to see where Rory came from and a few have become overseas members.’ Winner: Rory McIlroy has won his third Grand Slam at the age of 25, becoming only the third to do so . Embrace: The champion celebrates with his mum after securing the win at Hoylake on Sunday . Club general manager Paul Gray was the professional when the future superstar was just learning the game. ‘At eight Rory’s technique was very polished and by 13 he was probably better than me, to be honest,’ said Gray. ‘He used to come and play pro-ams with me, and I will always remember a shot he played at the Hilton course at Templepatrick that suggested he would be something special. ‘There was a fierce wind blowing across the hole and the pin was tucked away. He hit this four-iron from about 200 yards and somehow got it to hold its line to get to within a couple of feet. ‘It was the sort of shot that told you he would be outstanding - it was just a question of how good.’ Others, like his father, clearly felt the same, which is why some placed long-term bets on the young McIlroy to become Open champion by 26. One of them, Wilbur Walker, is said to have collected £25,000 after Sunday and, with the subject of his foresight returning to Belfast on Monday, had cause for a huge celebration. Eyed up: McIlroy trying to maintain a six-shot lead going into the final day . 1989: Born on May 4 in Holywood, Northern Ireland. 2005: Plays in his first professional European Tour event as a 16-year-old at The Forest of Arden.

Tears filled the eyes of John Singleton as he stood on the first tee on Thursday, in front of friends, family and workmates from the nearby resin mixing factory that had been temporarily closed so they could follow the action. Even . the coach from his three years spent at American college in Illinois . was there — Dave Smith having flown in at the last minute to watch his . former pupil. High times: Local qualifier John Singleton made the most of his appearance at The Open . Man at work: Local qualifier Singleton on his day job as a forklift driver . VIDEOVIDEO The Open: First Round highlights . After the raucous reception for the man who drives forklift trucks at Advanced Electrical Varnishings came the nerves, as the dream for the local qualifier became reality. He had to back off because someone sneezed and then, to the loudest cheer of the morning, he striped it long and straight down the middle of the fairway to get his unlikely appearance at a Major championship off to the perfect start. Five hours later he was back after what he described as ‘the time of my life’, despite a six-over-par back nine having eroded an impressively solid start and seen him finish on 78. Special: Singleton was followed by friends, family and workmates from the nearby resin mixing factory . His performance is likely to mean that it . will all be over for Singleton by Saturday night and that a return to the day . job beckons next week. But nothing could dilute his enthusiasm after his . round, or that of his mates who had followed him round in the Hoylake . sunshine. ‘It feels like I shot six . under, it was something special I can keep for the rest of my life,’ he . said. ‘I’m not some big-time Charlie who is going to win. I wanted to . enjoy myself and soak it all in. My boss paid for all of my workmates . who wanted to come. I had a beer with him last night and he told me he . has never wanted anyone not to come back to work so much on a Monday.’ So . informal was the atmosphere that Singleton’s friends scrounged some sun . lotion from him on a day when the Wirral peninsula had a somewhat . Mediterranean feel. ‘They told me to throw them some suncream,’ he . revealed. ‘I said ""I’m playing the Open"", they said . 'No, throw us some, . we are burning”. They kept it as well!’ The start had provided a . poignant Open moment. ‘I had tears in my eyes but I was more focused on . my shaking hands,’ he said. ‘As it turns out, I hit one of the my . best-ever shots under pressure.’ The front nine was a white knuckle ride as he clung on to level par. At . times it was almost Ballesteros-like, as Singleton repeatedly got . himself into trouble but then  rescued par, often through delicate chips . from just off the green. Only when he double bogeyed on the twelfth by . taking two to get out of the rough was he derailed, although he can . always hold dear the knowledge that he was once ahead of Tiger Woods in . the Open. Singelton’s fiance Lucy Johnson is expecting their first . child in six weeks and consequently restricted herself to watching him . play only five holes. Focused: Singleton enjoyed the experience despite dropping six shots on the back nine . It was she who encouraged him to try and enter . the qualifying event at Hillside that led to Singleton swapping his . forklift truck for the massive Hoylake galleries. She said: ‘I was unbelievably proud of him on the first tee although I was a nervous wreck. ‘I kind of enjoyed it, I really enjoyed seeing him out there. I’m not a golf fan really, but I encouraged him to do this. ‘He . felt like he had unfinished business in terms of his golf career.

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Twenty townsfolk from Lismore in Australia, home of Tiger Woods's playing partner Rhein Gibson, were at Hoylake wearing T-shirts emblazoned 'Living the dream with Rhein'. To play in a major on a Saturday alongside a 14-time winner is a fine achievement, although for Woods it might be a case of 'Living the reality with Rhein'. This is it right now for Tiger, scraping over the line to make the cut and going out the next day with fellow non-contenders Gibson and the albeit precocious talent of  Jordan Spieth. VIDEO Woods holds hands up after poor display . Disappointed: Woods admits he has made too many mistakes in his first Major back since surgery . Before this event began the 38-year-old American told the usual assembled throng of media that it would not be acceptable to finish anything other than first. Another unacceptable week, then, although it is increasingly stretching credibility for him, or anyone else, to believe this kind of thing. It suits Woods and golf in general to perpetuate the myth but the hard fact is that you have to go back to the 2008 US Open for the last time he mounted the victor's podium at any of the big four events. Imagine Roger Federer not having won a Grand Slam for six years and still retaining a similar aura. Under normal circumstances Woods would have been one of the early starters, the undercard attracting morning spectators before the likes of Rory McIlroy got under way. Help: Woods and his caddie Joe LaCava discuss where to play his drive on the 13th tee at Hoylake . Heading for the green: Woods plays from the fairway on the sixth hole during his round of 73 . VIDEO Woods holds hands up after poor display . Instead he was last off on the 10th tee as part of the reshuffle and the non-event of his eventual one-over- par round was summed up by its conclusion. Rather than soaking in the applause down the horseshoe arena of the 18th he finished out on the par-three ninth, before a minibus took him and his partners down a service road and back to the front of the main clubhouse. Any momentum he has gained since Thursday has been halted by some dreadful hashes, such as the double and triple bogeys on the reverse back nine. 'I'm starting to get the flow of the round, the flow of playing again but I've just made too many mistakes,' he said. 'You can't run up high scores like that and expect to contend, especially when the conditions are this benign. 'I've made two double bogeys and two triples, that adds up to a lot of shots. On top of that I missed a bunch of opportunities for birdies and so I'm three over par.' Off-balance: Woods watches a putt during his third round, and, right, follows the flight of his 10th tee shot . Spot of bother: The American hits from a bunker on the 15th hole on Saturday . Waiting: Woods hopes to iron out the errors in his game that caused him to drop shots this week . Twenty-five majors have now passed since his US Open triumph, although he has missed six of those through injury, two of which have been caused by the operations that make it look less and less likely that he will surpass Jack Nicklaus's tally of 18 majors. The evidence increasingly suggests he will not pass that milestone. In Nicklaus's main window of winning all but one of his biggest trophies between 1962 and 1980, the longest he went between claiming a major was 10 events, but for Woods that hiatus is now up to 19. If there is any consolation here it is that Saturday's damp conditions were the kind to encourage discomfort for someone returning from back surgery, but there at least does not appear to be any specific handicap coming from that. What is inarguable is that he still exercises a fascination and hold over the sport unlike anyone else. What could be termed the fire hydrant and cocktail waitress factor might have something to do with it, and the galleries still strained their necks for a sight of the living legend. Woods - still commanding his own dedicated 'Tigercast' channel on ESPN - birdied his first two holes to go to level par and at the turn there was the promise of a concerted climb up the leaderboard. Yet he has found the second hole a particular problem and, after bogeying it on the first two days, went one worse when a double resulted from finding the bunker. He lost his ball in the gorse on the seventh (his 16th) and the reload went into the opposite rough, costing him the triple. The serenity he talked about experiencing when winning at Hoylake in 2006 seems far away as he resumes at tied 58th, and it will take a strong final round to beat his season's best so far of finishing an unacceptable 25th.","The three-time Open champion finished his third day with a three-over total .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Ten years ago at the precocious age of 13 Tommy Fleetwood was first picked for Lancashire’s senior golf team and a suitable playing partner was sought for him. That turned out to be fellow Southport lad Matthew Baldwin, five years his senior, and on Thursday afternoon — playing within three groups of each other — they will line up for the first time in the starting field of The Open. With Wirral factory worker John Singleton, the 30-year-old Cinderella figure at this year’s event, they make up a three-strong Merseyside contingent at Hoylake. And with due respect to golf’s finest forklift truck driver, the two younger men are much more likely to play in future Opens. Local boy: Tommy Fleetwood will tee off at the 143rd Open for the first time at Holylake . Inside knowledge: Tommy Fleetwood has played Royal Liverpool a lot as an amateur . Fleetwood, now 23, recalls his shyness when he first met Baldwin: ‘We were playing against Britain’s Curtis Cup squad (the women’s amateur team) in a practice match. Basically, I was thrown in. He looked after me.’ Thursday is another debut for Fleetwood, reckoned to be a seriously good prospect, and again he is glad to have a local connection as he tackles his first major. ‘I’ve played Royal Liverpool a lot as an amateur so I know the course well,’ said Fleetwood. ‘The only problem is that I don’t have a clue which hole I’m on because they’ve changed the numbers.’ Hoylake alters its sequence for The Open so the usual 17th and 18th holes become the first and second, allowing the par-five 16th to become the dramatic closing hole. Southport might be thinly populated, given the numbers heading down to the Wirral to support its two most prominent golfers. Scouse proud: Merseyside's Matthew Baldwin will bring the crowds from Liverpool . Familiar faces: Matthew Baldwin partnered a young Tommy Fleetwood 10 years ago . The local football club may have long since lost its League status but Southport is a golfing hotbed boasting many  top-class courses. ‘It’s not called England’s golf coast for nothing,’ said Baldwin, whose grandfather Ron Ryder played rugby league for Great Britain, and in the Challenge Cup final for Warrington. ‘We’ve got Royal Birkdale, Southport and Ainsdale, Hillside, Formby, West Lancs is not far away — all top courses. I should mention Hesketh too, because I grew up in a house behind the 17th green and that’s where I learned to play. ‘I wouldn’t say we push each other. Tommy is younger — he’s a proper talent and self-driven. Links golf suits us. We’ve played a lot here, so there’s no reason we can’t do well.’ And Fleetwood believes they will not be the last locals to make the grade. ‘There are quite a few juniors about where we’re from and some of them are good,’ he said. ‘It can’t do any harm to have two of us playing at The Open.’ Against the odds: Forklift truck driver John Singleton is a 1000-1 shot to win The Open . Do the write thing: John Singleton signs autographs for spectators during his practice round . Both men will have friends and family in the gallery but they are unlikely to have as much support as 1000-1 shot Singleton, who works a few miles away in Moreton for AEV Varnishes and came through qualifying at Hillside. The factory employs 25 people and half will be given the day off today to watch and half tomorrow — all hoping their colleague makes the cut and is still around at the weekend. Singleton — who spends his working day driving the forklifts and mixing resin — had planned to volunteer as a Hoylake marshal. Instead, he tees off this morning with American Peter Uihlein and Scotland’s Marc Warren. Depending on the next few days, Singleton may consider giving professional golf another go, having once tried via the American college system. ‘I’ve got nothing to lose,’ he said. ‘No-one expects anything from me, so I’m just going to enjoy myself.’ VIDEO Stunning Hoylake course preview .","Liverpool men Tommy Fleetwood, Matthew Baldwin and John Singleton will play at 143rd The Open at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Holylake .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . It was 16 years ago at New York’s Madison Square Garden that the last best-of-five match was played in women’s tennis, with Martina Hingis beating Lindsay Davenport in what turned out to be four sets. The idea has not been tried since that meeting at the WTA Tour year-end Championships, but in the wake of a crushingly one-sided women’s Wimbledon final, the possibility of women going the same length as the men has been raised. Judy Murray has suggested that the best-of-five format from semi-finals onwards might be the best antidote to the kind of 55-minute hammering of Eugenie Bouchard by Petra Kvitova, which left some fans feeling shortchanged after paying £124 for a ticket on Saturday. Hard work? Novak Djokovic (right) played five sets while Petra Kvitova breezed to the title . Champions: Djokovic and Kvitova pose with their trophies following their Wimbledon victories . The comparison with Sunday’s four-hour epic between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer also stirred up the debate about the equal pay that is now a fixture at Grand Slams. The idea of extending women’s matches was gaining little support as Wimbledon closed down on Monday. ‘I can see that it wasn’t great value for money on this occasion, but it isn’t a change I would like to see,’ said Sue Barker, former French Open champion. ‘Eugenie was blown away a bit as was Sabine Lisicki last year, but then we have just had an excellent French Open final a few weeks ago (Maria Sharapova beat Simona Halep over three hours). ‘I’m hoping that this new generation of players will make it more competitive at the top. Also the three week gap between Roland Garros and Wimbledon next year will make a difference - you are going to see players more comfortable on the surface.’ Time for change? Judy Murray has suggested the best-of-five format should return from semi-finals onwards . With women’s tennis fought out from baseline to baseline, the extra pounding the already stressed show courts would take from longer matches was a concern raised by Britain’s former world No 5 Jo Durie. ‘The women have never objected to playing best of five and they are certainly capable of doing it,’ she said. ‘But the women’s game is  different to the men’s and women are made differently. Three sets is a good fit to me. There is a danger of a knee-jerk reaction.’ Former British No 1 Annabel Croft agreed, saying: ‘They tried it in New York and it didn’t work. Women’s matches tend to take longer and there were TV scheduling problems.’ While there have been many one-sided women’s Grand Slam finals in recent years it is a myth that they have all been that way. The last two US Open finals have gone to a deciding set, as have three of the last five Australian Open finals. Last time: Lindsay Davenport and Martina Hingis played in the last best-of-five match 16 years ago . Yet there is no escaping that . straight-set climaxes to women’s championships have become commonplace. Of the combined last 24 women’s finals at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and . the US Open, 20 have been over in two sets. David Felgate, coach of one of the women’s game’s rising stars, Croatian Donna Vekic, is also against the move. ‘It would alter the whole dynamic of the matches. Someone like Donna is conditioned to play best of three. Playing a potential five is very different. If you do it for two rounds you have to do it for all seven.’ And that, as pointed out by ex-Great Britain player and Sky commentator Barry Cowan, would bring enormous challenges. ‘You would have to start early to fit it all in, especially at Wimbledon, and you could have players walking out to empty stands. ‘The argument about equal prize-money because they play shorter matches is a non-starter for me, as it’s about quality and enjoyment. How could people who like tennis not have been impressed by the quality of Kvitova’s ball striking?’ For most people the calibre of matches and the narrative at the top of men’s tennis has way outshone the women in the current era of Federer, Rafael Nadal and Co. It is why men’s final tickets, with the solitary add-on of the mixed doubles final, were priced at £148 compared to Saturday’s £124 for the women’s, which also included the women’s doubles and an outstanding men’s doubles final. The difference in unofficial prices was far greater. In five years things may have changed considerably, with the women’s game likely to regain lost ground in public affection as male superstars fade away. Regardless, any reversal of the equal prize-money policy is never going to happen.","Judy Murray suggests five set matches could be reintroduced to women's tennis from semi-finals onwards .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . As children, Rhys Enoch and his younger brother Ben would play golf and kid each other that a certain putt would be to win the Claret Jug. When he crouches over a six-footer at Hoylake some time this week Rhys might think back to those days, in the achingly sad knowledge that his brother will not be here to see if he can hole it. In May 2009 Ben was killed in a car crash while travelling up to the Lytham Trophy, one of the country’s top amateur events. Outsider: Rhys Enoch made it to The Open after qualifying through a play-off . He was 19 and, like Rhys, a Welsh . international reckoned to be an outstanding prospect. The memory of him . will be all the more vivid tomorrow when Rhys tees up for his Open . debut, having realised his dream of making the field through qualifying . at Woburn earlier this month. Of . course, there will be butterflies, although these have a completely . different meaning for the Truro-based Enoch family compared with other . people. ‘My mum is quite a . spiritual person and she relates the butterfly to Ben,’ said Rhys after . completing a practice round at Royal Liverpool. Going up: Enoch has rubbed shoulders with the likes of Jason Day this week, who was his practice partner . He . took it as an omen when he saw one on the second hole of his second . round at qualifying as he battled to get one of the precious spots for . this week’s tournament. ‘This . butterfly came to rest by the hole and it didn’t move,’ he said. ‘Naturally, I thought of him then and I thought of him again when it . came to the play-off hole later.’ With three players in the eliminator chasing one place at The Open, Rhys, 26, chipped in from 20 yards to win it. ‘Whether . that had something to do with it I am not sure but I do feel that Ben . is still there,’ he said. ‘There will be times I think of him this week . because I’ve achieved the dream that we and so many other young golfers . have.’ Tinged with sadness: Enoch's adventure will take place without his brother Ben who passed away in 2009 . Rhys was on a golf . scholarship at East Tennessee State University in the USA — and Ben had . already secured a place to join him there — when the accident happened . on an A road in Herefordshire. ‘I . actually had a really good summer golf-wise after he died,’ said Rhys. ‘The two things I thought would be difficult, playing golf and sleeping, . were actually not difficult at all, perhaps because they were both a . type of escape. Golf took my mind off everything. ‘Maybe . it helped then and still does because if you miss a putt you realise . there are much worse things in life that can happen.’ Struggle: Enoch, ranked 1,045 in the world, has also had to contend with the debilitating condition ME . Getting . to this point has been all the more difficult because Rhys has also had . to contend with the debilitating condition ME. It has contributed to . him not yet earning his European Tour card and his current modest world . ranking of 1,045. ‘I got . glandular fever in the summer of 2012 and it seemed to stem from that,’ Rhys said. ‘There are times when all you want to do is sleep, it was . really bad for three months but at least I got to watch a lot of the . London Olympics. It has been a constant battle but the last six months . have been much better. ‘There is not much you can do about it. I just try to eat well and boost my immune system as much as possible.’ Enoch, . who is attached to Celtic Manor and now lives in Cardiff, had world No 6 .

If Novak Djokovic had his doubters after losing three straight Grand Slam finals then so did the man who coached him to the Wimbledon title on Sunday - Boris Becker. So for the 46-year-old German there was a particular pleasure in proving wrong those who believed his appointment was a gimmick, or merely an attempt to copy Andy Murray in his choice of Ivan Lendl. Becker came out on top of Sunday’s coaching face-off with his old rival Stefan Edberg, but he believes that today’s stars hiring those of yesteryear was always going to make sense. Been there, done it: Boris Becker believes today's stars like Novak Djokovic should learn from the greats . ‘Stefan in my opinion knows a lot more about tennis than 99 per cent of the people involved in tennis and I’m not far behind,’ said Becker as he celebrated at the Champions’ Dinner at the Royal Opera House. ‘I think it was time for the top players to understand that if they want to improve. There is an understanding Stefan and I have about the sport, that it’s not about the first or second point, it’s about those moments when it’s about winning and losing. ‘I am including Ivan in that list too. It’s obvious what Ivan brought to Murray and I’m surprised that people were surprised.’ Becker said that his arrangement with Djokovic, the now restored world No 1, could develop into a long one. ‘As long as we have fun with it,’ he added. ‘As long as he thinks I bring something to the table, as long as I feel I can bring something he hasn’t heard. If it’s successful, if my wife allows me to be travelling like that and behave like a 25-year-old, then sure it could. Novak and I have an unbelievable amount of respect for one another. But friends? I would rather not go with him on a bachelor weekend in Ibiza, put it that way. ‘I remember how I felt (winning Slams) and this hasn’t happened for a long time that I remembered how I felt on the court. I noticed emotions that I haven’t felt in a long time and that’s a driving force.’ Emotional reunion: Djokovic hugs coach and three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker after his victory .","Novak Djokovic wins Wimbledon having been coached by Boris Becker .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . New light can be shed today on one of Wimbledon’s mysteries of 2014 — Andy Murray’s supposed cry during his quarter-final exit referring to something ‘five minutes’ before the match started. Credible sources close to those in the Murray camp, at whom it was directed, have told Sportsmail that the two courtside photographers who initially reported this slightly misheard what was shouted. What he actually declared was ‘Forty-five minutes before the match’ (expletive deleted). It is a significant difference that could explain a lot. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andy Murray do Grigor Dimitrov's hair in a funny clip . Unhappy: Sportsmail understands Andy Murray did not launch an X-rated rant towards his own team . Frustrated: The courtside photographers misheard Murray as he shouted 'forty-five minutes' X-rated: Murray was thought to have been heard swearing towards his own team at Wimbledon . Wimbledon officials and Murray himself have been adamant that there was nothing unusual in the immediate build-up to the match or the ‘call’ to the two players that they would soon be required to report for Centre Court duty. At that time Murray would presumably have been sitting quietly in the locker room getting his equipment together. All contact and preparation with his team would have been done and dusted. However, 45 minutes beforehand he is likely to have been going through tactics and points to remember with his coaches Amelie Mauresmo and Dani Vallverdu. It is said that his cry of frustration was connected with a matter associated to that, possibly an instruction about his serve and ball toss. It was therefore no more than the usual outburst of annoyance about something random that Murray often delivers at his bench. Seasoned observers of the British No 1 are used to witnessing this sort of thing around the world. The habit was largely curtailed when Ivan Lendl was present and has generally been seen less at Wimbledon than anywhere else. While there is a danger of reading far too much into this one incident, it does highlight the current issues with his coaching team. Another day has passed without any announcement of how he plans to proceed with Mauresmo. Back to the drawing board: Murray's  coach Amelie Mauresmo looks on as her player lost in straight sets . Murray is still figuring out exactly how it will work long-term with the French former champion, with whom he met last Thursday before she went away on holiday. He needs to assess how she will fit in with long-serving staff like Vallverdu and Jez Green, who have expressed unease at the situation. Meanwhile, Serena Williams, whose bizarre behaviour in the doubles was another mysterious Wimbledon occurrence, has recovered from her ‘viral illness’ and is still entered into this week’s Bastad Open in Sweden. It is unclear whether she will be accompanied by coach Patrick Mouratoglou, who is said to have ended the personal side of their relationship just prior to Wimbledon. Where do you go from here? Murray must decide on how he moves forward after Wimbledon . Frustrated? Murray must decide whether he continues with Mauresmo after unsuccessfully defending his Wimbledon title at SW19 with her as his main coach .","Andy Murray shouted 'forty-five minutes before the match' - NOT 'f***ing five minutes before the match'

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Amelie Mauresmo celebrates her 35th birthday on Saturday and so, keen to get home for that, she did not want to waste time before discussing her future together with Andy Murray. As they chatted on Thursday, the subject of travel is bound to have come up because that is likely to be the only obstacle to the continuation of their fledgling player-coach partnership. In the wake of his shattering quarter-final defeat to Grigor Dimitrov, Murray made clear that, in principle, he wanted them to continue. Tough to take: Andy Murray crashed out of Wimbledon at the quarter-final stage . Slow start: Murray plans to stick with Amelie Mauresmo despite his Wimbledon exit . The intention was always that this was a long-term partnership which is having a trial period, not a trial period which might develop into something long-term. But the dethroned champion also stated that he needs to go to Miami quickly to start preparing for   Masters level events in America next month that have now assumed more importance. He seemed to suggest allowances could be made in future for Mauresmo’s location, but not at this moment: ‘I would say it would be more likely that I will go to Miami just because of the conditions,’ he said. ‘I am not against changing or going to train in different places but I think for this period, just because of conditions in Cincinnati and at the US Open, Miami is a good place to prepare for that. But at other times of the year there is no reason why I couldn’t go somewhere else.’ Time to regroup: Murray heads to the US next for the hard court season . Mauresmo wants to keep her travelling to a minimum, so it could be she would not hook up with him until before his next scheduled event, the Canadian Open in Toronto which starts on August 4. There have been several years in the past — the last two for example — when Murray has turned up in Canada and Cincinnati and treated them like glorified training weeks. He acknowledged this needs to change if he is to alter the pattern that has developed of him playing well in Grand Slams before turning in a performance of surprising ineptitude in the quarter or semi-finals. ‘It’s been a year since I won an event and the best way to prepare for majors is by winning a lot of matches and I have not done that. In Doha (in January) I didn’t do that, I didn’t do that before the French, I didn’t win Queen’s. ‘It hasn’t stopped me from having good . runs in the Slams but to have great ones it helps if you have a good . build-up. I lost to Roger in Australia and Rafa in Paris. I felt I was . playing good tennis for 10 days, moving well, my game was in good shape. Work to do: Mauresmo must hit the practice courts to address Murray's slide . Sinking feeling: Murray has not won an event for a year . 'Then I just had a poor day. I don’t want to over-analyse but I know if I make some improvements, when you have those off-days you can still find a way to win.’ The statistics back up his own assertion that he has not improved since last Wimbledon. Once the tournament was over last year he was world No 2 and had earned 5,160 ranking points from the start of 2013, winning four titles. This year he has no titles and amassed only 2,290 points. His new ranking of No 10, to be announced on Monday, is falsely depressed by missing the last two months of the season and will likely pick up soon enough, but it shows how far he has left to climb back to the elite group, which is reshuffling itself. Downward spiral: Murray will slip to tenth in the rankings when they are announced on Monday . ‘I need to go away for a few days, think about a few things, talk to my team about how I’m going to get better,’ he said. ‘If you get too down about things you waste time and the US Open will come round pretty quickly. ‘I need to make sure that when I get back on the practice court my head is clear and I have a clear plan for the next five weeks before I start playing matches again.’ Assuming he and Mauresmo continue, there are two things they must address: his second serve and his mindset going into big matches. With Ivan Lendl, the second serve was shored up to the point where even Novak Djokovic could not properly attack it in the Wimbledon final. Problem area: Mauresmo needs to work on Murray's second serve . 1) Rafael Nadal - 12,670 pts . 2) Novak Djokovic - 11,850 . Finalist: 12,330 Winner: 13,130 . (Will become world No 1 if he wins Wimbledon) 3) Stan Wawrinka - 5,770 . 4) Roger Federer - 5,620 . Finalist: 6,100 Winner: 6,900 . (Will become world No 3 if he reaches final) 5) Tomas Berdych - 4,410 . 6) Milos Raonic - 3,920 . Finalist: 4,400 Winner: 5,200 . (Will become world No 5 if he wins Wimbledon) 7) David Ferrer - 3,875 . 8) Juan Martin Del Porto - 3,360 . 9) Grigor Dimitrov - 3,270 . Finalist: 3,750 Winner: 4,550 . (Will become world No 8 if he reaches final, world No 5 if he wins Wimbledon) 10) Andy Murray - 3,040 . Too often recently it has been wafted in at sub-80mph, and someone of Dimitrov’s quality made him pay. It also appeared that he went into the match assuming or hoping the Bulgarian would not play well, despite him having just won at Queen’s Club. Murray retreated towards his counter-punching ways rather than going forward and seizing the initiative. It was a bit like his surprise 2009 semi-final loss to Andy Roddick. Lendl managed to get him to ignore his natural defensive instincts and be more positive, Mauresmo was unable to coax him into that on this one occasion and needs to pull off the trick in future. As BBC . commentator Tim Henman pointed out on Thursday: ‘I think Amelie should . be given her opportunity but Lendl had a huge impact. 'It . wasn’t necessarily about teaching him new shots but really focusing on . the game style and having someone in his corner with the experience and . the knowledge to say: “You’re doing the right thing.” ‘And the fact that he’s not there any more, I think is a loss, but let’s see what happens with Mauresmo.’ Knowledge: Tim Henman (left) says Mauresmo should be given a chance .","Murray set to continue with Amelie Mauresmo as coach despite SW19 loss .
