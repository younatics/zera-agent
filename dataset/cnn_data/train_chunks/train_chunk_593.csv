New Orleans police have identified a suspect in the mass shooting at a Mother's Day Parade that left 19 wounded, including two children.

'We are coming to find him. We will find him,' said New Orleans Police Supt. Ronal Serpas. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wanted: Akein Scott is wanted for allegedly shooting 19 people, including two children, during Mother's Day Parade in New Orleans . More than one witness had positively identified Scott as the shooter, Serpas said, according to a local television station. Scott has two previous arrests, one for illegal possession of a stolen firearm and another for resisting an officer, illegally carrying . weapons, possession of heroin and illegal possession of stolen firearms . and illegally carrying weapons with controlled dangerous substance. For the first arrest, the district attorney declined to prosecute and on the second case, all charges were dropped except carrying a weapon, for which he was indicted on April 22 of this year. He is due back in court on that charge on Thursday. Determined: New Orleans Police Supt. Ronal Serpas said, 'we are coming to find' Scott . Scott allegedly unleashed the carnage Sunday afternoon, which was caught on surveillance footage. The grainy footage shows a crowd suddenly scattering in . all directions, with some falling to the ground, in a scene of confusion and chaos. They appear to be . running from a man, who is wearing a white T-shirt and dark pants, who turns and runs out of the picture. The image isn't clear but police . say they hope someone will recognize him and notify investigators. Before the chaos: Police released footage of a suspected shooter who opened fire in New Orleans Sunday . Moment of attack: The man, circled, is seen running to the crowd and apparently opening fire . Horror: Police have released footage of a man opening fire on a neighborhood parade on Sunday . Do you know him? The footage is grainy but police are asking for any information on who he could be . The shooting - described by the FBI as a flare-up of street violence - shattered the festive mood surrounding the parade that drew hundreds of people to the 7th Ward neighborhood of modest row houses not far from the French Quarter. Cell phone video taken in the aftermath of the shooting shows victims lying on the ground, blood on the pavement and others bending over to comfort them. At least three of the victims were seriously wounded. Of the rest, many were grazed and authorities said that overall most wounds were not life threatening. No deaths were reported. The victims included 10 men, seven women, a boy and a girl. The children, both 10-years-old, were grazed and in good condition.

Police vowed to solve Sunday's shooting but said it was not initially clear if particular people in the parade were targeted, or if the shots were fired at random. 'We'll get them,' Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas said. 'We have good resources in this neighborhood.' Mayor Mitch Landrieu urged witnesses . to come forward with information during a news conference Sunday night . at a hospital where gunshot victims were taken. 'These kinds of incidents will not go . unanswered. Somebody knows something. The way to stop this violence is . for you all to help,' he said. Mary Beth Romig, a spokeswoman for the . FBI in New Orleans, said federal investigators have no indication that . the shooting was an act of terrorism. Drama: This image from a mobile phone shows the immediate aftermath of the shooting as chaos unfolded . Commotion: This image shows the moment police arrived on the scene. One officer described it as 'simply an act of street violence' 'It's strictly an act of street violence in New Orleans,' she said. As many as 400 people came out for . the second-line procession - a boisterous New Orleans tradition - though . only half that many were in the immediate vicinity of the shooting, . said Serpas. Officers were interspersed with the marchers, which is routine for such events. Police saw three suspects running from the scene. No arrests had been made as of early evening. One suspect was videoing the parade and captured some of the chaos as he fell to the ground when the shooting started. Investigation: New Orleans Police comb for clues at the intersection Frenchman Street at N. Villere on Mother's Day in New Orleans . No suspects were in custody and police are still looking for leads in connection with the shooting, which took place around 2pm. Police believe there was more than one shooter .

Bad things always happen to good . people,' said Temple, who was at the parade but didn't see the . shootings. In the late afternoon, the scene was taped off and police had placed bullet casing markers in at least 10 spots.

The neighborhood where the shooting happened is a mix of low-income and middle-class row houses, some boarded up. As of last year, the 7th Ward's population was about 60 per cent of its pre-Hurricane Katrina level.

A Cleveland police officer has recounted the emotional moment he found Amanda Berry alive outside the house of horrors where she was kept in chains for a decade. Anthony Espada wrote in a police report that he and his partner with the first officers to arrive on scene after Berry broke out of the house on Seymour Avenue and called 911 for help. 'It's her,' Espada's partner exclaimed when he saw Berry, who went missing from a nearby neighborhood in April 2003. The call from officers was received by veteran police dispatcher Jennifer Daunch, who said it was shocking to hear officers confirm Berry had been found. Scroll down for video . Trembling: Cleveland police dispatcher Jennifer Daunch said she broke down in tears when she heard that Amanda Berry had been found alive . Intense: The video captures police officers prying the door of Ariel Castro's home, and flooding in, some reaching for their guns . 'My heart was racing,' Daunch told CBS News. 'I mean, I was trembling. I was crying.' The response from police on the scene was no different. 'My partner was driving. So she came up to the driver's side. He looked up at me and he's like, ""It's her."" Just emotion from that point that he confirmed it was Amanda was overwhelming,' Espada wrote in an official police report obtained by CBS. He also recounted the moment that Michelle Knight, 32, jumped into his arms as he searched the house. Knight went missing in 2002 at age 21. Her case was never reported in the media and authorities believed that she had run away. Seconds later, they found Gina DeJesus - who was abducted off a busy street in 2004 when she was 14. An emotional Espada radioed into his supervisors: 'We found them. We found them.' Response: Additional officers sprint to the home after gaining entry through the front door . Daunch said it was chilling to hear Amanda Berry's voice on a 911 call . 'To see this outcome and be following . it for all these years, it was - I'm so glad, and I got to see the end . of it,' Daunch said. 'She's home. I got to be there from the beginning . to the end.' A brief video filmed by Jasmina . Baldrich shows the very first image of Berry after she broke out of the . house of horrors after being held captive for a decade. Berry can be seen clutching her . six-year-old daughter Jocelyn in her arms and holding Charles Ramsey’s . hand for comfort. Ramsey was later hailed has a hero for responding to . Berry’s cries for help and phoning 911. Cops can be seen prying . open the front door of Castro's house. Once open, they flood into the . home, some reaching for their handguns. Baldrich and her friend Ashley Colon . were driving down Seymour Avenue on Monday evening when they were . suddenly surrounded by police cruisers. Baldrich thought she was being pulled over. Within second, the officers . started running toward a house and breaking down the door. ‘We just seen cops and then out of nowhere all we see Amanda walking by . saying I'm Amanda Berry,’ Baldrich told NewsNet 5 in Cleveland. Free: A neighbor got a picture of Amanda Berry as she escaped the home last Monday with her six-year-old daughter, who the kidnapper's brothers previously saw with Ariel on trips to McDonalds . Baldirch said she and Colon both immediately realized what was happening. ‘We both got goose bumps at the same time.  We were shocked, we could not believe it,’ Colon said. The revelation that Berry, Gina . DeJesus and Michelle Knight were alive and had been kept as sex slaves . for a decade shocked and horrified the nation, but it was seen as a . miracle in Cleveland.

Their disappearance haunted their . neighborhood and their parents made public campaigns to search for them . and plead for their return. Berry was nearly 17 when she . disappeared in 2003. DeJesus was just 14 when she was taken off a street . walking home in 2004. Knight disappeared in 2002, but because she was . an adult and because her mother assumed she had run away, her case fell . through the cracks. Freed: Amanda Berry (center), Gina DeJesus .

Central Park West will soon be missing an unlikely inhabitant to its rarefied row of multi-million dollar homes as NASCAR great Jeff Gordon puts his $30 million Manhattan condo on the market. The four-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will likely be driving away from the place even richer than when he purchased the Central Park adjacent digs in 2007 for a mere $9.67 million. And $30 million is just the asking price since many well-heeled Manhattanites (or wannabe Manhattanites) will undoubtedly be clamouring for a spot in the highly sought-after building at 15 Central Park West. Steal: NASCAR superstar Jeff Gordon has put his Central Park West condo on the market for a cool $30 million . The New York Times calls the building the ‘reigning superstar of Manhattan trophy residences,’ and Gordon’s apartment, with its Brazilian cherry floors, spatterings of flamed black granite, and other precocious appoints is front and center of the pack. His unit, number 7C, is located in the building’s preferable 20-story frontispiece, known only as ‘The House,’ which allows sprawling views just at the edge of the treetops in the city’s favorite strip of woodland. The great room in Gordon’s 3,454-square-foot residence offers the lucky buyer a personalized view of the park. Through the residence’s only glass doors (the rest are rift-cut oak), those eating in the dining area are also privy to peeks at nature. Less desirable is ‘the Tower,’ a tower that rises 43-stories behind ‘the House’ and offers views of the Hudson River. Breathtaking: The 3,454-square-foot stunner offers treetop views of Central Park . The best: Gordon's pad is located at the most desired address in the already beloved row of multi-million dollar apartment buildings, 15 Central Park West . Kitchen: The elegant kitchen features Italian ceramic floors and neo-Paris stone backsplash . Upon entering the lavish abode, visitors step upon bronze-inlaid flooring in the foyer and pass a powder room with a limestone vanity just past the cloak room. A steel-topped oak built-in that Gordon calls ‘the sushi bar’ is the living room’s centrepiece and hides a refrigerator underneath. From there, one may tiptoe across the Italian ceramic floors past the finest culinary appointments, a wine cooler, and neo-Paris stone backsplash. Bathroom: All three bedrooms have en suite baths and the master bath features a stand-up shower with room for two . Bedrooms: The condo's bedroom wing has window's facing the building's verdant courtyard . And for those who are invited, the master suite beyond offers a roomy 743-square-feet of slumber space. For now, though, that room is reserved—as is the entirety of the pristine and playful pad—for Gordon and wife Ingrid Vandebosch. Whoever ends up buying the place will have the two of them to thank. The pair purchased the apartment from the offering plan, so it came to them as ‘a big white box with high ceilings.’ Dining room: Those lucky enough to be invited are treated to Central Park views while they eat . Playful: Brazilian cherry wood hugs the floors and flamed black granite accents peek out throughout the home . So both the compliments and hefty dividends, like those driver has been earning for years, will be well-deserved. And before you ask why the couple wants to leave the breathtaking condominium, agent Nora Ariffin of Halstead Property has an answer, straight Gordon himself. She said the stock car legend has chosen now as a time to sell because 'the demand for trophy apartments is pretty strong.' Modern: Gordon calls the big, steel-topped built-in bar 'the sushi bar'c . Sensible: The unlikely Central Park West dweller usually calls North Carolina home and reportedly wants to unload the place because 'demand for trophy apartments is pretty strong'","The 3,454-square-foot apartment is located in the most sought after building in an already desirable locale .

Stalking: Former Aston Villa goalkeeper Matthew Ghent, 32, admitted harassing his ex-lover relentlessly . He could scarcely look more arrogant if he tried. Bathing in banknotes, this is Matthew . Ghent, a former professional footballer who left his ex-girlfriend . suicidal after a relentless campaign of harassment against her. Just weeks before he admitted the . charges in court, he posted this photograph on his Facebook page, . showing himself sitting in a bathtub full of cash, cigarette in one hand . and a glass of wine in the other. He even gloated that he had hidden the £50 notes underneath the £20s to avoid being too ostentatious. He wrote: ‘Because I can. Go **** . yourself’, adding: ‘The bottom layers were actually 20s/50s. I thought . it was too “bling” to put 50s on top.’ A court heard the former Aston Villa . and England youth goalkeeper booked a holiday for the couple after the . woman broke up with him, then began stalking her when she refused to go . on the trip. Ghent bombarded her with 70 emails and . text messages, paid money into her online PayPal account and turned up . at her office, not leaving until the woman’s colleagues threatened to . call police. He left the 30-year-old victim feeling ‘trapped and . isolated’, the court heard. In a victim impact statement the woman . said she was left always ‘looking over her shoulder’ and that, almost a . year on from the ordeal, she was considering abandoning her career as a . prison officer for a ‘fresh start’ abroad. It is not the first time . Ghent has been convicted of harassing an ex-partner. In 2006 he was . jailed for three months for attacking and stalking his then girlfriend, . Maria Morris. A foolish brag: Ghent posted this photograph of himself drinking and smoking in a bath full of money on his Facebook page last month . A court heard he had kicked her in the . stomach when she was pregnant with their son and throttled her because . he didn’t like how she decorated the Christmas tree. Ghent was in the full Aston  Villa . squad for three seasons between 1997 and 2000 and was often a . substitute, but never played for the first team and was eventually . released. He went on to play for Barnsley and Lincoln City, then lower . league teams Tamworth and Solihull Moors. He retired in 2008 and now sells hair and beauty products online. Ghent admitted harassment and was . handed a ten-week suspended prison sentence at Northampton Magistrates’ Court. The prosecutor told the court that Ghent, pictured above, had been 'very controlling' during the relationship . A Villan in the dock: Ghent, seen here in the middle row, sixth from left, played for Aston Villa and England as a youngster . He was also given a two-year supervision order, ordered to take . part in a domestic abuse programme, handed a restraining order banning . him from contacting the victim and told to pay her £750 in compensation. Sentencing, deputy district Judge Elizabeth Harte said Ghent was guilty . of an ‘exceptionally unpleasant case of true stalking behaviour.’ The judge added: ‘If you fail to . moderate your behaviour, you will go to prison for a long time.’ Prosecutor Julia Barnett told the court the couple met on a dating . website, and Ghent had been ‘very controlling’ during their turbulent . six-month relationship. They broke up last May and Ghent was . given a harassment warning by police after the victim complained. He . booked the holiday in July, and the stalking began afterwards.

"By . Matt Chorley and Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 05:16 EST, 19 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:20 EST, 19 April 2013 . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls is under pressure to spell out his economic plan . Ed Balls was today branded the 'most annoying man in politics' as he faced mounting questions about Labour plans to increase spending after the next election. The shadow chancellor came under fire during a radio phone-in dominated by reports that he is planning to reject coalition budget limits from 2015 onwards. The Tories said the reports were proof Labour is ‘addicted’ to spending public money. The shadow chancellor was forcefully . questioned on LBC 97.3 by a small businessman who accused him of being . ‘in denial’ over the Labour government’s failure to tackle the deficit . when they were in power. Sean, from Matfield in Kent, asked Mr . Balls why he had ‘racked up a structural deficit of £76billion’ when he . was right-hand man to then chancellor Gordon Brown’s in 2006-7. He said . Mr Balls had repeatedly denied this in interviews. He said: ‘You denied it….Your biggest . problem is you are the most annoying man in politics.  You live in . denial.  You smear on behalf of Gordon Brown when you did it.  You’re a . left wing economist with a private education…’ The caller said his party had . presided over ‘the biggest deficit in Europe’ and asked Mr Balls why . countries such as Australia and Canada had avoided going into . recession. Mr Balls insisted that before the . financial crisis hit, Britain’s national debt was lower than other . countries such as the US, France, Germany and Italy. He also claimed the deficit at the . time - the gap between between what the Government spends and what it . makes from taxes per year - was ‘low’. But Labour's economic plan risked descending into chaos as Mr Balls insisted no . decisions had yet been taken on spending limits for after the election. It was ‘impossible’ to predict exactly . what his plans will be in two years’ time, he said. Scroll down for video . Spending spree: Ed Miliband (left) and shadow chancellor Ed Balls could promise to outspend the Tories at the 2015 election under a plan to set out a new 'economic settlement' for Britain . Senior figures in the party say there is a growing consensus in favour . of taking longer to cut the deficit than the coalition, to redirect . money into investment in major projects and housebuilding. The emergence of the high risk idea, which could see Labour portrayed as having failed to learn the lessons of the financial crash on their watch, threatened to overshadow a speech by leader Ed Miliband today. He will promise detailed policies ‘to rebuild and invest in Britain’s economic future’. The Labour leader wants to present a ‘new economic settlement’ to voters. Under a plan being considered by the party, Labour would not match Tory post-2015 spending plans as it did ahead of the 1997 election under Tony Blair. David Cameron sought to exploit the row today, as he launched the Conservative local election campaign in Nuneaton. The Tory leader said: 'If you want good government that costs less – vote Conservative. If you want waste and propaganda – vote Labour. 'Do not let Labour do to your council what they did to our country.' The Prime Minister said the Conservatives would fight for 'the services on our streets', 'the pound in your pocket' and 'the future of our country'. David Cameron used a speech at the launch of the Tory party's local election campaign to attack Labour's economic record . Next week the Labour-affiliated Fabian Society will back the idea of promising to spend more than George Osborne. It . will publish a study arguing that if the economy is growing by about 2 . per cent annually, public spending could rise by 1 per cent a year and . Labour could achieve Mr Osborne’s target of seeing debt falling by . 2016-17 two years later – or sooner than 2018-19 if taxes were . increased, the Independent reported. TV comic Lee Nelson is to stand for Parliament - in the by-election for David Miliband's former seat of South Shields. The character, created by funnyman Simon Brodkin and who has his own BBC3 series, intends to contest the election on May 2 after handing in his nomination papers this morning. He will contest the election as Nelson, standing for Lee Nelson's Well Good Party, and read out a speech on the steps of the Town Hall in South Shields. David Miliband quit the seat for a job running aid charity International Rescue Committee in New York. He made little attempt to hide the fact that his decision stemmed from the 2010 leadership defeat he suffered at the hands of younger brother Ed. He said it would be better for him to be ‘3,000 miles from the front bench’. Andrew . Harrop, the Fabian Society’s general secretary, warned that matching . the Coalition’s plans ‘will harm the economy, further undermine the . welfare state and might not even help Labour’s election chances.’ He . added: ‘Labour needs to have a credible alternative on the economy that . will include targeted cuts in some areas to shift money to higher . priorities.’ A Conservative source said: ‘This is . shocking confirmation that Ed Miliband and Ed Balls would take us back . to the brink of bankruptcy. ‘They can't kick their addiction to more spending and more borrowing.’ Questioned about the proposal today, Mr Balls did not deny it was likely to form the basis of the party’s election pitch, but insisted he would not announce his spending plans now. The Tories seized on the reports to claim Labour had been ‘exposed.’ Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said:  ‘Labour don't get it. They have opposed every single step we've taken to cut the deficit and to turn our country around.‬‬ ‪‪ . ’And now we know for certain that their only plan is more of how they got us into this mess in the first place - more spending, more borrowing and more debt.‬‬ ‪‪ . ‘Ed Miliband is offering no new ideas and no leadership for Britain's future.’ But Mr Balls insisted it would be ‘totally irresponsible’ to announce his plans for 2015 and beyond now. He told LBC 97.3: 'We’ve got a spending review in a few weeks’ time from the Chancellor, we don’t know how bad the economy is going to be then. 'We know he is spending much more than he wanted to because he can’t get unemployment down, we don’t know where we will be in two years’ time.' Mr Miliband, who yesterday used a small wooden pallet to address residents in South Shields, will promise voters a new 'economic settlement' The idea of going into the next election promising more spending could backfire on Labour, which trails the Tories in polls on who voters would trust with the economy. In June Mr Osborne will set out the details of a spending review for 2015-16, which begins just weeks before the general election is due. Mr Miliband will hint at his approach in a speech to the Scottish Labour  Party later. He is expected to say: ‘Building a recovery made by the many needs every person who can to play their part. ‘And, for all the Tories’ rhetoric about welfare reform, the costs of economic failure are just going up and up. ‘We are the only party in British politics saying let’s get long term unemployed people back to work: proper rights to work with a real responsibility to do so. ‘But this party under my leadership will never seek to divide our country and say to young person aged nineteen in Inverness desperately looking for work, to the older worker Ipswich laid off because of economic failure, that they are somehow a scrounger or a skiver. We will succeed by uniting our country, not dividing it.’","Labour will not repeat Tony Blair's 1997 promise to match Tory plans .

Stalking: Former Aston Villa goalkeeper Matthew Ghent, 32, admitted harassing his ex-lover relentlessly . Former Aston Villa goalkeeper Matthew Ghent relentlessly harassed his ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him, booking a holiday for them both and even turning up at her office, a court heard. Ex-England youth international Ghent was branded a 'true stalker' by a judge after he admitted harassing the probation officer, with whom he had a six-month relationship after meeting her on a dating website. Ghent, who now sells hair and beauty . products online, played for Villa and England as a youngster but left . the club without making a first team appearance. He later turned out for . Barnsley, Lincoln City, Solihull Moors and Tamworth. The 32-year-old from Tamworth, Staffordshire, bombarded his former lover with 70 emails and text messages in a campaign that drove her to the brink of suicide, Northampton magistrates heard. Ghent, who has since posted online photographs of himself in a bath full of money, was given a 10-week suspended prison sentence, given a restraining order banning him from contacting his ex-lover, and ordered to pay compensation and costs after admitting harassment last week. The court heard that on one occasion Ghent, who was previously convicted of attacking another ex-girlfriend, even turned up at the woman’s office and only left when her colleagues threatened to call the police. In a statement handed to the judge, his 30-year-old victim said she was receiving counselling and had even considered suicide after she was harassed by Ghent last July. Passing sentence, Deputy District Judge Elizabeth Harte said: 'This was an exceptionally unpleasant case of true stalking behaviour. 'This is exactly the kind of behaviour that this law was designed to combat. 'I have been made aware of the very profound effect that this behaviour has had on the victim’s life. This is not the first time you have been convicted of an offence like this and you have a previous record that shows you have engaged in this type of behaviour before. 'I must pass a prison sentence but can provide greater, long-term protection to those that need it by suspending the sentence. 'If you fail to moderate your behaviour, you will go to prison for a long time.' A foolish brag: Ghent posted this photograph of himself drinking and smoking in a bath full of money on his Facebook page last month . Julia Barnett, prosecuting, told the court that Ghent had been 'very controlling' during the couple’s turbulent relationship. They broke up last May and Ghent was given a harassment warning by police after a complaint by the victim. But . the court heard he then booked a holiday for the couple, without her . knowledge, last July and tried to convince her to go with him. He . mounted the campaign of harassment when she refused. Between July 10 and 25, the court . heard Ghent sent dozens of emails and texts and also deposited money . into her online Paypal account. He turned up at a Probation Service office where she worked on July 18. Mark . Moore, defending, said Ghent’s behaviour had not been threatening and . he had suffered difficulties since the end of his football career. Mr Moore said: 'He accepts he sent a number of emails and messages but they were not threatening in nature. 'He . has suffered from difficulties since his career ended, but he has . always participated fully in courses ordered by the courts. Poor control: The prosecutor said Ghent, pictured above, had been 'very controlling' during the relationship . 'There is now a degree of openness about his behaviour, which is perhaps more difficult to admit in the macho world he is from.' Mr Moore asked for a suspended jail sentence to be imposed to ensure Ghent was punished but that there was 'appropriate monitoring and support in respect of him and the people he has relationships with in the future'. Ghent was also ordered to pay the victim £750 compensation and £135 costs. Judge Harte added: 'No amount of money would really truly reflect what has happened in this lady’s life. 'The most important part of the sentence is the indefinite restraining order. 'If you try to contact her in any way possible you will breach the terms of the suspended sentence and will be sent to prison.' Ghent’s . latest victim told the court her life had 'changed beyond recognition' since they met and she now planned to quit her job and move abroad. A Villan in the dock: Ghent, seen here in the middle row, sixth from left, played for Aston Villa and England as a youngster . In a moving witness statement, the woman said: 'I have gone from being a safe, independent and confident woman to someone who is constantly looking over their shoulder. 'I have never felt so trapped and isolated while in the relationship. Everything I did and said was in an effort to placate Matthew and to avoid situations of confrontation and aggression. I was constantly treading on egg shells, left feeling confused, in fear for myself, my friends, my family and my pets. 'I was downtrodden and broken, lacking confidence and spark and I always seemed vacant and distracted.' Her statement added that she was receiving counselling, had considered suicide and had been prescribed anxiety drugs. And the document said her ordeal had also impacted on her job as a probation officer. She added: 'My employers had to implement an employee safety plan, which involved the entire centre being alerted to the potential risks of the situation, at huge embarrassment to myself. It has affected the way I work with particular cases. 'I also find it particularly difficult when I am in the courts as part of my job. I am still exploring the idea of moving and working abroad, to escape and have a fresh start.'

Boasting the latest in design and tech, the Ear Force headphones from Turtle Beach claim to offer the definitive audio experience for gaming. Indeed, if judged on looks alone, it’s clear the X-Rays mean business. Sporting chunky lines with aggressive black styling and an attractive LED power switch, and they resemble something kitted out to the SAS. Cutting edge: The Ear Force X-Ray headset is packed full of the latest technology . Look a little closer, though, and you’ll notice the quality of the materials – for example, the leatherette headband and memory foam ear cushions. They’ve been marketed as the official headphones to Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, a game that perhaps better than any, shows off the X-Ray's impressive features. Immediately noticeable is the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. With crisp pitches and thundering bass, it brings audio to life with remarkable aplomb. You’ll hear the tiniest details, and shudder at every crack and whoosh of explosions. The depth of sound is wonderful, too – with the 360 degree audio allowing you to pinpoint the direction of every sound. Surround sound angles can be adjusted to optimise the audio experience. If things get too loud, the Blast Limiter function lets you reduce the amplitude of explosions and gunfire, while optimal sound quality is achieved through a digital audio connector. The X-Rays also use 2.4/5 GHZ Dual-Band wifi, which virtually eliminates interference, while duel Bluetooth pairing allows you to chat wirelessly. Retailing for around £179 means that they are by no means cheap. But given the quality of the materials and state-of-the-art tech, the X-Rays make a brilliant alternative to a vastly more expensive home cinema. Cheaper option: The KILOs may be around half the price, but they still provide excellent audio . There are also the cheaper KILO versions, which retail for £69.99. Although they are not as tech heavy as the X-Rays, the KILOs haven't skimped on quality. The Bass Boost function, coupled with their massive 50mm speaker drivers, ensures immersive sound whatever the amplitude - making them a perfect purchase for the more causal gamer.

A cruel husband sent to prison for 11 years after blinding his wife with a lit cigarette has been forgiven by his wheelchair-bound partner who believes he should never have been jailed. In a vicious attack Robert Clark, 40, stubbed the cigarette in the eye of disabled Susan Clark, 56, shouting: 'Can you see it now?'. But after he was jailed at Hull Crown Court injured Mrs Clark said: 'I still love him, but I am angry . with him. 'I am . hoping to get some sight back, but and I am not raising any hopes. I . don't think prison is the right place for him, but I know it has to be . that way.' Attack: Robert Clark (left) blinded his wife Susan (right) with a cigarette but she says she has forgiven him and that he should not have been jailed for 11 years . Mrs Clark, who founded two Hull charities for the disabled, was already blind in her left eye following an accident in 2009. She was immediately totally blinded as her right eyeball burst in the attack by her husband, which surgeons have so far been unable to repair. Prosecutor James Byatt said Mr Clark had gone with his wife to hospital where she had initially accepted she was responsible for the eye injury. Only when a matron challenge the pair, did Mr Clark begin nodding and crying. Mr Byatt said: 'He said ""Yes I did it!"". He was close to tears when he said: ""I could not cope. I was lashing out."" He said he had pushed the cigarette into his wife's eye.' He told an NHS worker he found the pressure of living with Mrs Clark too much. 'He was bottling it up. He said it was like a volcano going off.' His wife is 3ft 2in tall and has been left in a wheelchair because of problems with her hips and legs. Abuse: Clark pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and the judge said he was guilty of serious violence aimed at his wife . Mr Clark pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. His barrister Paul Genney said: 'There is very little to say. His wife is a very fragile lady. She is of the sweetest nature. She holds no resentment at all. Despite all this she has no bitterness. She wants to resume the relationship. But that is not going to work. This is a tragic case in many ways. He understands what he did and the injuries to her eye are appalling.' Sentencing him at Hull Crown Court Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'This is a desperately serious offence. Your wife is terribly disabled. 'She is as vulnerable as a victim could be. You were her carer in a position of trust. You breached that trust on this occasion and others as well she was frightened of you.  You talked about using her as a punch bag and being capable of killing her. 'She says nevertheless she loves you and has forgiven you. That speaks to her credit, not yours. It also speaks to her condition that she would rather be with you, than on her own. It shows you have conditioned her in to accepting violence. She has been left totally blind, that is on top of everything else she has to bear. I have agonized whether there is room to reflect the merciful feeling your wife holds although I think they are misguided'. He jailed Clark for 11 years ordering a five-year extended sentence. It means he will be jailed for two-thirds of his eleven-year sentence. However, if he commits a further offence he will be jailed for the full 16 years. Mrs Clark's former husband Bill McLean was at court with Mrs Clark and . is now her full-time carer. He said: 'Her sight has totally gone. There . were warnings signs this would happen unfortunately. She is a very . brave, lovely woman who founded two disabled groups in Hull. She cannot . do that work now.'","Robert Clark attacked wife Susan Clark, 56, shouting: 'Can you see it now?'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:20 EST, 14 July 2011 . Quizzed: Neil Wallis leaves Hammersmith police station in London, after his arrest over phone hacking allegations . Former executive editor of the News of the World Neil Wallis was hired by the Metropolitan Police as a consultant last year, it was claimed today. The 60-year-old, who was Andy Coulson's deputy at the time of the scandal, was being questioned by detectives probing the phone hacking scandal. He is the ninth person to be arrested. Wallis, who had been working in PR since leaving the paper in 2009, was arrested in a 6.30am swoop on his west London home. Sky News said he had been hired by the police last year. Tonight he was photographed leaving Hammersmith Police Station shortly before 5pm. His company Chamy Media was paid £24,000 by the force for 'communications advice' in 2009 and 2010 while the force's deputy director of public affairs was on sick leave. As part of the contract, Wallis advised the commissioner's office, the directorate of public affairs and specialist operations. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson has made the chair of the police authority aware of the contract, which ceased before Operation Weeting started in January this year. Today he insisted he has done nothing wrong as it also emerged he has had dinner with Wallis. The Scotland Yard chief said developments in the News of the World inquiry in recent weeks were 'deeply disturbing' as he addressed members of the Metropolitan Police Authority. When asked whether he regretted his decision in 2006 to have dinner with the then deputy editor, the commissioner said he had no reason to suspect any wrongdoing. It has also emerged today that detectives have told a cousin of Jean Charles de Menezes his number was found on the phone hacking list of a News of the World private investigator. Other people connected to the young Brazilian shot dead by police marksmen at Stockwell Tube station in 2005 fear they too may have been targeted. In another development, the Hacked . Off campaign is consulting its lawyers over whether some witnesses . called before the inquiry should be granted immunity from prosecution to . speed up proceedings. It will submit a recommendation to inquiry judge . Lord Justice Leveson. Former . Lib Dem MP Evan Harris, a member of the group, said: 'Some people feel . that anyone who has been involved in wrongdoing should face a criminal . trial and other people are very keen that the truth comes out as quickly . as possible, even if that means giving immunity to the people who admit . to wrongdoing.' Wrong side of the lens: Mr Wallis, former deputy editor at the News of the World, was arrested in a 6.30am raid on his west London home . As Andy Coulson's . former deputy Neil Wallis was arrested in the phone hacking inquiry . today, neighbours claimed he had done nothing wrong. The woman, who refused to be named, said: 'I just told her we are all very sympathetic because he has done nothing wrong. 'I am extremely sorry about Neil because he has been such a good neighbour to us all.' The developments came as Rebekah . Brooks confirmed she will appear before a Commons Culture Select . Committee next Tuesday. Rupert and James Murdoch both said they are 'too . busy' to attend and now will be issued with a formal summons. Getaway: Mr Wallis, whose PR company gave advice to the Metropolitan Police, is the ninth person to be arrested over the NotW hacking scandal . Today Nick Clegg said they had to show they were accountable to the public. The . deputy Prime Minister said on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'We need . to look at whether they have got the power and the ability to compel . them. 'If someone cannot be compelled I don't know whether we can frogmarch them to the select committee. 'But . if they have any shred of sense of responsibility or accountability for . their position of power then they should come and explain themselves to . the select committee.' The committee could issue a formal . summons forcing Rebekah Brooks to attend as she is a British citizen. If . she failed to turn up she would be in contempt of court. It was expected to emerge later whether they had accepted an invitation to appear before the panel. Yesterday Mr Murdoch pulled the plug on a £10billion deal to buy the remaining 61 per . cent of BSkyB he does not own in the face of massive pressure. News Corporation CEO Rupert Murdoch is driven away from his flat - and the media scrum - in central London today . Nick Clegg speaks out about phone hacking today. The deputy Prime Minister called for Rupert Murdoch, his daughter Elisabeth and Rebekah Brooks to appear before a Commons Select Committee . Andy Coulson's deputy Neil Wallis was nicknamed 'Wolfman' because he is short, used to have lots of facial hair and is aggressive. The 60-year-old suspect has been described as a 'no-nonsense, larger-than-life character whose every utterance is peppered with expletives'. He stood down as News of the World's executive editor in 2009 and had been working in PR. He started working for News International in 1986 for 12 years where he held senior positions before taking the job of News Editor at The Sun. In 1998 he became editor of the People, a job he held for five years before returning to become deputy editor of the News of the World in 2003 working under Andy Coulson. According to mediaweek, Wallis led a redesign of the newspaper in 2002 and launched a sports supplement to help in a battle against the Daily Star. Last week Andy Coulson was grilled by detectives for 10 hours over allegations of corruption and phone hacking. Today detectives from Operation Weeting - the . Scotland Yard investigation into mobile interceptions by News . International - made a fresh arrest. A spokesman for Scotland Yard confirmed they had carried out a raid. 'The man is currently in custody at a west London police station. It would be inappropriate to discuss any further details at this time,' a statement said. The man was being held on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications. As Andy Coulson was held last week police also arrested former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, 53, and an unnamed 63-year-old man in connection with allegations of corruption . All three men were released on bail until October. Rupert Murdoch was forced to shelve his offer to buy satellite broadcaster BSkyB as it became clear that David Cameron, Nick . Clegg and Ed Miliband were joining forces in a Commons vote urging him . to back off. It came as Mr Cameron relented in the . face of intense pressure from Labour and the Liberal Democrats and . agreed to a judicial inquiry into press standards, regulation and . ownership, and allegations of illegal phone hacking by the News of the . World and police corruption. Media proprietors, including Mr . Murdoch, as well as senior politicians, police chiefs and journalists . accused of phone hacking, are all expected to be summoned under oath. The probe will be headed by Lord Justice Leveson, who prosecuted Britain’s worst female serial killer, Rose West. Yesterday the scandal spread to the U.S. as . family members of victims of the 9/11 attacks called for an . investigation of claims their phones were hacked. Abi Titmuss, pictured at a recent summer party, is the latest celebrity to claim her phone was hacked . There were claims that Murdoch was considering selling off his remaining British newspapers The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times. Mr Cameron also vowed that media executives responsible for the scandal would be barred from owning newspapers or broadcasters. 'The people involved – whether they . were directly responsible for the wrongdoing, sanctioned it, or covered . it up, however high or low they go – must not only be brought to . justice, they must also have no future role in the running of a media . company in our country,’ he said. Labour leader Mr Miliband hailed the . move, inconceivable only a few days ago, as 'a victory for people up and . down this country who have been appalled by the revelations of the . phone hacking scandal and the failure of News International to take . responsibility’. The collapse of the takeover bid was . announced by News Corp deputy chairman Chase Carey, who said it had . 'become clear that it is too difficult to progress in this climate’. The . firm will have to pay BSkyB a 'break fee’ of £38.5million after walking . away from the deal. The furore had already led to the . closure of the News of the World, the UK’s biggest-selling Sunday . newspaper.","Rupert and James Murdoch summonsed to appear before MPs to answer questions on the phone-hacking scandal .

President's fury: Barack Obama, flanked by wounded Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and the families of other recent mass shootings, blasted the Senate for failing to pass the measure . 'A majority of senators voted yes to . protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks, but . because of a continued distortion of Senate rules, a minority of . senators was able to block it from happening,' Obama fumed. The amendment had been negotiated by Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. It was seen as Obama's best hope to pass . meaningful gun-control legislation after the December massacre of 20 . children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown. Obama targeted much of his anger at the National Rifle Association, which lobbied hard against all of the proposed gun control legislation. 'The gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill,' he said. 'They claimed that it would create some kind of big brother gun registry. And unfortunately this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose because it upset an intense minority of gun owners. 'There were no coherent arguments as to why they wouldn't do this. It came down to politics, the worry that a vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections.' Support: Families of the Newtown school shooting stood by the president after the measure failed . Anger: Lori Haas, whose daughter was shot at Virginia Tech, and Patricia Maisch, who knocked a high-capacity magazine from the hand of shooter Jared Lee Loughner as Tuscon, Arizona. President Barack Obama claimed that '90 percent of Republicans' voted against the background check proposal and '90 percent of Democrats supported it.'

A statement from the NRA restated the group's position that the bill 'would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution.' Texas Congressman Steve Stockman said that the defeat of the final gun control measure shows that Obama's political power has waned. 'After spending over $1 billion to claw out a 51% re-election, it’s clear at this point Obama couldn’t pass a stone,' he said in a statement. Staying active: Giffords, who was shot in the head in January 2011, has used her public profile to campaign for tougher gun laws since . Other measures backed by the Democratic president - including a proposal to ban rapid-firing 'assault' weapons like the one used in Connecticut and a limit on ammunition magazines - also are expected to fail as the Senate conducts nine consecutive votes on gun-control legislation. The votes are the culmination of weeks of intense negotiations and lobbying over Obama's proposed gun restrictions, and the defeat of the background checks amendment could doom the biggest package of gun legislation Congress has considered in two decades. Opponents of the Manchin-Toomey plan and the restrictions on assault weapons said the proposals were an example of government overreach that would infringe on the constitutional right to bear arms. The Democratic-led Senate also will consider several Republican-sponsored amendments backed by the National Rifle Association gun lobby that would expand gun rights, adding an element of uncertainty to the eventual content of the bill. The Senate legislation also includes tighter restrictions on gun trafficking and more funding for school security. The Manchin-Toomey background checks amendment allowed exemptions for private sales or gifts between families and friends and prohibited the creation of a national registry of guns. Polls show more than 80 percent of Americans support expanded background checks.","Amendment failed 54-46, six votes short of the 60 needed to pass Senate .

An ancient Buddhist artefact discovered being used as a doorstep and valued at £30,000 has been sold for more than £500,000. The granite relic was given to Bronwen Hickmott’s parents by a tea planter who returned to Britain from Sri Lanka in the 1950s. Mrs Hickmott inherited the 2.4m-long (8ft) stone from her mother and father and began using it as a doorstep at her home in Exeter, Devon - affectionately calling it 'the pebble'. Ancient: This 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple step has been sold for more than £500,000 at auction . But an expert who spotted the one . tonne stone in a photograph later confirmed it was actually a Buddhist . temple step - up to 1,300 years old. It was put up for auction with a pre-sale estimate of £30,000 to £50,000 but sold yesterday for ten times as much - £553,250. Mrs Hickmott said she was 'over the moon' at the sale, and that rival auction house Sotheby’s had previously shown no interest in helping her research the origin of what she called ‘The Pebble’. And she told how she was also turned down by producers of BBC1’s Antiques Roadshow. She likened the response of Sotheby’s and the BBC producers to that of shop staff in hit film Pretty Woman who famously refuse to serve Julia Roberts - and miss out on a fortune when she goes on a spending spree. Mrs Hickmott said: 'They have had a Pretty Woman moment. It was a big mistake. I bet they are kicking themselves now.' She added: 'We are over the moon. We did not have a clue what ‘The Pebble’ would sell for. 'It was very exciting and as the amount increased we were left speechless and holding our breath. 'I have loved ‘The Pebble’ virtually all my life. I always knew it was something special - but never knew how special. Relic: Despite once adorning a Sri Lankan temple the intricately carved step had been marking the end of a concrete path outside a bungalow in Sussex . The city has been awarded a UNESCO World Heritage Site status. It lies 205 km north of the capital Colombo, on the banks of the historic Malvathu Oya. It is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and one of the country's eight World Heritage Sites. The sacred city was established around a cutting from the 'tree of enlightenment', the Buddha's fig tree. It was brought there in the 3rd century B.C. by Sanghamitta, the founder of an order of Buddhist nuns. Anuradhapura, a Ceylonese political and religious capital that flourished for 1,300 years, was abandoned after an invasion in 993. It was left hidden in dense jungle but now its palaces, monasteries and monuments, is now accessible to visitors once again. Source: UNESCO . 'A few years back when I was trying to research what it was, Sotheby’s turned it down. 'I also tried the Antiques Roadshow but the producers said they knew nothing about it.' It was not until Sam Tuke, from the . Exeter branch of Bonhams, showed the step to the auction house’s art . experts in London that its origin was identified. Mrs Hickmott said: 'That is the first . time we realised what we had got in the garden but we never expected it . to make anywhere near as much money. 'We shall be sharing the proceeds with our family - our brothers and sisters and children. 'But for now we are celebrating in London. I am going shopping tomorrow.' The museum piece from the . Anuradhapura period, between 400BC to 1017AD, is decorated with carvings . of lions, horses, elephants and birds. It is said to symbolise the four stages life - growth, energy, power and forbearance. Bonhams spokesman Julian Roup said: 'There was a huge amount of interest so it wasn’t that much of a shock, . though we didn’t expect it to sell ten times the estimate. 'The Hickmotts are absolutely delighted. To say that they were astonished is something of an understatement.' Sri Lanka’s ancient city of Anuradhapura is now a Unesco world heritage site.

Prison: Steven Quinn, 33, was jailed for six years and four months today at Bolton Crown Court for mowing down 16-year-old Callum Hilton while drunk . A driver who knocked down and killed a 16-year-old boy was so drunk he told his petrified passenger that he had only struck a bollard. Steven Quinn, 33, was jailed for more than six years today for mowing down Callum Hilton as the youngster crossed the road in Bury, Greater Manchester. Quinn had earlier guzzled seven pints of lager, as well as vodka and lemonade, and only left for home after bar staff refused to serve him any more alcohol. He was driving his Peugeot 306 at speeds of up to 50mph, ignoring pleas from his passenger to slow down, when he slammed into Callum, who was on his way to a house party. The boy was thrown 20ft through the air and suffered serious head injuries in the crash. Paramedics rushed him to hospital but he died hours later with his family by his bedside. Speaking after her son's death, Callum's mother Tricia Hamilton said: 'Can’t sleep and don’t want to, because it all becomes a reality when I wake up after holding my son whilst he passed.' Today at Bolton Crown Court, Quinn, from Radcliffe, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed for six years and four months. On the day of Callum's death in November last year Quinn had spent the afternoon drinking and watching football at the Heaton Park social club. He drank up to five pints of lager there before getting behind the wheel again to visit the nearby Red Lion pub where he sank another two pints of beer and a vodka lemonade. Staff at the Red Lion refused to serve him any more drinks after he was seen slurring his words and stumbling over bar stools. His friend Elizabeth Cox suggested they share a tram ride back to his house. But Quinn pushed his keys into the ignition of his car and revved up the engine. 'She made the very foolish decision of getting into the car with him,' said Michael Morley, prosecuting. Callum had also been watching the football with friends before they decided to go to a party advertised on Facebook. But on their way there they found themselves lost and Callum crossed the road to ask for directions. He walked straight into the path of Quinn’s oncoming car. Tributes: Friends and relatives of Callum mourn at the scene where drunken Quinn ran over while the youngster was crossing the road on the way to a party with his friends on Saturday November 3, 2012 . Mr Morley said in the moments before the crash Miss Cox had been worried about Quinn’s driving, speed and concentration, so she turned off the car radio - but felt an almighty thud as she did so. 'He was driving too fast and she told him again to slow down. She felt like the radio was on in the car was very loud and distracting the driver,' Mr Morley told the court. No chance: Callum had just walked across the road to ask for directions when he was hit by Quinn's oncoming Peugeot at speeds of up to 50mph . 'She heard a noise but didn’t know what it was. She noticed that there was damage to the car and she could no longer see the driver’s wing mirror. Quinn told her, “I have hit a bollard”. 'She didn’t realise that anything else had gone on and the two drove on. Even after that noise or collision, the defendant still didn’t slow down and carried on speeding.' Passers-by stopped to help Callum and tried to give him first aid at the scene. When Quinn got back home, Miss Cox left soon afterwards, still not realising what had happened. Police alerted by a tip off saw the offside wing mirror of his car was missing. They arrested Quinn just before they were about to force entry to his house after he failed to answer them. He said he thought he had hit a post. Quinn’s phone was seized and officers discovered two text conversations during which he told a friend he could not remember what happened because he was so drunk, and then later when the police turned up at his door he was ‘shaking like a leaf’. In her victim impact statement Callum’s mother said: 'My son was a beautiful young soul. I don’t know if dying of a broken heart is possible. 'I speak to him, I imagine him as he comes in at 11pm, I imagine him walking out the gate with his head phones on, I light a candle for him at night. Our family life has been destroyed.' In mitigation defence counsel Hunter Gray said his client opted to drink and drive after failing to get a lift to the working men’s club. He added: 'The blame here lies solely at his door. He wishes to apologise for his behaviour.' Passing sentence Judge Peter Davies banned Quinn from driving for six years and told him: 'It was prolonged, persistent and deliberate course of bad driving. 'You were in no condition to drive. You were very drunk, you got into your car and drove yourself and her back to your home. 'During the course of the journey your were warned several times not to drive but you continued to drive. 'Callum was walking across the road with his friends; because of your speed and intoxication, you failed to see him.' Tragic: Callum was thrown 20ft through the air and suffered serious head injuries in the crash. He was rushed to hospital but died later in his mother's arms and with his family by his side . Detective Inspector Amber Waywell said after the case: 'Callum’s mum and grandad, who raised him, have suffered an unimaginable loss. A much-loved son and grandson has died in such terrible and tragic circumstances and our thoughts remain with the family as they attempt to come to terms with losing Callum so young. 'No words, and no sentence, can ever bring Callum back. A car can be a lethal weapon and sadly that has been borne out and robbed Callum’s family of a much-loved young man.'","Steven Quinn had drunk seven pints of lager before getting behind the wheel .

Eurosceptic Tory MPs could stand under a joint ticket with UK Independence Party,  Nigel Farage revealed today. The UKIP leader suggested his party’s logo could appear on the ballot paper alongside Conservative candidates as a seal of approval for MPs who back his party’s position on Europe. But he stressed that the endorsement would be done on an individual basis, ruling out an election pact unless David Cameron is replaced as leader. UKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested he would welcome Tory defections with open arms, as he offered the UKIP logo to Eurosceptic candidates . The Tories are embroiled in serious turmoil over the issue of Europe, and Mr Cameron’s promise to renegotiate links with Brussels before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. Mr Farage suggested the Tories have an ‘issue of trust’ after failing to deliver a vote on the Lisbon Treaty. Mr Cameron, who is on a visit to the US, has been forced to deal with Tory Cabinet ministers saying they would vote to leave the EU if there was a referendum tomorrow, as dozens of backbenchers prepare to vote against the Queen’s Speech in an unprecedented revolt on Wednesday. Many in Conservative ranks have been spooked by the rise of UKIP, which two weeks ago took almost one in four votes in the local elections. It UKIP has held talks with several Tory MPs about possibly defecting before the next election. But today Mr Farage revealed he could offer the UKIP ‘pound sign’ logo to endorse some Tory MPs at the next election. He told BBC News: ‘The law now allows one candidate to have the logo of more than one party [on a ballot paper], so legally if someone wanted to stand as a Tory-UKIP candidate or even a Labour-UKIP candidate that would be allowed under electoral law.’ A request from a Tory MP to use the UKIP emblem would be discussed by the UKIP local association ‘and we’d go from there’, Mr Farage added. David Cameron is in Washington for talks with US President Barack Obama, but the trip has been overshadowed by questions over Tory splits back home over Europe . Mr Farage said the Tory party will go on being ‘hopelessly split’ unless an in-out referendum is held before the 2015 election. As a result UKIP could not do a deal with Mr Cameron in charge. ‘I think the dam has broken. I think the politics that dare not speak its name has now become mainstream and you’re going to see a lot more voices coming out over the next few months saying that the time has come for us to leave. ‘Nobody could do a deal with a party that is completely spilt and it’s difficult to ascertain what its position is. ‘I’ve said all the way through that if someone like a Boris [Johnson] or a Michael Gove was leading the Conservative party we’d certainly be prepared to have a conversation. Please don’t think that UKIP is just here as a fringe of the Conservative party. ‘We took a lot of Labour and Lib Dem votes two weeks ago and that’s something in this debate that tends to get forgotten.’ We're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable.","Anti-EU candidates can have two logos against name, UKIP leader says .

Jailed: Paul Rishworth, from York, was handed six years for throttling his girlfriend until she blacked out . A jealous boyfriend has been jailed for six years for strangling his girlfriend and telling her 'I want to see your last breath.’ Paranoid Paul Rishworth, 27, twice throttled his terrified victim so hard that she blacked out, a court heard. Sentencing, Recorder Gregory Perrins told him: 'You are, in my judgment, a paranoid, aggressive and ultimately violent individual and someone who is a danger to women with whom you are in a relationship.' Both the attacks were 'without justification and without provocation'. The earlier one had been 'horrific' and the later one 'sickening'. 'Had the police not attended, which is something you were anxious to prevent happening, the injuries to her would have been significantly worse.' Prosecutor Nicholas Adlington told York Crown Court that the woman suffered bruising and cuts to her face and neck, but no long-term injuries. The couple had been in an on-off relationship for a year. Between the throttling attacks Rishworth had bombarded her with phone calls in which he was angry one moment and placid the next. She sought refuge in a friend’s house for a week. The first attack, on September 21 last year, only ended when a friend arrived. Six months later, on March 9, Rishworth arrived at her home while she was getting ready to have a bath, and locked himself in the bathroom with her and repeatedly throttled her. His eyes were glazed and he appeared high on drugs. She was terrified he was going to kill her and managed to phone 999 on one phone while he was going through another looking for evidence she had been cheating on him. But he again throttled her. When police arrived, Rishworth was sitting calmly in the house 'as if nothing had happened', said Mr Adlington. Rishworth, of York, pleaded guilty to attempted grievous bodily harm with intent and causing actual bodily harm. He was given a restraining order banning him from contacting the woman, going near her or harassing her in any way indefinitely. Mitigating Nicholas Barker claimed that Rishworth was a 'broken and fragile individual' and that he had only intended to talk to the woman when he went to her house on March 9 this year - an argument rejected by the judge. York Crown court heard Paul Rishworth, 27, committed the attacks 'without justification and without provocation' Mr Barker said the relationship had been 'volatile' and Rishworth did like the woman. He had no memory about what he had done to her because he had taken alcohol and drugs, but he was remorseful. 'He knows he needs help and he is willing to receive and accept that help,' said Mr Barker. Detective Inspector Shaun Page, of North Yorkshire Police, welcomed the sentence and urged other domestic violence victims to come forward. He said: 'A dangerous man has been taken off the streets and now has to face up to the consequences of his actions. His sentence will give him ample time to reflect on his actions and seek help to address his violence. 'Anyone who is suffering at the hands of a violent partner or family member should not hesitate to contact the police.'","Paul Rishworth, 27, from York, twice throttled his terrified victim .

Free healthcare could become a thing of the past if Scotland becomes an independent nation, Gordon Brown warned today. The former Prime Minister said the whole of the UK benefits from ‘pooling resources’, and the loss of Scotland could undermine the NHS, pensions and the benefits. Launching a Labour campaign against independence, he said he was returning to the political front line after three years ‘with time on my hands’. Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned public services like the NHS and pensions across the UK depend on 'pooling resources' The former Labour leader was launching a new campaign - United With Labour - which is the party's own drive to keep the Union together . Voters in Scotland will have their say on independence in a referendum on September 18 next year. Mr Brown said he wanted to make the case for the ‘pooling and sharing’ of public money across the UK. In a rare political speech since being forced from Number 10 three years ago last Saturday, Mr Brown launched United With Labour – the party’s own drive to keep Scotland in the UK. Sources were at pains to play down the idea that the it is a rival to the cross-party Better Together campaign, fronted by Mr Brown’s former chancellor Alistair Darling. The pair have barely spoken since leaving office, with Mr Darling accusing Mr Brown’s allies of unleashing the ‘forces of hell’ against him after comments about the scale of the economic downturn under Labour. Today Mr Brown said he wanted to put ‘the positive, principled, forward-looking case for a strong Scottish Parliament inside a strong United Kingdom’. He began his speech by saying that in the 'last few years I have had time on my hands, time to reflect, courtesy of the British people'. Last Saturday, May 11, marked the third anniversary since Mr Brown was forced out of power when the Tory-Lib Dem coalition was formed. He said he now wants to 'put the positive, principled, forward-looking case for a strong Scottish Parliament inside a strong United Kingdom'. Voters in Scotland will have their say on independence in a referendum on September 18, 2014 . Mr Brown was joined by Scottish Labour party leader Johann Lamont at the launch in Glasgow . While some policy areas such as health and education are devolved to the Scottish parliament, Mr Brown said their funding were only possible because of the way public money is ‘pooled’ across the four nations of the UK. He said he would not focus on the concerns about defence, security and the environmental impact of independence – pushed by the Better Together campaign. Mr Brown said: ‘I want to make the case, the most modern case for the Union, for the pooling and sharing of resources so that we are in a position to tackle poverty, unemployment together. ‘We are in a position to fund a National Health Service based on the principle that it is free at the point of need. Therefore, I want to make the case for a Union for social justice, dominated by our principle of fairness. ‘Our UK pensions, UK national insurance, the UK minimum wage, the UK equalisation of resources , the UK children's benefits are all to the benefit not just of Scottish people but to the benefit of people all across the United Kingdom.’ Mr Brown said he wanted to focus on 'social justice' not defence and security policy . The Labour push is separate to the cross-party Better Together campaign fronted by Mr Brown's former Chancellor Alistair Darling. Pictured left to right Scottish Labour Party Leader Johann Lamont, Mr Darling, Scottish Conservative Party Leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie . Mr Brown went on to warn against a ‘race to the bottom’. On corporation tax, the former chancellor claimed if Scotland cut the rate to that of Ireland, it would lose £1.5 billion of the £3 billion raised in Scotland ‘immediately’. He said: ‘You would lose half the share of corporation tax revenue. Then what would happen is the English would cut their corporation tax, the Welsh would demand they had the right to cut theirs, the Northern Irish already want the right to cut theirs. ‘Then there would be a race to the bottom and soon we would have very little revenue at all from corporations operating in the United Kingdom.’ This would mean less cash for pensions, for the NHS, for education ‘for the basic services we need’. He said: ‘That race to the bottom would affect our ability to deliver the best living standards and quality of life for Scottish people.’ On pensions, he questioned whether an independent Scotland would be able to provide people with the same level of financial support in their old age as the UK does. ‘We know people have contributed their money in taxation and national insurance to a pension that has been guaranteed by the UK as a result of their contributions. ‘Would you say you were in a better position with a UK pension, guaranteed because of your national insurance contributions over the years, than with the promise but no guarantee of a Scottish administration that has already said they are setting up a working party to consider the affordability of pensions?’ We're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable.","Former Prime Minister says pensions, benefits and healthcare depend on 'pooling resources'

Scepticism about the benefits system has increased more among Labour voters than Tories in recent years, a major survey found yesterday. Nearly half of Labour supporters, 46 per cent, think benefit cuts would encourage claimants to ‘stand on their feet’ and find work. That compares to the 16 per cent who favoured cuts in 1987 when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister. And it is more than the 43 per cent of Conservative voters who believed in 1989 that if benefits were less generous more people would provide for themselves. Now, 68 per cent of Tories think benefits are too high and encourage dependency. Encouraging dependency? Unemployed people file into a Jobcentre Plus office in Rusholme, Manchester. A new survey suggests Labour supporters' attitudes are hardening towards the jobless . In 1989, 46 per cent of Labour supporters thought social injustice was the main cause of poverty. By 2010, despite the recession, only 27 per cent did. The plunging support for the benefits system emerged in a survey for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It said in a report that the gap on welfare between Tory and Labour supporters is narrowing. The findings will concern Ed Miliband, who has opposed Coalition welfare reforms including the £500 a week benefits cap. Senior figures in his own party think he is out of touch with voters. In particular Mr Miliband objected to Chancellor George Osborne’s questions over why the lifestyle of Mick Philpott, convicted of killing six of his children in a fire, was supported by state benefits. In advance of the local elections earlier this month, the Labour leader attacked Mr Osborne, saying he was exploiting the deaths and asking if it was right to ‘say to people that this is somehow a common truth about people on benefits.’ The Joseph Rowntree report found that 46 per cent of Labour voters now believe that ‘people would stand on their feet if benefits were cut’. It said that a ‘general hardening of attitudes to welfare has continued through the past few decades.’ The report continued: ‘The view that poverty is caused by individual rather than societal factors has increased most markedly among Labour supporters, as has the view that welfare recipients are undeserving and that the welfare state encourages dependence.’ The survey questions were asked on Rowntree’s behalf in 2011 by NatCen Social Research among more than 3,300 people. ‘Results were ready for publication last month but were delayed, although Joseph Rowntree denied that they had been held back until after the local government elections.’ Losing touch: Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) objected to questions by Chancellor George . Osborne (right) over why the lifestyle of Mick Philpott, convicted . of killing six of his children in a fire, was supported by state . benefits . The 46 per cent backing among Labour supporters for welfare cuts compares with 16 per cent of Labour supporters who favoured cuts when asked the same question in 1987. In the recession of the early 1990s, only 21 per cent of Labour supporter thought unemployed people could find a job if they wanted one. in 2011, in the depths of the current recession, that had more than doubled to 50 per cent. Nearly half Labour supporters, 46 per cent, thought in 1989 that injustice was the main cause of poverty. By 2010 only 27 per cent did so. The report said: ‘The view that the generosity of welfare benefits encourages dependence has become more prevalent; much of this change occurred when the Labour Party was in office and economic circumstances appear to have had little impact. ‘Changes in attitudes have been concentrated among the youngest in society and Labour Party supporters.’ The percentage of Labour supporters who now think that cutting welfare benefits would force people to stand on their feet is higher than the share of Tory voters who thought the same thing when Margaret Thatcher was in power. In 1989 only 43 per cent of Conservative voters believed that if benefits were less generous more people would provide for themselves. Now more than two thirds of Tories, 68 per cent, think benefits are too high and encourage dependency. The gap on welfare between Tory and Labour supporters is narrowing, the report said.

Appeal: Paul Lamb accompanied by daughter Lauren, left and campaigner Jane Nicklinson at the High Court in London . The decision on whether to allow two men to end their lives with medical help will not be based on sympathy for their desperate plight but on legal principles alone, the country’s most senior judge declared yesterday. Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, was speaking at the opening of a test case that will rule on whether those with extreme physical conditions should be able to call on doctors, family or friends to help them die. Two men have gone to the Appeal Court to win the right to end their lives. One, Paul Lamb, 57, a former builder paralysed in a road accident 23 years ago, wants a doctor to kill him, preferably by lethal injection. He is asking the court to guarantee that any doctor who kills him will not be charged with murder. The second is a man with locked-in syndrome known only as Martin, who wants current legal guidelines on assisted suicide to be loosened to allow a medical professional to help him kill himself. In a statement, Mr Lamb said: ‘I am in pain every single hour of every single day. I have lived with these conditions for a lot of years and have given it my best shot. Now I feel worn out and I am genuinely fed up with my life. I feel I cannot and do not want to keep living. ‘I feel trapped by the situation and have no way out. I am fed up of going through the motions of life rather than living it. I feel enough is enough.’ Right to die: Paul Lamb, 58, is paralysed from the neck down . Ongoing: Paul Lamb with Jane Nicklinson whose husband Tony suffered from locked in syndrome and started the legal battle . Paul Bowen QC, appearing for Mr Lamb, said: ‘He feels that he is trapped in his body, that he cannot enjoy or endure a life that is so monotonous and painful and lacking in autonomy. He wishes a doctor to end his life.’ Both men say Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to privacy and family life, should give them the right to decide how their lives should end. Lord Judge, who is sitting with the Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson, and Lord Justice Elias, told the court: ‘We are acutely aware of the desperate situation in which these appellants find themselves, and we are very sympathetic.’ But, he added, ‘we cannot decide this case as a matter of personal sympathy’. It must be decided ‘on the basis of principles of law’. The case comes as the former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer prepares to launch a Bill in the House of Lords tomorrow that could lead to a law allowing a doctor to end the life of a person with a terminal illness who is expected to live for less than six months. Semantics: Lord Alex Carlile QC, left, said the terms of Lord Falconer's, right, bill are based on 'euphemisms' and criticised an attempt to call doctors helping a patient to die as 'assisted dying' rather than 'assisted suicide' Critics say he is trying to push a right-to-die law through Parliament on the back of heart-rending court cases, and a prominent peer, Lord Carlile, has condemned him for using ‘Orwellian spin’. Mr Lamb, a father of two, joined the case after the death last year of locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson days after the High Court rejected his plea for a doctor to kill him. Mr Nicklinson’s widow Jane is continuing his case before the Appeal Court judges. The High Court ruled that voluntary euthanasia is murder and that it is up to Parliament, not the courts, to change the law. Mr Lamb said outside the court yesterday that simply having the legal right to die ‘would give me peace of mind enough to prolong my life’. He added: ‘Otherwise I am constantly looking, if I want a way out, how on earth can I do it, without getting someone into trouble. I just want my wishes to be respected.’ However, he said he was ‘not confident because I’ve seen the legal system. It’s already failed people.’The hearing continues.

An eight-year-old girl has been reunited with her stolen puppy, which she spent three years saving up for. Izzy Duffy did not spend her birthday, Christmas and pocket money so she could help pay for Skittles, a 14-week-old black and white Shih Tzu. She was left heart-broken when burglars forced open a ground floor window and took the family’s mobile phones, wallets, games consoles, tablet computers, cameras, and a laptop, before stealing the puppy in its cage. Skittles was stolen, leaving his young owner Izzy Duffy devastated by the cruel theft . But she has now been reunited with Skittles after she was spotted by two members of staff at a Tesco Express who were closing up and spotted the puppy in the car park, according to the Daily Express. Her mother Shona, 44, said: 'It's incredible and Izzy is thrilled to have Skittles back.' The family's BMW X5 was also stolen on the night, but it had very little fuel in it following a family trip to Anglesey and was dumped a mile from their home in Whitworth, Lancashire. Izzy's dad, Dr Chris Duffy, said she and her six-year-old brother, Alistair, were distraught when they realised the dog had gone. He said: 'We can replace the property, but this has really hurt the kids. 'Izzy just cried and cried. She couldn’t go to school on the following day because she was so upset. The family had Skittles micro-chipped and hope a vet will soon identify it and alert the police . 'But the school understood because every free choice of work she gets is dog-related, and we had only taken Skittles in the previous week to show all the other children.' The family had the dog micro-chipped and they had been hoping a vet would be able to identify it and alert the police. Shih Tzu puppies can sell at between £300 and £600. Dr Duffy said: 'We had a lovely weekend away and then woke up the next day and were absolutely gutted.' A spokesman for Lancashire Constabulary said: 'This was a high value burglary and we are determined to reunite the family with their property. 'The family is most devastated about their 14-week-old puppy being stolen and we would appeal to anybody who might know where it is to come forward.' The burglary comes after police realised that gangs have been daubing signs on properties they want to steal from - and the latest sign being 'K' believed to be a play on the word 'Canine' The latest incidents of the 'K' code were highlighted by Cheshire Police officers in April who are investigating thefts in Alsager. Gangs are stealing either pedigree dogs to sell to unwitting buyers online or mutts they can use in illegal dog fights. Pedigree dogs are sold on the black market for up to £2,000 each. Gangs' most popular targets are trained working dogs, such as Labradors, although other popular types such as Chihuahuas and pugs also figure highly in the list of breeds stolen. The biggest rise has been in thefts of cocker spaniels, following an increase in popularity after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge adopted a puppy, Lupo. An RSPCA spokesman said in April: ‘If people are concerned, they should make sure their pets are microchipped, gardens are secure, their dogs are monitored while in the garden and report suspicious activity to police.’ We're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable.","Thieves took laptop, wallets and phones from Izzy Duffy's family home .

An associate of victim Marlon O'Reilly, who did not wish to be named, said he was killed by mistake outside the Dovecote pub in the Cockshut area of Birmingham on Friday evening because he was wearing a T-shirt similar to the intended target. It is believed West Midlands Police are probing local claims Marlon was not the intended target of the gunman - who arrived at the pub on a quad bike and escaped before armed officers arrived. Mr O'Reilly was pronounced dead at the scene. Tragic victim: Father-of-two Marlon O'Reilly was apparently shot dead by mistake in front of horrified drinkers at a pub in Birmingham on Friday evening .

Floral tributes were left at the scene after the 'true gent' died in the local pub . Floral tributes were laid outside the Dove Cote pub in Yardley after the father died while he was drinking with firends . His friend said he believed the shooting had been opportunistic and organised just minutes before the fatal execution-style killing. He said: 'There had been an altercation earlier that day at a gym. But Marlon wasn't present when that happened. 'The bust-up at the gym was just the latest incident in a long-running feud between a large family and somebody who they thought had disrespected them. 'Marlon met up with the man we think was the intended target later that evening at the Dove Cote pub. 'It seems someone on a quad bike drove by the pub and spotted Marlon and his mate through the pub window from outside. 'Marlon and his mate were both wearing white T-shirts. The word is the spotter on the quad bike put a call in to the killers to say their target was wearing a white T-shirt. 'But when the killers walked in the intended target had nipped to the loo.' Devastated friends have been paying tribute both online and at the scene and also believe Mr O'Reilly was not the intended target. Writing on Facebook, 50 Shades of Birmingham said: 'This was a guttless (sic) act by some gutless idiot. ' 'Marlon was a pal of mine and I know everyone says ""He was a top bloke"" but he really was. 'This shooting was a case of mistaken identity and whoever done it would be better handing themselves in than getting found. 'Truly gutted. RIP Marlon and my thoughts are with all his family, his young kids, Mom and Brothers xx.' Floral tributes were also laid at the scene. A card on one read: 'Marlon, you will never be forgotten, always in our hearts and thoughts.' Another read: 'Goodnight, God bless' with another mourner addressing their card 'to ""my brother"" Marlon'. A solitary black balloon displayed the words: 'A true gent - RIP.' A woman who lives opposite the pub but . declined to be named said she had seen a man make off from the pub on a . moped just after the shooting happened.

An illegal migrant has finally been sent to prison a decade after killing an air hostess in a motorway smash. Zahid Masood was driving at up to 90mph and talking on his mobile phone when he ploughed into 19-year-old Charlotte Smoker’s car. But police allowed the 47-year-old to leave the scene of the November 2003 crash because he said he was suffering from shock. Charlotte Smoker, 19, was killed after Zahid Masood, 47, drove into her at speed before fleeing police for years . He had given them a false name and quickly fled to his native Pakistan. Incredibly, he returned to Britain . under his true identity in 2007 – but used the false name again to start . a new life in Rochester, Kent, where he set up a temping agency and . became a governor at his children’s school. He was finally trapped last November . when credit checks revealed his deception. He was arrested and charged . with causing the crash. Charlotte’s parents – Michele, 51, and . Ian, 52 – had had to make the devastating decision to turn off the life . support system keeping their daughter alive. Mr Smoker, who served as an RAF . engineer for 31 years, said Masood should be deported immediately to . serve his sentence in Pakistan. He was given four years for causing death by dangerous driving and nine months for perverting the course of justice. Mr Smoker – from Basingstoke in . Hampshire – said: ‘He only got nine months for perverting the course of . justice, and we had nine years of struggle to come to terms with what we . lost that evening. ‘He was able to come and go from this . country as he pleased, using a different name and passport and move on . with his life – never paying for what he did. ‘Masood was able to set up a life for himself in this country, getting married and having children. Zahid Masood has been sent to prison a decade after hitting Charlotte while talking on his phone . ‘When police told him what he had done . the day Charlotte died he simply ran away with no regard for the . consequences of his actions – no regard for our laws. As a family we . want to see him deported back to Pakistan. We do not understand why he . has been treated like a British citizen when he never behaved like one . in the first place. ‘Why should he have the benefit of our taxpayers’ money and all the services we provide prisoners?’ Mr Smoker, who was on a posting in . Cyprus with his wife on the day of the fatal crash in November 2003, . said he would never get over it. ‘When we came back to the UK after the . accident Charlotte was laid there on life support,’ he added. ‘Her mum and her sister painted her . nails and we said our goodbyes. She was so young – she was incredibly . bright, she was our blonde haired sparkly eyed girl and she was robbed . from us.’ Privately-educated Charlotte was stranded in the outside lane . of the M25 after she lost control of her Fiat after leaving Stansted . airport in Essex, where she worked for Ryanair. The court was told other cars swerved . past her Cinquecento but Masood failed to see it because he had been . travelling at speeds of up to 90mph in his Ford Focus while making . business calls on his mobile. Nearly one in five murder or rape suspects last year were born overseas, according to police statistics. The figures show that 93 of the 555 murder charges in 2012 were laid against foreign nationals. For the 3,436 rape cases, 632 of the accused were foreign nationals. Many of the cases will still be making their way through the criminal justice system. The only constabulary in the survey of 43 police forces in England and Wales not to have foreign citizens on its books for rape or murder was Dyfed-Powys in rural Wales. Hampshire refused to reveal the nationalities of the eight foreigners it has charged with rape, saying it could lead to ethnic victimisation. In London, more than a third of the 210 rape suspects charged in 2012 were from overseas. Twenty-four were from Jamaica, 14 from Nigeria, 13 from Poland and ten from Portugal. Of the 180 the Met charged with murder, 41 were foreigners, including seven from Jamaica and five from Turkey, Poland and Sri Lanka. Following the crash police officers . took down Masood’s details but allowed him to leave the scene to recover . from the ‘shock and trauma’ of the crash. Within a year he was travelling back . and forth between Britain and Pakistan on business. In 2007, he returned . to the UK using his real name and was given student status while . working full time for his business, Universal Workforce. Allister Walker, prosecuting, told . Maidstone Crown Court that Masood had given the name Ahmed Mukhtar to . police at the scene of the crash. ‘In fact, the defendant was an illegal . entrant into the United Kingdom. After the collision he left the United . Kingdom,’ he added. ‘He told police he returned after . marrying his Romanian partner in 2007. This time he returned as Zahid . Masood – his true identity.’ At the time of the crash, Masood, who . was convicted by a jury, had no insurance and held only a provisional . driving licence. He first came to Britain in 1999, using false papers. He was told he faces deportation when he leaves prison. Judge Philip . Statman said: ‘You had no right to be on the motorway unsupervised as . inevitably you were. ‘The telling feature in this case in . my judgement is that you were distracted because you were using a mobile . phone to make a business call. ‘You made absolutely no effort on your . return to the United Kingdom to surrender to the authorities. You . probably thought you had got away with it.’ Kent Police insisted last night it was not common procedure to arrest a driver at the scene of a collision. ‘We review all wanted person files and no case like this is ever fully closed,’ said Detective Constable Dave Holmes. ‘I am satisfied the Smoker family have finally been given some justice for their tragic loss.’","Michele and Ian Smoker say Zahid Masood, 47, should return to Pakistan .

A technician at a leading university used his laboratory equipment to prepare £10,000 worth of high-grade cocaine. Timothy Newbury operated a hydraulic press in the physics department at Bristol University to create blocks of the Class A drug. CCTV showed him sneaking into the laboratory with accomplice Nicholas Avery, a former soldier who had begun preparing the cocaine in a workshop at his home. Cocaine is first cut with other substances before being pressed into a block for sale. Timothy Newbury, 53, left, and his friend Nicholas Avery, 53, right, were caught on CCTV entering the laboratory . The men were caught together when . police stopped 53-year-old Newbury’s car and found £10,000 of pressed . cocaine inside. He was suspended by the university after his arrest and . has now been sacked. Newbury was jailed for 18 months at . Bristol Crown Court after admitting possession with intent to supply. The court heard he was due to receive a small amount of money for his . part in the crime, but had not been paid anything. The case has echoes of the popular US . drama Breaking Bad, in which chemistry teacher Walter White, played by . Bryan Cranston, uses his scientific know-how to produce crystal meth, a . powerful form of speed. Sentencing Newbury, of Bristol, on . Friday, Judge Julian Lambert told him: ‘You had led a positively good . and productive life until now and you have let your friends and family . down.’ When Avery’s home in Bristol was . searched, officers discovered 1.6lbs of high-purity cocaine worth almost . £200,000, and almost £4,000 in cash. Avery, 53, who served in Northern . Ireland and the Falklands, admitted two counts of possessing cocaine . with intent to supply and was jailed for five years. The judge told him: . ‘You have given great service to your country and I am greatly . disappointed in you.’ He told both men: ‘You made a . terrible choice when you decided to involve yourselves in the world of . controlled drugs.’ A proceeds-of-crime hearing will be held in . September. Avery worked as a lab technician at the physics department at the prestigious University of Bristol . 'Kenneth Ball, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Newbury was a lab technician employed by the University of Bristol in the Physics department. 'CCTV showed Mr Newbury and Mr Avery going to that lab. There the hydraulic press was used to press the cocaine taken there by Mr Avery who had cut it. 'In effect the Crown says there was a . cutting workshop at Mr Avery’s home and a pressing workshop at the . university which was operated by Mr Newbury.' Tim . Rose, defending Newbury, said he had an impeccable background but once . he had agreed to help Avery felt he could not then say no. Cocaine is cut with other substances, pressed into blocks and then sold in smaller 1g wraps, pictured . Tabitha Macfarlane, for Avery, said he had been a soldier of some stature who wanted to work as a close-protection security officer but needed money for the relevant licences. She said he recognised the stress he had caused his family - especially his 88-year-old father who was a veteran of Monte Cassino - and whom he feared he would not see again. A proceeds-of-crime hearing will be held in September. A University of Bristol spokesman said: 'We suspended the individual concerned as soon as we were made aware of the incident.

Today, armed police escorted him to Madrid's Central Criminal Court as he was driven into an underground car park and led into the court building in handcuffs. The extradition hearing was closed to the press and public. Last night Moran, part of an armed . gang that held up a Royal Mail van in Colne, Lancashire, in 2005, was . remanded in a local jail as the Spanish authoritiies considered his . future. A court source said Moran also had a case against him outstanding in Alicante, the province he was arrested in on Friday. The extradition judge has to decide . tomorrow whether to send him back to Alicante or authorise . first his forced return to Britain. Guns, cartridges and several mobile phones were seized from his home . These large knives were among the weapons recovered in Moran's property . A pair of guns and cartridges were found among Moran's possessions . It is not known what the outstanding court case relates to. A spokesman for Spain's Central . Criminal Court, where all extradition hearings take place, said: 'The . British fugitive arrested on the Costa Blanca appeared in court this . morning. 'The hearing was closed to the press and public and lasted around 10 minutes. 'He was asked if he opposed extradition and said he didn't. 'He was remanded to a local jail.' A court source added: 'It appears Moran has an outstanding case against him in a court in Alicante. 'Extradition for someone who agrees to be sent back is very quick and takes place within days. 'But the judge in this case must . decide whether he sends Moran back to Alicante to be dealt with first or . if he sends him back to the UK first. 'I haven't information on what the court case in Alicante relates to. Moran had been involved in a gang who threatened . a security guard with a gun and machete outside an ASDA supermarket in . Colne, Lancashire. They stole £25,000 . Moran escaped capture in Spain last November, when he drove up wrong . side of motorway to flee officers. It is not known how long Moran has . been living abroad . 'The decision on Moran's immediate future will be taken tomorrow once the judge has more information at his disposal.' He was named on a most wanted . Crimestoppers list in 2011 after assaulting four security guards and . fleeing from the dock during his trial at Burnley Crown Court in 2009.

Owners of iconic beach huts in Whitby say their view over the beach and sea has been ruined by 'ugly' safety railings. The crowd control-type barriers went up earlier this month in front of the colourful beach huts on the promenade above West Cliff Beach in the popular North Yorkshire resort. They were put up by Scarborough Borough Council who cited 'safety concerns', and said the barriers would be replaced with permanent railings in the autumn. Blighted: The colourful beach huts now have crowd-control barriers to stop people falling off the promenade . The iconic beach huts enjoy dramatic views over rockpools, the sandy beach, and the North Sea beyond . The colourful beach huts enjoyed far-reaching views over Whitby Pier, the sandy beach and the North Sea . This picture shoes the view from above the huts before the council put up the safety fencing in front of them . But chalet-owners say they were installed without consultation - and are spoiling their beautiful view. Maggie Hall, whose family has used one of the colourful chalets for 65 years, said: 'One of my great pleasures, one shared by many chalet users, is to hole up in the chalet on a miserable, rainy day with a cuppa, a book and the papers, gazing at that wonderful sight of the beach and the tide. 'I know there are many things to worry about in this world but it breaks my heart to think the council has robbed us of that view and pleasure.' Artist Dave Jeffery, who regularly paints the view, said: 'It's changed the whole aspect.  For anyone who has a beach hut, sitting out on a deck chair all they will see are metal railings in front of them instead of the view they will have been used to for many, many decades. 'It was a beautiful view, but now the railings look like crowd barriers.  They are very ugly.' The council said the tide and weather had reduced the level of sand on the beach in recent years, increasing the height of the drop between the promenade and the beach. Before the railings were put up, users of the promenade managed to get along it without falling into the sea . Holidaymaker Chris Hall, from Hull, is one of the hut owners who say their view has been ruined by the fencing . The council says it plans to replace the temporary barriers with more permanent railings . Andy Skelton, Scarborough Borough Council's director of service delivery, said: 'We were keen to address chalet users' safety concerns and took action to install temporary railings ahead of the last bank holiday weekend, which is viewed by many as the start of the summer season.

Veteran actor Arnold Peters, who was known for his role as Jack Woolley in The Archers for more than 30 years, has died at the age of 87. His appearances on the show spanned almost 60 years, having first featured in the cast in 1953 and notching up spells as two other characters prior to Jack. Peters died after suffering from Alzheimer’s, a disease which also affected his character - although he continued to perform until July 2011 despite the condition. Royal support: Arnold Peters is pictured in 1984 with Sara Coward, left, who plays Caroline Sterling and Princess Margaret, right, during the recording of an episode of the Archers . His family said he died on Saturday at a home in Northamptonshire. Peters was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s shortly after his character began to suffer from the condition but, despite the toll it was taking on his memory, he was able to continue acting and was said to “come to life” in front of a microphone. Although he was last heard on July 19 2011 in the show, Jack still survives in the show as a “silent” character, and is regularly visited by his wife Peggy. The Radio 4 series won a Mental Health Media Award for its handling of the Alzheimer’s storyline. Actress June Spencer, who plays Peggy, said: “As an actor he was the complete pro. He was very conscientious. He always turned in a good performance, no matter what we were doing.”He loved acting. It was his life. I picture him in the latter days in the green room, with his stick and his cap, always very genial. Full of character: Arnold Peters in the part of Jack Woolley . Vanessa Whitburn, editor of The Archers, said: “Arnold was immensely successful as Jack Woolley. With enormous skill he took the character from sharp, sometimes ruthless, businessman, mellowing through the years into retirement and eventual dependence on wife Peggy, as Alzheimer’s set in. Only the best actors can fine tune those character arcs over many years and Arnold was the best. He will be greatly missed by the whole Archers team and our thoughts are with the family.” Arnold’s first Archers role was as farmhand Len Thomas in 1953. After the character’s departure he became the Rev David Latimer, vicar of Ambridge, in 1968, continuing in that role for five years, and then returning in 1980 as Jack Woolley. He also became a familiar face on TV for his appearances in a TV ad campaign for Werther’s Originals toffees.","Arnold Peters first appeared on the celebrated Radio 4 show in 1953 .

Wales' oldest schoolboy rugby fixture has been suspended over teachers' fears that the boys on one team had become so much bigger and better at the game than the others. The match between private schools Llandovery College and Christ College, Brecon, has been called off for the first time in more than 130 years over worries the boys are now mismatched. This schools say a difference in emphasis between the schools - Llandovery excels at sport whereas Christ College concentrates more on academia - means that the Llandovery boys have become bigger, stronger, and thus a danger to those from Christ College. Llandovery College and Christ College, Brecon, have called off their historic rugby match over fears the Llandovery boys will hurt their smaller rivals. Picture shows the Christ College 1st XV in 1965/66 . The pupils at Christ College, Brecon, are concentrating less on rugby and more on a broader mix of sports and study . Guy Ayling, headmaster at Llandovery College, said: 'The pupils are devastated, but we are not shy about being outstanding at rugby; we are enormously proud of our teams, and their pursuit of excellence is quite inspirational. 'Since the advent of the professional game in rugby, the two schools have taken different routes, and it has been increasingly difficult to ensure a safe and competitive game as a result. 'It has therefore been decided by both schools that we should suspend the fixtures in senior rugby for the time being.' He added: 'Both schools are committed to reviewing this decision regularly, and if the day comes when the fixture can once more be played in a way that is both competitive and safe, the match may become a part of the calendar once more.' The clash has historically been the centrepiece of the sporting calendar for both mid-Wales schools. The first match in 1879 took place two years before the Welsh Rugby Union was launched. Guy Ayling, left, head of Llandovery College, said he was 'enormously proud' of his pupils' rugby abilities . But recently Christ College has paid less importance to the game, and turned pupils' focus instead to other sports and academic achievement. This has led to a 'widening physical gulf' between the two teams creating fears someone could soon be seriously injured. The gap between the two sides was highlighted in 2009 when 17-stone juggernaut George North appeared for Llandovery - just a year before his Wales international debut. Other notable former Llandovery pupils include rugby stars Alun Wyn Jones and Andy Powell. Llandovery has enjoyed a 15-year unbeaten run in the fixture but the clash has maintained its popularity at both schools. Emma Taylor, head of Christ College Brecon, said: 'Llandovery's rugby side is very big and very strong and we admire them for that. International rugby stars 'juggernaut' George North, left, and Alun Wyn Jones, right, both went to Llandovery . 'At Christ College we go for wider range of sports with a real emphasis of academic provision at the core of what we do.  Sport is very important, including rugby, but with a slightly different emphasis than Llandovery. 'Therefore our senior squad, on average, is generally made up of younger and less experienced players. 'The decision to suspend the fixture is exactly that, a suspension, and I certainly don't see it as the end of the story.' The rugby fixtures in younger age groups and fixtures at all levels in other sports will continue to be played. Back in 1888/89, the Christ College 1st XV was a good match for the team from Llandovery, but no longer .","Llandovery College and Christ College, Brecon, say teams are unequal .

So began the first volume of a journal written in 1832 by Princess Victoria of Kent, aged 13. It was a diary that the young royal - later to become Queen and ruler of the British Empire - would continue to add to until her death in 1901. And now, her great-great-granddaughter Queen Elizabeth has launched a website documenting Victoria's life in her own words. The monarch was handed a remote control in Buckingham Palace’s throne room yesterday, which she pointed at a screen to officially launch the website, www.queenvictoriasjournals.org - but revealed she had no plans to publish her own diaries. The site contains 40,000 pages of the surviving volumes of Victoria's journals, along with sketches and paintings she drew to illustrate them. The newly launched website www.queenvictoriasjournals.org contains scanned pages - some in Victoria's own hand - from the monarch's diaries . Princess Victoria's first diary entry outlined a trip to Wales in 1832 when she was 13; right, an entry from August 12 that same year . The Queen views some of the private journals of her great-great-grandmother, accompanied by curator of the Royal Collection, Lady Jane Roberts, during a reception to launch the Queen Victoria Journals Online project at Buckingham Palace yesterday . The first entry relating to Wales concerned a trip that was planned partly as a holiday, and partly as an opportunity to introduce the young princess to the nation to whose throne she was heiress. She wrote the passage as they travelled through Snowdonia. Her mother, the Duchess of Kent, and her Governess, Baroness Lehzen, wanted her to keep the diary to aid her education - that she might write well and observe what she saw. The Royal Archives, Bodleian Libraries at Oxford University and online publisher ProQuest scanned the pages - some in Victoria’s own hand and some edited and then transcribed by her daughter Beatrice after her death - for the six-month project, carried out to mark the Diamond Jubilee. When asked by Bodleian librarian Sarah Thomas if she herself wrote a diary, the Queen, wearing a summery floral printed dress, replied to laughter from those gathered to mark the launch: 'Mine’s not being published'. Dr Thomas said afterwards that she 'couldn’t resist' asking the Queen about her own journals, having been a part of the project. She added that it was 'an amazing honour' to work on the journals. She said: 'We have been motivated by the intrinsic value of these collections and the idea of sharing them. The site contains 40,000 pages of the surviving volumes of Victoria's journals, along with sketches and paintings she drew to illustrate them.

'It amplifies the excitement we have in having Her Majesty herself come here, because it shows she has a real interest. She was obviously engaged. 'This is a part of history. It is such an exciting moment, when you can unlock history and make it publicly available. 'The eyes of the world are focused on the Queen and the Diamond Jubilee - and this is the other Diamond Jubilee.' In her diary, Victoria wrote of the scenes that greeted her during a parade to mark her own 60-year reign: 'Passed through dense crowds, who gave me a most enthusiastic reception. It was like a triumphal entry. 'We passed down Cambridge Terrace, under a lovely arch bearing the motto, ""Our hearts thy Throne"". 'The streets were beautifully decorated, also the balconies of the houses with flowers, flags, and draperies of every hue... The streets, the windows, the roofs of the houses, were one mass of beaming faces, and the cheers never ceased.' Writing on the website, launched alongside a Twitter account providing extracts from the journals, the Queen said: 'In this the year of my Diamond Jubilee, I am delighted to be able to present, for the first time, the complete online collection of Queen Victoria’s journals from the Royal Archives.

A pencil drawing of two ghillies lying in the undergrowth, by Queen Victoria on October 1, 1851 . 'These diaries cover the period from Queen Victoria’s childhood days to her accession to the throne, marriage to Prince Albert, and later, her Golden and Diamond Jubilees. 'Thirteen volumes in Victoria’s own hand survive, and the majority of the remaining volumes were transcribed after Queen Victoria’s death by her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, on her mother’s instructions. 'It seems fitting that the subject of the first major public release of material from the Royal Archives is Queen Victoria, who was the first Monarch to celebrate a Diamond Jubilee.' The Queen took a particular interest in a drawing of Victoria’s wedding head dress when shown the original pages from the diaries today. The launch was timed to coincide with the 193rd anniversary of Victoria’s birth today. She would perhaps have been interested in how the documents are now available on the internet - as she wrote, again on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee, of sending a message electronically. She wrote: 'I touched an electric button, by which I started a message which was telegraphed throughout the whole Empire. 'I really cannot say how proud I feel to be the Queen of such a nation,' she wrote in her journal. Left, the Queen at Buckingham Palace in the year of her Diamond Jubilee; right, the monarch in her carriage leads a procession driving through London during her Diamond Jubilee celebrations in June 1897 . 'It was the following: ""From my heart I thank my beloved people, may God bless them."" At this time the sun burst out...' She had certainly envisaged them being read by others, writing on January 24 1843: 'Wrote in my journal, which I am vain enough to think may perhaps some day be reduced to interesting memoirs.' She also writes at length of her love for Prince Albert, describing her wedding day on February 10 1840: 'Albert repeated everything very distinctly. I felt so happy when the ring was put on, and by my precious Albert.' Above, the pair in May 1854 . Over the years, Victoria became a keen diarist, extensively documenting details of both public and private life. She underlined important words or phrases two or even three times, and liberally used exclamation marks. Her daughter, Princess Beatrice, spent 40 years transcribing the journals covering the period 1837 to 1901 - a total of 111 volumes. Victoria instructed her to modify the text, taking out parts that could offend other members of the family and other sections not suitable for publication. The originals were destroyed, in accordance with Victoria’s wishes. Other key events detailed in the diary include Victoria’s coronation, her entry for that day reading that she was woken by guns in a nearby park at 4am and then could not sleep because of the noise of the crowds gathered outside. She wrote: 'There were millions of my loyal subjects assembled in every spot to witness the procession. Their good humour and excessive loyalty was beyond everything. 'I really cannot say how proud I feel to be the Queen of such a nation.' She also writes at length of her love for Prince Albert, describing her wedding day on February 10 1840: 'Albert repeated everything very distinctly. I felt so happy when the ring was put on, and by my precious Albert.' Two days later, she wrote: 'Oh! was ever woman so blessed as I am.' Her sorrow at his illness and death are palpable, writing in her diary on January 1 1862, her first entry after his death: 'This day last year found us so perfectly happy and now!!.., . 'All these recollections were pouring in on my mind in an overpowering manner. Felt as if living in a dreadful dream.' Pam Clark, senior archivist at the Royal Archive, said she had learned a lot about Victoria while working on the project. 'She’s a natural writer, and a natural painter,” she said. 'She had a way with words and a way with her pen. It’s very exciting to see all this coming together.' The Twitter account @QueenVictoriaRI will be active during the Jubilee period. The online release of the diaries, which have been transcribed up to the year 1840, mark the start of a year-long programme to digitise work from the Royal Archive.","Wrote diary from 1832 until her death in 1901 .

Father-of-one Lee Lewis, 22, was killed when he crashed his stolen car during a 12-mile police chase by 'untrained officers' The family of a joyrider who was killed in a police chase have been awarded £20,000 in compensation. Father-of-one Lee Lewis, 22, suffered multiple injuries when his stolen car hit a wall during a 12-mile chase by four police cars in Port Talbot, south Wales. The five 'untrained' officers who gave chase had ignored orders from the police control room to stop the pursuit. They were given written warnings after an investigation into the fatal crash. Lewis' family have now been given £20,000 compensation - awarded to his seven-year-old son Iestyn. They were awarded an out-of-court settlement after a putting in a civil claim for negligence against South Wales Police. Lewis, . who had just become a father at the time of the crash, died after . taking a Ford Fiesta from a street in Swansea in May 2008. He crashed into the stone wall after leading the two police cars and two vans at speeds of up to 87mph. Lewis' grandfather Peter Howells today slammed the way the case had been dealt by the police force. He said: 'He was a young man, he had a young baby, and it's ruined our lives. 'These officers didn't even get a speeding fine, they've had nothing, just a slap on the wrist - this isn't justice.' Five officers were given written warnings for misconduct after an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission . South Wales Police yesterday claimed lessons had been learned from the incident. Alun Michael, South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner, said: 'Having reviewed the case with senior officers I am satisfied with the thoroughness of the investigation. 'I feel great sympathy for the family of Lee Lewis. 'While I understand the family's position, I can see no grounds for further action in this case.' The compensation payout was slated today by the TaxPayers' Alliance. Campaign manager Robert Oxley said: 'It is a tragedy that a man has lost his life but that does not justify this outcome. Lee Lewis died after taking a Ford Fiesta from a street in Swansea in May 2008 and crashing it into a wall (file picture) 'It was the joyrider who put his and other people's lives at risk. 'The police must review their decisions that day but this does not justify a taxpayer funded compensation payment for an accident that was a result an individual's actions, not others.' South Wales Police agreed to pay the £20,000 compensation even though Lewis was not wearing a seatbelt when he crashed during the chase. Lewis died 12 days after the crash in Morriston Hospital, Swansea, in May 2008, after developing blood poisoning. Five officers were given written warnings for misconduct in 2009 after disobeying orders from their control room to stop pursuing Mr Lewis. It concluded they had committed disciplinary offences by disobeying orders from their control room to stop pursuing Mr Lewis, who had been seen driving without lights. The IPCC investigation concluded that none of the officers were qualified to take part in pursuit driving and that some had denied understanding the meaning of the term 'stand down'. They were found to have given inaccurate information about their speeds until 'black box"" recorder devices from their vehicles established they were doing nearly 90mph at times. IPCC Commissioner for Wales Tom Davies said: 'The police pursuit was conducted by four drivers who were not pursuit trained. 'During some stages of the pursuit there were four police vehicles in a convoy travelling at speeds of up to 87 MPH on roads that had a 60mph limit. 'This included two police cars and two police vans, one of which was a dog handler's van. 'When the officers were interviewed by the IPCC they were unable to recall travelling at excess speeds or that they were ordered to stop the pursuit but continued. 'The public perception of a police officer is an individual who gives reliable and accurate evidence. 'During the course of our investigation it has been disappointing that the officers actively involved in the incident found it difficult to recall distances, speeds and the actions of others.'","Lee Lewis, 22, died after crashing a stolen car following a 12-mile police chase .

Andrew Kelly, pictured outside York Crown Court, was caught speeding at 122mph, and used a forum to try and avoid a conviction . A biker who was caught speeding at 122mph visited an internet forum to brag about how he avoided a parking fine and to ask for advice on how to avoid speeding points. Andrew John Kelly, 37, took to the forum to find out how he could get off the speeding charge after he was clocked with a friend. A court heard how he persistently lied to the police and provoked outrage on the forum after admitting to other users that he had been caught on the A63 near Selby, North Yorkshire, on June 20 last year. Police were tipped off by Road Safety Support - a not-for-profit company providing specialist services to the police and local authorities - about the thread on pepipoo.com in September last year and Kelly was arrested. Kelly, of Pudsey, West Yorkshire, was jailed for eight months after admitting two counts of  perverting the course of justice and one charge of speeding. A judge labelled his behaviour 'calculated, deliberate and thoroughly disturbing'. During the investigation, police uncovered that father-of-one Kelly had previously boasted about how he had forged a recovery invoice and claimed his car had broken down when he parked in a disabled parking space so he could buy a sandwich. Posting under the name 'andyroo', Kelly, who works as an MOT tester at his father’s garage, stated that he was the rider at the time of the offence but  didn’t want the points so asked other users how to avoid being caught.

Traffic Constable Zoe Billings of North Yorkshire Police said: 'Unbelievably Kelly published his intention to lie about who was riding his motorbike on the internet. 'When forum users spoke of their disgust at his dishonesty, he then bragged to them about how he had lied in the past and got away with not paying for a parking ticket. 'Our investigation also revealed that Kelly had a history of failing to comply with statutory documentation and a complete disregard for road safety. 'He tried to portray himself as a simple mechanic who was poor at paperwork, but in reality, he is an accomplished liar. 'He continued to lie during police interviews and only when presented with overwhelming evidence through his seized clothing, did he admit to being the rider of the bike.'

Stephen Smith, co-founder of the pepipoo.com motoring advice website and forums, said: 'This case shows yet again that many people don’t appear to appreciate the seriousness of lying about what they may see as ""just speeding"", or even something as minor as a parking fine.'","Andrew John Kelly, 37, took to forum to ask how he could get off charge .

A mother who went to extraordinary lengths to con her family and friends out of thousands of dollars by convincing them she was dying of cancer, has pleaded guilty to theft by deception in a bid to escape jail. Lori Stilley, 41, of Delran, New Jersey duped supporters by telling them she had Stage IV bladder cancer - even writing a book about her experience, making t-shirts and holding fund-raisers in the scam. On Monday she entered a plea bargain that calls for her to receive four years probation when she's sentenced in July. Lori Stilley, 40, has pleaded guilty to accepting money from fundraisers after falsely claiming she had bladder cancer . The prosecutor's office said it all began in February, 2011, when Stilley allegedly told friends and family that she had been diagnosed with Stage III bladder cancer and had to undergo radiation and chemotherapy . Under the terms of the deal she would also have to pay restitution ranging from $15,000 to $20,000 and perform at least 100 hours of community service. She also will have to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, reports NBC10. In February 2011, Stilley told those close to her and posted on Facebook that she had been diagnosed with cancer. In April, she said her condition had . worsened, and supporters quickly raised more than $12,000 . for medical expenses, prepared her meals and even paid for the . 'inspirational' mother's wedding. Her 'Team Lori Rocks' support page on Facebook attracted more than 300 friends, all eager to make the New Jersey woman's life as happy as possible in her last few months. But, after suddenly announcing a 'miraculous recovery' in November, suspicion arose around the mother-of-two's 'condition'.

In February last year, the con-artist told friends she had Stage III cancer, and would have to undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In April 2011, she told them her condition had deteriorated and she would need to go to a hospice.

"By . David Martosko In Washington and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:58 EST, 6 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:55 EST, 6 May 2013 . Stand down: Gregory Hicks, the number two diplomat in Libya at the time of the Benghazi attacks, says special operations troops were told to stand down . The former number two diplomat in Libya has told members of Congress that U.S. Special Operation Command in Africa denied U.S. commandos permission to fly to the scene of the slaughter to intervene. Gregory Hicks gave private testimony in April about the events of September 11, 2012, and will testify in public during a Washington, D.C. hearing on Wednesday. Hicks is one of three State Department . 'whistle blowers' expected to appear publicly in front of the House Oversight . Committee to speak out about the Obama Administration's response to the attacks that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. According to a partial transcript released Monday and first reported by CBS News, Hicks said a lieutenant colonel who was readying his team in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, was told to stand down instead of boarding a military C-130 aircraft bound for Benghazi. Additionally, the military was unable to scramble fighter jets to engage the attackers because air support was too far away. Hicks believes fighters could have saved lives by dispersing the Libyan attackers. SOCAFRICA, the special operations command on the African continent, which answers to the Pentagon, reportedly delivered the order. Witness: Gregory N. Hicks, a veteran officer of the Foreign Service - was in Tripoli on the night of the attack when he received a distress call from Ambassador Stevens . Tragic: The September 11, 2012, assault on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi resulted in the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The special ops officer, Hicks . testified, ‘got a phone call from SOCAFRICA which said, ""You can't go . now, you don't have the authority to go now."" And so they missed the . flight ... They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it.' He . added that his aim was to fill the scheduled C-130 flight with . special-forces rescuers, specifically because security measures at the . Benghazi outpost were known to be lax. ‘We . fully intended for those guys to go,’ Hicks said, ‘because we had . already essentially stripped ourselves of our security presence, or our . security capability, to the bare minimum.’ But ultimately, he insisted, ‘They were told not to board the flight.’ The U.S. State Department gave the order, according to Hicks’ recollection of remarks from the SOCAFRICA commander, whom he identified only as Lieutenant Colonel Gibson. ‘I still remember Colonel Gibson,’ Hicks recalled. ‘He said, ""I have never been so embarrassed in my life that a State Department officer has bigger balls than somebody in the military."" A nice compliment.’ While mortars and rocket-propelled grenades rained down on the American outpost, no American military forces came to the rescue of the consulate’s personnel. Four Americans perished, including Ambassador Stevens. Hicks said he believed a quickly scrambled fighter jet could have prevented additional casualties after the first wave of terrorist attacks, which the CIA determined almost immediately came from the militant group Ansar al-Sharia and other al-Qaeda-related Islamist rebels. ‘If we had been able to scramble a fighter or aircraft or two over Benghazi as quickly as possible after the attack commenced, I believe there would not have been a mortar attack on the annex in the morning because I believe the Libyans would have split,’ he testified. Mourned: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Foreign . Service Officer Sean Smith were both killed inside the American . consulate in Benghazi, Libya . Defenders: Glen Doherty, left, and Tyrone Woods, . right, were former Navy seamen who responded to the call for help from . the consulate and were killed in a counter-attack by the terrorists . ‘They would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them.’ In the wake of the attack, the Obama administration repeatedly claimed that a YouTube video that mocked the Muslim prophet Muhammad angered a spontaneous mob of protesters outside the consulate, and that the protest turned unpredictably deadly. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice appeared on five Sunday morning political talk shows on September 16, repeating that line from a set of unclassified talking points provided by the White House. Reporting from The Weekly Standard has since established that  those talking points originated as a frank description from the CIA of a coordinated, pre-planned terror attack. Following a meeting of administration deputies, the conservative magazine has reported, the talking points were reduced to the inconclusive report that informed Rice’s television appearances – sanitized of all references to premeditation and Islamist terrorism. Information trickling out of the Obama administration has suggested in recent weeks that the White House was aware from the beginning that the Benghazi consulate was under attack by organized terrorists. Hicks’ testimony reinforces that line of thought. Allegation: One of the Benghazi 'whistle-blowers' will reportedly claim on Wednesday that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to silence the State Department's own counterterrorism bureau . ‘I was in communications with Washington all night long,’ he said. ‘I was reporting all night long what was happening to Washington by telephone.’ 'I thought it was a terrorist attack . from the get-go. I think everybody in the mission thought it was a . terrorist attack from the beginning,' Hicks said, according to excerpts . of interviews released to CBS' Face the Nation. Hicks, . a 22-year veteran of the foreign service, says he was furious when U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on TV five days after the attack and . declared that U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans . died as part of an anti-American 'demonstration' by Libyans. 'I've never been as embarrassed in my life, in my career, as on that day,' he told Congressional interviewers. He . added: 'I never reported a demonstration. I reported an attack on the . consulate. Chris's last report - if you want to say his final report - . is, ""Greg, we are under attack.""' Asked by congressional investigators if military authorities ever considered sending an F-16 fighter jet into the airspace over Benghazi, Hicks said he asked twice and heard the same negative answer both times. ‘I talked with the Defense Attache, Lt. Col. Keith Phillips,’ Hicks said, ‘and I asked him, ""Is there anything coming?"" And he said that the nearest fighter planes were [at] Aviano [Air Force Base, in Italy], that he had been told that it would take two to three hours to get them airborne, but that there were no tanker assets near enough to support a flight from Aviano.’ Eric Nordstrom, who was the regional security officer in Libya, also testified on Capitol Hill on October 10 . Hicks later mentioned ‘the second time that night’ that he asked Phillips 'is there anything coming, is there anything out there to help our people from, you know, big military? And the answer, again, was the same as before. … The answer was, ""it's too far away, there are no tankers, there is nothing, there is nothing that could respond.""' Another witness of the attacks, Mark . I. Thompson, a U.S. Marine veteran and a State Department . counter-terrorism adviser, plans to testify that then-Secretary of State . Hillary Clinton tried to leave her department's own counter-terrorism bureau out of . the loop as government in the hours after the attacks as officials figured out how to respond to the attacks. The . third witness is Eric Nordstrom, a former State Department diplomatic . security officer in charge of regional security in Libya. The Wednesday afternoon hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will include testimony from Hicks and two other whistle-blowers who have first-person knowledge of what happened on the ground. 'Clearly, there was a political . decision to say something different than what was reasonable to say,' House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa told Face the Nation. He . said State Department and White House officials launched 'what is a . misinformation campaign, at best, and a cover-up at worst.' 'Cover-up': Congressman Darrell Issa, the Republican in charge of the Benghazi attack hearings, says the testimony from the whistle blowers could reveal an Obama Administration 'cover-up' Political fallout for the Obama administration could be devastating, although not as much as it might have been if the testimony had been heard in September or October – before the 2012 presidential election. Barack Obama claimed during one presidential debate with former Republican nominee Mitt Romney that he designated the Benghazi attack ‘an act of terrorism’ during a press conference on the day after it occurred. A transcript of the president’s remarks from that September 12 event show that he used the word ‘terrorism,’ but not specifically in reference to the Benghazi attack. During a CBS News interview taped just hours after that press conference, 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft asked Obama to comment on early reports that armed militia men carried out the assault on the U.S. consulate. ‘Do you believe that this was a terrorist attack?’ Kroft asked the president. ‘Well, it's too early to know exactly how this came about, what group was involved,’ Obama replied, ‘but obviously it was an attack on Americans.’ CBS broadcast that interview only on November 4, one day before Obama was re-elected.","Deputy Chief of Mission Gregory Hicks will testify that military intervention, including scrambling a fighter jet, could have saved lives .

Admission: Former Tory MP Louise Mensch says alcohol was ruining her life, as she was drinking every night after work . Former Tory MP Louise Mensch has criticised Britain's 'off-base' culture of drinking to unwind saying that alcohol was ruining her life before she emigrated. Mrs Mensch, who quit politics to move to America, says she has been diagnosed with a form of attention deficit disorder (ADD), which meant she was 'self-medicating' for stress with a large glass of wine after work every night. The controversial chick-lit author last month admitted having a face-lift because 'I like the way I look and like to keep it that way'. She has now encouraged others to give up drinking because it will improve mood, sleep patterns, and refresh the skin. The 41-year-old says she was diagnosed with ADD (type 2 inattentive), which has an impact on concentration. Her 'problem' with alcohol is yet another admission by the former Tory MP for Corby and East Northamptonshire, who also said she was involved with hard drugs as a young woman. On her Unfashionista blog, under the title 'Why-ne O'Clock', she wrote that moving to America 'had a number of beneficial side effects, but the most profound has been that I have almost completely given up alcohol'. 'Like many British women I relished that moment every night, after work, when I could get a large glass of white somewhere, and relax,' she said. 'I now realise it was also putting the breaks on the spinning atoms in my head, caused by untreated ADD. I was self-medicating for stress. And Britain is a culture in love with alcohol. In fact not to drink makes you weird and a killjoy. 'But alcohol was ruining my quality of life, although I didn't understand this fully until I stopped wanting to drink it. 'The elephant in the room is that British culture is completely off-base about booze. It's NOT ok to drink wine every night. It's not ok even to have a large glass of wine when you do'. Marriage: Louise Mensch with her husband Peter Mensch, who she moved to New York with after quitting as MP for Corby . In August last year she sensationally . quit as an MP, saying she could not represent Corby in Northamptonshire . because she could not juggle her political and family life. Mrs Mensch . moved to New York with her three children to live with her second . husband Peter, who manages rock group Metallica. One of the so-called ‘Cameron cuties’, Mrs Mensch won the her seat for the Conservatives in 2010 after it had been in Labour hands for 13 years. Labour then regained the seat in a by-election which was triggered by her departure. Her decision to quit, three years before the next election went down badly with her party, and she was booed and heckled when she appeared on a film screen at the Conservative party conference. Blog: Mrs Mensh wrote about her problems with drink on her Unfashionista website, under the title 'Why-ne O'Clock' This week she wrote that Americans have a 'happier and healthier' life because they do not drink like the British, and warned many others may have untreated Attention Deficit Disorder. 'It's a sign of a problem that you feel the need to have an evening drink. You shouldn't need it. If, like I was, you are a woman who drinks ""reasonably but regularly"", it's not reasonable. Consider that you may have ADD. Ask your doctor,' she said. 'There is a downside to cutting right back on alcohol, and it is that when you do indulge (even modestly) it will hit you a hell of a lot harder - seemingly unfairly hard, because you will lose your alcohol tolerance. 'But it is a small price to pay for a happier life. Consider making this change.

"By . Rob Cooper . PUBLISHED: . 11:10 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:51 EST, 22 April 2013 . Peeping tom: Russell Singleton, 57, filmed schoolgirls using his bathroom from behind a two-way mirror over a ten-year period . An assistant headteacher secretly filmed schoolgirls using the bathroom through a two-way mirror in his home over a period lasting almost 10 years, a court heard. Russell Singleton, 57, set up a secret den behind a false wall in his airing cupboard so he could act as a peeping tom. The married man, who was a popular and highly-regarded teacher with 35 years experience, would give girls soft drinks when they visited his home so they would make regular trips to the bathroom. Nottingham Crown Court heard he would secretly film them from a wall cavity between the bathroom and the airing cupboard which was big enough for him to fit into. The teacher fitted a camcorder, which was . placed on a shelf and trained on the shower and toilet, with a remote . sensor allowing him to operate it when he wasn't there. Singleton's wife had no idea he had set up a 'sophisticated system' to covertly film the students in their detached home behind the two-way mirror. Pupils would regularly come round for production rehearsals and after-show parties. He also filmed other female victims that weren't pupils of his, including ex-students and a teacher. The court heard Singleton, of Heanor, Derbyshire, amassed a haul of 24 videos of nine different females using the bathroom. Detectives also found 366 similar images on his mobile phone. He was jailed for 38 months after admitting a string of sexual offences. Avik Mukherjee, prosecuting, said the victims were left 'disgusted, confused, violated and betrayed.' The incident left one teenage girl so traumatised that she attempted suicide. Judge Michael Stokes QC, sentencing, said: 'What is particularly concerning is, having filmed these girls and recording what they were doing, he would see them the very next day in school. 'It poisons the atmosphere and, in his secretive little mind, he was teaching girls that he had filmed naked in the shower the previous day.' At an earlier hearing, the judge told Singleton: 'This was carefully planned and pre-meditated. It is very serious because of the length of time offending happened and the degree of planning and repetition involved.' Singleton was assistant head, and head of the arts and drama department at Alfreton Grange Arts College, formerly known as Mortimer Wilson Secondary School, in Derbyshire when the offences occurred. Voyeur: Singleton, 57, set up a secret camera from behind the bathroom mirror in his home in Heanor, Derbyshire. School pupils would regularly come round for drama rehearsals, the court heard . The hearing was told he was a 'talented, enthusiastic and effective teacher who engendered feelings of loyalty, affection, and respect in the numerous pupils who had passed through the school.' Singleton was so trusted by colleagues and parents that pupils were allowed to stay over for drama rehearsals and post-production parties. But for nearly a decade, he took advantage of the trust placed in him. The court heard that on one recording of a 13-year-old girl in his bathroom, Singleton could be heard breathing heavily. He was caught out when police searched his home last year after a teenage student admitted to another teacher she and Singleton were having an affair. Mr Mukherjee said: 'They found set up in a partition between the bathroom and airing cupboard a big enough space for him to be in and a camcorder set up which enabled him to record things live. 'It involved a high degree of planning and had gone on for a considerable length of time.' After his arrest, Singleton admitted he was interested in 'voyeurism', and admitted he had filmed the pupils for his own sexual pleasure. But he claimed they were 'victimless' because they did not know were being recorded. Jailed, Singleton, 57, was given 38 months behind bars for filming the victims in his bathroom between 2003 and 2012 . Popular teacher: Russell Singleton worked as a drama teacher at Alfreton Grange Arts College, Derbyshire, for 35 years and was well-respected, the court heard . Singleton admitted nine counts of taking indecent photographs of children, two of making indecent photographs of children, and three charges of voyeurism. The offences related to children aged 13 to 17 years and adults between 18 and 24 years, and dated from 2003 to 2012. Singleton also pleaded guilty to seven charges of sexual activity when he was in a position of trust, an offence which involved a pupil when she was aged 16 and 17. Mark Watson, defending, said Singleton's wife of 31 years had been 'completely unaware' of his actions. He added that she had been left 'devastated' - but was standing by him. Mr Watson also told the court: 'His fall from grace has been complete. His reputation is destroyed. 'He faces humiliation. The consequences for him go beyond a prison sentence.'

"Amanda Dodd slimmed down from 17st to 10 and a half . Cut out junk food to achieve her dream of performing on stage . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 05:58 EST, 14 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:18 EST, 13 May 2013 . Weight loss can have many positive effects and for one woman, it has helped her career soar. Amanda Dodd, 41, from Solihull, West Midlands once tipped the scaled at 17 stone and hid behind baggy size 22 dresses but was determined to squeeze back into her sexy size 10 corset after landing a lead role as Sally Bowles a cabaret which was to be performed in front of 1,100 people. The mother-of-one was so determined to lose the pounds that she shunned junk food to achieve her goal and her professional life has bloomed ever since. Amanda Dodd has shed almost seven stone - to slip into a corset to star in a raunchy production of Cabaret . Amanda once weighed 17st but she cut out the junk food to shed the pounds and hasn't looked back since . And just two years after her new weight loss programme, Amanda is now running her own health and wellness business, helping other people to transform their lives. Amanda said: 'I’d always been a fairly big child - and although I was very active, I’d always enjoyed my food, and been bigger than all my peers. 'As I got older, and had a family, more and more weight crept on, and I started to become a shadow of my former self. 'At my biggest, I weighed over 17 stone - and hated being in the limelight. Amanda has slimmed from a size 22 to a healthy size 10 and feels great in her new body . 'I’d always loved acting and being on the stage, but the bigger I got, the less and less confident I became, and I started to take parts backstage, rather than acting and singing. 'One of my friends insisted that I take on a role in one of his plays - and wouldn’t take no for an answer. 'I knew straight away that I couldn’t go on stage with all those people looking at me, and that I had to do something about my weight. 'The thought of getting on stage in front of people made me feel sick.' Amanda cut out the junk and began a strict exercise regime - after enrolling on the lighter life diet plan. And as the pounds melted away, her confidence soared - as she went from 17 stone to a svelte size 8 to 10 - weighing in at just over 10 and a half stone. Amanda looks like a different person in her new body and has gone on to achieve her performing dream (image: Peter Weston / Caters News) Amanda added: 'As soon as the weight started to come off, I got more and more determined to achieve my goal. 'My confidence was sky high - I started auditioning for loads more roles, and was thrilled when I landed the part of Sally Bowles - and I didn’t have to worry about fitting into the costumes. 'That is the role of a lifetime for me - but never in my wildest dreams think I’d ever be able to play it at my size. 'Once I lost weight, every area of my life seemed to improve - because I was more confident, I started becoming more vocal at work, which led to me being promoted. 'I realised that I could help other people with their confidence issues too, and found I finally had the confidence to start my own business - helping people with their health and wellness. 'Sometimes it’s weight loss that’s an issue for people, sometimes it’s purely a confidence issue, but I try to help people achieve whatever their goals are by helping them adopt a healthy lifestyle.'","Amanda Dodd slimmed down from 17st to 10 and a half .

Sleep deprivation plays an important role in lowering the achievement of schoolchildren, according to new research. The study, carried out by Boston College in the U.S., also found that the problem was particularly prevalent in developed countries - experts believe this is because of the increasingly technology-saturated culture children live in. According to the BBC, the international comparison found the U.S. to have the highest number of sleep-deprived students, with 73 per cent of nine and 10-year-olds, and 80 per cent of 13 and 14-year-olds identified by their teachers as being adversely affected. The U.S. has the highest number of sleep-deprived students, with 73 per cent of nine and 10-year-olds, and 80 per cent of 13 and 14-year-olds being affected . In contrast, 47 per cent of primary schoolchildren across the world need more sleep, as do 57 per cent of secondary school pupils. The worst affected countries were found to be New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Australia, England, Ireland and France while children who get the most sleep tended to be found in countries including Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Portugal, Japan and Malta. The researchers studied data about more than 900,000 schoolchildren in more than 50 countries. The children were asked to sit tests in maths, science and reading and the results from these tests were studied alongside interview responses from their teachers and parents about their sleep habits. The researchers believe that the prevalence of computers and mobile phones in children’s bedrooms are primarily to blame for the sleep deprivation – partly because children stay awake using them, but also because looking at a screen before going to bed disrupts natural sleep patterns. Chad Minnich, of the TIMSS and PIRLS International Study Centre, told the BBC: ‘If you are unable to concentrate, to attend mentally, you are unable to achieve at your optimal level, because your mind and body are in need of something more basic. Children who are sleep deprived cannot concentrate so teachers have to adapt their lessons which means that even the unaffected children are held back . ‘Sleep is a fundamental need for all children. If teachers report such large proportions of children suffering from lack of sleep, it's having a significant impact. ‘But worse than that, teachers are having to modify their instruction based on those children who are suffering from a lack of sleep.’ He explained that, as a result, the children who are suffering from a lack of sleep are driving down the achievement of all of the students. The researchers do, however, acknowledge that sleep deprivation is not the only indicator of academic success and that the ill-effects can be reversed if sleep levels are increased.","Lack of sleep lowers a child's academic achievement .

But it appears American contestants are finding the gentle cooking competition a bit harder to handle. Judge Paul Hollywood said bakers on the other side of the Atlantic are so sensitive that they burst into tears every time he criticises their cakes. Tantrums and tears: Paul Hollywood was surprised that his harsh criticisms of competitors' cakes brought them to tears on the new US version of Great British Bake Off . The 47-year-old has joined a new US version of the hit BBC2 show - renamed The Great American Baking Competition - to air on CBS later this month. His British co-star Mary Berry has been replaced by American chef Marcela Valladolid, while US comedian Jeff Foxworthy takes the place of hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. Speaking at the TV Bafta Awards on Sunday, Mr Hollywood praised British contestants for having a ‘stiff upper lip’ and admitted he was surprised to discover how thin-skinned their American counterparts were. He said: ‘It’s exactly the same show. Same tent, same set up, same stations, same people. Except they are bigger. They are very emotional, and of course I’m not the right person to put up with that. Within the first week, all of them were crying. ‘I said “I’m so sorry, but I’m only saying your cake doesn’t look good.” And then they just burst into tears. It’s all a bit much. But in Britain it’s all stiff upper lip. And then you get crying later.’ UK pride: Hollywood, pictured on last year's Great British Bake Off with Mary Berry, said contestants in America lacked the 'stiff upper lip' of the Brits .

For the benefit of American viewers unfamiliar with his fame in the UK, CBS dubbed Paul Hollywood ‘the George Clooney of baking’ in its promotional material. The series will begin on May 29. The programme’s successful format has been licensed to 11 countries – including the US, America and France – by BBC Worldwide, the corporation’s commercial arm. Mr Hollywood admitted he had trouble understanding the American contestants, and said they were less skilled in the kitchen than the British.

I had to adjust to the accents. You know the twang. I had to tune in because we had people from the deep south, from Boston, LA, California, New York. I had to tune in to all of them, but in the end I got it. ‘And they got it as well. They certainly got the rough end of my tongue a few times. They sat back too much. I am judging a product, not a person. It is not personal for me. ‘It may be the first time they have heard criticism of their bakes. They have to take it, because it is the only way you get better and better and better.’ ‘At one point a contestant pulled me to one side and said “I think you’re wrong.” I said: “It’s fine if you think I’m wrong. Unfortunately for you, I’m the judge.” He just looked at me and just said “English.”’ He added: ‘To be honest, the bakers over here are much better. But we are filming series four now here so the fact is things will only get better in America. You are going to attract a more qualified baker. ‘I just hope the Americans like it.

The elegant vessel - which Mr Bygott had spent 26 years and hundreds of thousands of pounds restoring - shattered on rocks near Padstow, with pieces left strewn across a nearby beach. Wreckage: Ron Bygott and three crew members were rescued but the boat was smashed apart by the sea and eventually washed up on a beach . Destroyed: The historic fishing boat was destroyed after it smashed against rocks - while the crew prepared to scatter a friend's ashes at sea. Here parts of the vessel can be seen strewn across the beach . Mayday: The 50ft ship as it was before it was wrecked. Mr Bygott says the wheelhouse had broken in half after it struck rocks and they were forced to issue a Mayday call . Shipmates: Ron Bygott, 66, left, had gone out to see to scatter the ashes of John Fox, 45, right . The crew had been attempting to anchor the ship in the Camel estuary at the time of the disaster on April 28, but the vessel suffered a gearbox failure. The four sailors were rescued by the RNLI who say they arrived 'in the nick of time' as the men would have died just minutes later as the ship broke up. 'True friend': Mr Fox, pictured, sailed with Mr Bygott for 28 years . Looters made off with most of the wreckage left on the beach but a couple of treasured items were salvaged - including Mr Fox's urn. Mr Bygott said Mr Fox's parents had asked for his ashes to be scattered at sea after his death last December from liver complications. The married dad-of-two from Bristol said: '[Mr Fox] joined me when he was 18 years old. We were sailing together for 28 years and he was a true friend. 'We were going to scatter his ashes at the same exact place where I sprinkled my father Frederick's ashes ten years earlier but we got into trouble going into Padstow. A lifeboat turned up in about 15 minutes and it's lucky they did because my boat and the wheelhouse broke in half. 'The wheelhouse was attached to the main mast. If that had gone we would probably have gone with it. John's urn was sitting on his bunk when the ship went down. I'd also . kept my father's urn onboard all those years so that went too.' Mr Bygott said looters 'even took the figurehead - the one part I was most desperate to keep.' Members of the coastguard rescued the two urns from a rock pool. Mr . Bygott and Mr Fox had spent nearly three decades at sea together on the . 50ft vessel - which Mr Bygott had bought to restore and poured his life . savings into. The . ship, which he used for displays at boat shows - was just a hull when . Mr Bygott, a steel company boss, bought it for £12,600. Skipper: Mr Bygott, pictured, scattered his father Frederick's ashes out at sea 10 years earlier . Sad: Wreckage from Courageous II is spread across Greenway Beach in Cornwall. Looters stole most of the wreckage, but several important pieces were salvaged by the crew . Damage: The remains of the ship's wheelhouse were washed up on the beach upside down and covered in debris . Restored: More wreckage scattered on the beach. The ship had been reused and lovingly restored by Mr Bygott before the accident . More than 25 years later the colourful fishing boat - known as a 'pop pop' because of the sound of its engine - had attracted a huge following. Mr Bygott said it was so badly damaged - and that so much had been stolen - there is no hope of repairing it. He said to rebuild the stainless steel and wooden ship today would cost £1million. 'I'm absolutely distraught about the boat,' he said, 'I poured 26 years of my life into it and spent crazy money over the years. 'It was a dream, my finest achievement. It would cost you at least a million pounds to do all that work from scratch. It had a huge following and people would come from all parts to see it. I've even had someone asking me if I'll sign a piece of the wreckage.' Remains: The Courageous II had become a popular sight for boat lovers off the coast of Cornwall . Memories: There is little left of the elegant ship - seen here in port before it was wrecked . Costly: To rebuild the stainless steel and wooden fishing boat today would cost an estimated £1million . Restored: The ship, pictured in 1940, was just a hull when Mr Bygott bought it for £12,600 . Mike England, of Padstow RNLI said: 'This was a very speedy rescue as the four men were in immediate danger with the boat literally breaking up under their feet. Fortunately thanks to skilful boat handling in very shallow water we were able to get them off the boat and ashore in minutes and they are all well.' The vessel was carrying 900 litres (198 gallons) of fuel and coastguards worked with the harbour authority to contain a 'small oil slick' coming from the wreck. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) has been informed about the incident. Recovered: Despite looters making off with much of the wreckage, Mr Fox's urn was salvaged .","Ron Bygott, 66, and three crew were on board the Courageous II at time .

Accused: Kurtis Green was reported to the police after connecting a water supply to a war memorial in Dersingham, Norfolk, without permission . A teenager who was questioned by police after a council accused him of connecting a water supply to a war memorial without permission - will not face prosecution. Kurtis Green, 19, and a 65-year-old man were reported to the police by Dersingham . Parish Council, in Norfolk, after allegedly carrying out the work without its consent. The teenager - who has tended to the memorial unpaid for 12 years - was questioned by officers for two hours at Hunstanton police station and . told that he had been accused of theft and causing criminal . damage. Norfolk Police put out a statement last week, saying that the matter was being considered by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). But a spokeswoman said today that the file on the case was not going to be handed to the CPS after all. She said: 'Officers have spoken to everyone involved and the circumstances are now being considered. 'Police are aware of Kurtis’s efforts in cleaning up the memorial and we will work with all concerned to try to reach an acceptable resolution.” Mr Green's father, Keith, 69, who owns a fish and chip shop in the town opposite the memorial, said he was relieved his son will not face prosecution. 'How could he have been prosecuted for a crime that he did not commit. There was no criminal damage or theft,' he said. 'The way Kurtis has been treated is absolutely revolting.' Mr Green got into trouble in February when he connected a new pipe so the flower beds could be safely watered. He . and fellow villager John Houston, 65, assumed they were authorised to . do the work because the pipes for the water supply had already been . placed in the ground as part of the restoration project. But . Dersingham Parish Council complained to the police that they had done . the work without its permission and accused them of criminal damage and . theft. After: The police now say that Mr Green will not face prosecution. The decision follows a public outcry about his treatment. He tended the memorial opposite his parents' fish and chip shop for free . Before: How the memorial looked before the teenager spent his spare time looking after it . In January, the Queen congratulated the . teenager for his hard work in revamping the memorial, near her .

When he was 15, he persuaded . councillors to spend £20,000 on restoring the area with raised flower . beds, new railings, seating and block paving. Hard work: Mr Green (pictured hiding in shrubbery with other volunteers) devoted hours to improving the overgrown area around the war memorial . Mr Green worked tirelessly to help with the project and won a Young People of the Year award after he was praised by villagers. His . efforts were then recognised by the Queen in a letter after the local . Royal British Legion won a prize for having Norfolk’s most improved war . memorial.

Jailed: Ben Raftery has been sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 18 years for the murder of 23 month-old Roxie Archer . A man who battered his girlfriend’s daughter to death after she left her in his care while she went on holiday to New York - has been jailed for life. Ben Raftery, 21, left 23 month-old Roxie Archer with devastating brain injuries just hours after her mother Sophie Archer flew to the US to celebrate her 21st birthday. An investigation revealed she was either . pushed or fell down the stairs and tests showed she was punched, slapped . and subjected to ‘vigorous shaking’ before she died. Raftery from Gorton, Manchester was convicted of murder today and ordered to serve a minimum of 18 years. Ms Archer was just hours in to her five-day break when she got a call to say Roxie had been injured at home. She caught the first available flight back home and found her daughter was on a life support machine. The toddler died hours later. Passing sentence the Judge Mr Justice John Saunders said: 'It was an appalling crime which involved a grown and powerful man inflicting a number of hard blows on a toddler which were sufficiently forceful to cause devastating brain damage from which she died. 'Roxie was particularly vulnerable because of her age and that at the time of the offence the defendant was entrusted with the sole care of her. 'While I accept that Roxie may not have been easy to look after that day as she was not well and the Defendant had limited parenting experience, I do not consider that to be of great significance when he only had to look after her for one day and it was at his insistence that he had the care of her.' Manchester Crown Court was told the . tragedy occurred in March last year after Ms Archer was bought tickets . to fly out to the US for a sightseeing trip. Originally Roxie’s grandmother was due to look after the toddler. Tragic: Little Roxie Archer (right) with her mother Sophie Archer. The 23 month-old died from a brain injury inflicted by Raftery after her mother had flown to New York to celebrate her 21st birthday . Care: Raftery had been left to care for Roxie at the home the couple shared in this street in Ashton Under Lyne, Greater Manchester . But Raftery, who was not the youngster’s biological father, persuaded Ms Archer to leave the child with him at their shared home in Ashton-under-Lyne because he wanted to ‘bond’ with her. Now 22, Sophie told the jury: 'I trusted him and didn’t think he would cause any harm to her. I thought they would have bonded, they would have got on, not that anything like this would have happened.' But in the early hours of March 10, Raftery rang 999 and told the operator: 'My baby’s fell down the stairs. I can’t really hear breathing.' Defenceless: Raftery had said he wanted to 'bond' with Roxie . Later while Roxie was being treated at . Manchester Royal Infirmary, Grant Dutton, the partner of her great aunt . noticed Raftery was particularly upset. Mr Dutton said: 'I tried to comfort him by saying it was just a tragic . accident. But he said ‘I killed her’. He was very emotional at the time. 'He was crying, he seemed really upset. He was concerned that the police were going to get him and he would get arrested and he would go to prison. At the time we didn’t think too much about it. We put it down to grief and emotion.' Inquiries revealed in the hours before Roxie was taken to hospital that Raftery posted a photo of Roxie on Facebook, with a caption saying she had hit her head on a door at McDonalds. But the day after she died, he edited the caption on the picture to read, ‘Aah my little princess when she banged her head on the floor’. Raftery denied murder and insisted the child’s injuries were caused by an accidental fall down the stairs at the house he shared with Roxie and her mother in Ashton-under-Lyne. He said: 'Roxie called me daddy the first day I met her - I had a bond with Roxie, we were so close - I thought Sophie was the one.' But Det Supt Denise Worth from Greater Manchester Police said: 'Roxie was a two-year-old little girl who should have felt safe in her own home in the care of Raftery. He abused his position of trust and subjected an innocent toddler to an attack which left her with an unsurvivable head injury. 'We will never know exactly what happened on that day, as Raftery has always maintained that it was an accident. Roxie’s family are devastated by Raftery’s actions and will never be able to see [her] grow up into a young woman, see her get married and have children of her own. 'He has now been jailed, and will have to live the rest of his life with the knowledge that he is responsible for killing Roxie.'","Ben Raftery, 21, left 23 month-old Roxie .

Russell has already pleaded guilty to killing four other soldiers and a Navy officer in 2009 . A U.S. Army sergeant calmly smoked a cigarette before shooting dead five fellow soldiers at a U.S. military counseling clinic in Baghdad, a court has heard. Sgt. John M. Russell has already pleaded guilty to the killings but says he killed the men in a 'rage'. He denies premeditation. But the U.S. government has argued that Russell carefully plotted the attack as 'revenge' - and suggested he had been seen coolly smoking before the shooting spree. Russell - who is from Sherman, Texas - went on a shooting rampage at the Camp Liberty Combat Stress Center near Baghdad in May 2009. Prosecutors described interactions in . which Russell had indicated his wish to leave the Army and how he grew . angry at a doctor who told him he was mentally OK . 'This is not a case about rage,' said Lt. Col. Robert Stelle, an Army prosecutor. 'This is a case about revenge.' Stelle told the court-martial how a witness had seen Russell smoking in an SUV outside the clinic before the shooting. After entering the building, Russell came across a group of soldiers in a classroom. Russell peered in the room, Stelle said, but showed restraint and continued down the hallway before beginning his killings. Verdict: Soldiers stand outside the building at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash., where the court-martial for U.S. Army Sgt. John Russell began . Patrol: A U.S. Army civilian federal police officer patrols the perimeter of the building at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash . Defense attorneys reserved their opening statements for later but were successful earlier in the day in their quest to introduce evidence that suggested Russell may have had brain abnormalities. Col. David Conn, the military judge overseeing the case, agreed to allow that evidence along with the perspectives of other experts who deemed Russell's brain normal. The first witness to testify Monday afternoon was retired Staff Sgt. Enos Richard, who had been tasked with escorting Russell to and from a stress clinic on the day of the shooting. When the two returned to the unit headquarters, Richard described how Russell took Richard's gun from the back seat and demanded the keys. 'Give me the keys or I will shoot you,' Russell said, according to Richard's testimony. After getting the keys and getting in the vehicle, Russell sped away. It was about 30 minutes before the shooting began - about the time needed to drive to the stress center. Prosecutors showed a video of the route all the way back to the stress clinic, often leaving the windowless courtroom in silence to view the slow, bumpy and congested roadways that Russell may have followed after taking the vehicle. Killed in the shooting were Navy Cmdr. Charles Springle, 52, of Wilmington, N.C., and four Army service members: Pfc. Michael Edward Yates Jr., 19, of Federalsburg, Md.; Dr. Matthew Houseal, of Amarillo, Texas; Sgt. Christian E. Bueno-Galdos, 25, of Paterson, N.J.; and Spc. Jacob D. Barton, 20, of Lenox, Mo. Russell is being held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, about 40 miles south of Seattle. His previous plea agreement means he will avoid a death sentence. His maximum sentence would be life in prison. Crime scene: The killings happened at a combat stress counseling clinic called Camp Liberty in Iraq, pictured . Locator: Two medical officers and three serving soldiers were killed at the base in Iraq . The shooting was one of the worst instances of soldier-on-soldier violence in the Iraq war and raised questions about the mental health problems for soldiers caused by repeated tours of duty. A hearing on possible charges was held in August 2009 at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. Two evaluations presented during that hearing said Russell suffered from severe depression with psychotic features and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. A March 2011 evaluation said the major depression with psychotic features was in partial remission. Russell was nearing the end of his third tour when his behavior changed, members of his unit testified in 2009. 'At breaking point': It is alleged that U.S. Army sergeant John Russell was suffering from post-traumatic distress disorder at the time of the shootings after multiple deployments (stock image) They said he became more distant in the days before the May 11, 2009, attack, and that he seemed paranoid that his unit was trying to end his career. On May 8, Russell sought help at the combat stress clinic at Camp Stryker, where his unit was located. On May 10, Russell was referred to the Camp Liberty clinic, where he received counseling and prescription medication. Witnesses have previously described seeing Russell the following day crying and talking about hurting himself. He went back to the Camp Liberty clinic, where a doctor told him he needed to get help or he would hurt himself. Richard testified Monday that Russell tried to surrender to military police to lock him up, but they let him go. We're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable.","Sgt. John M.

A dieter who shed more than 300 pounds has now developed a fear of food. Doug May, from Spartanburg, South Carolina is so concerned about putting the weight on that he lost three years ago that he now finds eating an ordeal. 'I've developed a fear of food,' he explained. He sat on his front porch, next to a photo of a much heavier version of himself — a person he doesn't want to revisit. 'When I go out to eat, I have to force myself to eat,' he said. Anna . Voss, a licensed professional counselor with Associates at Park Avenue . in Greenville, said a fear of food is an eating disorder she sees often. 'It is something I commonly see,' she said . 'After working so hard on one . particular goal and then reaching it, it makes sense to become afraid of . the thing that created the problem for you in the first place. In this . case, it's food.' She compared the problem to a recovered alcoholic who becomes afraid of beer or bars. You don't want to go back to the way you were, she said. That's the fear May has. 'I don't want to put the weight back on. If I could get over that, I'd be OK.' He . says he lost the weight by exercising at home and by changing his diet. Today, he is 'basically a vegan,' eating mostly raw fruits and . vegetables, and occasionally fish. When May was heavier, he said his biggest problem was the all-you-can-eat buffet. 'I would pig out. I was out of control.' Now, he realizes just how much he relied on food in his life. 'When . you try to take that out of it, it's hard to function,' he said. 'I . just want to be able to enjoy a pizza with my (10-year-old) son.' Bob .

Heavyweight: Mr May is seen with his children when he was at his heaviest. He slimmed down three years ago and has kept the pounds off . 'People sometimes have the best intentions of doing something like losing weight but go about it the wrong way,' he said. 'People . need to have that coach that oversees what they are doing and help . educate them on the importance of things like nutrition and exercise. 'People . can tend to take things to the extreme and lose a lot of weight because . they are not versed in what foods they should or should not eat as well . as understanding the types of calories they are using.'

She was on the verge of becoming a Lady – and frequenting the nation’s stately homes with her Eton-educated husband. But it seems Zeaphena Badley, 31, has been anything but ladylike since her aristocrat ex-fiance the Hon Nicholas Knatchbull called off their wedding. Instead of visiting Buckingham Palace to meet the Royal Family, friends of her former in-laws to be, she has been attacking police, shouting abusively about the Queen, and staying in one of Her Majesty’s prisons. Smoking: Pregnant Zeaphena Badley outside court. She has been found guilty of assaulting three police officers . Badley, who was engaged for 18 months to Knatchbull, also known as Lord Romsey and in line to inherit a £100million fortune, appeared before magistrates last week. She had earlier been found guilty of assaulting three police officers, punching, kicking and spitting at them while apparently on drugs at Notting Hill Carnival in August. The portrait of a lady presented in court was, in the words of one victim, of a ‘vile and disgusting individual intent on attacking as many police officers as possible’. It certainly confirmed Badley’s declaration to the Daily Mail last year that: ‘I’m not like Kate Middleton, not at all.’ The court heard Badley had been a guest at Knatchbull’s 60-room Broadlands estate in Hampshire, but is now ‘sofa surfing’ at friends’ London flats and using soup kitchens. Following the attack – shortly after her engagement ended – she spent 35 days in Holloway prison  in London. In her latest court appearance, . magistrates heard that the mother of two was seven months pregnant and . she was given a suspended six-month sentence and 12 months’ probation . with 20 compulsory ‘structured supervision for women’ sessions. Happier times: Badley and former fiance Nicholas Knatchbull, who is heir to a £100million title . Stately home: Knatchbull's 60-room Broadlands estate in Romsey, Hampshire . Her mingling with the upper class does not appear to have taught her manners. She was late for her first hearing, and on hearing the guilty verdict shouted at the district judge: ‘F****** a*******. I’m seven months pregnant. There is no justice in this country.’ Outside she smoked a cigarette despite her pregnancy, ignoring a prominent no smoking sign. Her former fiance, 32, is himself no stranger to the seamier side of life. After Eton, where he helped mentor Prince William, a family friend, he sank into drug addiction. He attended rehab before meeting half-Jamaican Badley. Their engagement emerged in 2010. He is now engaged again, with nurse Raz Tedros, 28, set to be the 9th Baroness Brabourne. At Badley’s trial at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court last month, prosecutor Paul Mitchell described her assault on police officers Stephanie Grayson, Maggie Saliwell and John Taylor: ‘The defendant was shouting, “What the f*** are you doing?” and turned to officer Grayson and punched her cheek.’ New love: Nicholas Knatchbull, the godson of Prince Charles, with his fiancee Raz Tedros, a 28-year-old nurse . He added she ‘spat at officer Saliwell’s face and then kicked her’, shouting: ‘Only Jah can judge me now. There is no Queen, she’s not real, so there are no laws.’ Badley called one officer an ‘ugly bitch’ and tried to bite another. He said: ‘The officers believed she was under the influence of drugs.’ Miss Saliwell said: ‘She was a vile, disgusting individual intent on attacking as many police officers as possible and showed no remorse.’ The drug addict and chain smoker had already been convicted of assaulting two police officers last year. Badley denied the offences, claims she was assaulted, and plans to appeal. Magistrate Andy Robinson told her: ‘You have shown no remorse. Your previous record is horrendous.’","Zeaphena Badley, 31, was set to marry aristocrat Nicholas Knatchbull .

Travel reps flogging excursions was also particularly annoying but other guests bagging the best sunbeds annoyed only 31 per cent of the 2,004 UK adults surveyed. Despite the British obsession with talking about the weather, rain ranked only eighth on the list.

Holidays are set to get cheaper for British holidaymakers this summer as prices plummet at popular resorts across Europe. Despite the falling value of the pound, European resorts are desperately trying to entice British holidaymakers back in the wake of the Eurozone crisis. With prices down by up to 20 per cent in . Spanish holiday hotspots and 15 per cent in the Algarve in Portugal, . they have topped the list as the cheapest holiday destinations this season according . to the Post Office Holiday Costs Barometer. Top spot, lowest price: Albufeira in the Algarve (pictured) is the cheapest of 20 holiday destinations as resort prices plummet across many European hotspots . Measuring the cost of ten typical holiday items – including coffee, beer, cola, wine, mineral water, suncream, cigarettes and a three-course meal for two – the barometer found that Albufeira in the Algarve, Portugal was the cheapest of 20 holiday destinations because of its meal and drinks, closely followed by Costa del Sol and Costa Blanca in Spain. The cost of the ten items is now £46.34 in the Algarve, £46.50 on the Costa del Sol and £47.14 on the Costa Blanca. Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money . said: ‘The pound may be worth less in Europe than a year ago but fierce . competition means that lower prices in several of the resorts we . surveyed can easily offset the falling value of sterling. Stretching the holiday budget further: Costa del Sol (pictued) and Costa Blanca in Spain were also among the cheapest holiday spots according to the Post Office Holiday Costs Barometer . ‘Taking some time to check out resort . costs and add them to package prices to find the best overall deal will . pay dividends this summer. 'Be prepared to swap destination or switch to . a cheaper resort within the same country.’ Prices also fell by 5.2 per cent in the Croatian coastal city of Split while the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheikh fell by more than 17 per cent in the last year, making it 39 per cent cheaper than Dubai. In America, even though sterling is 4.1 per cent weaker than last year against the dollar, holidaymakers heading to Orlando, Florida will find prices much lower in the theme park capital.  The ten typical holiday purchases surveyed now cost 21.2 per cent less than in 2012 (£58.16). Back in Britain, Blackpool made 11th place with items costing £65.96 and Bournemouth was 14th place at £78.01. Bargain hunters staying in the UK this year will find the North Country favourite is 15 per cent cheaper than the south coast resort. Tuscany and Sorrento continued to be the most expensive European resorts surveyed – more than twice the price of the four best value destinations at £94.92 and £101.79 respectively. Break the budget: Tuscany (pictured) and Sorrento in Italy remained the most expensive resorts costing more than twice the price of the four best value destinations . Mr Brown said: ‘With the continuing volatility of sterling, holidaymakers should budget carefully and take enough spending money to cover all the costs they are likely to incur while abroad. ‘Running out of cash and having to use an overseas ATM or pay on a card that incurs extra charges could pack an unpleasant punch when the bank or credit card statement arrives. 'Allow time to buy foreign currency before leaving home because changing money at the airport means losing out by getting a poor rate.’ We're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable.","Resort prices are dropping across European holiday destinations .

Tasted freedom: Inmate Shaun Lloyd was working as a chef at The Clink, a restaurant run by prisoners, before he escaped . An inmate who worked at a 'fine dining' restaurant in a converted wing of a prison went on the run because he developed a fear of closed conditions, his mother has said. Shaun Lloyd, 25, was working as a chef at The Clink, in Cardiff Prison - set up to help offenders become more employable - before he escaped almost a month ago. Seven years into his jail sentence at HMP Prescoed open prison in Monmouthshire, South Wales for street robbery, Lloyd feared 'closed conditions' and longed for the outside world. His mother Shirley Lloyd, 52, said: ‘He was going to work in The Clink and he loved it. But the going back to prison every evening was a problem for him. ‘I spoke to him on the day before he absconded and he didn't sound right on the phone. He sounded shaky. ‘He had a fear of them taking him back to closed conditions.’ Cardiff Prison won Home Office clearance last year to convert their former visitor centre into the £380,000 restaurant, an initiative to encourage prisoners not to reoffend by providing them with hospitality training. Diners pay up to £5.50 for entrees and £11.50 for mains from a breakfast and lunch menu at the 96-seat restaurant. Prisoners are paid £15 for a five-day working week. It took 30 minutes to transport Lloyd to The Clink each day for work where he cooked dishes such as thyme-roasted baby beets with marinated Coley fillet. Lloyd was due for parole in June but it is thought that the date could have been delayed after he tested positive for alcohol on his last day release. Loved working at The Clink: Lloyd's mother Shirley Lloyd said he enjoyed his work at the restaurant in a converted wing of Cardiff Prison (pictured) but that 'going back to prison every evening was a problem' for her son, who has been on the run for almost a month . Ms Lloyd from Adamsdown, Cardiff, said: ‘Shaun is banned from drinking alcohol but he's a 25-year-old man and probably just wanted to taste it. ‘He went back to prison, he was tested for alcohol and it showed positive. ‘His parole would have been postponed for three months or more because of that and I don't think he would have been able to cope with that much longer.’ 'Hand yourself in': Ms Lloyd said she does not know where he is but appealed to him to turn himself in . Customers at The Clink must be searched before they enter the Category B jail which houses 780 inmates. They must hand in their mobile phones and are warned not to carry more than £50 cash. Ms Lloyd appealed for her son to hand himself in. She said: ‘I don't know where he is. Shaun if you're out there, reading this, please hand yourself in. ‘I can help you and there's people that can help you.’ The Prison Service said it does not comment on individual prisoners. A spokeswoman said: ‘According to published data, the number of absconds from open prisons is at a record low. ‘Those who do abscond will be returned to a more secure prison and may face further charges.’ Gwent Police said the force had activated its operational plan to try and find him. A spokesman said: ‘There may be a potential risk due to the fact that Lloyd is no longer in the custody of the prison service. ‘It is thought he could be in the Cardiff area where he has contacts.’ The . restaurant employs about 24 chefs and waters, as well as cleaners, with . the hope that prisoners, once released, are employable in luxury hotels . and restaurants instead of resorting to low paid work. So far, 85 prisoners have been or are currently training at the restaurant with 25 ex-inmates successfully gaining full time employment upon jail release. The restaurant is the brain child of .

The first album included 11 number one singles and a collection of 30 tracks from 1983 and was released on double vinyl LP and cassette. It was unlike other compilations at the time which were edited to fit the running time. The series is a collaboration between EMI and Virgin which allows a greater number of major hits to be included. The idea for the series started at Richard Branson’s Virgin Records offices in Vernon Yard, just off Portobello Road. Mr Branson bought a 1920s Danish Bacon poster of a pig singing Now That’s What I Call Music! to a chicken producing an egg, and gave it to his cousin Simon Draper, then the head of A&R at Virgin Records and later Managing Director. Mr Draper hung the poster in his office and during a meeting with Peter Jamieson, then the managing director of EMI Records, the poster caught his eye and the name of the series was born. There have been a number of spin-off compilations including Now Dance and Now Smash Hits which went on to release their own compilations. The series continues today and also exists in several other countries including Argentina, Israel and South Africa.

The 925 will sell for around 469 euros (about £400) before tax and and will be available as early as next month. It comes as eMarketer estimates that there will be 30.9 million . smartphone users in the UK this year which represents 48.4% of the total . population.

They say slow and steady wins the race and zoo keepers are holding out hope that this is still the case for a pair of giant tortoises who have failed to mate after four decades. Dubbed ‘Britain’s most reluctant lovers,’ Biggy and Twiggy have lived together at Bristol Zoo since 1975 and today were given a clean bill of health at their first weigh-in in five years. Giant tortoises usually start breeding when there are enough around to force competition so the zoo has recently introduced two more tortoises into their enclosure to encourage the pair to mate. Slow and steady: Vet Rowena Killick checks 63-year-old male giant tortoise Biggy for the first time in five years in which he weighed-in at 220lbs . Female Twiggy, who is 63 weighed-in at 220lbs, 22lbs more than in 2008 but it was 68-year-old male Biggy who really tipped the scales, weighing-in at 440lbs, 50lbs more than in 2008. Zoo spokesman Catherine Foster said: ‘Maybe he has just been taking his time, playing the long game. ‘There has been mating actually, but breeding is work in progress. Tipping Twiggy: The pair of giant tortoises were given a clean bill of health after their weigh-in and health check which included tipping female Twiggy on her side . Slow moving: Biggy (pictured) and Twiggy have been living together at Bristol Zoo since 1975 but have yet to reproduce . ‘We're still waiting for the fairy tale slow patter of little feet.’ Tortoises live in a heated enclosure where they spend their days munching high-quality hay and the occasional treat of dandelion or spring greens. While they look harmless enough, the lumbering hulks lose their gentle temperament when they are in the mood for mating. Ms Foster said: ‘Giant tortoises . prefer to go over things than around them so if you're ever standing . nearby one watch your toes.’ Native . to Seychelles in Africa, the giant tortoise has a lifespan of at least . 100 years, even up to 150. They grow steadily for the first 40 years of . their lives and can weigh up to 560lbs. Waiting for the slow patter of little feet: Zoo keepers are hopeful that, even after almost four decades, the pair will mate and reproduce . Large tortoises are among the . longest-lived animals on the planet, with some individuals thought to be . over 200-years-old, but this is difficult to verify because they tend . to outlive their human observers. Their shell does not serve as protection from predators as they have no predators on the islands where they evolved. They are usually silent but mating males make a hollow groaning sound that can be heard hundreds of feet away. Tortoises exploit many different kinds of habitat including grasslands, low scrub, mangrove swamps, and coastal dunes. Competitive nature: Giant tortoises usually start breeding when there are enough around to force competition so the zoo recently introduced two more tortoises into their enclosure to encourage Biggy (pictured) and Twiggy to mate . Last month 18-year-old Adam Steff stole an endangered tortoise worth £2,000 from a safari park and sold it on Facebook - for a paltry £30. The teenager took Flo, a 4.5lb juvenile Aldabra giant tortoise, from Woburn Safari Park in Milton Keynes after he wandered into her enclosure while drunk. The 18-year-old originally tried to sell Flo for what she was worth, then accepted an offer of just £30 for the tortoise - a specimen of one of the world's rarest species. Police arrested Steff, a bricklaying student, after matching his DNA to saliva on a beer can left at the scene. He was ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work and also given a curfew from 7pm to 7am, to last two months.

In the Texas lawsuit where a football star is out to get an engagement ring returned, the ex-fiance is now telling her story and has returned fire with a counter-suit. With the help of a powerful Houston attorney, Erin Marzouki is seeking to correct what she calls her ex-fiance Mario Williams' 'silly' accusations and doesn't intend to give back the ring because it was given to her as an unconditional gift. Former Houston Texans star Williams, who now plays for the Buffalo Bills, is worth over $30M with a $100M contract, but that isn't stopping him from suing Marzouki to get back the $785,000 engagement ring he gave her in February 2012. Scroll down for video... Happier times: Buffalo Bills' Mario Williams poses for a photo with his fiancee Erin Marzouki. They've since split and are suing and counter suing over the engagement ring . The suit seeks recovery of a stunning . 10.04 carat diamond ring from Marzouki after, Williams claims, she . decided to end their engagement with Williams in January. According . to court documents, Marzouki only had dollar signs in her eyes and not . butterflies in her stomach when she first said yes to the proposal. Blinged out: Williams wants the 10-carat $785,000 diamond engagement ring he bought returned, Marzouki's counter claim says it was a gift and he wasn't committed anyway . '(Marzouki) never intended to marry . (Williams) and used the relationship as a means to get to (Williams’) money and acquire gifts,' says the lawsuit, filed by Houston attorneys . Monica Schulz Orlando and Michael Gary Orlando. But papers filed by Marzouki in a counter suit tell a totally different story. She . says Williams was the one who broke off the engagement because part of . him 'wanted to be married and start a family, while another part wanted . to continue to live the life of a wealthy bachelor who could do whatever . he wanted, with whomever he wanted, whenever he wanted.' Read Williams side of the lawsuit in full... According to the counter-claim, Williams broke off the engagement several times but never asked for the return of the ring. She even claims she returned the ring on her own volition the first time he ended the engagement. Marzouki claims she had enough and refused to reconcile despite his pleadings after the most recent split. Williams' lawyers have asked the court to obtain the ring from Ms. Marzouki until the legal action is resolved. Marzouki's claim asserts that Williams' suit only seeks 'harass and scare.' Williams . gave the engagement ring to Marzouki on February 19th 2012 along with . an American Express card to which she charged $108,000 during 2012 and . 'additional luxurious items' valued at about $230,000. Breakup: Mario Williams, 28, is suing Erin Marzouki, 31, in a civil lawsuit for the return of her $785,000 engagement ring . Bling: The ring is a GIA certified radiant cut diamond weighing 10.04 carats, E color grade and VS2 clarity grade worth $785,000 . But it was all over within a year with when Marzouki 'unilaterally terminated' the engagement on January 21st 2013. The court documents says Williams ex-fiance 'never intended to marry and used the relationship as a means to get money and acquire gifts.' The lawsuit exudes Williams' bitterness over the failed relationship and states that Williams has refused requests to return the diamond engagement ring.. Rich: Wiilliams signed six-year deal with the Buffalo Bills in 2012, worth up to $100 million, with $50 million guaranteed . Counter punch: Marzouki maintains Williams broke up with her repeatedly. Williams' suit claims Marzouki was only seeking his money. In one year he claims he spent $1,123,000 on a fiancée who broke up with him just months after they’d become engaged. Williams’ lawyers are now looking to take out a restraining order that would prevent Marzouki from selling or damaging the ring or keeping any proceeds by selling it. Williams was the first selection in the 2006 NFL draft by the Texans and played in Houston through the 2011 season. Although by regular standards the ring is a fortune, it is pocket change to Williams who last year signed one of the most lucrative contracts for a defensive player in NFL history: a six-year, $100 million with the Buffalo Bills with $50 million in cash guaranteed.","Fomer Houston Texan star Mario Williams is suing his ex-fiancee, Erin Marzouki for the return of a $785,000 diamond ring .

Minnesota is set to become the 12th U.S. state where gay couples can get married after a final legislative vote that will let the weddings start on Aug. 1st. Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton has pledged to sign the bill, and has scheduled a ceremony for 5 p.m. today on the front steps of the Capitol in St. Paul. Minnesota is now the first state in Midwest to legalize gay marriage by legislative vote, and the third nationwide in just 10 days, joining Rhode Island and Delaware. Thousands of gay marriage supporters thronging the Capitol erupted into deafening cheers after the Senate's 37-30 vote; the House passed it last week on a 75-59 vote. Jubilant: Sen. Scott Dibble, DFL-Minneapolis, left, sponsor of the gay marriage bill in the Minnesota Senate, and his partner Richard Leyva greet a large, joyous crowd as the arrive at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota . 'Members, God made gays,' Sen. Ron Latz, a Democrat from a suburb of Minneapolis, said during the Senate's emotional four-hour debate. 'And God made gays capable of loving other people. So who are we to quarrel with God's intentions?' The gay marriage issue shifted quickly in Minnesota, with the Legislature's vote coming a little more than six months after voters defeated an amendment that would have banned gay marriage in the state constitution. The groups that led the campaign against the amendment swiftly turned to pushing for legalizing same-sex marriage, an effort aided when Democrats captured full control of state government in November. Only one Republican senator, Branden Petersen of suburban Andover, voted for the bill. Three Democrats from rural districts voted against it. Republican opponents said the bill alters a centuries-old understanding of marriage as a societal building block that benefits children. 'Forcing others to give you your rights . will never end well,' said Sen. Dan Hall, a Republican and a pastor. ""It . won't give you the recognition you desire.' Hall said gay marriage . supporters have told him he's on the wrong side of history but, he said, . 'the truth is I'm more concerned about being on the right side of . eternity.' Support: Thousands filled the Minnesota State Capitol as they waited for word that the Senate had passed the gay marriage bill on Monday. The bill now goes to the governor who is expected to sign it later today . Worth the wait: Thousands filled the Minnesota State Capitol as they waited for word that the Senate had passed the gay marriage bill . But supporters, too, cited religious faith and with relationships with gay family members and friends in shaping their vote for the bill. Many spoke of the benefits of their own marriages. 'I could never and I would never deny the kind of recognition and all the other positive things I get out of my marriage with my husband, to anyone else,' said Sen. Vicki Jensen, a Democrat from the southern Minnesota city of Owatonna. Republican opponents argued that the bill's provisions meant to protect religious freedom were insufficient, raising concerns it could force merchants in the wedding industry to accept business from gay couples even if the merchants object to such marriages. Kisses: Sen. Scott Dibble, an openly gay lawmaker who sponsored the Senate's gay marriage bill, throws a kiss toward the gallery as the Senate prepared to debate the issue on Monday . Thumbs up: Sen. Scott Dibble, a gay lawmaker who sponsored the Minnesota Senate's gay marriage bill, acknowledges supporters after the Senate passed the bill . 'We must respect religious freedom at the same time as we advance rights,' said Sen. Carla Nelson, R-Rochester. 'This bill does not do that.' Still, with passage looking inevitable Monday, vocal and visual opposition was muted. Don Lee, of Eagan, placed a tombstone on the Capitol lawn with the words ""R.I.P. MARRIAGE 2013.' 'The legislation being passed today is the end of marriage as we know it in Minnesota,' Lee said. 'It's a transformation from a forward-looking sacrificial institution to one focused on adult desires.' Supporters and opponents were close to evenly matched during the House debate, but Monday was dominated by gay marriage backers. They taped blue and orange hearts on the Capitol steps, creating a path into the building for lawmakers with the signature colors of their movement. In the rotunda, demonstrators sang songs including 'Over the Rainbow,' 'Going to the Chapel' and 'The Star-Spangled Banner.' Celebration: Gay marriage supporters celebrate outside the Minnesota Senate chamber after the Senate passed the gay marriage . Like Thursday, there was a stepped-up security presence. State troopers were posted inside and out, and areas of the building were cordoned off to allow lawmakers to move freely amid the expected throngs. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman ordered the Wabasha Street Bridge near downtown festooned in rainbow-striped gay pride flags, and temporarily renamed it the ""Freedom to Marry Bridge."" He also proclaimed it ""Freedom to Marry Week.' Minnesota's most famous opponent of gay marriage also weighed in. U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, an ardent supporter of banning gay marriage when she served in the state Senate, released a statement expressing disappointment in a vote she said 'denies religious liberty to people who believe in traditional marriage.' Mixed views: Supporters and opponents of Minnesota's gay marriage bill demonstrate on the State Capitol steps in St. Paul before the Senate prepared to debate the issue . But gay couples were already thinking about wedding planning. Jeff Moses and his legal husband, John Westerfield-Moses, of Minneapolis, were married in Iowa four years ago, when the state's Supreme Court ruled to allow it. Their anniversary is Aug. 23, a few weeks after a Minnesota law would take effect, and the couple is considering having a marriage ceremony here, too. 'Any excuse for a party,' Jeff Moses said. 'It was bound to happen,' John Westerfield-Moses added. 'It was a train that was coming.' Jessica Flatequal and Maria Bevacqua, a lesbian couple from Mankato who have been together for a decade, were jubilant after the vote, as supporters spilled out of the front of the Capitol. 'We're excited to become equal citizens under the law,' said Bevacqua, a professor at Minnesota State University-Mankato. Asked whether they would get married, both women laughed. 'Well, neither of us proposed today,' Flatequal said. 'But now that's going to be part of the discussion. It's weird, actually.'","Minnesota is the 12th state that has voted to allow gay marriage .

The man poised to become Pakistan's next prime minister has pledged to help Nato forces withdraw from Afghanistan safely next year by allowing them to use his country's roads to move troops and equipment. Nawaz Sharif, who is facing renewed allegations of vote rigging after video purporting to show election officials in Karachi stuffing ballot boxes with votes, said he thought Pakistan had a good relationship with the USA. But he described the CIA's ongoing drone campaign in the country's tribal region as a challenge to national sovereignty. Scroll down for video . Pledge: Nawaz Sharif, who is poised to become Pakistan's next Prime Minister, said he would allow Nato forces to use Pakistan's roads to withdraw safely from Afghanistan next year . In a press statement given at his opulent villa near Lahore, Mr Sharif said: 'American troops are being withdrawn in 2014. We will extend full support to them. We will see that everything goes well and smoothly.' The U.S. is reliant on Pakistan for help in neighboring Afghanistan, where it will likely play a strong role in any reconciliation deal with Taliban militants. Much of the American military equipment that must be shipped out of Afghanistan when the international coalition there ends its combat mission in 2014 will go through the port city of Karachi in southern Pakistan. It comes as fresh allegations of vote-rigging were being aimed against Sharif’s PML-N party after video emerged appearing to show election officials stuffing ballot boxed with votes. A video released by the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, which finished fourth winning just ten seats, allegedly shows several women stuffing stacks of papers into ballot boxes at a polling station in Karachi. The video is one of several that have been aired on Pakistani television purporting to show evidence of vote rigging . One of the women in the grainy video smiles towards the camera and puts a finger to her lips, appearing to make a 'be quiet' gesture. It is one of several videos purporting to show vote-rigging which have been airing on Pakistani television news channels following Saturday's result. On Monday Munsif Ali Khan, an independent candidate from Pakistan's remote tribal areas, presented a mobile phone video to journalists showing ballot papers scattered on the ground near a polling station with sound of gunfire heard in the background. Despite the allegations, Sharif, a devout Muslim and a populist, is expected to supplant President Asif Ali Zardari as the international face of Pakistan following his party's resounding victory in Saturday's election. The 63-year-old Sharif often hit out at the U.S. in statements while lobbying for votes, and he accused the outgoing government ruled by the Pakistan People's Party of selling out the country's sovereignty in exchange for U.S. aid. However, analysts have cautioned that while such rhetoric sells on the campaign trail in a country where anti-American sentiment is high, Sharif is likely to take a more nuanced approach to U.S. relations once in office. 'I think we have good relations with the United States of America. We certainly have to listen to each other,' said Sharif. 'If there are any concerns on any side, I think we should address those concerns.' Sticking point: Mr Sharif described the CIA's ongoing drone campaign in the country's tribal region as a challenge to national sovereignty . Pakistan and the U.S. have had an extremely fraught relationship in recent years, especially following the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden in a Pakistani army town in 2011. The U.S. didn't tell Pakistan about the operation beforehand, and the government was outraged at the breach of its sovereignty. Even before the raid, the U.S. accused Pakistan of supporting Taliban militants who use the country's rugged northwest tribal region to launch cross-border attacks against American troops in Afghanistan - allegations denied by Islamabad. The relationship has improved somewhat over the last year, but U.S. drone attacks targeting Taliban and al-Qaida militants in Pakistan's tribal region continue to create serious friction between the two countries. The strikes are extremely unpopular in Pakistan, where many people believe they mostly kill innocent civilians - something Washington denies. 'Drones indeed are challenging our sovereignty,' said Sharif. 'I think this is a very serious issue, and our concern must be understood properly.' Briefing: Mr Sharif talks to journalists at his opulent villa on the outskirts of Lahore . Host: Nawaz Sharif Nawaz offers a table full of food to journalists after a press conference at his house on the outskirts of Lahore . But Pakistan has a long history of . officials condemning the strikes in public and supporting them in . private, and how aggressively Sharif pushes the U.S. may depend on how . much he needs it in other areas. Pakistan . relies on the U.S. for hundreds of millions of dollars in aid every . year. More importantly, Pakistan would likely need U.S. support to get a . bailout it desperately needs from the International Monetary Fund . because of the government's shaky financial situation. Sharif spoke with reporters at his palatial estate in the rural town of Raiwind near the eastern city of Lahore. The . estate is filled with acres of plush lawns and manicured gardens, where . scores of majestic peacocks roam freely. The inside of his house is . opulently decorated in a style reminiscent of Louis XIV and features two . stuffed lions - the symbol of Sharif's party - at the entrance to his . living room. Sharif's . supporters believe his pro-business background and years of experience . in government make him the right person to tackle the country's many . economic woes, like growing power cuts, painful inflation and widespread . unemployment. Opulent: Sharif's villa, which is decorated in a style reminiscent of Louis XIV features two stuffed lions at the entrance to the living room . His stance on reining in violent Islamic extremism, however, remains uncertain. Critics have accused his Pakistan Muslim League-N party of being soft on radicals because it hasn't cracked down on militant groups in its stronghold of Punjab province. Even if Sharif wanted to shut down the U.S. drone program, he would have to contend with the wishes of the Pakistani army, which is considered the strongest institution in the country and often plays a dominant role in national security issues. The army is known to have supported the drone program in the past. That cooperation has decreased over time as the relationship between the two countries has deteriorated. Many analysts believe there is still grudging acceptance of the strikes - both because of U.S. aid and because of the harm it would do to the relationship if Pakistan really put its foot down. The number of strikes targeting militants has dropped from a peak of more than 120 in 2010 to close to a dozen so far this year, but it's unclear how much this trend has been driven by U.S. decisions about targeting versus the political sensitivity of carrying out strikes.","Nawaz Sharif said he thought Pakistan had .

Prince Harry's garden at the Chelsea Flower Show will reflect his loss of his mother, Diana, according to its designer. Renowned landscape gardener Jinny Blom was commissioned to create the garden to raise awareness of the Prince's Lesotho-based charity Sentebale. She told the Radio Times that the garden would symbolise Harry's loss over the death of his mother and that it would also represent a memorial to Diana, Princess of Wales. The spirit of Prince Harry's late mother, Princess Diana (left), is in the garden, who the charity was set up for in her memory . Plans for the garden have been part-designed by Prince Harry, and will appear at the Chelsea Flower Show . A pattern 'based on the idea of hearts and crowns', cut into a floating stone in the middle of the garden would symbolise the Prince and his loss, she said. She told the magazine: 'I think she (his mother) is always there, present in him. Harry knows as well as anyone what loss means. 'It's what makes him understand that in others, their desire for belonging. I want the garden to reflect that and give space for thought.' The Prince's charity helps children who have suffered loss as well as poverty. The gardener said: 'One thing that's important in life is shelter and a home. Harry is someone who has lost those parental arms that we all need round us. He knows all about it, of course, that kids deserve to be loved and picked up.' Asked whether the garden represented a memorial to the Prince's mother, she said: 'Absolutely. I feel the spirit of his mother in this garden, which has private areas as well as public parts. Jinny Blom has created a pattern 'based on the idea of hearts and crowns' Visitors to the Chelsea Flower Show will see the 'wet and cold' side of Africa that is reflected in the Prince's garden . 'The charity was set up in memory of his mother and is very much in the spirit of her. It's the kind of thing she would have done and I'm sure it would have made her proud.' Blom admitted that she thought twice before agreeing to create the garden when she was approached last August. 'I wasn't sure about it. It's so exhausting doing a garden for Chelsea,' she said, but after visiting Lesotho to see the landscape and experience the work of the charity there she 'was aware of what I wanted to represent'. She said that the Prince had seen all the plans and was being kept informed at every stage, adding: 'He's very enthusiastic. He's very involved and, so far, has been very happy about everything I'm doing...He is very excited about it. He trusts me. But, at the end of the day, he's a soldier not a gardener.' Blom, who trained as a psychologist specialising in mental health issues before changing her career, designed a Chelsea Flower Show garden in 2002 for the Prince of Wales and told the magazine: 'He told me I'd be damned if I didn't and damned if I did!' The landscape gardener, who has planted 12,500 plants so that 4,500 are up to scratch, fears people won't 'get it' when they see her new creation, adding: 'I'm not sure if this is what the Royal Horticultural Society is expecting! But, there you go.' She added: 'I know what people think of Africa. They assume it's all dry and hot and full of lions and giraffes. But Lesotho is wet and cold! I have reflected that in the garden. There's not any dry grass or African animals in sight.'","Landscape artist Jinny Blom has created pattern of crowns and hearts .

"PUBLISHED: . 04:53 EST, 13 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:41 EST, 13 May 2013 . According to callers, the 111 line is not picking up calls quickly enough . The extent of the new NHS non-emergency advice line’s teething problems have been laid bare after official figures revealed a stark rise in abandoned calls. The number of people who hung up after waiting for a response for more than 30 seconds increased from 6,976 in February to 29,100 in March, according to NHS England figures. And the average call length also increased from 14.19 minutes in February to almost 18 minutes in March. However, while the number of abandoned calls rose, the number of calls to the line increased by more than half a million within the same timeframe too. Last week, leading doctors warned that the 'problematic' roll-out of the NHS 111 advice line had left patients not knowing where to turn to for help. The Royal College of General Practitioners said patients have 'lost confidence' in the new non-emergency number before it is even fully up and running across the country. The service was planned to be rolled out on April 1, but officials were forced to postpone the deadline after it emerged that many of the advice lines - which are run by 44 individual local bodies across the country - were not ready to 'go live'. And, more than a month on, seven of the regional bodies are still not ready to start giving advice to patients in their areas. Patients have complained about calls going unanswered and poor advice being given, especially at weekends, which has led to hospitals being inundated with patients who could be treated elsewhere. Today Health minister Earl Howe hit out at the quality of the some of the operators of the 111 line but claimed that across most of England people were getting a 'good' or 'fantastic' service. Frustration: Those calling the new NHS 111 helpline say that they are being given substandard advice, especially at weekends . At question time in the House of Lords, Lord Howe said: 'We recognise that the NHS 111 launches in March did not go as smoothly as planned and a number of providers have delivered an unacceptable service, especially at weekends. 'NHS England is working closely with clinical commissioning groups to stabilise providers who have failed to deliver an effective service and to ensure those areas yet to go live are in a safe and fit state to do so.' But shadow health minister Lord Hunt of Kings Heath demanded: “On what grounds was the decision made to go ahead with the national roll-out in the light of the results from the pilot which showed problems with the scheme and the fact that many people in the NHS advised ministers and NHS England that it should not have been rolled out because it was not ready to be rolled out?' Lord Howe said Sheffield University had carried out research on the pilots which suggested high levels of satisfaction and that the service was sending people to the right places. 'On that basis it was considered safe to go ahead with the roll-out. 'Unfortunately, in particular areas of the country the resources deployed to meet the demand have not been accurately assessed,' he added. 'Across the vast bulk of England people are getting a good if not fantastic service. 'Unfortunately, in two particular areas of the country - the South East and South West - we are still seeing the problems arising.'","The number of abandoned phone calls rose from 6,976 in February to 29,100 in March .

The discovery of the 4,400-year-old burial site of a woman adorned with gold jewellery has prompted speculation that Windsor's royal connection goes back further than suspected. Archaeologists working in a quarry near the royal family's Berkshire residence have unearthed a rare Copper Age grave of a middle-aged woman buried with some of Britain's oldest gold ornaments. The find is doubly significant since grave sites from the era containing such fine jewellery, which also included lignite and amber, are usually associated with men. The first Queen of Windsor? This computer-generated image imagines how the Copper Age woman found buried near the royals' Berkshire residence may have looked wearing her gold, amber and lignite finery in life . 'It is interesting to think who this woman was within her community,' said site director Gareth Chaffey of Wessex Archaeology, who has worked on the site for the past seven years. 'She was probably an important person in her society, perhaps holding some standing which gave her access to prestigious, rare and exotic items. 'She could have been a leader, a person with power and authority, or possibly part of an elite family - perhaps a princess or queen.' The Windsor Castle that stands to this . day was begun by William the Conqueror in the decade following the 1066 . Norman Conquest, which overthrew the Saxon kings who had previously . ruled England. He . established the site as part of a ring of forts around London intended . to cement his new position of power and guard against potential . usurpers. Beaker burial: She as found with a large pottery drinking vessel, dating her to communities which lived across Europe at around 2,500 BC . But experts believe the recently unearthed woman was interred much, much earlier. They estimate that she was buried between 2,200 and 2,500BC - just a century or two after the construction of Stonehenge. That stone-circle, which many believe had mystical significance to early Britons, is located just 60 miles to the south-west. She was found with a large pottery . drinking vessel, which archaeologists term a 'beaker', dating her to . communities which lived across Europe at around 2,500 BC. In more westerly regions like Britain these beaker-using communities were the first to use copper and gold. At the time of the woman's burial, she . wore a necklace containing small tubular sheet gold beads and black . disc beads of lignite - a material similar to jet. A . number of larger perforated amber buttons were also found in a row . along her body, indicating that she may have been wearing clothing, . perhaps of woven wool, at the time of her burial. Further lignite beads from near her hands suggest that she also wore a bracelet. The Royal Standard flies from Windsor Castle: The castle that stands to this day was begun by William the Conqueror in the decade following the 1066 Norman Conquest as part of a ring of forts surrounding London . Stonehenge, Wiltshire: Scientists estimate the woman was buried just a century or two after Stonehenge was completed. The mystical site is located ust 60 miles to the south-west of the quarry where she was found . Dr Stuart Needham, an expert in Copper . Age metalwork, who studying the gold beads said: 'Beaker graves of this . date are almost unknown in South East England and only a small number . of them, and indeed continental Europe, contain gold ornaments. 'The . tubular beads that were found at Kingsmead Quarry are certainly rare in . Britain, and this gives the grave tremendous research importance.' Lead . isotype analysis has been used to determine that the gold used in the . jewellery most probably came from deposits located in south-east Ireland . and southern Britain. The . lignite beads used in the necklace are believed to have come from the . east of England, while the amber may have come from as far away as the . Baltic. Scientists hope . further analyses will shed light on the patterns of gold procurement and . the extent of trading networks in prehistoric Britain. Rare find: Lead isotype analysis has been used to determine that the gold used in the jewellery most probably came from deposits located in south-east Ireland and southern Britain . Osteologist Jacqueline McKinley . examined the skeletal remains. She said they appear to be those of an . adult aged 35 or over, possibly female. She . admitted however that the high acidity of the soil around the grave had . led to the degradation of the the bones and collagen precludes the . possibility of radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis. Beaker burials of this type are rare in this region of England and, it was an unexpected find, the researchers said. The Kingsmead Quarry site: Experts say there is an 'extensive prehistoric landscape' buried beneath the quarry and surrounding areas on the edge of West London and East Berkshire . This map shows the relative locations of the archaeological site at Kingsmead Quarry, Windsor Castle and Stonehenge, which was completed just a century or two before the woman was buried with her jewellery . However, as Dr Alistair Barclay of Wessex Archaeology noted, 'we know from recent research that an extensive prehistoric landscape is buried beneath the edge of West London and East Berkshire. 'The Kingsmead Quarry project is currently adding much new and significant information to this unfolding story and challenging our perception and understanding of prehistory.' The beads will go on display at the end of April at a special two day event organised by Wessex Archaeology and CEMEX UK, the cement firm which owns the Kingsmead Quarry site where they were unearthed.","Ancient 'princess or queen' dug up near to the royals' Berkshire residence .

A SARS-like virus that has killed at least 18 people can be passed between humans, the World Health Organisation now believes. Yesterday, WHO officials said it seemed likely that the new coronavirus could be transmitted from one person to another, however, they believe that prolonged contact with an infected person is required for transmission to take place. The virus is from the same family as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that swept the world and killed 775 people in 2003. WHO officials think that coronavirus could be transmitted from one person to another but prolonged contact is required for transmission to take place . Coronavirus emerged in the Gulf last September and has now infected at least 34 people, the majority of whom are in Saudi Arabia. Last week French authorities confirmed that a 65-year-old French man had been diagnosed with the condition after returning from Dubai. Yesterday they announced that a second man had been diagnosed with the disease after sharing a hospital room with the original patient. WHO Assistant Director-General Keiji Fukuda said there was no evidence so far that the virus was able to sustain ‘generalised transmission in communities’ - a scenario that would raise the spectre of a pandemic. He added: ‘Of most concern is the fact that the different clusters seen in multiple countries increasingly support the hypothesis that when there is close contact, this novel coronavirus can transmit from person to person. ‘There is a need for countries to increase levels of awareness.’ Coronavirus emerged in the Gulf last September and has now infected at least 34 people . A public health expert who declined to be identified, said ‘close contact’ meant being in the same small, enclosed space with an infected person for a prolonged period. Mr Fukuda, part of a WHO team visiting Saudi Arabia to investigate the spread of the disease, said although no specific vaccine or medication was yet available for novel coronavirus, patients were responding to treatment. ‘The care that is taken in the hospitals, in terms of using respirators well, in terms of treating pneumonia, in terms of treating complications, in terms of providing support, these steps can get patients through this very severe illness,’ he said. A World Health Organisation team are investigating the Al-Moosa hospital in Saudi Arabia where several patients are being treated. ‘One focal point of the investigation at the moment is the hemodialysis unit in the hospital,’ said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl in Geneva, referring to equipment used on kidney and diabetes patients. ‘The association of this outbreak with a single health care facility suggests hospital-acquired transmission,’ he said, noting that some patients under treatment for ailments may have had increased susceptibility to infection. ‘However, the presence of infection in people not associated with the facility itself raises a concern about potential broader transmission in the community,’ he said.","Coronavirus could be transmitted from one person to another according to the World Health Organisation .

Slimmers who embark on a DIY diet lose a lot less weight than those who join a slimming group, according to a new report. The latest American study reveals that dieters who join Weight Watchers lose, on average, five times more weight than those who go it alone. Researchers at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, compared weight loss among people following the Weight Watchers approach with those following a self-help approach. The findings showed that after both three and six months, people who followed the Weight Watchers approach achieved significantly greater weight loss than people who tried to lose weight on their own. Average weight loss after three months in the Weight Watchers group was 8.6lbs, compared with 1.8lbs in the self-help group. After six months the difference in results between the groups was even more stark, with average weight loss in the Weight Watchers group 10.1lbs, compared with 1.3lbs in the self-help group. Dr Craig Johnston, lead researcher on the study said: ‘The difference in weight loss between the two groups is compelling. ‘Whilst people in the Weight Watchers group demonstrated significant weight loss at six months, people in the self-help group started to re-gain weight. ‘Over time, it is unlikely that DIY diets are successful. ‘Also striking is the level of weight loss in the Weight Watchers group. Simply put, more people in the Weight Watchers group experienced clinically meaningful weight loss which has been shown to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases.’ As part of the study, 147 people were asked to follow the Weight Watchers programme, while another 145 participants were asked to diet alone. Those in the self-help group were provided with publicly available printed materials explaining basic dietary and exercise guidelines for safe weight loss. The study concluded that for the Weight Watchers group, the most important factor for weight-loss success was attending the meetings. After three months of dieting people following a Weight Watchers programme lose an average of 8.6lbs. DIY dieters lose just 1.8lbs . Zoe Hellman, Head of Public Health at Weight Watchers said: ‘These results demonstrate that the Weight Watchers approach works. ‘We believe that our meetings provide a powerful element of regular group support, where people are motivated, supported and learn how to change their lifestyles - and we have all the tools available to help them, with online and mobile access to our programme.’ This is the latest published research which supports the body of clinical evidence that proves Weight Watchers to be an effective and sustainable weight loss approach. A one-year global study recently published in The Lancet indicated that overweight and obese adults referred to Weight Watchers lost more than twice as much weight as those who just received care from their GP practice. An independent study published in the British Medical Journal also concluded that community based weight loss programmes were more effective and cheaper than those provided by specially trained health professionals.","People on Weight Watchers diet lose average of 8.6lbs in 3 months compared to 1.8lbs on DIY diets .

"By . Michael Zennie and David Mccormack . PUBLISHED: . 14:14 EST, 3 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:39 EST, 3 April 2013 . A shocking new revelation has been uncovered in the infamous 31-year-old mystery surrounding the death of Hollywood actress Natalie Wood. Wood's body was found floating in the sea off Catalina Island, California on Nov 29, 1981. She had been staying on the yacht, the Splendour, along with husband Robert Wagner and their guest and fellow actor Christopher Walken. The new discovery is the latest in a series of revelations in the case over the past couple of years. Refusal: Robert Wagner (left) has refused requests by detectives to be interviewed as part of a fresh investigation into the death of his wife Natalie Wood (right) in 1981 . Christopher Walken was a guest of Natallie Wood and Robert Wagner on their yacht on the night that she drowned . Authorities reopened the case in 2011 . after the captain of the yacht, Dennis Davern, claimed he had originally . lied to the authorities and a new coroner's report published in January revealed that Wood sustained bruises to her face and other parts of her body before she went overboard and drowned. Now the National Enquirer claims to have uncovered documentation - an official lifeguard log - which suggests Wagner and Walken had engaged in a sexual act and that Wood may have walked in on them and set off the chain of events which lead to her untimely and still unexplained death. The note, which is torn and illegible in parts, reads 'also known Chris Walken and Robert Wagner were engaged in sexual activity in cab of boat... (illegible)...that Ms Woods found both of them together (illegible)...stated they took her away in a (illegible)...was the last time she was seen alive.' The Los Angeles County lifeguard, who worked with detectives on the case, told The Enquirer he made the notes on the log after detectives told him that it was a scenario that were considering as a possible motive for any crime that might have been committed on the boat. Party: Ms Wood, Mr Wagner and actor Christopher Walken were aboard the boat - along with captain Dennis Davern (right) when she disappeared and drowned . If legitimate, the documentation could help shed further light on the case which is remains a mystery 21 years after the tragedy occurred. Ms Woods death was initially ruled an accidental drowning, caused by her slipping and falling from the dinghy, but authorities reopened the case in 2011. Davern, who said he had originally lied to authorities, now claims Woods and Wagner had been fighting in the hours before her body was found. Neither Wagner nor Walken has ever been charged in connection with the case. In January a new coroner's report revealed that bruises found on the actress' face, wrists, knees, and ankles occurred before she went into the water - not, as the 1981 report had concluded, as she struggled to climb back aboard the yacht after falling over the side. Those bruises could have been 'non-accidental' and she could have been assaulted aboard the yacht, the medical examiner claimed. Beaten: Ms Wood, seen here in 1962, had bruises on her wrists, knees and ankles that were consistent with her being beaten, according to a new coroner's report released in January . The new coroner's report poked numerous holes in the original autopsy reporting and the ruling that her death has been accidental - however it stopped short of calling her death a homicide. Wagner's publicist, Alan Nierob, told MailOnline in January that he would not comment on the report. Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives reopened their investigation in 2011 after the captain of the yacht claimed that Wood's husband, Robert Wagner, was with her right up until she went overboard. Her death was ruled 'accidental' at the time, but in 2012, the coroner changed the ruling to 'undetermined.' The coroner's office said in the new report that it is not have enough evidence to rule on the manner in which Wood died. However, the report did pay special attention to the bruises found on Wood's body. 'The location of the bruises, the multiplicity of the bruises, lack of head trauma, or facial bruising support bruising having occurred prior to entry in the water,' the report stated. Fatal: This is the yacht Splendor that Ms Wood and Mr Wagner were aboard when the actress went overboard and drowned off Santa Catalina Island over Thanksgiving weekend in 1981 . Dangerous: Ms Wood reportedly could not swim. Her body was found floating in the water near Catalina Island hours after she went overboard . Tragic: New information released in the last couple of years has cast suspicion on the original finding that Ms Wood's death was accidental (pictured here with Mr Wagner) Confession: Dennis Davern, the skipper of the yacht, says he lied to police about what happened the night Wood drowned . 'Since there are unanswered questions . and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined . by this Medical Examiner that the manner of death should be left as . undetermined,' Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran . wrote in the report completed last June. Wagner has told investigators that . Wood, who could not swim, must have fallen in the water when she got up . to try to retie a dingy that had been knocking against the side of the . yacht. He is not considered a suspect by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office. Wood's body was found to have a blood . alcohol content of 0.14 percent, nearly twice the legal limit for . driving. She was also found to be under the influence of a motion . sickness medication and a painkiller, which likely increased her level . of intoxication. Her body was found floating off Catalina Island, near Los Angeles, several hours later. The . captain of the yacht, Dennis Davern, told '48 Hours' and the 'Today' show last year that he heard Mr Wagner and Ms Wood arguing the night of her disappearance and believed Mr Wagner was to blame for her death. He said that after Wood went to bed, he heard the fight continuing in her cabin, including sounds of a physical struggle. He also claimed that a fight had broken . out between Wagner and actor Christopher Walken, who was also aboard to . yacht. Mr Davern claims Wagner waited several hours after his wife disappeared to call authorities. Wood, 43, rose to stardom in 1947 playing little Susie, the girl who didn't believe in Santa Claus, in 'Miracle on 34th Street.' She later starred as Maria in 1961's 'West Side Story' and was nominated for an Oscar for her role opposite James Dean in 'Rebel Without a Cause.' Wagner, now 82, admitted he had a fight with his wife on the night of November 28, 1981, but said she was not in her cabin when he went to bed. He maintains he had nothing to do with her death, though said he feels personally responsible for not looking after her. However, Davern reportedly offered an alternate explanation for Wood's death. Lana Wood, the actress' young sister, claimed to author Suzanne Finstad that Davern called her and drunkenly confessed that Wagner allowed his wife to drown. 'He said it appeared to him as though (Wagner) shoved her away and she went overboard. Dennis panicked and (Wagner) said, ""Leave her there. Teach her a lesson."" Dennis said he was very panicky that he was sitting and (Wagner) kept drinking and kept drinking. ‘And he’d say, ""Come on, let’s get her."" And he said (Wagner) was in such a foul mood, at that point, that he then shut up and was waiting for when, when are they gonna go to her rescue, until all the sound stopped,’ Lana is heard telling Finstad in recordings make for her 2001 book Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood. Lana continues on to say that Davern did not think that Wagner meant for Wood to die but he did not ‘run to her aid.’ 'Even if he did not kill her, which is what I understand the guy’s saying, it was – you know, that it – it was an accident,' Lana said. In January investigators also revealed that Robert Wagner has declined to be interviewed for the latest inquiry. Detectives began re-investigating the case in November 2011. Investigators interviewed more than 100 people – including Mr Walken - but Mr Wagner refused and Sheriff's Lt. John Corina has said the actor's representatives have not given any reason for his silence. The setup: On November 28, 1981, the 60-foot yacht Splendor set out for Santa Catalina Island, a rocky island off the coast of California, 22 miles from Los Angeles. Aboard were Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood and the boat's skipper, Dennis Davern. The couple also brought Wood's newest costar, Christopher Walken, to celebrate their successful completion of filming for 'Brainstorm,' a science fiction thriller. Wood, Wagner and Walken departed the yacht and rode a dingy to shore, where they had dinner at Harbor Reef Resultant on the island. Waitresses reported that all three Hollywood actors drank heavily - mostly champagne - and were rude and boisterous. Witnesses say all three were very intoxicated about 10.15pm when they piloted the dingy back to the yacht, which was anchored offshore. Exactly what happened after the three returned to the boat remains a mystery. The tragedy: Wood's body was found floating in the water about a mile from the yacht about 8am on November 29 and the coroner determined that she had died of a combination of drowning and hypothermia. Her blood alcohol level at the time was . 0.14percent - nearly twice the legal limit for driving. She also had . motion sickness medication and painkillers in her system, which likely . increased her level of intoxication. The time of death is estimated at about midnight at on November 29. 'The fact that her stomach contained 500 cc of partially digested food material supports that opinion of that time of death being around midnight, especially given the information that dinner was consumed between 8 and 9pm,' according to the new report. However, Wood was not reported missing until 1.30am - fully 90 minutes after she went overboard, according to an interview with the manager of the restaurant on shore.","A log has been uncovered that suggests Wagner and Walken were engaged in a sexual act when Wood walked in on them on the night she died .

Promising: Anne Smedingoff, 25, was working to create opportunities for women in Afghanistan . A promising young diplomat from Chicago has been killed in a suicide bombing along with five other Americans in the deadliest day in the war in eight months. Anne Smedingoff, 25, is the first member of the Foreign Service killed in the 12-year-old War in Afghanistan. She is also the first American  diplomat to die overseas since the consulate attacks in Benghazi, Libya, claimed the lives of Ambassador Chris Stevens and Sean Smith. She had been working with schools and businesses to improve the lives of girls and women in the southern province of Zabul. 'It was a great adventure for her ... She loved it,' her father, Tom Smedinghoff, said. 'She was tailor-made for this job.' Smedingoff, a Johns Hopkins graduate, and the other Americans were on a mission to donate books to Afghan students on Saturday when their convoy was rammed by a suicide car bomber. Three Americans soldiers and a civilian Defense Department employee were killed along with Smedingoff. Four other diplomats were injured, one critically. The attack came when the Americans' convoy intersected with a convoy carrying the provincial governor. The governor was not injured, but an Afghan doctor was killed. An American civilian adviser to the Afghan military was also killed in a separate attack in the east of the country, bringing the death toll to six. It was the deadliest day for Americans since August 16 when seven soldiers died in a pair of attacks in Kandahar. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday railed against the 'cowardly' terrorists responsible for the attack. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Afghan National Army soldiers rushing to the scene moments after a car bomb exploded in front the PRT, Provincial Reconstruction Team, in Qalat, Zabul province, southern Afghanistan . Tragic: Anne Smedinghoff worked in Venezuela before she volunteered for Afghanistan . At a news conference with Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, Kerry described Smedinghoff as 'a selfless, idealistic woman who woke up yesterday morning and set out to bring textbooks to school children, to bring them knowledge.' 'Anne and those with her,' Kerry said, 'were attacked by the Taliban terrorists who woke up that day not with a mission to educate or to help, but with a mission to destroy. A brave American was determined to brighten the light of learning through books, written in the native tongue of the students she had never met, whom she felt it incumbent to help.' The violence - hours after the U.S. military's top officer arrived for consultations with Afghan and U.S.-led coalition officials - illustrates the instability plaguing the nation as foreign forces work to pull nearly all their combat troops out of the country by the end of 2014. The attacks came just days after insurgents stormed a courthouse, killing more than 46 people in one of the deadliest attacks of the war, now in its 12th year. Smedinghoff's father Tom told the Chicago Tribune she had met Kerry when he visited Afghanistan last month. She has helped organize the Secretary of State's trip to the country last year, he said. He said his daughter died doing what she loved and believed in. The deadly day comes and American forces are preparing to pull out of Afghanistan . Passionate: Smedinghoff joined the Foreign Service out of college and was first posted in Venezuela. She later volunteered to go to Afghanistan . 'She was living in a compound that was heavily fortified and she was always trying to get out and do things for the population,' he said. He said family members would tease her about signing up for a less dangerous location, maybe London or Paris. 'She said, ""What would I do in London or Paris? It would be so boring,""' her father recalled. He said she would spend her free time traveling as much as possible. Mr Smedinghoff said his daughter and her colleagues knew the assignments were dangerous, though she spent most of her time at the U.S. Embassy compound. Tragedy: Six American troops and civilians and an Afghan doctor were killed in attacks on Saturday in southern and eastern Afghanistan as the U.S. military's top officer began a weekend visit . Trips outside were in heavily armored convoys — as was Saturday's deadly outing. 'It's like a nightmare, you think will go away and it's not,' he said. 'We keep saying to ourselves, we're just so proud of her, we take consolation in the fact that she was doing what she loved.' She joined the State Department immediately after finishing college at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Her first post was in Venezuela, . another nation where the U.S. is struggling diplomatically. When her . tour there ended, she volunteered to go to Afghanistan. 'She . tragically gave her young life working to give young Afghans the . opportunity to have a better future,' Kerry said in a statement. 'We . also honor the U.S. troops and Department of Defense civilian who lost . their lives, and the Afghan civilians who were killed today as they . worked to improve the nation they love.' Taliban . spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi claimed responsibility for the attack in . Zabul and said the bomber was seeking to target either a coalition . convoy or the provincial governor . 'We were waiting for one of them,' Ahmadi said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. 'It was our good luck that both appeared at the same time.' Black smoke rises from the bombing scene, where the Taliban allegedly attacked a U.S. convoy leaving a hospital compound . The deaths bring the number of foreign military troops killed this year to 30, including 22 Americans. Provincial Governor Mohammad Ashraf Nasery, who survived the attack in Qalat, said the explosion occurred in front of a hospital and a coalition base housing a provincial reconstruction team, or PRT. International civilian and military workers at the PRT train Afghan government officials and help with local development projects. Nasery said the car bomb exploded as his convoy was passing the hospital. He said the doctor was killed, and two of his bodyguards and a student from the school were wounded. 'The governor's convoy was at the gate of the school at the same time the (coalition) convoy came out from the PRT,' said provincial police chief General Ghulam Sakhi Rooghlawanay. 'The suicide bomber blew himself up between the two convoys.' Nasery said he thought his convoy was the intended target. 'I'm safe and healthy,' he told the AP in a telephone interview. Adventure: Smedingoff's family said she traveled the world and joined the Foreign Service so that he could help people across the world . Insurgents have stepped up attacks around the country in recent weeks as Afghanistan enters what could be one of the most critical periods following the U.S. invasion in late 2001 that ousted the Taliban. The majority of U.S. and coalition forces are expected to begin a significant drawdown in the latter part of this year, leaving Afghan forces in charge of security across the country within months. Afghanistan also is gearing up for a presidential election next spring, and the Taliban have not yet accepted an offer to engage in peace talks in the Gulf state of Qatar. There currently are about 100,000 international troops in Afghanistan, including 66,000 from the United States. The U.S. troop total is scheduled to drop to about 32,000 by early next year, with the bulk of the decline occurring during the winter months. While there has been no final decision on the size of the post-2014 force, U.S. and NATO leaders say they are considering a range of between 8,000 and 12,000 - most of them trainers and advisers.","Anne Smedingoff, of Chicago, died when a suicide car bomber hit her convoy in Zabul Province, Afghanistan .

Customs officers have arrested five men in connection with a people-smuggling ring that used vehicles adapted with ingenious secret compartments to smuggle over 1,000 of illegals into the US. Immigrants paid . between $2,000 and $4,000 dollars to cram themselves into tiny spaces . next to V8 engines or to be locked into the trunks of cars during some of the hottest . times of the year. In an attempt not to arouse suspicion, the gang used non-Spanish-speaking African-Americans recruited from poor areas of Los Angeles to drive the vehicles across the border near San Diego. Busted: Customs officers have arrested five men believed to be members of a gang that smuggled hundreds of immigrants into the US in secret compartments built into vehicles . Claude Arnold, a special agent with . the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said: 'We estimate . about 1,000 people were smuggled across the border during the time of . the investigation. Maria Lopez-Diaz, 60, and three . others were arrested Thursday on counts related to the transportation of . illegal immigrants in special compartments and the trunks of cars, . Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement. The ring coordinated with . international smugglers to pick-up illegal immigrants once they crossed . the border and transport them to Los Angeles, officials said. Lopez-Diaz recruited poor black drivers from South Los Angeles hoping they would not rouse the suspicion of authorities near the border. The drivers' inability to communicate with the immigrants also meant they had limited information about the broader smuggling scheme, officials said. The drivers were paid between $300 and $800 for each of the dozens of people they transported from the border to Los Angeles each month in 2010. 'Criminal organizations are always looking for ways to evade detection by law enforcement, said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge of ICE homeland security investigations in Los Angeles. Stitch up: This photograph of a stowaway who was discovered sewn into the upholstery of a van seat was released last year. It is not known whether it was the work of the same gang . Another file picture released by the Customs and Border patrol  shows a woman hidden behind the dashboard of a car on the US Mexico border in 2001 . 'This particular organization figured out, hey, what if we used African Americans as drivers? They might be likely to draw less attention.' 'Ultimately, of course, it didn't work,' he said. Lopez-Diaz, two relatives and a suspected driver appeared in federal court Thursday afternoon. Another suspected driver remains at large. Lopez-Diaz was being held without bail. The five defendants were indicted last month on one charge of conspiracy. Lopez-Diaz and her 35-year-old son-in-law Juan Eduardo Baltazar are also charged with transporting illegal immigrants and immigrant harboring. Bobby Johnson, a 67-year-old driver from . Los Angeles, is also charged with transporting illegal immigrants, . officials said. Johnson is being held on $25,000 bond. Double trouble: These two immigrants were discovered in a hidden compartment built into the floor of a car in June 2010. Again it is not known whether the same gang was involved . Messages seeking comment were left for the defendants' attorneys Thursday afternoon. Baltazar's attorney Michael Belter said he has not yet received information about the case. His initial hearing was continued until next week. Immigration officials began investigating in January 2010 when border patrol agents reported seeing a rising number of African-American drivers with illegal immigrants hidden in the trunks of their cars. Typically, smugglers who bring illegal immigrants from Mexico use Spanish-speaking drivers, Arnold said.",Smugglers tried to avoid detection by recruiting non-Spanish-speaking African-American drivers .

Referee Fabio Schirru told St. Georgen-Montichiari defender Gabriel Brugger: 'If I hear you speaking German one more time you will be sent off.' The use of language is controversial in the region as it used to be part of Austria but was handed over to Italy after the war and although technically now Italian, most people in the region still speak German. The state governor Luis Durnwalder said: 'The local government is not aware of any laws ruling what language can be spoken on the football pitch. 'There are no such rules in place which govern sport.' The South Tyrol Amateur Footballers Association said that players should be allowed to use their mother tongue language amongst themselves. 'Nobody can stop them doing that,' he added. The referee association in South Tirol also backed the player and said that Italian should be the language used with the referee but the use of German is allowed on the pitch among players. An official complaint has been made against the referee. Durnwalder said: 'I have made it clear that the referee's actions were out of order.' South Tyrol is regarded as Italy's richest province and was once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but was annexed to Italy in 1919 at the end of the First World War. South Tyrol was once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but was annexed to Italy in 1919 at the end of the First World War . Many are native German speakers. In the 1920s and 1930s, fascist dictator Benito Mussolini encouraged Italians from the south to settle in the region. German was banned in schools, courts and public offices and place names were 'Italianised'. In 1939 Hitler and Mussolini agreed to give the German speakers a choice - to stay in South Tyrol and become integrated into Italian language and culture or emigrate to the German Reich. Relations between the two nations improves in the 1970s. The Schuetzen, who organise marches in Tyrolean national dress and feathered hats, have long campaigned for reunification with North Tyrol in Austria.","Referee Fabio Schirru told defender Gabriel Brugger he would be sent off if he spoke German .

"By . Laura Topham . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 11 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 11 May 2013 . My battle: Maureen Nolan suffers from deafness . The Nolan sisters are no strangers to tragedy and trauma. Between them they have endured difficult childhoods, infidelity, domestic violence and divorce. And now they are facing their biggest ordeal of all as Bernie bravely confronts the final stages of breast cancer. It’s a situation that has focused the minds of all the girls – and left one of them, Maureen, determined to tackle a health problem that has been blighting her life: deafness . ‘Seeing Bernie so poorly has made me more aware than ever that we should do what we can to look after ourselves and make sure we live life to the full,’ she explains. ‘I feel so blessed that hearing is my only health problem, which is entirely in my control to fix and can be easily resolved.’ Maureen, 58, says her problems date back to the early days of the sisters’ singing career. ‘I have just 50 per cent hearing in my right ear,’ she reveals. ‘I remember doing a 1960s rock ’n’ roll tour and being deaf every night when I came off stage, with a hissing in my ear. ‘I have been subjected to such massive noise through work – you’ve no idea how loud it could be on stage, even performing in the working men’s clubs when we were kids.’ Today Maureen is speaking about her problem for the first time, to launch Specsavers’ Sound Barrier Star Awards, which celebrate achievement by people with hearing loss. You wouldn’t know it to look at her, but Maureen has two new hearing aids that she says have transformed her life. With her beauty, youthful looks and glamorous make-up and hair, Maureen certainly crushes the stereotype of a hearing-aid wearer as elderly and debilitated. ‘I know there’s a stigma about wearing hearing aids but I don’t understand why,’ she says. ‘I don’t mind mine at all – with these new models, you can’t see them at all anyway.’ To demonstrate, she pops out the two tiny devices that sit in her ear canal – the size, shape and colour of a baked bean – and puts them on the table. Behind the jollity, the troubles to . have hit the family are never far from  her mind. Bernie, 53, has . advanced, incurable breast cancer and is the third of the singing . sisters to be diagnosed with the disease. ‘She’s got cancer of everything now, really,’ says Maureen, who is staying with Bernie the week we meet. ‘What’s worse – and what will get her – . is that she has lung cancer and now lung disease. She is on oxygen and . it’s very traumatic.’ Back in the day: The Nolan sisters on the Les Dawson show in 1977 - from left, Bernie, Denise, Anne, Maureen and Linda . It is a very different picture back at Maureen’s home in Blackpool, where she lives with husband Ritchie Hoyle, 48, a music tour manager. Their son Danny, 24, has just moved back in with his fiancee Maddison, 23, and daughter Sienna, two. ‘It’s a mad house. Danny was floundering a bit with bills so I said he was welcome to come and live with us. I’m thrilled. ‘My husband is still a bit traumatised, with the baby jumping on him every morning – but I grew up in a mad household so I love it. I didn’t ever want him to leave,’ says Maureen. It was her family who first noticed . her hearing problems. ‘They’re never shy of telling it like it is,’ says . Maureen. ‘They used to say, “God you’re deaf.” But I’d say, “No, no, . you’re not speaking clearly.” I was always turning up the TV and my son . would come in and say, “Mum that’s deafening!” ‘I found it hard to interact with people sometimes, but I never thought my hearing was making life difficult.’ Two . years ago, Maureen finally accepted something was wrong as she lay in . bed talking to Ritchie – and noticed she was lifting her head off the . pillow whenever he spoke. Tragedy: Bernie Nolan was diagnosed with cancer in 2010 and was recently told it is terminal . ‘I was raising myself up to stop my left ear being muffled as that was the only way I could hear him,’ she says. ‘I thought, “I should be able to hear with just one ear,” but I couldn’t. I knew then that I had a problem.’ But like most people who fear they are losing their hearing, Maureen did nothing about it. She says: ‘When you’re not completely deaf and managing to enjoy life, it’s easy to ignore it. But as time went on it got much worse – often I’d know someone was talking to me but be unable to work out what they were saying. My sense of humour went out of the door as I kept missing jokes.’ In March this year, she finally went for a hearing test. ‘It was a shock to find I had just 50 per cent hearing in my right ear. The other ear has a slight degeneration, too.’ While many people might be upset by the prospect of hearing aids, Maureen was happy. ‘I was relieved as I wasn’t living life to the full,’ she says. ‘Getting older is a very gradual thing so whatever it brings doesn’t really upset me. ‘I’m still pretty healthy, I look OK and I’ll cope with it. Older people think losing their hearing is a reflection on them ageing. But it’s much more ageing to not be able to keep up with what’s going on around you. I was left out of conversations as I couldn’t hear – and that ages you more than anything.’ Maureen’s hearing loss could be partly genetic – her 86-year-old aunt is profoundly deaf and her mother has otosclerosis, a hereditary condition in which bone grows across the ear. Maureen has yet to find out if she is affected, though it can be corrected through surgery. However, she admits that using the hearing aids has taken some adjustment. ‘I could immediately hear more clearly what people were saying. But I found it weird hearing my own voice in my head – it’s like sticking your fingers in your ears so your voice is amplified.’ Maureen is currently touring with the hit musical Blood Brothers. She says: ‘I’ve tried out the hearing aids during a sound check, but not for the show itself as that would take getting used to and the stage is the one place I’ve never had a problem.’ She is now determined to fix the hearing of the rest of her famous clan – whose best-known hit was I’m In The Mood For Dancing in 1979. ‘When I told my sisters about my hearing loss they just laughed,’ she says. ‘My brother Tommy already has a hearing aid – he’s the eldest of us at 64 – and I’m encouraging all my sisters to get tested. ‘It’s funny but I really notice hearing problems in other people now – they cock their head to one side and ask you to repeat things, or have a vacant look as they haven’t heard properly.’ For Maureen, that is a reminder of how much hearing aids have helped. ‘I wish I’d done it years ago,’ she says. ‘The worst thing about hearing loss is the isolation. With aids, you become part of society again. And I now have the TV at a normal sound level – which is a relief to everybody in the house!’ lMaureen is supporting Specsavers’ Sound Barrier Star Awards.

Her mysterious disappearance from the screen has baffled viewers, colleagues and even her own mother. But Christa Ackroyd’s absence from her flagship BBC programme has been more than filled by a few salient revelations – not least that she earns around £225,000 a year. That is believed to make her the highest paid regional news presenter in the country, with a salary far higher than the Prime Minister’s £150,000. Scroll down for video . BBC local news presenter Christa Ackroyd (left), who earns around £225,000 a year, stopped presenting Look North more than six weeks ago. She has presented the show with Harry Gration (right) since 2001 . It is believed Miss Ackroyd, who has presented Look North since 2001, is employed on a freelance basis and that her contract expires this year . Colleagues have accused the Look North co-host of behaving ‘like The Queen’ and being ‘too big for her boots’. Miss Ackroyd, who also runs a luxury B&B in West Yorkshire, has a penchant for sporty cars, the latest of which is a lovingly restored vintage blue and white Mini Cooper with number plate C12 STA. Last night sources at the BBC said her vanishing act may have been the result of a suggested pay cut. There was also speculation that it could be linked to her expenses and tax affairs. Miss Ackroyd’s extravagant lifestyle and salary came to light after she stopped presenting Look North more than six weeks ago. She has co-presented the programme with Harry Gration since 2001. Sources said Miss Ackroyd’s pay was significantly more than other regional TV presenters – most of whom earn around £100,000 –because she was poached from Yorkshire Television’s rival show Calendar to boost ratings. It is believed that Miss Ackroyd is employed on a freelance basis and that her contract expires this year. There was speculation last night that the BBC was planning to slash her pay back to about £150,000.Although she is popular with viewers, Miss Ackroyd is considerably less well thought of by her colleagues. Colleagues have accused the Look North co-host of behaving 'like The Queen' and being 'too big for her boots' One claimed: ‘Everyone says they are out . to get her because she is paid too much and the phrase being used is . she is too big for her boots. There is a feeling at the BBC and ITV she . should take a massive pay cut.’ Conservative MP Philip Davies, who . sits on the culture, media and sport select committee, said of Miss . Ackroyd’s salary: ‘It seems to me to be very high. How it has got to . that level I don’t know. I would have thought that is excessive.’ Miss Ackroyd, who runs the B&B . with her husband Chris Sutcliffe, last appeared on air on March 1. She . flew to Sydney the same month for her annual visit to spend time with . her 27-year-old daughter Briony. After arriving home in Yorkshire she tweeted that while she had jet lag she was looking forward to being back ‘in the real world’. But she has not yet returned to the Look North newsroom. Last night her 85-year-old mother Phyllis said: ‘She [Christa] has been in Australia for a few weeks and come back and we just don’t know what’s happening. I spoke to her yesterday. Everyone wants to know when she is back on TV and what’s going on but it’s not for me to say.’ Miss Ackroyd’s colleagues said: ‘The uncertainty is having a bad effect on the atmosphere. We seem to spend all our time answering queries about what has happened to Christa. Any inquiries we are just told to bat off to the BBC press office. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Christa is still working for the BBC but is off air at the moment. Freelancers and staff employed through service companies are responsible for making the appropriate payments to HMRC.’ Jonathan Ross was paid £6million a year when he was at the BBC . BBC One boss Danny Cohen has been promoted to director of television on a salary of £327,800. His appointment pushed the corporation into another row over executive salaries after it emerged he will be paid nearly £50,000 more than his predecessor. Critics said it was another example of the BBC failing to clamp down on inflated wage packets. It follows fierce criticism of the £450,000 golden goodbye given to former director general George Entwistle when he resigned after just 54 days in the job. His successor Tony Hall will also be entitled to a huge payout if he fails despite only having to serve a six-month notice period. The £340,000-a-year salary of former Times editor James Harding also raised eyebrows when he was announced as the new head of news and current affairs. The controversy over staff salaries comes after anger at the millions paid to the so-called 'talent'. Jonathan Ross has previously insisted he was worth the £6million a year he was previously paid by the BBC as he says he would have been paid more elsewhere. Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker's £2million-a-year salary also caused anger. His colleague Alan Hansen is understood to have taken a pay cut in his new contract.","BBC sources say vanishing act may have been result of suggested pay cut .

Cleveland kidnapping victim Amanda Berry may start a new life near her extended family in Tennessee after escaping the abductor who held her captive for ten years. Miss Berry, now 27, vanished in Cleveland, Ohio, on the day before her 17th birthday on April 21, 2003, shortly after calling her sister to say she was getting a lift home from her job at Burger King. But she incredible emerged alive earlier this month when she managed to escape from the basement of a house in Cleveland where she had been sexually abused by her captor and gave birth to her six-year-old daughter. Reunited: Amanda Berry, pictured centre, at the Cleveland Hospital alongside her emotional sister, left,and the daughter that she gave birth to during the 10 years she was held against her will . Facing trial: Ariel Castro is being held in prison facing charges of kidnap and rape after he allegedly held three women captive in his home for a decade . Two other women Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michele Knight, 32, who disappeared from the same block as Ms Berry ten years ago were also rescued from the property. Ms Berry's relatives now hope she will move to Tennessee so she can be closer to her father and extended family. Her uncle Curtis Berry, 50, from Elizabethton, Tennessee, told nydailynews.com: 'She has more kin here than anywhere else. This is her home.' Ms Berry has also been to visit the grave of her mother Louwana Miller, who never gave up hope her daughter was alive, for the first time  since she passed away. Her alleged abductor Ariel Castro, 52, is currently being held in prison awaiting trial. His brothers Onil, 50, and Pedro, 54, were arrested May 6 along with their sibling but were later released. Freed: Amanda Berry (center), Gina DeJesus . (left) and Michelle Knight (right) were held captive for ten years after . being abducting from the street between 2002 and 2004 . House of horrors: Law enforcement officers stand watch outside the Cleveland house where Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were found alive after being held captive for a decade . ‘I didn’t get to see Michelle because . - she came out so fast … but I was so focused on Gina because she was . so, she was shaking, she was like, it was sad ... and they were all . together that's the crazy thing, you know -- and we didn't even know . what was going on, we just pulled over because we thought we were going . to get stopped,’ Colon told NewsNet 5. In an interview in CNN, Pedro Castro said he had no idea what had been going on. He added: 'If I knew, I would have reported it — brother or no brother.' Ms Berry and her fellow captives only escaped after a neighbour heard Berry calling for help, kicked the door of the house in and gave her a telephone to call 911. 'Help me, I'm Amanda Berry... I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for ten years and I'm here. I'm free now,' she is heard saying in the call to police. 'I need them now before he gets back!' she said in the frantic phone call, going on to identify her captor as Ariel Castro, a 52-year-old Hispanic man. A brief video filmed by Jasmina Baldrich shows the very first image of Berry after she broke out of the house of horrors after being held captive for a decade. Escape route: The women escaped through the front door of Castro's home after a neighbor helped them . Intense: This video captures police officers prying the door of Ariel Castro's home, and flooding in, some reaching for their guns . Berry can be seen clutching her six-year-old daughter Jocelyn in her arms and holding Charles Ramsey’s hand for comfort. Ramsey was later hailed has a hero for responding to Berry’s cries for help and phoning 911. Cops can be seen prying open the front door of Castro's house. Once open, they flood into the home, some reaching for their handguns. Baldrich and her friend Ashley Colon were driving down Seymour Avenue on Monday evening when they were suddenly surrounded by police cruisers. Baldrich thought she was being pulled over. Within second, the officers started running toward a house and breaking down the door. ‘We just seen cops and then out of nowhere all we see Amanda walking by saying I'm Amanda Berry,’ Baldrich told NewsNet 5 in Cleveland. Baldirch said she and Colon both immediately realized what was happening. Just 16: Amanda Berry pictured centre with two school friends shortly before she disappeared in April 2003 . ‘We both got goose bumps at the same time.  We were shocked, we could not believe it,’ Colon said. The revelation that Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were alive and had been kept as sex slaves for a decade shocked and horrified the nation, but it was seen as a miracle in Cleveland. Berry and DeJesus were both well known missing persons cases. Their disappearance haunted their neighborhood and their parents made public campaigns to search for them and plead for their return. Berry was nearly 17 when she disappeared in 2003. DeJesus was just 14 when she was taken off a street walking home in 2004. Knight disappeared in 2002, but because she was an adult and because her mother assumed she had run away, her case fell through the cracks. ‘I didn’t get to see Michelle because - she came out so fast … but I was so focused on Gina because she was so, she was shaking, she was like, it was sad ... and they were all together that's the crazy thing, you know -- and we didn't even know what was going on, we just pulled over because we thought we were going to get stopped,’ Colon told NewsNet 5. Well known: Huge public appeals were launched after Amanda Berry, pictured left aged 15, vanished on her way home after finishing a shift at Burger King . The three women have hired attorneys and a PR firm to represent them as the entire world waits for them to make their first public appearances. Their lawyer addressed the media on Sunday morning with a brief public statement saying the girls were thankful for the support from the community. However, they asked for privacy and said they would not give any public interviews until after Castro’s trial. He is being held on $8million bail on three counts of rape and four counts of kidnapping. The prosecutor said he hopes to add murder charges to Castro’s indictment and pursue the death penalty after he allegedly beat his victims so that they had miscarriages. A 10-foot chainlink fence now surrounds the house on Seymour and work crews boarded up the windows to protect the home, and any remaining evidence inside, from furious Clevelanders who have threatened to burn it to the ground.

"By . Andy Dolan . PUBLISHED: . 04:37 EST, 10 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:00 EST, 10 May 2013 . A policeman was paid more than £13,000 in compensation after injuring his big toe – during health and safety training. The unidentified officer was one of 23 colleagues to lodge claims against Suffolk Police which has paid out more than £300,000 to staff since 2007. It is just the latest in a string of cases which have heightened fears that there is a burgeoning compensation culture within the police. Compensation culture: Officers from Suffolk police have claimed more than £300,000 in compensation from the force over the past six years reveal new figures . In March it was revealed that a woman officer is suing both her own force and a victim of crime over separate mishaps at work. And last month, it emerged another . officer is suing a burglary victim after allegedly falling into a drain . while investigating a break-in. In the latest case to come to light, . the Suffolk Police officer pocketed £13,625 after he hurt his right big . toe during a health and safety drill. Claim: PC Kelly Jones (left), pictured with her father on her first day as a police officer, sparked outrage when she launched a legal claim against a petrol station owner after tripping over a kerb on a call out . At least seven claims to the force . were lodged by officers who were hurt during training. The figures . released under Freedom of Information laws also reveal how another . officer received a payout of £7,400 for slipping on a spillage in a . custody suite. Injuries: It emerged that PC Jones had also taken legal action against her force after she was involved in a collision while traveling in a patrol car . The biggest successful claim – for . £130,845 – came in August 2010 when a member of force staff fell in a . store room and fractured a hip. Of the 23 compensation claims lodged . with Suffolk Police, 16 were settled, five were dismissed and two – one . involving an officer tripping over a pallet and the other when a falling . ceiling panel caused injury – remain outstanding. Suffolk Police said the compensation payments may include ‘legal expenses’ and ‘third party solicitor’s costs’. A spokesman said that of the £13,625 . paid out in the case of  the officer who injured his toe,  less than . £4,000 amounted to  actual compensation. The spokesman went on to defend the . claims. She said: ‘The very nature of policing can mean that incidents . attended by officers can involve pursuit or confrontation, which can . potentially result in damage or accidents. ‘Every effort is made to reduce these . instances but they can be inevitable in the course of ensuring that . communities are kept safe.’ Matt Gould, chairman of Suffolk Police . Federation, denied that officers were becoming more litigious or . greedy, adding: ‘I think one of the things that gets forgotten is that . if police officers become injured to the extent where they can’t perform . all of the functions of the police officer they face compulsory . termination of employment or medical retirement. Rough justice: Petrol station owner Steve Jones pictured with the kerb that PC Kelly Jones fell over while investigating a break in . Alarmed: Home Secretary Theresa May called for a review into Police compensation claims saying that it was damaging public trust in officers . ‘Just like any other employee, there needs to be some protection for them.’ But Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the case was ‘further evidence of how the compensation . culture has got out of control in this country’. He added: ‘Every penny spent on settling these claims means less money spent on frontline policing and keeping us safe.’ In March, WPC Kelly Jones triggered a . furious backlash after it emerged she was suing a garage owner in . Norfolk after tripping on a kerb while investigating a burglary. It then emerged the 33-year-old is . also demanding compensation from Norfolk Constabulary for a knee injury . sustained in an accident in a police car. The case prompted Home Secretary . Theresa May to order a review of police compensation amid fears it may . be deterring victims of crime from coming forward. Then last month it emerged PC Richard . Seymour is suing a burglary victim after he allegedly tore his Achilles . tendon when he fell into a drain while investigating a break-in in . Surrey in 2012. He is suing for ‘loss of overtime’ during his six-month absence from work despite being on full pay. Police officers have sought huge sums for controversial claims. Among them are: .","Suffolk Police paid out more than £300,000 in compensation in six years .

A woman who fell overboard from a cruise ship with her boyfriend off the coast of Australia had spoken of her excitement about the holiday in her final tweet just days before. Kristen Schroder, 27 and Paul Rossington, 30, are feared to have died after falling over the side of the Carnival Spirit liner into the Tasman Sea - 75 miles off New South Wales. They had been captured on CCTV arguing in the ship's casino before they plunged from its 65ft-high deck last Wednesday. In her final message on Twitter, Ms Schroder wrote: 'Gotta pack for the cruise!!! Cannot wait for the down time with the family! It's going to be awesome to have the most important people in my world around me for 10 days.' Scroll down for video . Fall: Paul Rossington, 30, and Kristen Schroder, 27 were arguing on the Carnival Spirit liner hours before they fell from the ship off the New South Wales coast . It has been reported that the couple, from Barraba near Tamworth, had . skipped an arranged dinner with Ms Schroder's family, who were also . travelling on the Carnival Spirit. Ms Schroder's . brother-in-law Sascha Percuoco has said neither was intoxicated at the . time. In a posting on his Facebook page - reported by ABC News - Mr Percuoco said he was upset to read that  Kristen had ' jumped off the Carnival Spirit cruise ship willingly.' 'I want to make one thing absolutely clear,' he said, 'neither of them had been . drinking and I do not for one minute believe Kristen would take her own . life.' He said Ms Schroder had 'lost her grip and slipped backwards' from the ship's railing,' according to ABC News, and that he believes Mr Rossington 'jumped in to save her without having a chance to think clearly and call for help.' Senior police sources revealed that . CCTV footage showed Ms Schroder fall from the ship first, with her . paramedic boyfriend following. Further footage shows her hit a lifeboat before her body hit the water. Tweet: Ms Schroder (right) wrote on her Twitter feed of her excitement about the holiday days before they boarded the cruise liner . Investigation: Police officers investigate the cruise ship's balcony where the couple fell overboard on Wednesday evening. they are reviewing CCTV footage for evidence . The couple had been travelling with a group of friends and family on the Carnival Spirit liner. A massive sea and air search was held after their disappearance. Authorities were said to be looking at the . theory that Miss Schroder fell first and her panic-stricken boyfriend . then jumped in to try to save her. Security footage on the ship is said to . show the pair falling overboard from the mid-deck of the boat as it . travelled down the New South Wales' mid-north coast just before 9pm . local time on Wednesday. Holiday: The couple was on holiday with a group of seven relatives and friends when they went missing on Wednesday night . Initially police were unable to . determine who had fallen into the sea first, but after the footage had . been enhanced, they could see that it was estate agent Miss Schroder who . plunged first from the 65ft-high deck, followed about 20 seconds later . by her boyfriend. They were reported missing 12 hours . later after the boat had docked at Sydney's Circular Quay at the end of . its 10-day cruise. Staff noticed the couple had failed to collect their . luggage when the rest of the 2,680 passengers disembarked. Survival expert Dr Paul Luckin said . if the couple, from Barraba, near Tamworth in NSW, had survived the . impact of hitting the water, fatigue would be their biggest problem. Dr . Luckin, who advises the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said . he would not expect anyone to last as long as three days after falling . from a ship. He told the Sydney Herald: 'If you're stuck in the water and constantly being hit in the face by water, that is tremendously fatiguing. 'It will certainly be under three days that you would expect somebody to survive without water in those conditions.' Mr Rossington, a paramedic, and his . girlfriend had been on holiday on the cruise around the Pacific Islands . with a group of seven relatives and friends. Their cabin on the ship remains sealed off while forensic officers inspect it, although the ship did set sail from Sydney on its next cruise at 6.30pm last night. CCTV: Police studying enhanced CCTV footage from the ship's cameras believe Miss Schroder fell into the sea first . Inspection: Police combed the cruise ship while it was berthed at Sydney's Circular Quay before it set sail again . NSW police marine area commander Mark . Hutchings said the couple's fall was not believed to be suspicious, and . officers were inspecting the ship's CCTV footage. He said: 'It’s very unclear, but it does depict one person going over and then a short time (later) another person going over.' The ship was about 120km (75 miles) off the coastal town of Forster when the couple plunged into the sea. A statement released by Carnival . Cruise Lines said: 'As part of our standard protocol, a full ship search . was conducted as well as examination of closed circuit video. 'There . is indication from the shipboard video of what transpired.

While entry standards will be similar to those for Westminster School, offers will not just be based on results but will also take potential into account, The Times has reported. Sir Daniel Moynihan, chief executive of the Harris Federation, said he hoped half of the academy's students would go on to study at Oxford or Cambridge, which would make it the country's most successful state-funded school. He said: 'We have around 1,600 or 1,700 sixth formers at Harris academies and are targeting Russell Group universities. We want to get more A* and A grades at A level and Westminster has that expertise.' Westminster head master Dr Stephen Spurr said: 'We are best at teaching academically gifted children and we believe that there are plenty such young people with the ability and potential to make the most of such a sixth form and go on to the best universities in this country and elsewhere.' The academy, which will be set up through the Government's free schools programme, is expected to start recruiting in June if it receives its formal approval next month. The academy's full capacity will be 250, although its first intake will be of 125 students in autumn next year. Applicants hoping to gain a place at the academy will be required to pass a tough entrance exam and interview and achieve A* or A grades at GCSE (file picture) Westminster, which charges fees of between £23,583 and £31,350 and each year sends about 90 pupils to Oxford and Cambridge, will shape the academy's curriculum, according to The Times. Lord Adonis, former Labour Schools Minister, has welcomed the plan, describing it as an 'immensely exciting and important venture'. Education Secretary Michael Gove said: 'This sixth form is a unique collaboration between two leading lights of UK education.

They look as unappetising as many of them taste. But ever since the wheatgrass shot became a health-food phenomenon – the bitter juice is said to do everything from boosting the immune system to warding off cancer – manufacturers have been falling over themselves to create new concoctions of green sludge that promise astonishing benefits. Surely, anything this disgusting must be good for us. But, what exactly DOES this stuff do? DRINK YOUR GREENSKnown collectively as ‘greens’, these supplements are derived from nutrient-packed plants and organisms, found in liquid, powder, pill or capsule form. They can be split into two categories. There are land-grown leaves and grasses, such as wheatgrass, barley-grass and kale, which are particularly rich in Vitamin C, calcium, iron, magnesium and potassium. Then there are algaes, such as spirulina, chlorella and kelp, which are high in good fats and protein, as well as magnesium and a host of vitamins and minerals. Manufacturers and retailers say modern diets and intensive farming have left us deprived of essential nutrients – particularly magnesium found in chlorophyll – which are abundant in these supplements. Magnesium is vital for maintaining healthy blood pressure and boosts the immune and digestive systems. GOOD ALL-ROUNDERSNutritional therapist Ian Marber says he takes a supplement combining several greens, and recommends them to his clients. ‘With so many foods available to us, we are very rarely deficient in essential nutrients,’ he says. ‘But that’s not to say that we couldn’t benefit from a little more of this or that. I use it in place of multivitamins. 'These “edible pond scums” are not chemical, and that means the body can absorb them more easily. They are good all-rounders and many of them contain probiotic bacteria.’ Celebrity fans: Both Miranda Kerr and Victoria Beckham enjoy green juices to keep themselves glowing . A SHOWBIZ STAPLECelebrities who consume the supergreen stuff certainly look as if they enjoy glowing health – Miranda Kerr, Poppy Delevingne and Victoria Beckham are among fans. When model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley tweeted a picture of herself drinking a juice cocktail containing chlorella earlier this year, sales of one brand rocketed by 60 per cent: Sun Chlorella UK claims it had to order an emergency shipment from Japan in order to keep up with British demand. In fact, chlorella is one of the most scientifically studied plant forms in the world, and has been hailed as a superfood since the 1940s when scientists believed it could be the high-yield, highly nutritious crop the world needed to feed the booming post-war population. Popular plants: Algae supplements such as spirulina, pictured, and chlorella are seeing a sales burst in the UK . It has been available in the UK in tablet form for seven years, and in that time it has been reported that it reduces body-fat percentage and blood-glucose levels, helping those suffering from type 2 diabetes, heart disease or obesity.

'Better sources of protein, as well as all the other vitamins and minerals they contain, can be found elsewhere at a far better price.

It may look innocuous, but this tiny lead ball is thought to have triggered a rebellion that saw millions of Russians die and gave rise to the world's first communist state. When the ball of shot narrowly missed hitting Tsar Nicholas II after it was fired from a cannon in 1905 in St Petersburg, it is believed to have set in motion a chain of events that culminated in the Russian Revolution. Now its unique place in history is expected to see the grapeshot ball - which has been privately owned for almost a century - fetch up to half a million pounds at auction. Chilling: When this grapeshot ball, left, narrowly missed hitting Tsar Nicholas II, right, in St Petersburg in January 1905, it set in motion a chain of events that culminated in the Russian Revolution . The lead shot missed the Russian Tsar by three feet when it was fired during a ceremonial salute outside the Winter Palace in January 1905. Russia was a country on the brink of mass political and social unrest at the time of the so-called assassination attempt on Tsar Nicholas II in St Petersburg in January 1905. On January 22, days after Russia's last emperor believed he had survived an attempt on his life, soldiers of the Imperial Guard shot unarmed striking workers as they made their way to the Winter Palace in a peaceful demonstration. Up to 100 people died on what came to be known as Bloody Sunday, a day that would prove to have grave consequences for the Tsarist regime. It is widely regarded as one of the key events that sparked the eventual Russian Revolution of 1917, which led to the dismantling of the country's Tsarist autocracy. The series of rebellions saw Tsar Nicholas II forced to abdicate in February of that year, and ultimately paved the way for the creation of the USSR in 1922. In October 1917 the Bolsheviks overthrew the shaky provisional government established after the abdication, and Nicholas and his family were eventually held in a prison in Yekaterinburg. In July 1918, as anti-Bolsheviks approached the city, the family was executed. They are thought to have been killed on the orders of Bolshevik leader Lenin. Although an investigation later found the shot had been fired by accident, Nicholas II is said to have been convinced he had been the target of an assassination attempt. Three days later, the Russian Imperial Guard opened fire on a crowd of striking workers and their families during a peaceful demonstration, killing almost 100. This incident earned the Tsar the title 'Nicholas the Bloody' and led to a decade of civil unrest that culminated in the Russian Revolution of 1917. The rebellion dismantled the Tsarist autocracy in Russia and paved the way for the creation of the USSR, led by communist revolutionary Lenin. Tsar Nicholas II and his family were executed in 1918. The shot was recovered from scene of the 1905 'shooting' by a Russian duke who had been standing next to the Tsar at the time. He took it to famed goldsmiths Faberge . where the shot, which measures 1.5ins in diameter, was mounted on a gold . seal that was later given to Nicholas II as a present. A member of the royal court took it with him when he fled Russia at the outbreak of the revolution. It . has been in private ownership ever since but has now gone on general . sale for the first time through London antiques dealer Wartski. The item could sell for up to £500,000 given its 'exceptional' provenance and Faberge seal, experts said. Wartski's managing director Geoffrey . Munn, who has appeared on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow, said: 'This is a . truly historic piece and an extraordinary treasure. 'The provenance is quite exceptional and from a time that now seems so remote yet was in an age of the motorcar and electricity. 'The will to revolution was born from this ball and the events that followed it being fired.' 'Truly historic': The shot was recovered by a Russian duke who had it mounted on a gold seal and presented to Tsar Nicholas II as a gift . Nicholas II's grandfather had been assassinated by revolutionary terrorists in 1881, and when he became Tsar in 1894, he used severe measures to subdue resistance movements. But by 1905 he was seen as a weak leader, and on January 19 that year he concluded the grapeshot fired from a cannon was at attempt on his life. This . grapeshot ball is said to have missed him by three feet while another . shattered a window, showering the Tsar's mother, the Dowager Empress, . with splinters of glass.

MILFS: Members of the armed group Moro Islamic Liberation Front take a rest inside a hut as they secure the perimeter to help maintain a peaceful election against other lawless elements in Shariff Aguak, Philippines . But despite the associations that may come with its abbreviated name, MILF is a deadly serious organisation. MILF is a splinter group of Muslim rebels from the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) formed in the 1960s to achieve greater Bangsamoro autonomy in the southern Philippines. It has used terrorist tactics to try and force greater independence on the region and declared a jihad against the government, its citizens and supporters. MILF, which was officially formed in the 1980s, has also been linked to Al Qaeda and a bombing incident in Davao Airport in 2003. In March 2007, the Philippine government offered to recognize the right of self-determination for the Moro people which it had never done in three decades of conflict. The Muslim militant group MILF joins one of many organisations around the world with unfortunate acronyms . But later that year in July, Islamic militants in Basilan in the southern Philippines killed 14 marines. MILF denied responsibility for the murders. This delayed the start of the peace process but MILF and the Philippine government took the first tentative steps last year toward ending one of . Asia's longest-running insurgencies. Both parties signed a . preliminary peace pact with a roadmap to a final peace settlement expected by . 2016. As part of the arrangement, MILF is responsible for maintaining peace on Mindanao island to prevent civil unrest during the congressional and local elections in the Philippines. More than 52 million voters registered to elect 18,000 officials, including half of the 24-member Senate, nearly 300 members of the House of Representatives and leaders of a Muslim autonomous region in the south, where Islamic insurgents and militants are a concern. Task force: MILF is a Muslim rebel group located in the southern Philippines which now has the agreement with the Philippine government to maintain peace in Mindanao island . Despite scattered killings and fears of . fraud, the polls were relatively peaceful as soldiers and police secured . stations in potentially violent areas. The . outcome will determine the level of support for President Benigno . Aquino III's reforms in his remaining three years in office. Aquino has . been praised at home and abroad for cracking down on widespread . corruption, backing key legislation and concluding an initial peace . agreement with Muslim rebels - including MILF. But he cannot run for re-election and a . choice of his successor, who will be expected to continue on the same . reform path, will depend on the new political landscape. Candidates . backed by Aquino are running against a coalition headed by Vice . President Jejomar Binay and deposed President Joseph Estrada. Peace keepers: MILF has helped keep election day violence down to an all time low . Although . officially No. 2 in the country, Binay has emerged as the . administration's rival and may be positioning himself for the 2016 . presidential race. Among 33 senatorial candidates are two of . Aquino's relatives, Binay's neophyte daughter, Estrada's son, a son of . the sitting chamber president, a son of a late president, a spouse and . children of former senators and there's a possibility that two siblings . will be sitting in the same house. Currently, 15 senators have relatives . serving in elective positions. The race for the House is even more . of a family affair. Toppled dictator Ferdinand Marcos' widow, the . flamboyant 83-year-old Imelda, is expected to keep her seat as a . representative for Ilocos Norte province, the husband's birthplace where . the locals kept electing the Marcoses despite allegations of corruption . and abuse during their long rule. Marcos' daughter, Imee is seeking . re-election as governor and the son, Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr., is . already a senator. Boxing star and incumbent Rep. Manny Pacquiao is . running unopposed and building a dynasty of his own: his brother . Rogelio is running to represent his southern district and his wife . Jinkee is vying to become vice-governor for Sarangani province. Estrada, . who was ousted in a 2001 'people power' revolt on corruption . allegations, is running for mayor of Manila, hoping to capitalize on his . movie star popularity, particularly among the poor masses. Philippine . elections have long been dominated by politicians belonging to the same . bloodlines. At least 250 political families have monopolized power . across the country, although such dynasties are prohibited under the . 1987 constitution. Congress - long controlled by members of powerful . clans targeted by the constitutional ban - has failed to pass the law . needed to define and enforce the provision. Geared up: Members of the armed group MILF will continue top patrol throughout the day. The election results will return within the next two days . Critics worry that a single . family's stranglehold on different levels of government could stymie . checks against abuses and corruption. A widely cited example is the 2009 . massacre of 58 people, including 32 media workers, in an ambush blamed . on rivalry between powerful clans in southern Maguindanao province. In . the latest violence, gunmen killed five people and wounded two mayoral . candidates in separate attacks over the weekend. Last month, gunmen . fired on a truck carrying a town mayor and his supporters in southern . Lanao del Norte province, killing 13 people including his daughter. The . 125,000-strong military has helped the government in urging candidates . to shun violence. An army general took off with his troops aboard two . helicopters and dropped leaflets calling for peaceful elections in . Masbate, a central province notorious for political killings.

A former soldier who savagely beat his friend with his own kitchen appliances in a violent two-hour assault has been jailed today. Nigel Heathman invited himself into the home of Martin Gumbrell on Christmas Day and attacked him with plates and bowls before smashing him over the head with a frying pan. Mr Gumbrell passed out several times during the assault, only for Heathman to revive him with cold water so he could continue the attack, Exeter Crown Court heard. The 39-year-old finally struck Mr Gumbrell with the frying pan so hard it bent, before leaving him on the floor of his flat covered in blood. The victim was in the middle of preparing Christmas dinner when an upset and intoxicated Heathman knocked on his door on December 25 last year. Heathman, who had recently split up with his wife of 24 years, was spending his first Christmas away from his four children and had been drinking heavily at lunchtime, the court was told. Mary McCarthy, defending, said Heathman had lost his business in the recession, after which he started drinking heavily. This wrecked his marriage and led to his estrangement from his wife and their four children. He vented his fury on Mr Gumbrell who invited him in to share his Christmas bottle of brandy. Heathman then subjected Mr Gumbrell, who has a long history of anxiety and depression, to the violent assault using bowls, plates and the frying pan. During a four-day trial Mr Gumbrell told the jury how he eventually came round, and fled in bare feet to raise the alarm. He said he had been left with gashes over his head and a deep cut on his scalp where he had been hit by the pan. Heathman claimed the victim had gone berserk and started attacking him for no reason. He said he had gone too far in self-defence but did not intend to cause such serious injury. Jailed: Nigel Heathman was found guilty by a jury at Exeter Crown Court and sentenced to six years in jail . Heathman, of Torquay, denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent but was found guilty by a jury at Exeter Crown Court. He was jailed for six years by Judge Erik Salomonsen, who told him: ‘It was Christmas Day and you knocked on the victim's door so you could enjoy his hospitality. He offered you a drink. ‘You took it upon yourself, for whatever reason, to subject him to a serious, violent and persistent attack. You were the author of all the violence. ‘You attacked him with your fists, you pulled his long hair, some of which you pulled out. You hit him with a heavy ceramic bowl, plates and caused multiple cuts. ‘You struck him with a frying pan with such force, using it like a cleaver, as to bend it. There was blood everywhere in the flat, a flat into which you had been invited and had no right to be. ‘The evidence shows you used water from a bowl to revive him when he became unconscious. This was a persistent and violent attack. ‘The victim still suffers from the effects. He feels unsettled in his own home and was a man who was already suffering from depression and anxiety, which has been increased by the assault.’","Nigel Heathman was invited to his friend's home on Christmas Day .

The report would appear to show that armed forces ministry chief Kim Kyok-sik, reputed to have been behind the 2010 shelling of a South Korean island that killed four people, had been replaced. Kim Kyok-sik himself was only named armed forces minister last November in a move North Korea watchers believed was part of an effort to solidify the grip of North Korea's young leader over the army.

Person of interest: Jeremiah Bean, 25, was arrested on a burglary charge in connection to the Fernely, Nevada, incidents . Detectives investigating a string of five homicides in two northern Nevada counties have made one arrest and believe all the killings are connected, including one at the interstate exit for the Mustang Ranch brothel. A married couple was found dead Monday in a Fernley home about 30 miles east of Reno and another dead man and woman were discovered in a house a few blocks away. Police determined those deaths apparently are tied to a fifth victim who was found in a ditch along the Interstate 80 exit for the infamous brothel just east of Reno. ‘We do believe that from talking to all of our detectives that they are connected,’ Lyon County Undersheriff Albert Torres told KRNV-TV. On Tuesday, Lyon County Sherriff’s Office announced that investigators have arrested 25-year-old Jeremiah Bean, of Fernley, on burglary charges. He is being held on $50,000. According to county officials, Bean had been on parole until December 18, 2012, in connection to an earlier burglary charge. ‘Five people dead in one morning is almost beyond belief,’ Lyon County sheriff Allen Deil said about the attacks in ‘one of Fernley's quieter neighborhoods.’ ‘This is absolutely shocking to us. It is senseless. The people we have talked to, they don't know whether to be paranoid, scared to death, shocked, angry,’ he told reporters at a midday news conference in Fernley. The first dead couple was discovered after firefighters were called to a house on fire on Jessica Lane in Fernley at around 6am Monday. North Lyon County Fire Chief Darryl Cleveland said that someone had deliberately started the fire inside a car parked in the garage of the Jessica Lane home using paper and wood. Slain: An older couple were discovered dead in their home on Jessica Lane in Fernley after firefighters were called to a house on fire . Neighbors killed: Deputies conducting a welfare check found a man and woman dead inside a home on Tamsen Road . Close proximity: The two slain couples lived 100 yards from one another on Tamsen Road and Jessica Lane . About two hours later, Washoe County sheriff’s deputies were called to the Mustang exit with the report of a dead man. KRNV-TV reported that victim was a 52-year-old man from Spanish Springs, a Reno suburb. The . victim worked at the nearby Mustang Market. The owner of the business . said the 52-year-old man was supposed to open the store at 5am, but . failed to show up. A short time later, deputies responding to a call for a welfare check found the other two victims in a home on Tamsen Road within 100 yards of the house where the first two dead were found. ‘This is the most horrific thing I’ve ever seen,’ said Stacee Dickey, a neighbor of the Fernley victims. She said she was acquainted with the husband of one of couples killed and he was friendly and ‘always helping kids.’ ‘Just an all-around nice man,’ she said. Malicious act: Police say someone set fire to paper and wood inside a car parked in the garage of the Jessica Lane residence where a couple were found dead . Third slaying: A 52-year-old man was found in dead a ditch along the Interstate 80 exit for the Mustang Ranch brothel . Speaking to KOLO-TV, . another neighbor, Gary Dolling, described the male victim as a friendly . man who owned several acres nearby and spent most of his time working . on his land. The arrest was made two doors down . from the site of the initial house fire after a homeowner called police . about a man hiding in his garage. At . around 4pm, SWAT team officers surrounded Bean, who initially ran out . the back door but confronted police and tried to run back out the front . of the garage, Torres said. ‘He had some evidence that came from . one of the residences where we had two victims,’ Deil said. ‘He was in . one of those residences where there were two deceased individuals and . had some of their property when he was arrested.’ Criminal history: According to county officials, Bean had been on parole until December 18, 2012, in connection to a burglary charge . By Tuesday afternoon, investigators had collected an ‘exhaustive list of evidence,’ he said. Authorities were searching for possible accomplices and warned residents to be on the lookout for strangers in the area. ‘We're still trying to determine whether we have one or more suspects. There are indications there may be,’ the sheriff said. ‘What we don't want to do is establish some sense of paranoia but we want people to be aware. By all means, lock your doors and windows. ... Notify us in the middle of the night if the dogs start barking.’ Investigators don't believe the killings were gang related and there was no evidence of drugs at either Fernley home, Deil said. Neighbors were helping provide tips to police — ‘things they may have heard during the night, vehicles they had seen,’ he said. ‘Because of the amount of evidence we had collected in at least four different locations, we are very optimistic about being able to bring this to a resolution.’ Authorities have not recovered any firearm or other weapon or instrument that could have been used in the deaths and it's not apparent how the victims died. Autopsies are pending to determine the causes of death. Police were looking for a white pickup truck they believe the man found dead near Mustang was driving — a 1998 GMC Silverado with Nevada plates, 336-UNB. So far, the motive behind the slayings remains unknown, and police have not revealed how exactly they are interconnected.","Jeremiah Bean, 25, was arrested and charged with burglary .

A former health boss was paid £100,000 in 'bonuses' at a hospital that is being investigated for high death rates. Dr Stephen Morgan received two annual £50,000 payments, according to the accounts at Basildon Hospital, Essex - on top of basic pay of £55,000 as medical director and a consultant salary of £110,000. Details of his pay came as it was revealed yesterday that there are thought to have been 2,452 'excess deaths' at the hospital in the past decade. Dr Stephen Morgan, a former health boss was paid £100,000 in 'bonuses' at a hospital that is being investigated for high death rates . The figure was revealed as part of the hospital’s statement of accounts for 2010/11 and 2011/2012, which also showed seven senior managers at the hospital were paid salaries of more than £100,000 for both financial years. The figures have been revealed at a time when Basildon and Thurrock NHS Trust is being investigated for high death rates in the wake of the Stafford Hospital scandal. The hospital has said the payments are not director’s bonuses, but Clinical Excellence Awards (CEA) - which are given to 'recognise . exceptional contribution over and above that normally expected in a job.' A statement added: 'These are payments made to doctors on the instructions of the Department of Health, following a rigorous competitive process. 'He has not left the Trust to go into private practice but is an NHS consultant and Clinical Lead for Renal Services in south west Essex and it is for this work, and his role in helping establish the Essex Cardiothoracic Centre, that he receives CEA. 'Dr Morgan single-handedly founded our renal services in 1995 which is now the largest in Essex. 'Previously renal patients had to travel to London hospitals for dialysis. The Renal Unit has a reputation for excellent care and receives high satisfaction ratings from patients. He received two annual £50,000 payments, according to the accounts at Basildon Hospital, Essex, (pictured) 'CEAs are an element of doctors’ pay, not a director’s bonus, but HM Treasury requires them to be entered under bonuses in the table of directors’ remuneration in the annual accounts.' Eleanor McGrath, campaign manager for Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be shocked by these figures, particularly following recent reports of the hospital’s failings.' Dr Morgan left his post at the hospital last September. Basildon Hospital is one of 14 trusts being invested across the country over death rates between July 2010 and July 2012. The hospital trust said it was working hard to improve its mortality ratio performance. A spokesman said: 'The figures published in the press over the weekend have not been given to us by the Department of Health or Dr Foster. Details of his pay came as it was revealed that there are thought to have been 2,452 'excess deaths' at the hospital in the past decade . 'However, official mortality figures relating to July 2010- June 2012, released by The Information Centre for Health and Social Care, show the Trust’s mortality rates as being higher than expected the figures are still within expected limits for our demographic. 'In a bid to reduce this figure further a Hospital Mortality Group meets every fortnight to discuss and act on specific diagnostic groups where HSMR/SHMI are high and to monitor a mortality reduction programme action plan.

Up to 35,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals could come to Britain next year, according to their ambassadors to the UK. The British Government has repeatedly refused to put a figure on the likely influx from January 1 2014 when border controls must be abandoned. Ministers say it is impossible to predict numbers and fear a repeat of the 2004 debacle when the influx from eight other Eastern European countries was grossly underestimated. Up to 35,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals could come to Britain next year, according to their ambassadors to the UK . But yesterday the Bulgarian Ambassador Konstantin Dimitrov said he expected between eight and ten thousand of his countrymen would come in a single year, and said he regarded that as ‘no major influx’. His Romanian counterpart, Ion Jinga, predicted between 15,000 and 25,000 Romanian arrivals. The number is similar to predictions made by the respected MigrationWatch think tank which put forward a figure of around 50,000. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch said: ‘It’s significant that these ambassadors now recognise that it could be 35,000. That’s at the bottom of our own range but it suggests they are beginning to accept that the numbers could be significant.’ There are currently around 130,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals living in the UK. The ambassadors said their figures were rough estimates, and defended their nations’ contribution to the UK economy. Work restrictions were imposed on the two countries when they joined the EU in 2007 but these must be abandoned next year - allowing all nationals of both countries full access to the UK labour market. Analysis of a BBC Newsnight survey published on Monday suggested the numbers with concrete plans to move to Britain could top 100,000. There are currently around 130,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals living in the UK. The ambassadors said their figures were rough estimates, and defended their nations' contribution to the UK economy . Speaking before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, Mr Jinga said Romanian migrants were young, in good health and not interested in claiming benefits or healthcare. ‘There are more than 4,000 Romanian doctors and nurses in the British NHS, we’ve educated them in our system and they came to work here. ‘In fact we bring in more to your economy than we take out.’ Speaking to Newsnight on Tuesday, the Romanian Prime Minister admitted there was an issue with Romanian criminals in the UK. Victor Ponta said: ‘I am very aware that Romanian citizens have committed, not serious crime, but some of them - Romanians but also representatives of the Roma minority - they are doing the small criminality, begging, stealing cellular phones. ‘I think that first of all we have to co-operate. Our police and law enforcement agencies should keep co-operating very well. On the other hand it is a huge challenge and a big concern for my government to implement the strategies for integration of the Roma communities.’","Government has refused to put a figure on the likely influx from January 1 .

Under the new regime, all councils have to come up with local plans, which include a target for the number of homes to be built over the next few years. Critic: Tory MP Douglas Carswell criticised the Government's new planning regime for 'riding roughshod' over local councils . However, before they can become operative they have to be signed off by an inspector by the Planning Inspectorate. The system replaced the ‘regional special strategies’, plans which covered a wider area and which were introduced by Labour. Planning consultancy Nathaniel Lichfield & Partners has looked at all 55 local plans examined or submitted for examination in the year since the National Planning Policy Framework was introduced. Shockingly, 44 per cent of the plans that passed examination by the Planning Inspectorate had to raise their submitted housing targets in order to be found sound, reported Planning magazine. Last night Douglas Carswell, Conservative MP for Clacton, said: ‘If the council decides it wants more homes, I’m not against them. But it should be entirely up to them, not central government. ‘I do not understand why the Government feels it has to ride roughshod over local councils and impose new targets on them. This is the sort of thing I would have expected John Prescott to have done.’ Fiona Howie, head of planning at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘This seems to clearly contradict the commitment in the Coalition Agreement, and oft repeated at that, to abolish top-down  decision-making and return  powers on housing and planning to local councils.’","Local planning proposals have to increase housing targets to get signed off .

Controversy: Bishop of Grantham Tim Ellis has expressed concern over such a lavish funeral for so divisive a figure as Baroness Thatcher . The bishop of Baroness Thatcher’s home town has joined her political opponents in questioning the cost of her funeral. The Rt Rev Dr Tim Ellis, Bishop of Grantham, described the scale of the event as a ‘mistake’. Yesterday, Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander said he would prefer to see a simpler funeral, while former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott suggested the occasion should be privatised. And Lord Ashdown, the Lib Dem elected leader of his party during Lady Thatcher’s final years in power, also said he would prefer something ‘more simple’. Dr Ellis said the ceremonial event, costing up to £10million, was ‘asking for trouble’ amid divisions over the late prime minister’s legacy. The Anglican bishop added: ‘I think that in a context where there is manifestly great ill-feeling about her tenure and about her legacy, to then actually have a situation where we seem to be expecting the nation to glorify that with a £10million funeral... I think any sensible person would say that that is asking for trouble. ‘It plays into the hands of  those more extreme people  who will use the funeral as an opportunity to promote certain political views. I think it was probably a mistake.’ But Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘He’s completely wrong and it seems particularly bizarre that of all the people to take this view, it’s the Bishop of Grantham. He’s using his position in the Church of England to basically put forward his own political views.’ And Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: ‘The arrangements for the funeral have been agreed by the Queen, who is the head of the Church of England. It is not for a bishop to call that into question.’ Dr Tim Ellis fears the cost of the funeral will play into the hands of those who despise her legacy . Members of the military rehearse at Wellington Barracks in Central London for former PM Margaret Thatcher's funeral procession on Wednesday . Meanwhile, Lord Prescott suggested the 13,000 millionaires who benefited from the Government’s cut in the top rate of tax should each contribute £770 to pay for it. ‘Privatise her funeral. It would be a fitting tribute,’ he added. Mr Alexander called for a debate to be held over the appropriate arrangements for when a prime minister dies, and said: ‘I’m a Presbyterian, I would, by inclination, err towards something rather more simple than what we will see, but my sense is this is not the week to be having those discussions.’ Lord Ashdown said: ‘I have to say something just as solemn but a little more simple might be better.’","Bishop of Grantham says the ceremony is 'asking for trouble'

If you've had ever a problem with your weight, a school canteen - where you'll be surrounded by chips, apple crumble and creamy custard - is probably the last place you'd want to work. But that hasn't stopped Russell Robinson, a former morbidly obese forklift truck driver who once weighed a scale-cracking 35 stone, from getting a job as a school chef. The 43-year-old father-of-four started his new job after losing a colossal 22 stone - excess weight he . piled on after losing both his job and his wife. The once morbidly obese driver from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, used to drink up to 40 pints a week and gorged on takeaways. He felt so self-conscious of his bulk - which he attempted to shroud in size XXXXXXL T-shirts (made for him at a specialist shop) that he could barely leave the house. Russell started piling on the pounds in . 1998 after splitting up with his wife and mother of his two daughters, . Paige, now 20, and Megan, 18. He quickly went from 15 stone to morbidly obese. He . developed the life-threatening condition sleep apnoea, which meant he . stopped breathing up to 50 times a night because of his colossal build. Having . failed miserably on different diets, Russell turned to his doctor as a . last-ditch attempt to fight the flab. He was told he was eligible for a . gastric bypass on the NHS and has now slimmed down to a trim 13 stone. Now, . Russell has a new job as a school chef and has even found love with a . new partner. He said: 'My life was a mess. I didn't feel like doing . anything. 'I couldn't afford . to buy fruit and vegetables so I ate c***. I didn't really go to the . pub but I'd drink can after can of lager at home. 'I . didn't own a pair of scales and had no idea how much I weighed. It was . terribly embarrassing. I'd go into the canteen at work and hear people's . snide remarks.' Regular shops didn't stock his size so he had to buy his clothes from specialist stockists. Russell, who works at Filey Secondary . School, North Yorkshire, said: 'I just fell into this cycle and couldn't . get out of it. I missed my kids and felt really depressed. 'I . was eating all the wrong things. I ate foods like Chinese take aways, . burgers, pizzas and chocolate. I just loved my food and it was my only . comfort really.' Hard at work: Russel working in the school kitchen at his new job . After another relationship, he went on . to have another two daughters, Imogen, nine, and Nuala, eight, but when . that failed in 2007, his problems with his weight only got worse. His weight rose to more than 35 stone, and his BMI was critically high at 72.9 - more than three times what it should be. Russ also developed sleep apnoea, . which causes sufferers to stop breathing in their sleep, diabetes, leg . ulcers, high blood pressure - all caused by him being severely . overweight. He said: 'I wasn't sleeping properly . so would nap when I felt like it. I lost interest in everything. I used . to like going fishing and shooting game but I didn't feel like doing . anything. 'Exercise was a . no-no because of my size. My mum was really concerned. She kept . pestering me to do something about it. I tried lots of fad diets and . even slimming pills. All they did was give me a bad tummy.' Out of desperation, Russell turned to his GP for help who agreed he was a suitable candidate for weight loss surgery. Russell opted to have the operation at Spire Leeds Hospital after reading about the surgeon's high success rate. Back in the day: Russell pictured before his gastric bypass . The long wait: Russell waiting for his NHS gastric bypass . He was put on a strict diet to help shrink his liver and managed to almost a stone. In . February 2011, he had a gastric bypass operation, which involved . re-routing the digestive system past most of his stomach. Russell has . since lost 90 per cent of his excess weight and now has a more healthier . BMI of 29. He now works as a chef, making lunch for the school's students and staff but he says being around food is not a problem. Russell said: 'I know what to eat and am now more careful about the choice of food I eat. 'My . diet is much healthier, more fruit, high fibre and wholegrain foods. I . have to take food in smaller quantities so it's important to make sure . every calorie is nutritious. 'I'm smaller now than when I got married. Sometimes it's hard to believe it.' Me at last: Russell now weighs just 13 stone and says he finally feels himself, and his children say they finally have their father back . We could both get in! Russell and his current partner Sarah hold up a pair of his enormous old trousers . Russell has been dating partner Sarah Cooper, 41, for five months and they are now planning to move in together. Russell said: 'Before surgery, I'd practically become a recluse. I wasn't comfortable with myself and the way I looked. 'I'd known Sarah for years through her sister. She knew me when I was big before my operation. 'She's not superficial and says she'd love me whatever weight I was but it definitely gave me the confidence to talk to her. 'Life is brilliant now. I've got my motorbike licence. I'd not been able to get on a bike before because I was so big. 'I do so much more with the kids. I love taking them camping or for long walks. They say they've got their Dad back.'Russell is now hoping to get funding for another operation to remove his excess skin.

Huge pension pot: Ian Marchant (pictured) will get nearly £400,000 a year from the company when he leaves SSE in the summer . The man in charge of one of Britain's biggest energy firms will receive an annual pension pot of £400,000 despite the company being found guilty of ripping off one million customers. Ian Marchant will get the payout worth up to £9million after 10 years of working at the helm of SSE which has been hit with a £10.5million fine following an investigation by energy regulator Ofgem. Marchant, chief executive of the company, was paid just over £1million last year with a £158,000 'cash incentive' on top of his basic salary of £840,000. There have also been calls for the rest of the company’s management team to be sacked. On a day of shame for the power industry, SSE was attacked for ‘failing its customers’ through ruthless ‘mis-selling’, either on people’s doorsteps, over the telephone or on the high street. Hundreds of thousands of new . customers were attracted to switch from other suppliers at the height of . the racket – which lasted for three years – and many ended up paying . higher tariffs. While the fine is the largest-ever . handed out by Ofgem, it is a tiny fraction of the company’s profits. Last year, it made annual pre-tax profits of £1.3billion. As MPs and consumer groups said the scandal was ‘fraud’ and required a police investigation, it emerged that: . Scroll down for video . SSE headquarters in Perth has been handed the largest ever penalty imposed on an energy provider . Barry Gardiner, a Labour MP who also . sits on the energy select committee, said: ‘The activities that SSE have . engaged in appear to be nothing short of fraud. It would be appropriate . for the regulator to refer this matter for further investigation by the . police.’ Michael Fallon, the Energy Minister, said he had ‘rarely seen a . worse case of consumers being misled so badly’. Ofgem launched a probe in 2010 amid . claims families, pensioners and other victims were encouraged to switch . from their energy provider to SSE, lured by the prospect of saving . money. But in fact they were switching to a . deal with the company, formerly known as Scottish & Southern Energy, . which was ‘more expensive’. Pensioners Frank and Maureen Price, from . Rotherham, told how they were left with huge debts after being persuaded . to switch to SSE by a door-to-door salesman. Energy watchdog Ofgem said it found 'failures at every stage of the sales process' across SSE's telephone, in-store and doorstep selling activities . The couple were told they would make . substantial savings but have ended up paying hundreds of pounds extra . every year after their tariff more than doubled from £61 a month to . £158. Mr Price, 83, described their ordeal . as ‘distressing’ saying they can no longer afford to go on holiday and . have had to cut out all luxuries. In another case, a woman, who was . paying £1,600 a year for her energy bill, was told her bill would drop . to £1,423. In fact, it jumped to £1,734. Sarah Harrison, senior partner at . Ofgem, said: ‘SSE failed its customers, mis-sold to them and undermined . trust in the energy supply industry.’ Ofgem said SSE’s doorstep sales team . was managed by people who ‘received a commission on sales’. It said they . ‘therefore had a financial interest in not reporting misbehaviour’. Yesterday SSE said it has written to . around 970,000 of its customers who might have been misled into signing . up as an energy customer. It has set aside a compensation pot of around . £5million, and has already paid out around £400,000. The average payout . is around £65. Other customers who suspect that they . might also have been duped into switching to SSE were yesterday urged . to get in touch with the company with their grievance. SSE, based in Perth, said it was . ‘deeply regretful’ of its actions, which Ofgem said began in 2009 and . ended in September last year. Adam Scorer, director of policy at . Consumer Focus, said: ‘This is not a case of one bad apple. The problems . at SSE…represent a fundamental failure.’ Ofgem said it had decided against . referring the matter to the police because it had not found evidence SSE . had deliberately intended to mis-sell to its customers. Luciana Berger, the shadow minister . for climate change, said: ‘It would be completely unacceptable for the . energy bosses responsible for this scandal to get any kind of bonus when . SSE announce their financial results later this year.’ Tory MP Peter Lilley added: ‘If I were a shareholder, I would be very surprised if the top management remained in place.’ An M&S Energy spokesman said the . scandal has affected ‘less than one per cent of M&S Energy . customers.’ Unlike the majority of its rivals, SSE remains a . British-owned energy giant and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.","Millionaire chief executive will leave this summer with massive payout .

A primary school teacher attempted to rape a young girl and sexually assaulted seven other pupils, a court heard. John Alway, 60, of Bradley Stoke, Bristol, is said to have touched all the children, the youngest of whom was nine, over a seven-year period while he was working as a supply teacher. He allegedly attempted to rape one youngster as he pinned her down naked in a locked classroom, Bristol Crown Court heard. He initially stood trial in June but the case was halted when five more complainants came forward after reading newspaper reports of the trial. Alway, who worked as a substitute teacher at a number of schools in and around Bristol, denies the 23 charges against him. He has pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted rape and 22 sexual assaults against eight girls between 1997 and 2004. Prosecutor Ian Fenny told jurors that police were brought in after one youngster told her mother that Alway was 'squidging' her bottom. But despite her mother telling her daughter to demand Alway stop, the abuse continued, the court heard. Mr Fenny said: 'The mother realised she had to do something. She didn't know what to do. She was aware that the teacher had been alone with her daughter in class. 'The last straw for the mum was when her daughter came home happy and pleased. On that day she wasn't touched by her teacher, John Alway.' Mr Fenny said the mother complained about Alway to the south Gloucestershire school in 2004 and an investigation followed. Alway, seen here arriving at Bristol Crown Court, is alleged to have assaulted girls as young as nine . Police were called in but, due to a lack of additional evidence, no prosecution was brought, it was said. In July 2010 a former pupil of Alway from a school in south Bristol also made a complaint against the teacher. Mr Fenny said: 'Her allegation was more serious, but bore real similarities. She said John Alway touched her during lunchtime. 'He got her to sharpen pencils, he sat her on his lap and he kissed and cuddled her. 'She recalled he ran his clammy hands down her back and squeezed her bottom. It happened a number of times.' The jury was told Alway progressed to lying the youngster on the floor and touching her private parts. John Alway's first trial at Bristol Crown Court, right, was halted when further complainants came forward . On one occasion he stripped her naked and lay on top of her but stopped what he was doing when he was disturbed by a knock on the classroom door. Mr Fenny told the court police tied the new complaint to the first girl's allegation, along with allegations from a third girl which supported them. Alway said he did not know one of the girls and insisted any touching of others was entirely unintentional. A trial followed at Bristol Crown Court in June last year but was stopped when more complainants came forward after they read newspaper reports of the case. Mr Fenny said: 'Cases such as this are a legitimate source of public concern and interest. The press were present. The Bristol press reported, in the local newspaper, the trial. 'They did not name the complainants but are entitled to publish the name of the defendant, and they did. 'In 2004, John Alway had a narrow escape.  In 2010, the skeletons came rattling out of the cupboard.' - Prosecutor Ian Fenny . 'When they did that, another young woman heard of the report and knew that they too had been the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of John Alway and so they came forward. All of a sudden we had five additional complainants.' The jury heard three pupils at a north Bristol school recounted how Alway touched them improperly. One claimed she was locked in a cupboard before being released and hugged by him and another said it happened on a school trip. The third girl said Alway touched her bottom and made inappropriate comments about her physical development. Two former pupils from another school in south Gloucestershire said the teacher touched their backsides and made one feel sick at the thought of going to school. Mr Fenny said: 'In 2004 John Alway had a narrow escape. In 2010 the skeletons came rattling out of the cupboard.' The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","John Alway, 60, allegedly touched pupils when working as supply teacher .

The officers, armed with automatic weapons, were taking no chances as they entered the property in the sleepy neighbourhood of Corinth, Mississippi. Curtis is suspected of sending letters containing deadly poison ricin to President Obama and to Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker. Raid: Armed federal agents wearing hazardous material suits and breathing apparatus enter the West Hills Subdivision home of Paul Kevin Curtis in Corinth, Mississippi . Target: Law enforcement officials blocked off the property yesterday after taking Curtis into custody under suspicion of sending letters covered in ricin to the President Barack Obama and Senator Roger Wicker . Hazard: The heavily-armed agents were fully equipped for the operation at Curtis's home where he was arrested on Wednesday . The agents were carefully washed down and their weapons and other gear bagged up after the raid in case of contamination. Senator Wicker has revealed he has had one encounter already with the Elvis impersonator . charged with trying to poison him and the president. Speaking with reporters on Thursday, he said that he met Curtis once, and described him as ‘very entertaining.’ Curtis, who believed he had . uncovered a conspiracy to sell human body parts on the black market and . sometimes performed as an Elvis Presley impersonator was arrested on Wednesday. Charged: Curtis is suspected of sending letters containing ricin to President Barack Obama and Senator Wicker . He . is accused of sending ricin-laced letters this week to the President . and to Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, that arrived . just one day after the deadly bombings in Boston. Curtis had previously sent letters to Sen. Wicker and officials from his office alerted . authorities about the frequency of his correspondence when the suspicious letter was found. The . suspect was originally identified by federal sources as Kenneth Curtis . of Tupelo, Mississippi, according to local media reports. It is not known if . Curtis has used Kenneth as an alias. An . affidavit shows the letters sent to Obama and Wicker both warned their . intended recipients: 'Maybe I have your attention now, even if that . means that someone must die.' Curtis is 'believed to be responsible . for the mailings of the three letters which contained a granular substance that . preliminarily tested positive for ricin,' the FBI said in a statement. Investigators with the Secret Service . and the FBI are using the Lee County Sheriff’s Department, in Tupelo, . as a staging area for their investigation, according to The . Clarion-Ledger. It is not clear where the suspect is being held. His . former wife, Laura Curtis, told reporters that her ex-husband makes a . living by impersonating the King at various functions, including church . events and birthday parties, the Wall Street Journal reported. She . told the paper that the message: ‘To see a wrong and not expose it, is . to become a silent partner to its continuance,’ which appears on both . the letter addressed to Obama and to Sen. Wicker, is his ‘favorite . saying.’ Laura Curtis told the Journal that . the two of them were married for a decade and divorced in 2002. They . have four children together. ‘I can’t imagine him doing this,’ she said. Last night Ricky Curtis, who said he was Kevin . Curtis' cousin, said the family was shocked by the news of the arrest. He described his cousin as a 'super entertainer' who impersonated Elvis . and numerous other singers. 'We're all in shock. I don't think . anybody had a clue that this kind of stuff was weighing on his mind,' Ricky Curtis said in a telephone interview. Elvis: Curtis is known to have performed as a professional Elvis impersonator using the stage name KC. He is seen here singing in a image take from a video on You Tube . Clean up: The agents have their clothes cleaned in case of chemical exposure outside the property. All suits and gear, including weapons were placed in hazardous materials bags for an extensive cleanup . Bagged: An armed federal agent collects the hazardous material suits and breathing apparatus. The level of care taken shows the potential dangers they faced during the operation . Ricky Curtis said his cousin had . written about problems he had with a cleaning business and that he felt . the government had not treated him well, but he said nobody in the . family would have expected this. He said the writings were titled . Missing Pieces. A Facebook account entitled Kevin Curtis Live (KC), which is believed to be that of the suspect, contains rants about a body parts conspiracy. One, posted on Tuesday, said: 'I'm on the hidden front lines of a secret war. A war that is making Billions of dollars for corrupt mafia related organizations and people. (bone, tissue, organ, body parts harvesting black market) when we lay our loved ones to rest.... 'My mother wants me to SHUT UP. My brothers fear me. My sister hates me. My cousins have hostility towards me (they work in healthcare) I have lost most of my friends. I have spent more than $130,000.00 on legal fees in 13.5 yrs. 'They burned down my home, killed my dogs, my cat, my rabbit, blew up my 1966 Plymouth Valent. They destroyed my marriage, they distracted my career, they stalked, they trolled, they came in to my home, took my computers, had me arrested 22 times and guess what? I am still a thorn in their corrupt a****!' Armed: The agents were taking no chances when they entered the property following Curtis's arrest. The raid, and Curtis' arrest have shocked residents of the normally sleepy Mississippi neighbourhood . Alert: The alleged ricin plot and the Boston bombings have left the US on a high state of alert. Officers can be seen here handing in their weapons to be bagged up . On the same day he posted a photograph of a revolver, with the comment 'say hello to my little friend'. The page's author wrote that he was . trying to 'expose various parties within the government, FBI, police . departments' for what he believed was 'a conspiracy to ruin my . reputation in the community as well as an ongoing effort to break down . the foundation I worked more than 20 years to build in the country music . scene.' Ricky Curtis said his cousin, a martial arts fan, ran a cleaning business, believed to be called The Cleaning Crew. He . added: 'As far as him being anti-government, I'm not going to say that, . but he had some issues with some stuff that happened with his cleaning . business.' Online posts refer to a conspiracy Curtis alleges he uncovered when working at a local hospital between 1998-2000, when he says he stumbled upon: 'a refrigerator full of dismembered body parts & organs wrapped in plastic in the morgue of the largest non-metropolitan healthcare organization in the United States of America.' On Tuesday there was a Facebook post linking to an article about a charity initiative, with the comment: 'This is KC & I approve this concept!' The two letters mailed to Washington, DC were both intercepted at a . mail screening facility in Maryland on Tuesday and initial tests found . the pieces of mail contained the toxic component that can be fatal when . ingested. Both letters sent to the politicians contained the same message, ‘To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.’ They also had the same signature that read: ‘I am KC and I approve this message.’ The letters contained a Memphis postmark and had no return address. Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the ricin found in the letters was 'low grade' and 'less than one percent toxin.' The FBI has said there is no obvious link between the letters, postmarked on April 8, and the deadly bombings in Boston on Monday. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri said on Wednesday spoke to the press about the investigation into the letter writer and said the person in question 'writes a lot of letters to (Congress) members.' A suspicious letter was also reportedly sent to Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, at his office in Saginaw, Michigan but there was no information if the letter tested positive for the toxic substance. Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, has also reported a suspicious letter. A . second letter containing a granular substance that preliminarily tested . positive for ricin was received at an offsite mail screening facility. The . envelope, addressed to the President, was immediately quarantined by . U.S. Secret Service personnel, and a coordinated investigation with the . FBI was initiated. It is important to note that operations at the White . House have not been affected as a result of the investigation. Additionally, . filters at a second government mail screening facility preliminarily . tested positive for ricin this morning. Mail from that facility is being . tested. Any time . suspicious powder is located in a mail facility, field tests are . conducted. The field and other preliminary tests can produce . inconsistent results. Any time field tests indicate the possibility of a . biological agent, the material is sent to an accredited laboratory for . further analysis. Only . a full analysis performed at an accredited laboratory can determine the . presence of a biological agent such as ricin. Those tests are currently . being conducted and generally take 24 to 48 hours. The . investigation into these letters remains ongoing, and more letters may . still be received. There is no indication of a connection to the attack . in Boston.","Images show FBI officers in body armour raiding home of Paul Kevin Curtis, 45 in Corinth, Mississippi .

Mr Johnson’s intervention comes after two Tory Cabinet ministers said they would vote to leave the EU if a referendum was held now. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Education Secretary Michael Gove broke ranks to publicly say they favoured withdrawal, with up to seven more senior ministers also wanting to exit. David Cameron has promised that if he is Prime Minister after the 2015 election he would renegotiate a new settlement with Brussels, before staging an in-out referendum. However pressure is mounting on the Premier to bring forward legislation sooner to firm up his commitment. David Cameron is in Washington for talks with US President Barack Obama, but the trip has been overshadowed by questions over Tory splits back home over Europe . Some Tory MPs want a referendum before 2015, but their Lib Dem coalition partners are opposed. On Wednesday up to 100 Conservative backbenchers are expected to back a motion criticising the Queen’s Speech for failing to commit to a referendum, in an unprecedented revolt. Mr Cameron will miss the vote because he is on a visit to the United States. Mr Johnson said he supported Mr Cameron’s plan, but added: ‘I personally back legislation now to make sure that referendum goes ahead.’ Should David Cameron bring forward the EU referendum? In his Daily Telegraph column . he added: ‘If we left the EU, we would end this sterile debate, and we . would have to recognise that most of our problems are not caused by . “Bwussels”, but by chronic British short-termism, inadequate management, . sloth, low skills, a culture of easy gratification and under-investment . in both human and physical capital and infrastructure.’ Mr . Johnson said Mr Cameron will only be able to extract concession from . Brussels if there is a realistic prospect of Britain quitting . altogether. 'This . renegotiation can only work if we understand clearly what we want to . achieve: a pared-down relationship based on free trade and cooperation,' he added. 'And our partners will only take us seriously if they think we will invoke Article 50, and pull out, if we fail to get what we want. If we are going to have any chance of success in the negotiations, we need to show that the UK is willing to walk away.' However, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Cameron faced an 'issue of trust' over his commitment to overhaul Britain's relationship with Europe. He said the Tories made a 'cast iron' promise top hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, which had not happened. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the Tories face an 'issue of trust' over Europe . Mr Farage said: 'No parliament can bind its successor. Even if a piece of legislation was passed in this parliament to say there would be a referendum in the next parliament that has no force of law whatsoever. 'The real problem is that Mr Cameron made a promise a few years ago, he said ‘I give you this cast iron guarantee that if I become prime minister there’ll be a referendum on the Lisbon treaty’ and he didn’t deliver. The real problem that the Conservative party have got with him is an issue of trust, people really don’t believe he intends to deliver,' he told Sky News. 'This is merely an attempt to kick the issue into the long grass to neutralise the European question at the next general election and to try to get UKIP off the Conservative party’s back. It won’t work. I don’t want to wait for up to five years to have a referendum on something as fundamentally important as this.' Senior Tory ministers upped the ante by calling saying they would back withdrawal if a referendum was held now. Exit strategy: Education Secretary Michael Gove (left) and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond both said they would vote for Britain to leave Europe if there was a referendum tomorrow . Asked whether he thought Britain should leave the EU if there were a referendum today, Mr Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘Yes, I’m not happy with our position in the European Union. But my preference is for a change in Britain’s relationship with the European Union. ‘My ideal is what the majority of the British public’s ideal is, which is to recognise the current situation is no good, to say that life outside would be perfectly tolerable, we could contemplate it, there would be certain advantages. 'But the best deal for Europe, and for Britain, would be if Britain were to lead the change that Europe needs.’ ‘My own view is, let the Prime Minister lay out our negotiating strategy, make sure he has a majority – which I am convinced he will secure at the next election – and let’s have the referendum then.' After Mr Gove’s interview, Mr Hammond, asked on . the BBC’s Pienaar’s Politics radio programme whether he would vote to . leave the EU as things stand, replied: ‘Yes, because I believe that we . have to negotiate a better solution that works better for Britain if we . are going to stay in and play a part in the European Union in the . future. ‘But let me be absolutely clear: I think it is defeatist to sort of say we want to leave the European Union. Today Tory MP Gavin Barwell, Mr Gove's parliamentary aide, said he would be voting for the amendment to the Queen's Speech expressing 'regret' at the absence of a referendum. 'I completely support the policy that was set out by the Prime Minister in January but what we need to do is to convince a sceptical electorate that we actually mean it,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'The electorate at the moment doesn't have a great deal of trust in politicians in general and many people feel they have been promised referenda in the past and they haven't happened. 'So this isn't an issue about Conservative MPs trusting David Cameron. It's about using the legislative process to convince the electorate that the clear commitment he gave in his speech is going to happen.' But Conservative former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind attacked the 'poor judgment' of the leaders of the rebellion. 'Sometimes it is necessary to split your party on a great issue of principle but to split your party on an issue of tactics seems to me pretty odd,' he told BBC Radio 4. 'What they are doing is putting the Prime Minister in an impossible situation. He cannot simply vote for this amendment because it would split the Coalition down the middle. At the same time, the motion cannot win because there is not a parliamentary majority for it.'","London Mayor backs Cameron's renegotiation plan but calls for early  legislation to guarantee in-out referendum .

A Scottish hospital has introduced a shopping trolley style coin unlocking system on wheelchairs – to force people to bring them back. Raigmore Hospital in Inverness is thought to be the first in Scotland to bring in the controversial new system, which is commonly used by supermarkets to stop shoppers stealing trolleys. While the hospital says there is no issue with patients stealing wheelchairs, it claims that often there are not enough of them available at the entrances because people tend to abandon them in various wards  and departments throughout the building. Controversial: Raigmore Hospital in Inverness has introduced a shopping trolley style coin unlocking system on wheelchairs - to force people to bring them back . But last night, the Scotland Patients Association condemned the move – pointing out that there was a huge difference between a supermarket and an NHS hospital dealing with the elderly, sick and infirm. Chairman Margaret Watt said: ‘I find it quite obscene. We are dealing with sick people here. Patients are worried enough when they arrive at hospitals. I don’t think they need any added problems.’ Several hospitals in England have recently introduced the coin slot scheme, claiming that, in some cases, patients had tried to make off with wheelchairs. Stafford Hospital, which was among the first to roll out the deposit system, said it had 20 chairs, worth £600 each, stolen over the past four years. Money slots: The hospital claims that often there are not enough wheelchairs available at the entrances because people tend to abandon them in various wards and departments throughout the building . Critics, however, claimed that the loss of £1 would hardly act as a deterrent to a patient determined to take a wheelchair. 'When people were coming in to outpatients, or our main entrance to the inpatient ward areas, there were no wheelchairs available' Donna Smith, Raigmore Hospital . Edinburgh Royal Infirmary looked at introducing a similar scheme a decade ago after neighbours complained about wheelchairs being dumped in their gardens but the proposal was later dropped. Raigmore spokesman Donna Smith said: ‘We received a lot of patient and visitor feedback that when people were coming in to outpatients, or our main entrance to the inpatient ward areas, there were no wheelchairs available. Decision: Raigmore Hospital (pictured) said patients and visitors told them 'that when people were coming in to outpatients, or our main entrance to the inpatient ward areas, there were no wheelchairs available' ‘As a result, we invested in new wheelchairs that are located at our two main entrances. They require a token or a pound coin to use, which can be redeemed when returned. 'I find it quite obscene. We are dealing with sick people here' Margaret Watt, Scotland Patients Association chairman . ‘Our reception desk in outpatients also has spare tokens if the patient or visitor needs one or in case of an emergency.’ But Mrs Watt said: ‘Why can’t they get a porter to return the wheelchairs to where they are meant to be? That is something a hospital employee could be asked to do. ‘It would have been much better if they had tried to solve this problem without putting more pressure on the patient.’","Raigmore Hospital in Inverness brings in controversial new system .

He has more than 160 burglaries on his record . Britain's most prolific house burglar who targeted vulnerable elderly people by un-pegging their washing before he sneaked into their homes has been jailed for six years. One man crime-wave Christopher Harrison, 30, has a record of 160 burglaries and 70 attempted burglaries over a 17-year career. After early release from a four-and-a half-year prison sentence for 143 burglaries, Wilson toured East Yorkshire from Mappleton to Howden from January 13 to April 3 this year looking for pensioner's homes. Harrison burgled ten homes in East Yorkshire and ten in Hull. He has targeted 200 homes in his career- and dozens of cars. He was stealing to feed his heroin habit and has been breaking into people homes since he was 13. Harrison's favourite distraction method was to un-peg washing. When women went out to pin it back on the line, Harrison would sneak-in and grab their hand bags. Edna Pollock, 87, lives alone in a semi-detached pensioner's bungalow in Clarondale, Hull. On February 1 this year she found her washing laid out on the grass in her back garden. While she went out to pin it back up Harrison went in her bedroom and stole her bank card. She had so little faith in the police she did not even report it. In a victim impact statement, she said: 'I feel very frail and I cannot sleep. I have been unwell and this incident has made me worse. 'At night, I'm kept awake by any noise and am terrified someone is in my home. I live alone and since this burglary it has made me a lot less confident. 'The fact an intruder has been in my house disgusts me. I do not feel safe and I should not feel this way in my own home.' Morris Nicholson, 78, from Hull, was burgled by Harrison as he pruned his roses in the garden. Harrison was seen to crouch down in a neighbour's bush waiting for Mr Nicholson to turn his back. Harrison ran in the house and stole a door key. A neighbour called the police and Harrison was caught nearby. Mr Nicholson said: 'Due to what happened I now feel more vulnerable and nervous in my own home. I feel he will come back.' Hull Crown Court heard Harrison toured East Yorkshire from Mappleton to Howden from January 13 to April 3 this year looking for pensioner's homes . Jailing Harrison yesterday, Judge Mark . Bury said: 'You have a horrid record for house burglary. Between 1996 . and 2011 you appeared before the courts for 16 house burglaries, but . have a schedule of 144 further offences to be taken into consideration. 'You seem to target elderly people, judging by the names of your victims. There are not many young people called Marjorie, Dorothy and Joan. 'You have now admitted two further burglaries and admitted 33 further burglaries on a schedule and seven offences of theft. There comes a point under Operation Clean Slate when you must be sentenced for what you have done. You are a career house burglar.' 'You have a horrid record for house burglary.' Judge Mark . Bury . Crown barrister Jane Bryan told Hull Crown Court Harrison's crime spree included Mona Nightingale's home in Full Sutton on January 29 where he sneaked in and stole a handbag one of 10 burglaries in the East Riding. There were four schedules of offences including shop thefts. Harrison, of Hull, appeared at Hull Crown Court for sentence after pleading guilty to two burglaries and asking for 33 burglaries and seven thefts to be taken into consideration. The court heard he was jailed for four and a half years in 2011 for a house burglary asking for 144 offences to be taken into consideration - 127 of which were burglaries and 70 attempted burglaries. In 2011 he took advantage of Humberside Police's Operation Clean Slate - to boost their clear up figures for crime and gain a one third reduction on sentence. He broke into cars as well as homes. Harrison made use of Operation Clean Slate and the early guilty plea scheme in April this year for a further discount to escape more jail time. Defence barrister Richard Thompson said: 'He took advantage of Operation Clean Slate last time. He has not mended his ways. Some of these offences go back to 2004. He has a drug habit. 'He has shown remorse. Unfortunately at the time of these offences, he was not able to prioritise his victim's interests above his own.' Judge Bury said he was obliged to give him a one third discount, but added if he had fought a trial he would have jailed him for nine years. Harrison was jailed for six years.","Christopher Harrison, 30, has a record of 160 burglaries .

Wanted: The carjacker is wanted by police after stealing an Audi A4 and tossing out its pensioner passenger . A carjacker drove off with an 83-year-old woman in the passenger seat - then pushed her out of the moving vehicle, police have said. The victim was sitting in the couple's Audi A4 outside a newsagent's while her 88-year-old husband was in the shop. A man suddenly climbed into the driver's side and drove the car away. The alarm was raised when a customer ran into the shop telling the victim's husband: 'Your wife's been kidnapped.' The couple's son said his parents had been left 'mortified' by the incident on Coal Clough Lane in Burnley, Lancashire. He said his mother was taken to hospital and treated for shock and minor injuries. Police have released CCTV images of a man they want to trace. The car, a £7,000 blue Audi A4, was stolen along with possessions the couple were carrying upon their return from a weekend away. Their son, a retired police officer who asked to remain anonymous to protect the safety of his shaken parents, said: 'I am absolutely seething. 'They are an old couple and they are really shaken up by all this. Every time I talk to my mum she just starts crying. 'They are very upset and frightened, and my dad is very confused. He feels as if he is at fault and it has certainly knocked him back. 'They have lived in Burnley all their lives and they think the streets are paved with gold. They love Burnley, but this goes to show that there are some really evil people here.' The incident took place at around 8.40am on Sunday, April 7 when the car was parked outside Coal Clough News. Police have only just released the details. The woman was sitting in the front passenger seat, with the key in the ignition, when a man climbed in. Shocking: The incident, earlier this month, happened outside this Burnley newsagents . The carjacker then repeatedly ordered her to get out of the moving car, before slowing down, pushing her out of the door and driving off. The victims' son, 53, said: 'Dad had just called in to get his Sunday newspapers when another customer ran back into the shop and told him: ""Your wife's been kidnapped"". 'He rushed outside and the car and mum were both gone. You can imagine how terrified he was. 'The car had gone so far down the road he couldn't see my mum. Luckily, her physical injuries aren't too bad but mentally it has scarred them.' DC Russ Hilton, from Lancashire Police's Pennine Target Team, said: 'This is a shocking crime against an elderly, retired couple who have simply called into a local shop for a Sunday paper. 'The 83-year-old victim was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital and treated for shock. Fortunately she only suffered minor injuries. 'I'd ask people to take a close look at the CCTV images and if they recognise the man or have any information that could assist with our investigation to get in touch. 'The man in the CCTV has entered the newsagents prior to the offence stating he was going to get a train back to Manchester so it is likely he is not local. He is described as scruffy and gaunt in appearance with a very pronounced nose.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:23 EST, 25 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:23 EST, 25 March 2013 . Economic advisers to the German government more than halved their forecast for 2013 growth today, blaming a sharp fourth-quarter contraction and weak prospects for foreign trade and investment. The advisers, known in Germany as the 'wise men', predicted the economy would almost grind to a halt this year, growing just 0.3 per cent compared to 0.7 per cent in 2012. In October they had forecast Europe's largest economy to expand 0.8 per cent in 2013, but data has since shown that it shrank by 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2012. Economic advisers to the German government, housed in the Reichstag, more than halved their forecast for 2013 growth . Foreign trade, traditionally the main driver of German growth, would subtract 0.3 percentage points from German gross domestic product (GDP) this year, the advisers said. Demand for Germany's goods has weakened as austerity measures and recession take their toll on demand in other members of the euro zone, where Germany sends 40 per cent of its shipments. The advisers said investment was unlikely to make any significant contribution to growth in the first half of 2013. They see capital investment dropping by 3 per cent over the year, a slight improvement compared with 2012, when firms invested 4.8 per cent less in machinery and equipment. Some German companies are making cuts, with Air Berlin, the country's second biggest carrier, saying it would focus on savings this year. Retailer Metro has said it would reduce overall investment in the shortened 2013 year to below the 954 million euros it put into its business in the first nine months of 2012. The advisers said growth would primarily come from domestic demand, with private consumption increasing by 0.7 per cent and government spending rising by an upwardly revised 1.7 per cent. 'Especially household final consumption expenditure should continue to display a robust development, given that the labour market is still remarkably stable,' the advisers said in a statement. Germany's jobless rate is close to its lowest since the country reunited more than two decades ago and the number of Germans out of work fell in February. Air Berlin, the country's second biggest carrier, saying it would focus on savings this year . In addition, inflation is moderate, wages are rising and paltry interest rates are giving consumers little incentive to save. Data due out later this week is expected to bolster the advisers' expectations by showing that the number of unemployed Germans fell by 4,000 in March and consumer sentiment held steady heading into April. The influential Ifo survey last week showed German business morale fell in March, breaking a four-month run of gains and highlighting concerns the reignited debt crisis in the euro zone will test Germany's resilience. Consumer price inflation will ease to 1.7 per cent this year from 2.0 per cent last year and the unemployment rate will edge up to 6.9 per cent from 6.8 per cent, the advisers said, which is still near post-reunification lows.",Germany economy shrank by 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2012 .

Research by the children's watchdog found that 100 per cent of 14-year-old boys in one school had watched pornography (file photo) Pornography is so pervasive that entire classes of young teenage boys have watched it, the deputy children’s commissioner has warned. Sue Berelowitz said access to pornography among children was so easy it should trigger 'moral panic' among parents, teachers and ministers. She quoted unpublished research into access to pornography among children which found it is much more widespread than previously thought. It showed that every boy and half the girls in a year nine group of 14-year-olds had accessed pornography in one school in England. Miss Berelowitz said she had evidence that children as young as 11 had been found actively to be 'seeking out pornography'. Some boys now felt they had an 'absolute entitlement to have sex with girls, any time, any place, anywhere, with whomsoever they wished'. The watchdog was so concerned that it had commissioned more research to see if boys actually understood what ‘giving consent’ to sex actually meant. On Tuesday, the Daily Mail revealed that 15 children a day are excluded from schools for sexual misconduct. This paper has been campaigning for tough restrictions on web porn to protect youngsters, following fears it is warping children’s views of sex and relationships. David Cameron has promised new protections whereby all new computers will be automatically fitted with web filters unless parents specifically lift them. But no timetable has yet been put in place to implement the scheme. Miss Berelowitz made her comments on BBC Radio 4’s Bringing Up Britain, which is examining 'parenting and pornography'. She said: 'We came across one study where they were looking at the whole cohort of year nine pupils within a large local authority in England. 'The findings were that 100 per cent of 14-year-olds is accessing pornography. And about 50 per cent of the girls. 'The girls did not want to look at the porn – they were being made to by the boys.' Conservative MP Claire Perry told the Bringing Up Britain programme that parents should tell other parents about the problems of children watching pornography . 'We have commissioned research into young people’s understanding of consent... It raises very serious questions about whether boys in particular have any understanding of the concept of consent.' Miss Berelowitz said: 'No one should be panicking, but why should there not be a moral panic? 'Because what we are uncovering is the scale of what this is doing to children and young people’s sense of what is reasonable. 'If that does not generate some huge moral anxiety amongst us as a responsible population, government and community then quite frankly I would be very worried.' Claire Perry, David Cameron’s adviser on childhood, told the programme the problem of children accessing sex websites should be treated like a 'public health issue' such as nits by parents. Parents should contact others, saying 'my child has seen porn, he may have sent it round his classmates, please can we all get together and talk about it', she said. Miss Perry said: 'One of the worst things is that parents are so shocked and ashamed that they find it difficult to talk to their children, let alone the other parents.' She said that it was up to parents to take back control of the internet, adding: 'If your children said, ""actually mum I want to go and drive the car"", or “I would just like to eat crisps and chocolate for every meal”, we would feel we had some level of responsibility or some ability to control those decisions.'","Deputy children's commissioner told Radio 4 access to porn is widespread .

Andrew Parsons, 38, is accused of stabbing his wife Janee, 31, to death at their Bicester home as she packed for a weekend away with her boyfriend . A jealous husband stabbed his wife to death as their five-year-old son screamed at him to stop, a court heard yesterday. The boy pleaded with Andrew Parsons to call an ambulance for his mother Janee, who had been punched to the ground before being knifed 17 times, it was alleged. Beautician Mrs Parsons, 31, had told her husband she planned to spend the weekend with her new boyfriend. What happened next was captured on a voice recorder Parsons, 38, had hidden under her bed to eavesdrop on her affair, Oxford Crown Court was told. ‘While Janee is stabbed you can hear her as she pleads for her life and the five-year-old screams for his daddy to stop,’ said prosecutor Miranda Moore. ‘She begs for an ambulance, as does her son, but the defendant refuses. [The boy] asked if Janee was all right, the defendant said she was fine – while Janee was struggling for her life.’ Miss Moore said Mrs Parsons, who was born in Texas before moving to Yukon, Oklahoma, had pleaded with her husband saying: ‘Your son is watching me die.’ The boy yelled ‘Dad, dad, dad’ and told his father, ‘Call the hospital, I don’t like it.’ Mrs Parsons, whose mother, Mary Brady, adoptive father Phil Brady, and biological father John Jacks still live in the U.S., tried to comfort her son, telling him ‘It’s all right’ before asking her husband to take him away and call an ambulance. Parsons punched his wife to the floor upstairs in their home then fetched a knife from the kitchen and stabbed her, the court heard . But Parsons responded: ‘You ****ing deserved it.’ The couple’s other son, aged eight, . had earlier been picked up from the house in Bicester, Oxfordshire, for a . day out with his grandparents. Mrs Parsons, a US citizen who sold her health spa business in Oklahoma when it ran into financial difficulty, worked as a skin specialist at Bicester Clinic and as a make-up artist for photographic shoots and at weddings. She had been . getting ready to spend the weekend with her boyfriend, Daniel Hansens, . when she was killed on the morning of December 1. Weeks earlier she had told her husband that she was leaving him for Hansens, whom she met in a bar. Mother-of-two Mrs Parsons was planning a new life with her boyfriend Daniel Hansens when she was killed . The couple, who had been married eight . years, agreed to stay together – in separate rooms – until after . Christmas for the sake of their sons, the court heard. But Parsons, a heating engineer, . pestered his wife as she tried to get ready. On the voice recording, Mrs . Parsons could be heard saying that she did not want to talk to him . before screaming, Miss Moore said. She could be heard saying; ‘Please . don’t kill me Andy... why, please.’ Parsons stopped hitting her and, as . she lay on the landing, went downstairs to fetch a kitchen knife, . yelling, ‘You lying cow, you’re dead’. He came back upstairs and started . stabbing his wife, Miss Moore said. He then bundled her into the bath . before changing out of his bloodied pyjamas and taking his son to a . friend’s house, it was alleged. When he returned 10 minutes later, he . called 999, telling an operator to ‘get police round quickly, please’ before hanging up, the court heard. Officers found Parsons lying at the top of the stairs, his head in his hands, saying, ‘My wife, my wife’. Friends described Mrs Parsons as an . ‘over-achiever’, who had confided that she thought her husband was lazy. She had become unhappy in her marriage and within weeks of meeting Mr . Hansens, a father of three originally from Belgium, made the decision to . leave. She confessed to her husband about her . new relationship and, in the weeks before her death, had jokingly . texted her lover saying: ‘He’ll probably kill me.’ Parsons gave the impression that he . was not interested but put the recorder in her room to snoop on her . private conversations, Miss Moore said. The device was discovered by a . relative who went to retrieve her belongings. Mr Hansens, who is divorced, told the . court he and Mrs Parsons had planned to move in together after Christmas . and were hoping to start a business together. He said he had been ‘quite worried’ for her, but she was confident she could handle Parsons, describing him . as ‘weak’ and ‘docile’. Parsons denies murder. The  trial continues.

Seth Mazzaglia (left and right) of Dover, who is . a struggling actor has been arrested and charged with the murder of . missing student Lizzi Marriott . Mazzaglia is also charged with second-degree murder for showing 'extreme indifference to human life.' A hindering prosecution charge . details a series of actions the couple allegedly took to mislead police. Prosecutors say McDonough sent a text to Marriott an hour after she was . killed at their Dover apartment asking why she never showed up for . their planned visit. The indictments allege the pair also . broke Marriott's cellphone and GPS tracking system and abandoned . Marriott's car in a parking lot at the University of New Hampshire, . where Marriott had transferred to as a sophomore to study marine . biology. Prosecutors say they also concocted . the plan to say Marriott was killed accidentally during a consensual sex . act - a notion that the lead prosecutor and Marriott's family Tuesday . decried as false. 'There's no allegation of anything . consensual,' Senior Assistant Attorney General Jeffery Strelzin said . Tuesday. 'On the contrary, it was not consensual.' Marriott's parents, Bob and Melissa .

Their lawyer, George Thompson, said . the Marriotts are 'resolute in their demands for justice for Lizzi' and . are satisfied with the indictments. Mazzaglia faces two alternate theory . first-degree murder charges. One alleges he strangled Marriott. The . other alleges he used physical force to strangle her before, during or . after an attempt to sexually assault her. Marriott's disappearance on October 9 led . to a massive search, and her family and friends distributed leaflets . throughout the seacoast region seeking clues to her whereabouts. Her . cellphone was last used in Dover at 10:11 p.m. that night. On October 13, four days after Marriott . was last heard from, police took Mazzaglia into custody and charged him . with second-degree murder.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles hoped the offer of a 'compromise' on his planning reforms would avert a rebellion among Tory and Lib Dem MPS . Homeowners will keep the right to complain about neighbours’ plans for large extensions, the Government signalled yesterday. The move is a major climbdown after David Cameron last year promised ‘fast-track’ applications to kick-start the economy through building. Property-owners were to be given the right to extend as far as 26ft without planning permission or opposition from adjacent families, but Conservative and Liberal Democrat backbenchers warned it would pit ‘neighbour against neighbour’. A revised scheme means homeowners will still have to notify their local council, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said last night. He promised to tackle the issue ‘head-on’ in a letter to all Tory and Lib Dem MPs last night. ‘We are seeking to deliver practical reforms to the planning system to help families improve their home, and to remove excessive red tape on uncontentious, small-scale extensions,’ he added. ‘We will seek to move ahead  with these new permitted householder development rights, but introduce a new light-touch neighbours’ consultation scheme. ‘I hope this shows that we have listened constructively and made a targeted and common sense improvement.’ Under the revised scheme, local authorities will notify neighbours of any applications and approve them if there are no objections made within 21 days. Councils will decide any contested cases, with the most difficult developments being decided at a full council planning committee. Mr Pickles said the new system would mean ‘uncontroversial improvements are fast-tracked’ but it also ‘builds consensus’ by encouraging homeowners to talk informally to their neighbours in advance. ‘Neighbours’ amenity is protected, with the council and councillors acting as independent arbiters,’ he added. The move also makes it cheaper and easier to extend by removing the need to buy planning documents and shifts power from the state to taxpayers, said Mr Pickles. ‘We now have a set of reforms that will both help local traders and the wider economy. We are backing families who work hard, want to get on and improve their homes,’ he said. ‘We are strengthening individuals’ property rights and supporting aspiration and home ownership.’ Under the government's reforms, the size of single-storey extensions which can be built without planning permission would double to up to 8metres . Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who opposed the original plans, said: ‘I think essentially the Government has moved quite a distance to address the specific concerns some of us had. 'For us a red line was that the neighbour’s right to object should be kept in place. I think people understand that the unfettered free-for-all that was originally proposed is not acceptable. ‘The Government’s proposals are not perfect but they have shown that they have listened and taken on board our legitimate concerns. Most MPs will be able to back these new proposals.’ Councillor Mike Jones, chairman of the Local Government Association’s environment and housing board, said: ‘Councils have been calling for the right of neighbours to have a say to be protected, and we are pleased that government is listening. ‘However, there are serious questions to be answered as to how this new separate scheme will work in practice. Unplanned blight: The critics of the 'planning free-for-all' say it could turn neighbour against neighbour and cause rift in communities (file photo) 'The Government needs to clarify how this new scheme, which will require a planning department to dedicate a significant amount of time and resources, will be paid for at a time when local authorities are already facing significant cuts to their budgets.’ A Government source said it had been ludicrous to suggest that  Mr Pickles’ original ideas would have contributed to growth. ‘They overstated the problem in terms of the way the planning system normally works. Ninety per cent of applications are approved.’ At the moment, homeowners can avoid seeking planning permission for a single-storey addition of no more than 10ft at a terraced property, or one of 13ft at a detached house. The Government wanted to double those figures for a three-year period, as long as the extensions did not take up more than half of a garden. Now, however, only uncontested applications will be allowed to proceed without permission. The Government says it still expects 40,000 extensions a year to be built under the new fast-track system.","Revised law means that homeowners still have to tell council when extending .

Britain is to double its support for Syrian opposition forces, as David Cameron left the door open to providing arms in the coming weeks, . The Prime Minister said ending the bloody conflict was the most pressing global challenge, and pledged to step up the non-lethal equipment being shipped to forces trying to overthrow President Assad. He warned that without providing more than ‘technical advice’ to moderate Syrian rebels, there  was a risk that extremists groups would take hold. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron said that there was an 'urgent window of opportunity' to act in the war-torn country, where 80,000 have been killed and was supported by President Obama . David Cameron said Britain was doubling its non-lethal support for Syrian opposition forces . Speaking at a press conference with US President Barack Obama, Mr Cameron said Britain could do more than offer 'technical assistance' to forces trying to overthrow Assad . FBI Director Robert Mueller talking to David Cameron during a tour of the Strategic Information Operations Center as the US and UK discuss global security challenges . Mr Cameron was addressing reporters at a joint press conference in the White House with US President Barack Obama. He said the UK would continue to press for changes to the European Union arms embargo and added: ‘We will double non-lethal support to the Syrian opposition in the coming year. Armoured vehicles, body armour and power generators are about to be shipped.’ An extra £10 million for non-lethal military aid would be made available for Syrian rebels and £30 million more would be ploughed into humanitarian assistance, under the plan outlined today. Mr Cameron said Assad had to realise there could be no military victory for his forces. ‘There will be no political progress unless the opposition is able to withstand the onslaught and put pressure on Assad so he knows there is no military victory,’ Mr Cameron said. Last week he held talks with Russian President Vladimr Putin, who remains opposed to the overthrow of Assad. Mr Cameron said 80,000 people were dead and five million had been forced from their homes as a result of the ‘brutal conflict’ in Syria. He added: ‘Syria's history is being written in the blood of her people and it is happening on our watch. The world urgently needs to come together to bring the killing to an end. ‘None of us have any interest in seeing more lives lost, in seeing chemical weapons used, or extremist violence spreading even further.’ The UK would increase efforts to ‘support and to shape the moderate opposition’. Mr Cameron last week met Russian President Vladimir Putin but the two men failed to reached agreement on the need to remove Assad from power in Syria . President Vladimir Putin still refuses to join the international community in taking stronger actions against President Assad's regime . Mr Cameron also promised more humanitarian assistance for those affected by the violence. ‘There is now common ground between the US, UK, Russia and many others that whatever our differences, we have the same aim: a stable, inclusive and peaceful Syria free from the scourge of extremism. ‘There's real political will behind this. We now need to get on and do everything we can to make it happen.’ Mr Cameron insisted no decision had been made on arming opposition groups in Syria. ‘What we have done is we have amended the EU arms embargo in order that we can give technical assistance and technical advice, and as I said in my statement, that is exactly what we are doing. ‘We are continuing to examine and look at the EU arms embargo and see whether we need to make further changes to it in order to facilitate our work with the opposition. ‘I do believe that there is more we can do alongside technical advice, assistance, help, in order to shape them, in order to work with them.’ Regional tensions have escalated since the twin car bomb attacks in the town of Reyhanli near the Turkish-Syrian border this week . The UK government has drawn up options which including lifting the embargo against giving arms to opponents of the Assad regime . And he challenged critics of his intervention to realise that the consequences of failing to act could be much worse. ‘If we don't help the Syrian opposition - who we do recognise as being legitimate, who have signed up to a statement about the future for Syria that is democratic, that respects the rights of minorities - if we don't work with that part of the opposition, then we shouldn't be surprised if the extremist elements grow. ‘So I think being engaged with the Syrian opposition is the right approach and that is an approach I know I share with the president and other colleagues in the European Union.’","Prime Minister promises more help to rebels to overthrow Syrian regime .

Ideas: Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, said at a symposium that the white working classes are increasingly unsure of their identities . The white working classes are so alienated from society that they should attend citizenship ceremonies with immigrants, according to David Cameron’s poverty tsar. Frank Field said some working class people were increasingly unsure of their identities. He suggested that going to the ‘wonderful’ citizenship ceremonies could help them feel like they were part of British society again. Mr Field, who was welfare minister under Tony Blair, told a conference that society had ‘lost confidence in what it is’ and needed to ‘relearn the rules’ it used to live by. The Labour MP criticised his own party for having lost touch with the working classes, the very group which created it. He said: ‘There are dangers for that group which used to run the Labour Party, [but] now is almost forgotten by it – the working class.’ Mr Field, MP for Birkenhead, made his comments amid growing concerns about the impact of immigration on white working class communities, some of whom are turning to the  far Right as unemployment rises. In March, Ed Miliband pledged to limit the number of unskilled people able to enter Britain to protect jobs and apologised for the previous Labour government getting it ‘wrong’ on immigration. Mr Field told the audience of academics: ‘In my lifetime, we’ve moved from a Labour Party which was working class-dominated. Some trendy London middle classes went along with it but were subjected, at least publicly, to the moral economy of the working class. ‘We’ve moved to a stage where  what was that minority is in a  governing position, which imposes upon the working class its moral economy . . . there is a real crisis of representation.’ He added: ‘I argue not to have these wonderful citizenship ceremonies just for people who want to come here. I think the poor working class in Birkenhead needs them. ‘We need to relearn what these rules are because they are not taught by the intermediary organisations which used to be very strong.’ Border control: Mr Field made his comments amid growing concerns about the impact of immigration on white working class communities, some of whom are turning to the far right as unemployment rises . Mr Field served as a minister between 1997 and 1998, with a remit to ‘think the unthinkable’ on the welfare state. But his inability to work with his boss, Harriet Harman, meant both were removed. He led the fight against Gordon Brown’s controversial scrapping of the 10p tax rate, and campaigns to reduce immigration. In 2010, to the consternation of many of Mr Field’s colleagues, Mr Cameron appointed him as poverty tsar. The MP was speaking at a symposium called ‘Diversity and the White Working Class: white flight, anti-immigration politics and integration’, hosted by Birkbeck, University of London and the think-tank Demos. Anyone wishing to become a  citizen must attend a citizenship ceremony, led by a registrar. During the ceremony, applicants must take an oath of allegiance, and pledge to respect Britain’s ‘rights and freedoms’.","Labour MP Frank Field said white working classes are unsure of identities .

They are being encouraged to purchase all their non-food items from supermarkets, as well as the weekly grocery shop, by convenience, cost and rewards such as loyalty points, a study found. The findings reveal that 98 per cent of Britons buy at least some non-food items – such as clothes or electronics – from supermarkets. Convenient: Eight million consumers buy everything they need from supermarkets . And six in ten shoppers would be happy to buy big-ticket items such as a holiday or TV from a supermarket if the price was competitive. Nearly three quarters (72 per cent) of Britons have bought clothing and accessories from  a supermarket retailer, rising to 78 per cent among women. CDs, DVDs and video games were the second most common non-food purchase, followed by household electrical appliances, toys, gardening equipment and DIY tools and mobile phone or computing devices. The survey of 2,000 people was commissioned by finance giant Santander. Spokesman Alan Mathewson said: ‘Cost, rewards and convenience are a major incentive for shoppers at a time when households are increasingly short of money and time. ‘While independent retailers continue to offer a more traditional high street experience, competitive pricing and generous rewards mean many consumers are looking to consolidate their purchasing habits under just one roof.’","Findings reveal 98 per cent of people living in Britain buy some non-food items from supermarkets .

It is not the first place you would think to go for fine wine – but budget store Lidl says it has been overwhelmed with demand for a £19.99 claret. The supermarket, perhaps  better known for discount lager than classy Bordeaux, is stocking a reputable St Emilion Grand Cru as part of a push for affluent  shoppers trying to bag a bargain. The Château Laroze 2007 is the most expensive wine ever sold by the German-owned chain. Lidl’s ‘Wine Cellar’ also includes a 2011 Châteauneuf du Pape at £12.49 and a 2011 Sancerre at £9.99. The wines were chosen by a panel including Master of Wine Richard Bampfield, who gave the Château Laroze an ‘outstanding’ score of 90 out of 100. The . current owners of Château Laroze, an obscure, St. Emilion classified . growth, are the Meslin family, who can trace their roots back to the . Gurchy family, who created the business in 1882, according to the Wine . Cellar Insider website. The 27 hectare Bordeaux vineyard of . Chateau Laroze is planted with 68 per cent Merlot, 26 per cent Cabernet . Franc and 6 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon. In the Chateau Laroze blog, the owner describes the wine as having sex appeal. Guy Meslin wrote in 2009: 'If any wine has sex-appeal, this one does. All the ingredients are melded and in place. 'The wood is nicely blended in and quite flattering, and nicely sets off the very fresh fruity hints. 'The tannins are not especially powerful, but contribute sheer silk and velvet. 'The finish prolongs all this with an emphasis on the aromatic freshness.' The supermarket launched its wine range after realising customers were willing to spend money on the finer things . He said: 'This is a Grand Cru Classé . which means it is at the top of the Bordeaux quality hierarchy and one . has to expect to pay more for it. 'This is very fine, showing the . fragrant aromas of St Emilion, a depth of flavour unusual for the . vintage and a wonderful long finish, the hallmark of a great Bordeaux.' Lidl is alone in selling the Château Laroze 2007 – it is only available from wholesalers otherwise. Lidl increased its share of the groceries market by 10 per cent between October and January. Aldi increased its share by 28 per cent and Iceland by 9.6 per cent over the same period. Ben Hulme, Lidl wine manager, said: .

A surge of millions of baby eels in the River Severn this spring has meant local restaurants can serve the delicacy for the first time in years. Elver catches in the river around Gloucester have been their highest for 30 years - meaning there are enough of the tiny worm-like fish to make their way onto British menus at cut down prices. This year numbers could reach up to 100million - ten times more than last year. Millions more elver eels have appeared in the River Severn meaning restaurants can now serve them for the first time in years and at cut-down prices . So many have been caught this spring that . the city's elver station had to close for two weeks because its storage . tanks were full and it was turning away fishermen trying to sell them. In past generations elver eels were a cheap and popular local delicacy. But in the 70s and 80s the demand for them in the Far East - where they are credited with aphrodisiac qualities - turned them into a luxury as expensive as caviar. Since the recent surge in numbers prices being paid to the fishermen have dropped from £200 a kilo at the start of the season to just £85. Because the UK Glass Eeels station at Over, near Gloucester, was closed fishermen were selling their catches elsewhere - including to the Tiger's Eye restaurant in Southgate Street where chef Robert Sinyard has put them on the menu. Peter Wood, of UK Glass Eels, at his elver station with some of the baby eels he has caught this year . He bought two kilos last week and is serving 20gram helpings cooked with bacon and scrambled egg for £8.50 a plate. 'Eels are meant to be a critically . endangered species but it certainly doesn't look like it here,' said . Peter Wood of UK Glass Eels. 'We have had huge catches such as we have not seen for a couple of decades. 'I would say the catch has been 20 times larger than it was at the low point four years ago.' Mr Wood's firm sends elvers to . countries across Europe for re-stocking of rivers - Sweden, Denmark, . Holland, Germany, Latvia and Lithuania are among the destinations. He believes that the numbers caught this year could be enough to keep rivers healthily stocked with eels for six to 10 years. So . far, 660,000 Severn elvers have been donated for re-stocking rivers in . this country and that figure will rise at the end of the season, he . said. The elvers need to be taken out of the . Severn and relocated because flood barriers are now so effective that . they would be unable to reach other streams and tributaries and would . perish. Andrew Kerr, former . chairman of Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust and now chairman of the . Sustainable Eel Group, said 'It is just extraordinary how many elvers . there have been in the Severn this season.' He said the precise reasons why there are shortages some years and gluts others cannot be explained. But the variation of currents in the Atlantic as the elvers are swept from the Sargasso Sea to the Severn could be part of the reason. 'They migrate with the tide and they come up the river in waves. There have been tales this year of fifty mile streams of elvers,' he said. Mr Kerr said 330,000 elvers have been released into rivers in Somerset today another 330,000 are being put into the River Avon at Tewkesbury. One of the reasons why Severn elvers are in so much demand for restocking programmes is that the way they are caught - with traditional trough-shaped 'artisan' nets - does not damage them in the same way as fishing methods elsewhere, said Mr Kerr. He was not pleased, however, to be told that elvers are back on restaurant menus again. 'We . are not that keen on them being eaten although it is better than them . just being wasted if they get stuck in the river,' he said. Experts believe the number of elver eels (pictured) caught this year could be enough to keep rivers healthily stocked for six to 10 years . The worst year for elver catches on the Severn was 2009 when about a million were netted. The following year it was about 3 million and then in 2011 and 2012 there were 9-12 million. 'This year we could be talking about 100million - ten times last year,' he said. 'The UK Glass Eels station had 1-2 tonnes in one night - that's four million elvers. the catches are the biggest for at least 20-30 years.' Back in the 1970s, when elvers were plentiful, riverside dwellers ate them regularly - and there was an annual Easter Monday elver eating contest on the village green at Frampton on Severn. Competitors would sit on a makeshift stage and wolf down a plate of one pound of fried elvers (half a pound in the ladies contest). But the competion had to be stopped when elvers became scarce and highly expensive. Now, shoppers in Gloucester have the chance to try the local delicacy cooked the traditional way at the Tigers Eye restaurant in Southgate street. Chef Robert said: 'I still had to pay £100 a kilo for the ones I bought but it is rare for them to be available to restaurants so we wanted to have some. 'The elver dishes are just flying out of the door and I shall only be able to serve them for a couple more days before we run out.'","Elver eel numbers could reach 100million this year - ten times last year .

Prosecutors in the Colorado theater shootings have listed about 3,500 potential witnesses they could call during the trial of defendant James Holmes. The estimate was in a motion filed Tuesday. None of the witnesses have been publicly identified. Lawyers also say nearly 40,000 pages of documents about evidence have been filed. Holmes is accused of killing 12 and . injuring 70 in the July 20 shooting at an Aurora movie theater. He's . charged with multiple counts of murder and first-degree murder. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Changing their stance: James Holmes, pictured during a March court hearing, has now entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity . Back in court: Accused movie theater gunman James Holmes, is led into the courtroom in this sketch . Mom: James Holmes' mother Arlene Holmes, left, is escorted by a member of the defense team as she arrives for Monday's court hearing . Holmes has asked to change his plea to not guilty by reason of insanity, but the judge hasn't decided whether to accept it. The . judge said that he finds 'good cause' to allow the change in plea but will . not make his decision until May 28 - three days before a new hearing . begins. Holmes had bushy hair and beard at his hearing on Monday. He didn't speak at all and entered the courtroom with his eyes downcast. The not guilty by reason of insanity plea is widely seen as Holmes' best - and perhaps his only - hope of avoiding the death penalty. But his lawyers have held off until now, fearing a wrinkle in the law could cripple their ability to raise his mental health as a mitigating factor during the sentencing phase. Two judges have refused to rule on . the constitutionality of the law, saying the attorneys' objections were . hypothetical because Holmes had not pleaded insanity. Defense: Attorney Daniel King made the request to change Homes' plea to not guilt by reason of insanity in court Monday . Judge: Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos Samour Jr will rule on the plea change on May 28 . The defense had little choice but to have Holmes enter the plea and then challenge the law. Holmes' lawyers announced last week that he would ask to change his plea at Monday's hearing. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Holmes, who faces more than 160 counts of murder and attempted murder charges. They say Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student, spent months acquiring weapons and ammunition, scouting a theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora and booby-trapping his apartment. Then on July 20, dressed in a police-style helmet and body armor, he opened fire during a packed midnight showing of the Batman film 'The Dark Knight Rises,' prosecutors say. Twelve people were killed and another 70 were injured. Arrest: Much of his actions have hinted that an insanity plea might be in the cards, especially after his first court appearance where he seemed out of it . No motive has emerged in nearly 10 months of hearings, but Holmes' attorneys have repeatedly said their client is mentally ill. He was being treated by a psychiatrist before the attack. The insanity plea carries risks for both sides. Holmes will have to submit to a mental evaluation by state-employed doctors, and prosecutors could use the findings against him. 'It's literally a life-and-death situation with the government seeking to execute him and the government, the same government, evaluating him with regard to whether he was sane or insane at the time he was in that movie theater,' said attorney Dan Recht, a past president of the Colorado Criminal Defense Bar. Among the risks for prosecutors: They must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Holmes was sane. If they don't, state law requires the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity. 'That's a significant burden on the prosecution,' Recht said. If acquitted, Holmes would be committed to the state mental hospital indefinitely. A judge entered a standard not guilty plea on Holmes' behalf in March, and he needs court permission to change it. Recht said it's a foregone conclusion the judge will accept the new plea to preclude appeals later. The mental evaluation could take weeks or months. Tragic: The shooting at the multiplex left 12 people dead and injured 70 in July 2012 . Evaluators will interview Holmes, his friends and family, and if Holmes permits it, they'll also speak with mental health professionals who treated him in the past, said Dr Howard Zonana, a professor of psychiatry and adjunct professor of law at Yale University. Evaluators may give Holmes standardized personality tests and compare his results to those of people with documented mental illness. They will also look for any physical brain problems. Zonana estimates he has conducted around 200 mental evaluations of criminal defendants, including some death penalty cases. 'All cases are tough,' he said. Meticulous planning, as in the scenario prosecutors laid out against Holmes, doesn't necessarily mean a defendant is sane, Zonana said. Zonana said he helped evaluate Stephen Morgan, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 2009 shooting death of Johanna Justin-Jinich in Middletown, Connecticut, where she was attending college. Evidence showed Morgan planned the shooting, Zonana said, 'but he was delusional as hell.'","Holmes has changed his plea to not guilty by reason of insanity .

An obese benefits claimant who boasted about his state-funded lifestyle was caught driving five high-powered 4x4 cars - all without insurance. Peter Owens, 43, was stopped by police five times in just seven months last year, each time behind the wheel of a different plush vehicle. But he will not be able to drive any of . his cars for three years after he was banned by magistrates for a string . of vehicle offences. Banned: Peter Owens who boasted about his benefit-funded lifestyle was caught driving five high-powered 4x4 cars - all without insurance . Magistrates said they wanted to give him a jail sentence for his repeated flouting of driving laws, but said their powers did not allow it. He was first caught driving an uninsured Jeep Cherokee in Barnard Castle, County Durham, on May 31 last year. Then in July, he was caught in a Mitsubishi Shogun in Kilburn, North Yorkshire, when he sped off from police. The vehicle was later found to have no insurance. The following month, Owens was caught in a Land Rover Discovery at The Lanyard on Hartlepool marina. A police check soon revealed he was not insured to drive it. In November Owens was caught behind the wheel of an uninsured Suzuki Vitara while poaching with others in North Yorkshire. And just a week later he was stopped again, this time in an uninsured Ford Maverick on Catcote Road, in Hartlepool. Caught: Owens - seen here driving along a beach a Seaton Carew, Teeside last year - was stopped by police five times in just seven months last year . Owens pleaded guilty to five offences of having no insurance, one of failing to produce a licence, one of having no licence, failing to produce insurance documents, and to poaching. He was disqualified from driving for three years and fined £550 at Hartlepool Magistrates' Court. John Relton, mitigating, said: 'He does not seek to trivialise these offences. He now regrets his actions.' Chairman of the bench, Lynne Hodgson, told Owens: 'We did consider the most serious sentencing we could impose, a curfew and we even considered custody. Unfortunately, our guidelines don't enable us to do that, the offences don't carry custodial or curfew sentences. 'If you are found driving when you are disqualified you could go to prison. You must not get behind the wheel of a car.' Owens, of Sydenham Road, Hartlepool, has achieved national notoriety for his boasting about his lifestyle on benefits. He previously bought a quad bike with cash left over from a £1,000 grant he had been given to redecorate his house. Standstill: The court heard he had brought the sea front at Seaton Carew to a standstill when he drove his 4x4 along the beach . In 2009, he was given a lenient sentence at Teesside Crown Court for a baseball bat attack because of health problems connected to his size. Last year, he complained after his Vauxhall Zafira mobility car was taken from him after he was fined for not having a licence for it. Last September, Owens brought Seaton Carew to a standstill for nine hours when he drove up and down the beach in another of his 4x4s. He later apologised for the disruption blaming the episode on physical and mental health problems. His last court appearance saw him spared jail in January after he was found guilty of blackmailing a car wash boss he threatened after a machine damaged the wheels on Owens' S-Type Jaguar. He told the trial jury: 'I like big cars because I am a big man.' The judge handed him a suspended prison sentence, again because of Owens health problems.","Peter Owens, 43, was stopped by police five times in just seven months .

It has taken Mr Barber three years to perfect the process and produce a vodka that approving experts say has ‘a creamy nose’. Mr .

The Mail on Sunday’s food and drink writer Tom Parker Bowles said: ‘OK, so vodka made from milk doesn’t exactly sound enticing. But Black Cow Vodka is one of the most remarkable things I’ve ever tasted – wonderfully smooth and beautifully rounded. ‘It’s made from the whey of proper Dorset milk and makes a Dirty Martini you’ll never forget.’","Jason Barber, 47, makes vodka from his dairy herd in Beiminster, Dorset .

Wine could become too expensive for anyone but the wealthy thanks to Government restrictions and taxes, says one major retailer. A potential ban on multi-buy offers in supermarkets and the recent 10p rise in wine duty could be responsible for drinkers turning to beer instead, according to Stephen Lewis, the chief executive of Majestic Wine. This could reverse the 'revolution' of people enjoying a glass of wine with a meal, he said. A potential ban on multi-buy offers by the Government could lead people to abandon wine for cheaper drinks, says one retailer . 'Having established this culture of food and wine, you know, which is a sea change from where we were 30 years ago, why would we want to stop that?' Mr Lewis, whose chain has nearly 200 stores in the UK. told the Daily Telegraph. He said that banning drinks offers in supermarkets would not solve the problem of anti-social behaviour. 'The Majestic consumer is not the person who’s smashing up things, they’re not the problem drinkers', he told the newspaper. Yesterday, the minister for public health indicated a decision over introducing minimum alcohol pricing may never be taken, despite it being backed at first by David Cameron. Public health minister Anna Soubry said minimum alcohol pricing may never be introduced . Anna Soubry said the policy could seem like 'big bossy government cracking down on people who don't have a problem', in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said the Government was yet to decide if it would introduce a 45p minimum unit price and possibly never would. Reports emerged last month that the controversial plans had been ditched amid claims David Cameron had run into fierce opposition from Cabinet colleagues, including Home Secretary Theresa May. The Prime Minister insists the Government is considering the outcome of a consultation and wants to act to curb cheap drink. Ms Soubry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'On alcohol, I don't think we have actually made a decision yet and there are good arguments both in favour of it and against it. 'I was not convinced. I have been convinced because I met a whole load of liver specialists and doctors and they persuaded me it was a good idea.' Asked if she had convinced Mr Cameron, she replied: 'Oh yeah.' Asked when there would be a decision on alcohol pricing: 'I don't know.'

Fast food giant McDonald's will source pork for its UK restaurants from British farms to meet strict animal welfare criteria from the end of the month, it has announced. All sausage and bacon on its menu will be 100 per cent Freedom Food pork from farms meeting standards set out by the RSPCA on how pigs are reared. The move will make it the UK's second biggest buyer of pork from the Freedom Food scheme, which goes beyond industry standards and legislation to demand better treatment for animals.

Britain has a ‘hideous’ attitude to success, the chairman of a literary prize warned yesterday as she announced that double Booker prize winner Hilary Mantel had been shortlisted for yet another award. She warned that far from praise, Miss Mantel was at risk of ‘vitriolic’ criticism. Actress Miranda Richardson, the chairman of judges for the Women’s Prize for Fiction, felt she had to defend the decision to honour Mantel. Support: Actress Miranda Richardson (left), the chairman of judges for the Women’s Prize for Fiction, felt she had to defend the decision to honour Hilary Mantel (right) She said the 60-year-old writer deserved to be on the shortlist of six female authors, regardless of her previous success. But she feared the author could become the victim of ‘tall poppy syndrome’, and be viliﬁed for having ‘too much success'. Richardson, known for her role as Queenie in Blackadder, also said she was ‘very keen’ to see Mantel make the ﬁnal cut for the prize. Richardson said yesterday it would be unfair to expect those who had been ‘lauded’ before to miss out on further recognition. She said: ‘I was very keen to keep a balanced approach about Hilary Mantel because I’ve heard what we call the “tall poppy syndrome”, particularly in Britain.’ ‘People have been quite vitriolic in . some cases. I think it’s disgusting, quite frankly. “You’ve already had . too much you can’t have any more. Go away and die now”.’ Richardson, who having won two Golden .

Mantel has previously won the Man Booker Prize . and Costa Book Award for her best-selling Bring Up the Bodies, the . sequel to her novel Wolf Hall, which also claimed the Booker. If she wins the Women’s Prize for Fiction she would become the ﬁrst novelist to receive all three. She is joined on the shortlist by two . previous winners – Zadie Smith, who triumphed in 2006 with On Beauty; . and Barbara Kingsolver,  whose novel The Lacuna won the prize in 2010. Mantel, who sparked a furore when she . described the Duchess of Cambridge as a ‘shop-window mannequin’, has . previously acknowledged criticism of her success.

Jodi Arias' effort to raise money for her legal team has offended many involved in the murder trial, but now new revelations about her creative subjects are shocking her ex-boyfriend's family. Old drawings that the accused murderer made while in jail show a noticeable similarity to her victim Travis Alexander's sister. In one series called 'The Hat', the female subject looks just like Alexander's sister Tanisha Sorenson, who followers of the case are familiar with because she has been sitting in the court room the entire length of the death penalty trial. Who's that girl: Court watchers have said that there are distinct similarities between the women in some of Jodi Arias' drawings and her slain ex-boyfriend's sister Tanisha Sorenson . Killer turned artist: Arias has been seen sketching throughout the lengthy trial, and she has been selling the art online to raise money for her legal expenses . Supporters of Travis Alexander's family found the pencil drawing that Arias allegedly made while behind bars for the brutal killing of her 30-year-old ex, who was found dead in his home after being stabbed 29 times and shot. This black and white drawing is not one of the ones that Arias and her supporters have been selling online in order to help pay for her legal team and her family's expenses while staying in Phoenix, Arizona for the trial. Though 'The Hat' series has not been put up for sale, her other drawings-featuring famous stars of yesteryear like Frank Sinatra and Grace Kelly as well as a number of reportedly anonymous subjects- have fetched thousands for her cause. The likeness between the woman in 'The Hat' and Tanisha Sorenson is striking, with the two sharing similar eyes and lip shapes. Eery: Supporters of Alexander's family noticed the similarities between the two, and because the drawings were made before the trial, that hints that Arias has been thinking of Alexander's sister for years . Ms Sorenson has been a constant presence in the Phoenix courtroom, sitting alongside one of Travis' good friends and their other sister. At one point during Arias' testimony about her sexual exploits with Alexander, Ms Sorenson visibly rolled her eyes. 'I know this might sound creepy, but I hope to get to watch her die someday after she’s on death row,' Ms Sorenson told HLN during an earlier interview. 'Even if it’s in 20 years from now, the death penalty is what she deserves, though she most likely won’t get it and instead will get some life sentence.' The Hat is not listed as being for sale, but the site, run by Arias' friends outside of prison, continues to list other drawings. Just today they added an earlier piece of art that the suspected murderer made of an unidentified woman holding a blue pill between her teeth. Inspiration: Ms Sorenson has been a constant presence at the Arias trial, and became visibly upset at points where Arias described her sexual relationship with Alexander and how she stabbed him 29 times . Due to apparent popular demand, they've also announced that they will be selling 100 limited edition reprints of her picture of an hourglass. Four other pieces that have already been sold all went for $1,000 or more, with her portrait of Grace Kelly earning a whopping $3,050. The drama surrounding the case continues in the courtroom as well, as one of Alexander's ex-girlfriends took the stand on Tuesday. 'Catharsis': This monochromatic work sold for $1,000 . On the auction block: Her Grace Kelly portrait (left) was the highest earner so far, with a final price tag of $3,050 while 'Pisces' (right) sold for $1,525 .

The controversial Speaker of the House of Commons has refused to reveal details of how he apparently avoided paying tax on his multi-million-pound grace-and-favour residence. John Bercow, who lives in the luxurious taxpayer-funded Westminster property with his equally controversial wife Sally, previously paid more than £4,000 a year because it was considered a ‘taxable benefit’. But this tax bill was mysteriously cut to zero in 2010/11, it has emerged. When asked for an explanation, the Speaker, who earns £140,000 a year, refused to explain his tax arrangements. Commons Speaker John Bercow has signed an exemption certifiate which means details of his tax bill for the flat cannot be released . Mr Bercow – who stood for his office promising greater transparency – used an obscure piece of parliamentary legislation to avoid answering. He claimed that to reveal his tax arrangements would ‘prejudice’ his position as Speaker but critics said he risked ‘tarnishing the reputation of Parliament’. Mr Bercow and his wife live rent-free in Speaker’s House, part of the Palace of Westminster. It has a magnificent Gothic-style dining room and a state bedroom traditionally used by monarchs the night before their coronation. Within weeks of taking residence in June 2009, he and his wife ordered refurbishments costing £45,000. As with any staff member granted a home by their employer, Mr Bercow is liable to pay tax either on its value or – if it is judged indispensable to their work – an amount equal to a share of the running costs. He was granted the latter arrangement – the same as the Prime Minister and Chancellor have for their grace-and-favour Downing Street flats – and, according to the Commons accounts, was asked to pay £4,300 in 2009-10. But in the following year’s figures, the bill mysteriously disappears. The account states that: ‘The Speaker’s official residence is provided in conjunction with his House of Commons duties. In 2009/10 the accommodation benefit assessable to tax was £4,300. Discussions with HM Revenue and Customs concluded that no taxable benefit arose in 2010/11.’ In response to a Freedom of Information request by the Press Association to reveal details of the tax arrangement, Mr Bercow took the unusual step of issuing a certificate that effectively exempted this information from normal rules. Sally Bercow, wife of Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow, caused a stir when she was pictured in the window of the Speaker's residence overlooking the Thames . This defence is normally subject to a public interest test, but the Speaker has the power to sign a certificate which is taken as conclusive proof he has reached a ‘reasonable opinion’. The Information Commissioner’s office said it has no power to challenge Mr Bercow’s decision. Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘This is a matter of great concern. There are question marks in this case and they should be explained. The Speaker can’t be above other MPs or the rest of the country. If the Speaker isn’t open about this it risks tarnishing the reputation of Parliament.’ Maurice Frankel, of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, said: ‘The Commons is relying on a power of veto which allows it to evade accountability to avoid embarrassment.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said Mr Bercow was attempting to exempt himself from the same scrutiny that other MPs face. ‘It’s completely inappropriate for the Speaker to make the final judgment over whether legitimate questions about his own taxpayer-funded perks are of public interest or not,’ he said, adding that Mr Bercow’s actions appeared to be ‘a blatant attempt to shut down a perfectly reasonable investigation’. The FoI request also revealed that the Clerk of the House, Malcolm Jack, paid tax on his grace-and-favour residence in 2009-10 but paid nothing in 2010-11. HMRC said: ‘Accommodation provided by an employer is generally taxable unless certain conditions are met: where it is provided for special security reasons, or it is necessary for the performance of the employee’s duties.’ Mr Bercow was elected Speaker in the wake of the MPs’ expenses scandal. It was then revealed he had ‘flipped’ the designation of his second home when he sold two houses, allowing him to avoid capital gains tax. He denied wrongdoing but paid back £6,508 to the taxman.","Commons Speaker used powers to block release of talks with HMRC .

Given the recent horse meat scandal, you'd be forgiven for assuming that British diners would want to avoid meat that isn't beef, pork or chicken. But according to London restaurants, Wahaca and The Blues Kitchen, demand for exotic fare has increased so much, they've added some very unusual items to the menu. At Wahaca, a sustainable Mexican street food chain of restaurants, you can enjoy chapulines fundido - a Mexican delicacy that includes fried grasshoppers. Bugs: Wahaca's chapulines fundido, a Mexican delicacy that includes a side order of deep fried grasshopper . Not to be outdone, Camden's The Blues Kitchen has put fried alligator tail on the menu. According to the restaurant, this translates as 'tender pieces of alligator tail coated in Cajun panko bread crumbs, and served with fresh mint and sweet chili sauce.' Since the horse meat scandal broke, sales of exotic meats such as ostrich and kudu have shot up, according to the man behind a meat retailer that sells everything from camel to crocodile. ‘With all the media attention on horse meat, lots of people are curious to try new things,’ says Paul Webb, director of Exotic Meats. ‘We’ve seen sales increase tenfold in a week.' Kezie Foods, a Scottish supplier of exotic food stuffs has also seen sales go through the roof, according to company spokeman, Julia Toomey. ‘Kangaroo meat is a very popular alternative and is delicious,' she reveals. 'It is low in fat, high in protein and available in the same cuts as beef so can easily be substituted in a regular recipe or meal. Anyone for alligator? The Camden eatery has added a dish made with the scaly reptile to its menu . ‘There are many other alternative meats that are lean and healthy which taste great; springbok, venison, wildebeest and zebra, to name a few, are very popular.’ Like antelopes and zebra, Mexican grasshoppers and alligator tails are packed with protein and can be cooked in much the same way. What's more, say Wahaca, the percentage of protein in grasshoppers is far higher than in any other type of meat, boasting 60 per cent protein to just six per cent fat. But despite most Brits' aversion to creepie crawlies, Wahaca founder and chef Thomasina Miers says eating insects is no different to eating shrimps or prawns. 'It’s just not in our psyche at the moment', she says. 'The chapulines fundido is a great introduction to the beautiful earthy flavour of these insects as it tastes amazing and a salsa is much more palatable for the more squeamish diners out there.' 'Insects do not have to be a novelty food, they are packed full of protein, taste amazing and due to their farming methods are incredibly good for the environment.' Could you? Would you? Does a grasshopper snack sound like something you would want to eat? Tasty: Alligator meat is rubbery in texture and tastes like a bland, if slightly fishy, version of  chicken . In Uganda, where I lived for two years, the onset of the long rains in March only ever meant one thing to locals: grasshopper time. For at least a month afterwards, you could expect to find an enterprising trader selling the bugs deep fried and breaded on every street corner - and they were never short of customers. One day, that crowd of buyers included me. The bag of bugs handed over by the smiling trader certainly smelled OK, tangy and rich, and very much like a deep fried prawn. They didn't taste as bad as expected. The texture was worse. It was a bit like chomping on a prawn with the shell left on - disgusting. The taste meanwhile, was a blandly juicy version of the same and badly needed its salt and breadcrumbs. The hardest part was trying not to think . about what it actually was - an insect that under normal circumstances . I'd have been more keen to squirt with bug repellent than eat. While it wasn't entirely revolting, I'm not anxious to repeat the experience. I can't say the same for crocodile, however. In Zimbabwe I was offered the chance to try some crocodile sausages, and having previously munched my way through platefuls of buffalo, springbok and kudu, I thought I'd give it a go. The sausages arrived, pale cream and glistening, and bore a worryingly close resemblance to Scottish white pudding. In the mouth, the flesh was slightly rubbery, similar to squid, and tasted like a bland, fishy version of chicken. The chef at Singita Pamushana safari lodge had made a heroic effort to spice it up with a delicious sauce and thanks to his work, the end result was pretty tasty. Like grasshoppers, it badly needed the extra salt and pepper, but unlike the bug, the squid like texture of crocodile is inoffensive. I'd like to try it again, but perhaps in steak form next time around...","Mexican restaurant Wahaca to serve fried grasshoppers .

Brooke Mueller is reported to have been babbling about ‘mafia connections’ when she was forced into psychiatric care earlier this month under suspicion of heavy drug abuse. When police arrived at her Los Angeles home on May 1 the 35-year-old was ranting about an imaginary FBI investigation of her ex Charlie Sheen. The mother-of-two claimed she was an informant for the Federal Bureau and was going to bring her former husband down with her secret information. Incoherent ramblings: Brooke Mueller babbled about 'mafia connections' when police took her into custody on May 1, pictured in Hollywood, in February . According to TMZ, law enforcement arrived at her home after receiving a 911 call from a man who claimed Brooke had assaulted him. Sources told the gossip website that officers on the scene believed that she was inebriated and appeared to not have slept for days. Her children, four-year-old twin boys Bob and Max who she shares with Sheen, were present in the house during the incident. Police called the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, who were reported have had an open case on the troubled mother. Upon making the call to Family Services officers took Brooke into custody under a section 5150 – a California Welfare and Institutions Code that deems an individual to have a mental disorder making them a danger to themselves and others. Brooke was placed under a three-day psychiatric hold and was later sent to rehab. A happier time: Charlie Sheen pictured with Brooke in Los Angeles, in September 2009 . Meanwhile, Brooke is said to be . concerned that her child support - a whopping $55,000 a month - will be . cut off by Sheen as their children are in the temporary custody of . Denise Richards. A source told RadarOnline.com: ‘One . of the reasons she had her lawyer go to court on Friday to ask the judge . to strip Denise Richards of temporary guardianship of Bob and Max - and . have them placed with her brother - is because she is afraid that . Charlie is going to cut off child support.’ The rehab veteran’s sole source of . income are the child support checks, as the source explained: ‘Brooke . hasn’t worked in years and is unable to keep a job because of her . addiction to drugs. ‘Brooke doesn’t have any money saved and lives month-to-month on the child support.’ Despite being denied spouse support . in her divorce from the movie star she did receive a $757,000 settlement . as well as $1 million from the sale of their home. But Sheen has no plans to cut her off . just yet as the source said: ‘Charlie will reassess the child support . issue with Brooke in the next few months and see where things stand. He . wants her to get the help she needs.’ 'Unsafe': Social workers removed Mueller's four-year-old twins Bob and Max, pictured in LA in 2011, after her drug use was said to be jeopardising their safety . Although, his other ex wife Denise is an entirely different story. Sheen is reported have offered to give Richards more money for taking care of his two children while their mother Brooke is in rehab. But the actress politely declined. The show of gratitude comes after Sheen flew Denise home to Los Angeles from New York in a private jet so she could see her children on Mother’s Day. The Anger Management star also pays Denise $55,000 a month in child support, but wanted to give her more as she tended to his four-year-old twins from his marriage to Brooke. A source told RadarOnline.com: ‘Charlie is extremely generous, and wanted to make sure having the twins in Denise’s care didn’t place a financial strain on her. ‘Denise was thankful for the offer, but declined because she has the financial means to take care of them herself. She isn’t doing this for the money.’ Taking its toll? Denise looked very slender as she clutched the hand of one of Charlie's sons while picking up her daughters from their gymnastics class in Los Angeles . Heading in: Denise appeared stressed as she was photographed on the outing . And Sheen is aware of just how fortunate he is to have the gorgeous actress in his life. The same insider explained: ‘There have been many times over the last year that Charlie has said the best thing he ever did was marrying and having children with Denise, but the worst thing was ever letting her go. ‘Denise is the one person in his life that he truly trusts.’ The 42-year-old is intent upon providing the best possible environment for the boys but it isn’t easy, as the source explained: ‘Five kids under the age of nine in one house is chaos at times, but Denise manages.’ Adding, ‘All of the kids are thriving and love each other.’ While Richards won’t take more money for her act of kindness she did gleefully accept his offer to fly her home for Mother’s Day. The Wild Things actress was ‘bummed to miss her special holiday on Sunday as she was in New York City to film her TV show Twisted. But her former husband - with whom she shares two daughters, Sam, nine, and seven-year-old Lola - had his exclusive plane whisk her back to Los Angeles the same day so she could be with her kids. Doting mother: Denise Richards pictured with daughter's Sam and Lola in Los Angeles, on Wednesday . Denise wrote on Twitter: ‘Greatest ex @charliesheen my mom's day gift flying me home on his plane so I can take the kids to school.’ The 42-year-old beauty married the Hot Shots star in 2002, but their union ended acrimoniously in 2006 and Denise later filed a restraining order against her ex-spouse. However, the former lovers repaired their relationship for the sake of their kids and in recent years have grown very close. The Starship Troopers actress - who also has a two-year-old adopted daughter, Eloise - was recently granted temporary custody of Charlie's two children with his third wife, who was placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold amid allegations of drug use.","Brooke babbled about 'mafia connections' as police arrived at her house .

The era of Britain as a property-owning democracy is over, according to new figures which reveal record numbers of people now forced to rent. Levels of home ownership have slumped to just 64 per cent, its lowest levels since the mid-1980s when Margaret Thatcher declared her ambition to see more people able to buy a house. The last decade has instead seen the first rise in the percentage of households renting since 1918, the Office for National Statistics said. Experts put it down to first-time buyers struggling to get on the ladder as soaring prices have far outpaced incomes. Generation rent: The Office for National Statistics revealed how the proportion of home owners has fallen in the last decade for the first time in a century . A new study into the way Britain lives reveals the impact of rising house prices and the limited availability of mortgages on those struggling to get on the property ladder. In 2011, just 64 per cent of the 23.4million households owned their home while the remaining 36 per cent were rented. It is in stark contrast to the 69 per cent who were owner occupiers in 2001. In London, 50 per cent of households are . renters, the highest in the country according to the Office for National . Statistics data. It marks a reversal in the way Britons live. In 1918 more than three-quarters of households – 77 per cent – rented. The sharp rise in ownership accelerated from 1953 onwards, with the majority lived in properties they had bought by the early 19710s. The number of households rose from 2001 to 2011, with the increase entirely driven by people renting their homes . Between 2001 and 2011, the number of households buying their homes through a mortgage fell by 749,000. The ONS said high house prices, low wage growth and tighter rules imposed by lenders were to blame. Among the 8.3 million renters in 2011, those renting from private landlords or letting agents were up 1.7 million to 3.6 million compared to 2001, while those socially renting decreased by about 100, 000 to 4.1 million. All regions in England and Wales had increases in private renters, of which 343,000 were in London, 233,000 in the South East and 209,000 in the North West. Wales and the North East had the lowest increase with about 75,000 and 73,000 households respectively. Rising house prices, lower wage growth and tighter lending rules have made it harder to get on the property ladder . The ONS said: ‘The rapid increase in the number of households privately renting could be linked to the decline in the number of households getting on the housing ladder, usually through a mortgage. ‘This is mainly because of the increasing difficulty for first time buyers to raise deposits for a mortgage.’ Between 2001 and 2011 the average house price for first time buyers soared by an eye-watering 96 per cent, putting the dream of home ownership out of reach for millions. The problem was compounded by mortgage firms tightening rules on who they would lend to in the wake of the 2007 financial crash, as the era of near 100 per cent mortgages became a thing of the past. In 2001 the average house was six times average wages but a decade later it was nine times larger, forcing people to wait longer to save bigger deposits. Wokingham, Bracknell and Blaby had the highest level proportion of homes bought with a mortgage, while in East Dorset, Eats Devon and North Norfolk almost half of properties are owned outright. Almost half of homes in East Dorset are owned outright without a mortgage, a breakdown by the ONS revealed .","High house prices, low wage growth and a lack of mortgages blamed .

Asda, which started a forecourt price war when it dropped prices on Tuesday, said customers would pay no more than 131.7p a litre for petrol and 135.7p a litre for diesel across the country. The AA said that Britain's drivers are victims of a 'postcode lottery' Supermarkets have slashed 2p off the price of petrol - their lowest levels since January . Mark Todd of Morrisons said: . ‘Wholesale prices are continuing to fall and that’s great news for . customers because we’re able to keep passing these savings on to them.’ AA president Edmund King said the price reduction gave drivers ‘a breath of optimistic spring air’. Supermarket cuts had already helped . push the average price of petrol down to 136.89p a litre earlier this . week - 3.02p lower than a month ago. With wholesale fuel prices falling, the AA said yesterday that average petrol prices could soon fall to about 134p a litre.

Northern Ireland also has the dearest diesel (142.8p a litre), while Yorkshire and Humberside has the cheapest (140.8p), the AA said. Mr King said: 'Last April UK petrol consumption fell. In October it did the same. 'And in February the UK sold the lowest volume of petrol in 23 years of recording. 'In the past 12 months, oil and fuel price speculation has swung back and forth through the fuel market like a wrecking ball, smashing family budgets, pulverising fuel demand, and rocking the foundations of fuel retailer and other business viability.'

To have six begins to look like, well …  it’s probably time to move out. Except Tom Wardle, 67, and his  73-year-old wife Shirley can’t sell their house because it’s so accident-prone. Mr Wardle says the sixth car to hit his wall, above, was driven by a young man travelling over the speed limit . Mr Wardle, above, has had to repair the destruction and make £15,000 worth of insurance claims . They have had to rebuild their garden wall six times in less than three years, costing their insurers £15,000. The couple’s home in Bretforton, near . Evesham in Worcestershire, is in a 30mph zone, but sits 75 yards from a . sharp bend which is a notorious black spot. The first crash was in September 2010, just months after they put their four-bedroom home on the market for £350,000. The next crash happened in April 2011, followed by two in August the same year and a fifth last July. The most recent accident happened a week ago. Last year the couple took £75,000 off the asking price, but they have now given up all hope of finding a buyer. Mr Wardle, right, said: ‘These . crashes are obviously down to the road deteriorating because this never . used to happen. But the council won’t do anything about it. They put a . sign up, but people ignore it.’ The fifth car, above, was left in the familiar spot after skidding off the road in July 2012 . Car number four, above, came off the road on August 26, 2011, leaving the garden wall obliterated . The third car, above, destroyed the wall - which is 75 yards from the middle of a sharp bend - in August 2011 . ‘I need to get this sorted out because the crashes regularly destroy our home, and the council won’t respond to me. ‘It’s having a really bad effect on my health and my wife’s health, and it’s just so infuriating to see these cars knocking down my wall all the time. ‘Nothing will be done about it until someone dies. There are lots of schoolchildren that walk through here, so something needs to be done desperately. ‘Even when cars aren’t speeding they still skid round the bend, so it’s the road surface which isn’t good enough. ‘Every year we plant loads of daffodils and dinner plate dalia flowers, and every year they get destroyed.‘We were desperate to sell this house, but it’s just not going to happen, everyone knows about the trouble with it. ‘We’ve just given up now and took the house off the market.’ A driver smashed into their property just months they put it on the market for £350,000 in September 2010. Builders then had to repair the couple’s wall twice in one month after cars hit it on August 4 and 26 2011. The second car to crash into the home of Mr Wardle, who said the road needs to be resurfaced to improve grip . The garden wall in Bretforton, Worcestershire, was hit by the first car, above, in September 2010 . The latest incident took place on the evening of April 13 when a driver in his early twenties lost control and careered into the couple’s garden. Tom added: ‘People round here know how dangerous the road is, so they need to have more respect for my property. ‘This young lad the other day was definitely over the speed limit, and he didn’t even show any remorse afterwards. ‘Friends in the area told me he was on Facebook and Twitter afterwards laughing about it. It’s no laughing matter.’ Jon Fraser, highways manager at Worcestershire County Council, said: ‘We have taken Mr Wardle’s concerns very seriously and last year speed and skid resistance tests resulted in a permanent speed activated sign being installed at the bend on Bretforton Main Street. ‘Following the recent incident, the county highways’ inspectors will carry out a further assessment of the road surface which may have deteriorated over the winter months. ‘We will also liaise with West Mercia Police with the aim of increasing enforcement on site.’","Tom Wardle, 67, and wife Shirley, 73, have taken their house off the market .

Amanda Thomson was inspired to create a low-calorie version of the luxury drink after her job as a showbiz reporter made her worry about gaining weight from attending VIP parties. So she left her job as a journalist at BBC London and moved her family to Paris, where she studied under one of the world's pre-eminent wine experts. Ms Thomson, 40, has just signed an agreement to get her products into a top-class restaurant in the New Forest, and is hoping to bring it to leading mine merchants across the UK. New career: Amanda Thomson left her BBC job to become a winemaker and is now launching a low-calorie champagne made without added sugar . 'I developed a love of champagne when I was working as a showbiz reporter in London and basically lived off fizz and canapés as I was at parties and events all the time,' she told the Evening Standard. 'I started to think about the taste and what I liked rather than just glugging it, and decided I wanted to make wine my career - which is why my husband and I decided to move to Paris.' Last year, Ms Thomson graduated from a wine course at the elite Cordon Bleu cookery school. She was then hired by the Penet family to create a 'zero dosage' champagne at their vineyard in the Champagne region of north-east France. Zero dosage fizz does not have sugar added during manufacturing, unlike traditional champagne. Harvest: Workers in the Champagne region gather grapes for making sparkling wine (file photo) Ms Thomson's wine has just 60 calories in each glass - significantly less than the 100 calories found in most sparkling wines. 'The French don't really care about calories, but it's proving to be very popular in Britain and in the emerging Asian markets,' the budding winemaker said. 'It has an amazing taste but without the calories, which women in particular love.' The Alexandre Penet Zero Dosage Extra Brut champagne retails for £49.95 online. Ms Thomson recently agreed a deal to stock the wine at Hartnett Holder & Co, a new restaurant in the New Forest helmed by Michelin-starred chef Angela Hartnett.","Amanda Thomson, 40, quit BBC job to become a winemaker in France .

A sound-proofed cinema, a botanical garden, a grotto-style swimming pool … not to mention a garage for ten cars screened by a waterfall. It’s a mansion fit for a James Bond villain. Or, in this case, a 24-year-old painter and decorator and his wife who scooped £45million on the lottery. Newlyweds Matt and Cassey Topham have lodged plans for their dream house, a £5million eco-home called Serenity. Scroll down for video . Bolthole: Matt and Cassey Topham hope to build this home in the Nottinghamshire countryside . The futuristic property has four wings or ‘hubs’, which are covered in solar panels and arranged around a sunken courtyard. Designed to shield the couple from . prying eyes, it will also boast a snooker room, gym, jacuzzi, . acoustically-sealed pods and even staff quarters. It’s certainly a very long way from their old home, a £89,950 ex-council house in Stapleford, Nottinghamshire. Just after their Euromillions . windfall, in February 2012, Mr Topham told a press conference: ‘I have . often painted these huge houses and wondered what it would be like to . live in one. Now I can find out.’ Serenity’s architects describe the property as a ‘21st century update of the traditional country house’. Artist's impression: The house will have eight bedrooms plus a swimming pool and private cinema . Estate: The property is set in a country park which the couple bought for £1.2million . Change of scenery: Matt and Cassey Topham were living in this semi-detached house in Stapleford when they won their fortune . The plans involve demolishing a 1930s mansion overlooking a country park, which the couple bought for £1.2million last year. Its most remarkable feature is its . underground garage, built to accommodate the couple’s growing collection . of cars. After their windfall they swapped their Peugeot 107 city car . for a Jaguar XKR-S and Range Rover Evoque,  worth a combined £150,000. Mr Topham is also said to have also splashed out on a Porsche and Aston . Martin DB9. The cars will be glimpsed through a waterfall, created from rainwater which will collect in a pool at the centre of the house. This will cascade into a second pool . below, producing a ‘water curtain’. In a statement released through . their architects yesterday, Mr Topham and his 23-year-old wife, a former . Iceland supermarket supervisor, said: ‘Must-haves [for the new house] . included five bedrooms, a dramatic sweeping staircase, a large garage . and a grotto-style pool. Jackpot: Mr and Mrs Topham won £45million on the EuroMillions lottery last February . Generous: The pair have paid off relatives' mortgages and given millions away to close friends . ‘We also spent a lot of time debating . with the architect how the rooms would be used and the split between . open plan and entertaining spaces versus cosy, snug rooms.  We were very . clear we didn’t want to live in a glass box. At the very top of our . wish list was a strong desire to keep the design contemporary yet . familiar, and flexible enough to accommodate a future family.’ They told London-based architects Baca the new home had to be ‘luxurious, environmentally-friendly and playful.’ The four hubs will be divided into ‘a . formal entertaining hub, a family hub, games hub and an annex’, with a . half-storey of steps between each. Richard Coutts, of Baca, said: . ‘Visitors arrive via a grand hall where a majestic staircase sweeps up . to a cinema room and study, contained in two acoustically sealed pods . hovering above a drawing room.’ The Nottinghamshire project is likely . to be one of the most ambitious new homes built in the UK. Baca . submitted an application yesterday, but planners are unlikely to . consider it until the summer. Last night Mr Topham’s father, Brian, . said the couple were enjoying an extended touring holiday in America. He . said they had had a ‘lot of input’ into the design of their planned . home, adding: ‘I’m not going to say where the house will be built but it . is quite local. ‘Matt has no plans to move – all his friends are around here.’","Matt and Cassey Topham apply to build new home in Nottinghamshire .

Police arrested the driver of a 44-tonne car transporter for drink-driving - and found he had a stash of 60 cans of lager and two bottles of wine in his cab. Karl Doyley, 44, 'stank of booze' when he arrived at a car dealership in Derby to drop off six cars. Tests revealed the trucker - who was about to drive on another 30 miles - was almost three times the drink-drive limit. Drunk at the wheel: Karl Doyley, 44, 'stank of booze' when he arrived at TC Harrison in Derby driving a 44-tonne transporter like the one pictured left . Police arrested him at the scene and stopped him taking his 22ft long transporter on to Chesterfield, Derbyshire. Officers asked Doyley to take a breathalyser test which found he had 95mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath. A second test in custody, taken around an hour later, found the reading was even higher at 99mg. The legal limit is 35mg. A worker at the TC Harrison Ford garage in Derby said the driver arrived at their Pride Park dealership at around 6pm on March 27. He said: 'Once it was clear that he was drunk and then told us he was going on to Chesterfield to deliver more cars after he left Derby I knew I had to act. 'There was no way I was going to let him back on the road and possibly kill someone because of the drunken state he was in. 'I couldn't, and I don't think any right-minded person, could have that on their conscience. 'What made it more remarkable was that when the police arrived and he opened up the door of his cab there must have been 60 cans of lager in there and two bottles of wine. Guilty: Doyley admitted drink driving when he appeared before magistrates at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court . 'Some were empty and lying on the floor and some were in a refrigerator he had in his cab. 'This man had already said he had delivered cars and was then planning on driving another 30 miles or so in the state he was in. It beggars belief.' At Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court, Doyley, of Banbury, Oxfordshire, pleaded guilty to drink-driving. Magistrates disqualified him from driving for 26 months, gave him a community order to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. They also told him to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. He was offered a drink-driving awareness course to reduce his ban by six months. Chief Inspector Steve Wilson, head of roads policing in Derbyshire, said: 'Without the diligence and the vigilance of the staff at TC Harrison this drink-driver could have got behind the wheel of his 44-tonne vehicle and put lives at risk. 'Their quick thinking has stopped what might have been an extremely dangerous situation whereby someone has got behind the wheel of a 22ft long lorry and carried on driving whilst in the intoxicated state they were in. 'It is always refreshing to see the positive attitudes people take against those who drink-drive.'","Karl Doyley, 44, 'stank of booze' when he arrived at car dealership in 44-tonne transporter .

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 12:07 EST, 19 January 2012 . Russia has warned of a 'very big war' causing suffering across the world if Western countries encourage anti-government uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Western meddling would lead to 'a very big war that will cause suffering not only to countries in the region, but also to states far beyond its boundaries', the New York Times reported. It came as Iran's foreign minister warned its Arab neighbours not to put themselves in a 'dangerous position' by allying themselves too closely with the U.S. in the escalating row over Tehran's nuclear activity. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov (left) warned of a 'very big war' if Western countries meddled in the Middle East, as Iran's foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi (right) told Arab neighbours not to cosy up to the U.S. Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, used for a third of the world's seaborne oil trade, if pending Western moves to ban Iranian crude exports cripple its lifeblood energy sector. A 'seriously worried' Lavrov spoke yesterday at his annual press conference, where he said a military attack on Iran would trigger a 'chain reaction' to destabilise the world. New sanctions against Tehran over its disputed nuclear programme would also 'stifle' the Iranian economy and hurt its people, he warned. He added: 'The consequences will be extremely grave. It's not going to be an easy walk. It will trigger a chain reaction and I don't know where it will stop.' Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi echoed the fears during a visit to Turkey today where he said: 'We want peace and tranquillity in the region. 'But some of the countries in our region, they want to direct other countries 12,000 miles away from this region. I am calling to all countries in the region, please don't let yourselves be dragged into a dangerous position.' Warning: U.S. President Barack Obama (left) is reported to have written to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (right) about the closure of the Strait of Hormuz . The remarks were an apparent reference to the alliance of Iran's Arab neighbours with the U.S., which has a huge fleet in the Gulf and says it will keep the waterway open. Salehi added that the U.S. should make clear that it was open for negotiations with Tehran without conditions. Iran would use 'advanced technology' and 'guerilla tactics' in any battle against the U.S. military, a report has revealed. Before that, Iran would first lean hard on weaker Middle Eastern nations to convince those states to deny Washington access to bases on their soil, it states. It also predicts Iranian ballistic missile launches on Gulf cities in an attempt to convince other nations to resist providing support to an American military operation. And it forecasts efforts by Tehran to use Shiite Muslim 'proxy groups' to attack U.S. allies in the region. Similar groups plagued the U.S.-led war effort in Iraq for years, and some officials and experts said they acted with Tehran's backing. Iran also could use new weapons, like advanced ballistic missiles, to attack U.S. bases and other forces positioned around the Persian Gulf. Mark Gunzinger, an analyst at the Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington, which has ties to the Pentagon, wrote the report. He referred to a letter Iran says it received from U.S. President Barack Obama about the situation in the Straight of Hormuz, the contents of which have not been made public. He said: 'Mr Obama sent a letter to Iranian officials, but America has to make clear that it has good intentions and should express that it's ready for talks without conditions. 'Out in the open they show their muscles but behind the curtains they plead to us to sit down and talk. 'America has to pursue a safe and honest strategy so we can get the notion that America this time is serious and ready.' The U.S., like other Western countries, says it is prepared to talk to Iran but only if Tehran agrees to discuss halting its enrichment of uranium. Western officials say Iran has been asking for talks 'without conditions' as a stalling tactic while refusing to put its nuclear programme on the table. With EU foreign ministers preparing to approve a phased ban on imports of Iranian oil at a meeting on January 23, Salehi said yesterday that his country was in touch with world powers to reopen talks frozen for a year. Washington and the EU have denied this, saying they are still waiting for Iran to show it wanted serious negotiations addressing fears that it trying to master ways to build atom bombs behind the facade of a civilian nuclear energy programme. In addition to an embargo on Iran's economically vital oil exports, EU diplomats said member governments had agreed in principle to freeze assets of Iran's central bank, but had yet to agree how to protect non-oil trade from sanctions. Concerns: Iranian oil workers may soon find themselves out of work if sanctions to stop the sale of the product kick in . Iranian politicians said Obama had expressed readiness to negotiate in a letter to Iran's clerical supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 'In this letter it was said that closing the Strait of Hormuz is our (U.S.) 'red line' and also asked for direct negotiations,' the semi-official Fars news agency quoted lawmaker Ali Mottahari as saying. The chief of the UN's nuclear . watchdog said it was his duty to warn the world about Iran's suspected . development of nuclear weapons. The comments from Yukiya Amano, . director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, maintained . pressure on Tehran ahead of rare talks between Iran and the agency later . this month. He made clear in an interview with . Financial Times Deutschland that the UN body would press for full . co-operation in meetings with Iranian officials in Tehran. He said: 'What we know suggests the . development of nuclear weapons. We want to check over everything that . could have a military dimension.' He also said Iran had so far failed to clarify allegations of possible military links to its nuclear programme. An IAEA delegation is expected to . seek explanations for intelligence indicating Iran has engaged in . research and development relevant for nuclear weapons. Washington denied there were any new discussions under way about resuming talks with Iran, but declined to comment on whether Obama had written to Khamenei. 'There are no current talks about talks,' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said yesterday. She added: 'What we are doing, as we have said, is making clear to the Iranians that if they are serious about coming back to a conversation, where they talk openly about their nuclear programme, and if they are prepared to come clean with the international community, that we are open to that.' The die was cast for international oil sanctions against Iran when Obama signed legislation on December 31 that would freeze out any institution dealing with Iran's central bank, making it impossible for most countries to buy Iranian oil. Similar measures are expected from Europe this month. One EU diplomat said yesterday: 'On the central bank, things have been moving in the right direction in the last hours. There is now a wide agreement on the principle. Discussions continue on the details.' The U.S. State Department denial about talks was echoed by a spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who represents the six world powers trying to engage with Iran. The spokesman said: 'There are no negotiations under way on new talks. We are still waiting for Iran to respond to the substantive proposals the High Representative (Ashton) made in her letter from October.' Worries: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (left), who met former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro (right) in Havana last week, could see his country facing stricter sanctions . Ashton underlined that talks must focus on Iran's underground uranium enrichment activity, whereas Tehran has wanted to discuss only broader security issues up to now. Tehran denies wanting nuclear bombs, saying its enrichment work is for power generation and medical applications. But a U.N. nuclear watchdog report in November lent weight to concerns that Iran has worked on designing a nuclear weapon, and Tehran is shifting enrichment to an underground bunker in a mountain fortified against air attack. Strategic: About one sixth of the world's oil trade flows through the Strait of Hormuz, pictured . Israel, which is believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal but sees Iran's nuclear ambitions as a mortal threat, and the United States have not ruled out military action as a last resort to prevent an atomic 'breakout' by Tehran. However, Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said on Wednesday that any decision about an Israeli assault on Iran was 'very far off'. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Iran had to be ready for serious negotiations. He told a new conference in Brazil: 'It is significant that when we are discussing additional sanctions in the European Union an offer of negotiations emerges from Iran. 'We will not be deterred from imposing additional sanctions simply by the suggestion there may be negotiations. We want to see actual negotiations.' The last talks between Iran and the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China - along with Germany stalled in Istanbul a year ago, with the parties unable to agree even on an agenda. The six countries have also failed to agree on a common line in their relations with Iran. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao defended his country's extensive oil trade with Iran against Western sanctions pressure in comments published today. Even so, he said Beijing firmly opposes any efforts by Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons.","Russian foreign minister says war would cause 'suffering across the world'

Foreign newspapers and columnists have roundly criticised the new British press regulation system, with one describing it as ‘scary’ and another as 'a mess'. Canada’s Toronto Star said it was ‘as if crime victims had helped judges establish sentencing guidelines’ and the Australian warned of a ‘press regulator with the power to maul unruly hacks’. The New York Times added that 'it would be perverse if regulations enacted in response to this scandal ended up stifling the kind of hard-hitting investigative journalism that brought it to light in the first place'. Worried: The New York Times voiced its concerns over 'regulations enacted in response to this scandal' that could 'stifle the kind of hard-hitting investigative journalism that brought it to light in the first place' And Arthur Macdonald of the Gulf Daily News in Bahrain said: ‘We already have in place the best regulatory force of any organisation on the planet.

Public outrage over phone hacking, which went beyond celebrities to include victims of crime and abducted children, pushed the Government to act, but it said it had still protected press freedom. The compromise will establish a new press regulator, introduce fines of up to £1million and oblige newspapers to print prominent apologies where appropriate.

The Welsh writer's clifftop home at New Quay, overlooking Cardigan Bay, was once stormed by a spurned husband who accused Thomas of sleeping with his wife and fired his machine gun through the window. William Killick, who had just come home from the Second World War, also let off a grenade at the poet's bungalow in the 1945 attack which was later featured in the 2008 Hollywood film The Edge Of Love. Majoda, the clifftop bungalow where Dylan Thomas lived with wife Caitlin in 1944 is now for sale for £450,000 . Dylan Thomas and his wife Caitlin moved into the modest bungalow at New Quay in September 1944 . The legendary writer moved into the house, which he called the 'shack at the end of a cliff', in September 1944 with his wife Caitlin MacNamara. While at the house, called Majoda, he was inspired to write the radio piece Quite Early One Morning, a sketch for his later piece Under Milk Wood.  He also wrote several poems, including Fern Hill, which he began at Majoda and completed the following summer while living in Blaen Cwm. But it was a bitter fight by a husband who believed Thomas had cuckolded him that earned the house a place in cinematic history. One night in March 1945, when the pubs had closed and Thomas was drinking with some friends at his clifftop home, recently-returned Army captain William Killick marched up to the window and fired a Sten gun through it. Having recently returned from the war in Greece, Killick believed Thomas to have been having an affair with his wife - and Thomas' childhood friend - Vera Phillips. In his jealous rage, Killick then marched into the bungalow and fired off another round before threatening to let off a hand grenade. Keira Knightley as Vera Phillips and Sienna Miller as Caitlin MacNamara in the movie release 'The Edge of Love' The producers recreated the house as it was when Thomas lived in it down to the last detail for the 2008 film . No-one was hurt in the attack, but . Killick was later charged with attempted murder, and the story was told . in The Edge Of Love starring Matthew Rhys as Thomas, Sienna Miller as . Caitlin, and Keira Knightley as Vera. Now . this modest piece of Welsh literary history is for sale with a few more . modern comforts than the poet would have known, including double . glazing to keep out the bitter winds sweeping in off the sea. Estate . agent Fred Davies, who is selling Majoda, said: 'It is a beautiful . property with unrivalled, breathtaking views, wonderful grounds and its . own access to the beach.' Local writer and Dylan Thomas expert Roger Bryan said: 'There were certainly shots fired at the property. The sitting room at the £450,000 bungalow in New Quay has stunning views over the Bay of Cardigan . The house has been entirely renovated and boasts no trace of William Killick's furious machine gun fire . The furious William Killick strode through the door of the house and let off his Sten gun in March 1945 . Dylan Thomas only lived to the age of 39, when he died of pneumonia in New York . 'The story goes that Killick seized a machine gun and a hand grenade, and fired a number of shots at Majoda. 'Fortunately no-one was injured, but Dylan was clearly shaken up.' Shortly after the incident Dylan moved out of the house - where he had paid just £1 a week in a rent but managed without running water and electricity. New Quay is believed to be the inspiration for the fictitious Llareggub in his play for voices, Under Milk Wood. The house has since been rebuilt and the 2008 film was shot at a full-size mock-up in the field next-door to it. The garden at the Welsh bungalow saw some heavy carousing when hard-drinking Dylan Thomas was there . With its sweeping views over Cardigan Bay, Majoda inspired some of Thomas' most famous works . The property sits on top of a cliff overlooking Cardigan Bay and boasts a large garden and UPVC double-glazing . The story of the cottage has gone down as part of the legend surrounding the poet who died in 1953 aged just 39. But the truth of the affair remains under dispute with some claiming the details were embellished for Hollywood. At the time Dylan’s wife Caitlin wrote: 'Frank was convinced that his wife had been living with us in a menage a trois (which was a ridiculous thought) while he had been away. 'And that we had been drinking too much of his money (there may have been some truth in that).'","Poet moved to spot overlooking Cardigan Bay with wife Caitlin in 1944 .

Over 50 channels are now . subscription-only, but not all paid-for channels can be subscribed to in . the UK - namely Jim Henson Family TV, and National Geographic Kids. Comedy.TV is just one of the 53 YouTube channels that will now charge you to watch videos. Monthly subscriptions start at 79p, although individual channels can charge more. Each channel comes with a 14-day free trial and subscriptions can be cancelled at any time . YouTube has over 1 million channels. More than 1 billion unique users visit YouTube each month. Over 4 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube. 72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. 70% of YouTube traffic comes from outside the US. YouTube is localized in 53 countries and across 61 languages. In 2011, YouTube had more than 1 trillion views or around 140 views for every person on Earth. Millions of free subscriptions happen each day. Free subscriptions allow you to connect with channels you're interested in and keep up with their activity on the site. Rumours about the launch surfaced . earlier this week. The video site, owned by Google, then confirmed plans on its official blog on Friday. Paying customers will be able to get access to exclusive videos, TV shows and films from select specialist channels. Paying a subscription also removes adverts on certain channels. Each subscription comes with a 14-day free trial. You can cancel a subscription at any time. YouTube is also offering subscription deals to people who subscribe to more than one channel. For example, if you subscribe to SmartTV.com for £6.49 a month, you get access to Cars.TV, Comedy.TV, ES.TV, JusticeCentral.TV, MyDestination.TV, Pets.TV and Recipe.TV. YouTube revamped the site and introduced channels in December 2011. In October 2012, the site launched 60 partner channels, including BBC Worldwide On Earth, ITN, the Jamie Oliver Food Channel and Mixmag TV. Other partners include Channel 4 and Film 4, Howcast and The Onion and the site said it now has over 1 million channels. YouTube has said that more of these partner channels are expected to be added to the subscription list in due course. The extra money made from subscriptions is expected to fund new TV and film shows that will be shown exclusively online. Paid-for subscriptions are an alternative way for YouTube to make money, in addition to its advertising revenues. The new channels have helped expand YouTube’s audience to 1bn users who watch 6bn hours of video each month. You can already subscribe to get updates from other channels for free. Over 50 channels have signed up to the subscription service. YouTube has over 1million partners including Howcast, BBC and Channel 4 and more are expected to be added the service in due course. Channels can use the money to show archived content or preview exclusive clips and shows . Stuart Fuller, Director of Commercial Operations and Communications at NetNames, commented on the launch: 'The growing popularity of on-demand video channels such as those offered by Netflix and LoveFilm has led to many users abandoning YouTube. 'Google will intend to better control content that is uploaded on to YouTube through such pay models, and hence avoiding painful and costly task of taking down pirated content online. 'Consumers will need to start getting used to this type of online models. 'Subscription models are only set to become more and more common in future.' Rumours about paid-for subscriptions . began in January when AdAge reported YouTube had been in touch with a . 'small group of channel producers'. At the time, a Google spokesman said: 'We're looking into creating a subscription platform that could bring even more great content to YouTube for our users to enjoy and provide our creators with another vehicle to generate revenue from their content, beyond the rental and ad-supported models we offer.' Then in February, Android fan blog Android Police noticed the YouTube app had been updated to include 'channel subscribe' code. YouTube is also believed to be considering charging for content libraries and access to live events on a pay-per-view basics . The code appeared to describe a function in the app which tells users they can only subscribe to or unsubscribe from paid channels from their desktop or laptop computers.

YouTube has launched the paid-for subscription as an experiment. The . revenue split between YouTube and the channel producers is expected to . be similar to the 45-55 split that YouTube currently has with . advertising revenue. At a media conference last year, YouTube's CEO Salar Kamangar said that a subscription model would give TV networks and producers of these networks a more direct line to their audience with lower costs.

The Skoda Yeti came top in a national satisfaction survey, with two other Skoda models also making the top ten. The flagship Skoda Superb was second and the Skoda Octavia sixth – not at all bad for a car which was once known for the comedy it produced, not its quality. The Skoda Yeti (pictured) has come top in a national satisfaction survey, while two other Skoda models also made the top ten . More than 46,000 car owners took part in this year’s survey, for Auto Express. The Yeti, which costs from £14,945 to £26,400 for a top of the range model, achieved a top score of 92.65 per cent in overall satisfaction ratings. According to the magazine, the Yeti is a ‘compact sports utility vehicle offering multi-purpose practicality, hatchback handling and genuine off-road ability in a great value package’. Britain’s Jaguar XF saloon took third spot in the survey followed by the Renault Scenic, Mazda CX-5, Skoda Octavia, Alfa Romeo Giulietta, Land Rover Discovery, BMW 3 series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Editor-in-chief of Auto Express, Steve Fowler, said: ‘We’ve always liked the Yeti – it’s a former Auto Express Car of the Year – so it’s great to see so many owners agreeing with us. They like its practicality, the tech on board and how easy and enjoyable it is to drive.’ Newcomers to the top ten list were the British-built Land Rover Discovery and the multi-purpose Renault Scenic. Mr Fowler said: ‘For the British company especially, it’s great news given the recent launch of premium new models like the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport – they’re clearly moving in the right direction.’ Czech car-maker Skoda has undergone a huge image change since it was taken over by German car giant Volkswagen in the early 1990s. Before that, its unreliable reputation made it the butt of countless jokes, such as  ‘how do you double the value of a Skoda? Fill it with petrol’. But last month sales of new Skodas hit an all-time high in Britain, with car registrations breaking the 9,000 barrier for the first time. A total of 9,711 customers bought a 13-plate Skoda in March, up 14.2 per cent on last year.

Vincent Van Gogh is renowned as one of the world's greatest-ever artists, whose work continues to inspire people almost 125 years after his death. And now a London street - close to where he once lived and fell in love - has been renamed in . his honour. Residents have used its association with the Post-Impressionist to inspire the transformation of what they said was once a no-go area.

Vincent van Gogh lived in nearby Hackford Road where he fell in love with his landlady's daughter . Isabel Street in Stockwell has been renamed Van Gogh Walk and the road is now filled with blue and yellow flowers in honour of his great work painting cypresses, what fields and, of course, sunflowers. Sculptor Bill Hudson has also created a timber piece that has been installed in Van Gogh Walk. His life and apparent suicide aged just 37 is widely known is the time he spent in London where he fell in love with his landlady's daughter. In 1873, Van Gogh moved to London aged 20 when he was working for a firm of art dealers. He lived at 87 Hackford Road - close to the newly created Van Gogh Walk - as a lodger and wrote of enjoying watching the bustling capital city. In one letter he wrote: 'Things are going well for me here. I have a wonderful home and it's a great pleasure for me to observe London and the English way of life and the English themselves.' But the artist's contented London life turned sour after he fell in love with his landlady's daughter. Sadly for him, she did not return his affection and he left Hackford Road in 1874 following a visit from his sister Anne. He died in 1890, aged 37, after apparently shooting himself in the head. His association with the Stockwell has inspired locals to transform a part of it. Elaine Kramer, who chairs the Grass Routes campaign group, told The Evening Standard that the Van Gogh Walk project 'puts our area on the map for positive reasons'. Plants and flowers are now growing in the road that residents said was once a no-go area . Van Gogh lived at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell, for a year and a blue plaque now adorns the house .

After searching high and low for the red Burmese tom, then aged seven, she had finally come to terms with the fact she would never see him again. But more than ten years later Mrs White, 56, has finally welcomed her beloved pet back into her home in Pilgrims Hatch, near Brentwood, Essex. Grandmother Sue White was inconsolable when her beloved at Miko went missing in August 2002. She searched high and low for him, but simply could not find him anywhere . But more than ten years later Mrs White, 56, has finally welcomed her beloved pet back into her home in Pilgrims Hatch, near Brentwood, Essex . A member of the public found him and took him to a vet where he was identified thanks to his microchip. And although nobody knows where Miko has spent the last decade - it seems he may not have gone too far - as he was discovered just six miles from his owner's home. Mother-of-one Mrs White, who had moved to a new house shortly before Miko vanished, said: 'Seeing him again was an absolutely fantastic feeling. I am  walking around with a permanent grin on my face. 'I look at him even now and just can't believe that I have got him back - it still feels quite surreal really. 'It is so amazing. What's happened to me, let's face it, it's a miracle. 'It would be nice to know where he has been all this time - if only cats could talk.' Brs White who works as Brentwood Borough Council's insurance officer, scoured the area around her home for Miko when he disappeared, putting up missing cat posters and pushing similar leaflets through letterboxes of 200 homes. She said: 'I was devastated when he went missing - I cried my eyes out and everything. It was horrible - it felt like I had lost a child. 'After 18 months I thought that the chance of ever getting him back was slim but I never stopped thinking of him. 'I used to do a lot of running in the local area and I used to wonder then if I would ever see him. 'You just don't know do you? Cats can travel for miles.' She said she was stunned to pick up an answer phone message earlier this month from a veterinary practice in Blackmore - six miles from her home - telling her a woman had found Miko and brought him in. She said: 'When I heard the message I couldn't believe it. 'As soon as I saw him I knew it was him and so did my son Tristan. He went straight up to my son and nuzzled his head onto his arm. Although it is not known where intrepid Miko - now 17 - has spent the last decade, he was discovered just six miles away from his home thanks to his electronic microchip . 'I couldn't believe it, I was just bouncing up and down. I even texted my ex-husband and said ""You are not going to believe this, I have got Miko back"".' She said Miko's coat was in fantastic condition and she was sure somebody had been looking after him. She said: 'He is underweight at the moment and he was very weak on his back legs when I got him home - he could barely walk around the house. 'The first time he tried to get up the stairs he really had to drag his back legs but now he is eating he is a changed cat. 'He is jumping up on the bed and he is obviously feeling a lot better in himself. 'I can tell that his sight is going, plus he's got renal failure, although that's now under control with tablets. 'My first Burmese, Shogan, only made it to 11 because he had renal failure quite early on, so in many ways I am surprised to see him alive. 'He always was a loving cat and that hasn't changed despite him being away for ten years.' Student veterinary nurse Danielle Fowles, 22, was on duty at House and Jackson veterinary practice in Blackmore when a member of the public bought Miko in.

The scene could hardly have been more romantic as Vicky Pryce linked arms with her husband Chris Huhne while the sun set over the Aegean. Yet as they posed as one big happy family for a wedding photograph in Greece, only Huhne could have known they were living one big fat lie. To his trusting family, he was playing the dutiful stepfather as he gave away Georgia – his wife’s elder daughter from her first marriage. Line-up: Vicky Pryce links arms with her husband Chris Huhne as a family photo is taken after the ceremony in Varkiza - the 'Athens Riviera' Unsuspecting? Vicky Pryce and Chris Huhne at the wedding in Greece in September 2009 . Little did any of them suspect that, back in Britain, he was cheating on his family with his bisexual mistress Carina Trimingham. His double life was to blow the family apart and set his scorned wife on a path of revenge that culminated in them both facing jail. But on that balmy evening in September 2009, shameless Huhne soaked up the acclaim as he basked in the role of a proud father of the bride at the ceremony in Varkiza – a posh suburb of the Greek capital known as the ‘Athens Riviera’. He led 33-year-old Georgia down the aisle at the pretty cliff-top chapel where she married Ed Beesley. Then Huhne lined up for photographs flanked by the bride and his wife Vicky, who looked happy and suntanned in a black and white African print dress and a pearl necklace.

The shadow of secret justice has ‘chillingly’ reached the highest court in Britain, campaigners warned last night. Liberty reacted with horror to a ruling by the Supreme Court that it was prepared to consider material delivered behind closed doors. In the past, neither the court nor its predecessor - the Law Lords - had considered secret evidence. Isabella Sankey, Director of Policy for Liberty, said that the Supreme Court had no statutory power to consider the ruling, delivered by High Court judge Mr Justice Mitting (left) But a panel of nine Supreme Court justices concluded that the court had the jurisdiction to consider a secret High Court ruling based on evidence given to a judge at a private hearing. Liberty had argued - at a Supreme Court hearing in London - that the Supreme Court had no statutory power to consider the ruling, delivered by High Court judge Mr Justice Mitting three years ago. Isabella Sankey, Director of Policy for Liberty, said: ‘Chillingly the shadow of secret justice now spreads to the highest court in the land.’ The Supreme Court justices had been considering a secret ruling given during a case involving the Government and an Iranian bank accused of indirectly helping finance Iran’s nuclear weapons programme. Bank Mellat is trying to overturn an order, made by the Treasury under counter-terrorism legislation, which bars it from operating in the UK. Bank bosses say the order is unlawful and unfair. They have appealed to the Supreme Court after failing to persuade the High Court and the Court of Appeal to overturn the order. Mr Justice Mitting had heard evidence behind closed doors when Bank Mellat mounted a High Court challenge in 2010 - and delivered a secret judgment based on that evidence. The Court of Appeal considered that secret judgment before dismissing Bank Mellat’s appeal in 2011. Treasury ministers, who have the power to impose sanctions on anyone involved in nuclear weapons development which poses a 'significant risk' to the UK, had argued that the Supreme Court could and should consider Mr Justice Mitting’s secret judgment before ruling on Bank Mellat’s latest appeal. But Bank Mellat, which has not seen Mr Justice Mitting’s secret ruling, had argued that the Supreme Court had no statutory power to consider the secret judgment and did not need to consider the secret judgment when making a decision on whether or not to overturn the Treasury order. Liberty had also said the Supreme Court had no statutory power to consider secret material. Lord Neuberger said justices had decided that the Supreme Court had the jurisdiction to consider Mr Justice Mitting’s secret judgment. But he said justices had yet to decide whether they needed to consider the ruling in order to make a decision on Bank Mellat’s appeal, which continues.

Byron Myers claims he was forced out of the BBC after blowing the whistle on suspected fraud . The BBC threatened one of its own staff with prison when he blew the whistle on suspected fraud to the Daily Mail, a tribunal has heard. Byron Myers, a former head of human resources, discovered that a BBC manager was signing off lucrative payments to his girlfriend’s company, First Positions. The suspected conspiracy involved payments worth tens of thousands of pounds, it was claimed. Mr Myers said that when he reported his suspicions, in 2011, there was ‘a cover-up’. In 2012, Mr Myers decided to alert the public by taking his evidence to the Daily Mail, which conducted an investigation and published an article. But the BBC responded by threatening him with ‘a prison sentence’ for leaking information. Mr Myers, 39, of Central London, told the tribunal: ‘I contacted the Daily Mail newsroom. I met with a journalist. At our meeting I told him the whole story of my employment with the BBC. 'I explained the matter around First Positions and what had happened. He asked me if I had raised the First Positions matter with the BBC. I confirmed that I had repeatedly. ‘The BBC had been very aggressive because I had leaked the story. ‘The BBC’s lawyers had written to me and attached a copy of the Computer Misuse Act, with prison sentence attached to it.’ He added: ‘This was potentially a fraud allegation. There was a cover-up. There was an organisational cover-up.’ The evidence came in an employment tribunal at Watford between Mr Myers and the BBC. He accuses the corporation of forcing him out after he turned whistleblower. Mr Myers had discovered that £70,000-a-year BBC manager Craig White, 47, was signing off payments to studio staff supplied by private firms, one of which was run by his lover, 47-year-old Jane Fleury. Mr White personally authorised payments of £69,000 to Miss Fleury’s First Positions Ltd. And over a three-year period, staff in his department had paid a total of £1.6million to the same company – before Mr White declared a ‘conflict of interest’ to the BBC. Mr Myers discovered that Craig White, left, was signing off payments to studio staff supplied by private firms, one of which was run by his lover Jane Fleury, right . Miss Fleury is a former BBC manager and First Positions is an agency she set up seven years ago to supply studio crew. They have worked on some of the BBC’s most popular programmes. The couple are both listed on the electoral roll at Miss Fleury’s Grade-II listed Cotswold stone townhouse in Burford, Oxfordshire. Corporation chiefs were urged to investigate suspicions of a possible conspiracy over the payments, which had soared 2,500 per cent in two years. The tribunal heard that one of the BBC’s own lawyers, Laura Juliet, advised in May 2011: ‘The important thing now is to carry out a full investigation... to establish whether there has been any conspiracy’. But this legal advice was allegedly ‘ignored’ on the orders of the BBC’s highest-paid boss, John Smith, who at the time was the £1million-a-year chief executive of BBC Worldwide. Mr Myers claimed the BBC’s audit . department ‘had been told by John Smith to ignore the legal advice and . simply do a review’, the tribunal was told. Mr Smith, who left the corporation last year after 23 years, is about to join luxury retailer Burberry as chief operating officer. Mr Smith is due to give evidence later, and it is understood he will strenuously reject the suggestion he ignored legal advice, and will say he ordered an independent investigation. The BBC’s investigation into the dealings between it and First Positions produced a single-page report, exonerating all concerned. Mr White told the Mail he had been cleared of any wrongdoing. At the tribunal, Caspar Glyn QC, for the BBC, repeatedly accused Mr Myers of fabricating conversations to bolster his claims, suggesting he had ‘made up a series of wholly untrue fictional lies’. Mr Myers insisted he was telling the truth. Last night the BBC said: ‘We are vigorously contesting the Employment Tribunal claim made by Mr Myers. It is inappropriate for us to comment further during the tribunal.’ The tribunal continues.","Byron Myers said he was forced out of job when he turned whistleblower .

Unknown: Identity of 82-year-old arrested in Jimmy Savile investigation is still kept secret . The identity of a household-name celebrity arrested by the Jimmy Savile police squad was being kept a mystery  last night. The 82-year-old star was detained on suspicion of sexual offences by officers from Operation Yewtree. He was questioned on Thursday and released on police bail to a date in May pending further inquiries. Yesterday neither he nor his agent or lawyers responded to requests for comment. There were four cars on the gated drive of the celebrity’s riverside house in Berkshire, and people could be seen inside, but nobody would comment. When a reporter identified himself over the intercom, a woman said: ‘Good for you.’ The star was first interviewed under caution on November 29 last year. That month, officers also executed a search warrant. The entertainer is one of 11 people arrested so far under Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police’s £1million investigation sparked by Savile’s decades of offending. Scotland Yard said the arrested man falls into the category of its investigation termed ‘others’. This means he is suspected of sexual offences that are not connected to Savile’s offending. Earlier this week, the Mail revealed that as few as three of the 11 men arrested by Scotland Yard over suspected sex offences in the Savile case are likely to be charged. Details of the small number of likely Yewtree prosecutions emerged a day after a former BBC producer was released without charge following his arrest over an alleged sex assault in 1965. Wilfred De’Ath, 75, who spent four months on bail before being cleared, accused police of being ‘over-zealous’, pursuing ‘spurious’ claims, and failing ‘lamentably’ to stop Savile’s reign of terror while he was still alive. Cleared: Former BBC producer Wilfred De'Ath spent four months on bail before he was cleared by police . Arrested: Both PR guru Max Clifford, left, and DJ Dave Lee Travis have been arrested by Yewtree detectives . The police operation, which has 30 dedicated detectives, has been criticised by some as a ‘celebrity witch-hunt’. There has been growing speculation that comedian Freddie Starr could soon be told that he, too, will not be charged. He strenuously denies claims that he attempted to grope a 14-year-old girl in Savile’s BBC changing room in 1974. If, as seems likely, only a handful of men are charged, there are sure to be uncomfortable questions for the police over the probe. Yard chiefs insist all arrests by the Yewtree detectives were ‘necessary and proportionate’. Other celebrities arrested by the Yewtree squad include the comedian Jim Davidson, PR guru Max Clifford and disgraced pop star Gary Glitter, all of whom deny wrongdoing. Davidson, 59, was detained over historic sex allegations – not involving children – shortly before he was due to appear on Celebrity Big Brother in January and rearrested last week over new allegations dating back to 1978. DJ Dave Lee Travis, 67, was also rearrested over sex allegations involving adults. He too denies wrongdoing.

Theresa May last night killed-off plans to bring an immediate end to the scandal of foreign criminals claiming a human right to a ‘family life’ in Britain. The Home Secretary refused to support a simple nine-word amendment which would have stopped the convicts blocking deportation under article 8 of the Human Rights Act. The measure, which could have passed within weeks as part of the Crime and Courts Bill, was supported by more than 90 Tories and the ex-Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett. Backtrack: Theresa May refused to sign an amendment that would have made it impossible for foreign criminals to claim a right to a family life in the UK . They had hoped Mrs May - who has spoken repeatedly in recent weeks of the need to end rampant abuse of human rights law - would seize the opportunity. But the government refused to support the amendment, which is now likely to run out of Parliamentary time and never be implemented. Last night, Mrs May said she remained determined to end abuse of article 8, but - because of Britain’s obligations to the European Court of Human Rights - the amendment would have been ruled unlawful. Backbencher: Tory MP Dominic Raab said that May had missed a real chance to change the law . She promised backbench MPs that, if the Tories win the next election outright, the government will consider leaving the jurisdiction of Strasbourg. In the meantime, she will introduce a law later this year to make it harder for criminals to claim they have a right to a family life in the UK - though not stop it altogether. Currently, there are around 4,000 overseas convicts living in the UK which the government want to remove but are blocked from doing so by human rights laws. MPs backing the amendment said a golden opportunity had been missed to bring an immediate end to this abuse. They are concerned that - by delaying action - hundreds more people will fall victim to muggings, burglaries and sex attacks by convicts who should already have been booted out. Securing 100 names for a backbench amendment is highly unusual - and shows the huge strength of feeling at Westminster on the issue. Tory MP Dominic Raab, a long-term campaigner for reform of human rights law, said the government had lost a ‘real chance’ to remove hundreds of serious criminals each year. He added: ‘The political promises have been buried in the long grass.’ In a letter to MPs, Mrs May said she was ‘wholly supportive of the intention behind the amendment’, but that it would be ‘counterproductive’. She said it was ‘highly probable’ that the measure - which would have stopped criminals having any protection under article 8 in most cases - would be declared incompatible with human rights law. The European Court of Human Rights would then issue a binding interim measure under - under the so-called Rule 39 - preventing deportation until the issue was resolved by Strasbourg. Supporter: Former Labour Secretary of State for Work and Pensions David Blunkett supported the change in policy . Mrs May said this could drag on for number of years - with the 4,000 criminal deportations that take place each year stuck in limbo. The Home Secretary added the problems raised by Mr Raab’s ‘quite reasonable proposal is exactly why I believe that we need to address not just the Human Rights Act but our relationship with the European Court of Human Rights. But she warned: ‘Given the constraints of Coalition, that will have to wait until the general election.’ The Lib Dems have repeatedly blocked any attempt to reform the Human Rights Act or even discuss leaving Strasbourg.","May refused to support an amendment bringing an end to the scandal .

The man who discovered the second Boston Marathon bomber hiding out inside his boat got choked up when talking about the victims of the deadly blasts. David Henneberry dismisses claims that he is a national hero, saying that if anything, he is an 'incidental hero'. 'It makes me feel wonderful that people that are thinking like that, but it is my boat. People lost lives and lost limbs,' Mr Henneberry told local station WCVB. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO . 'Incidental hero': Watertown resident David Henneberry (right) was the one to discover Dzhokhar Tsarnaev inside his boat that was being stored in his backyard . Crime scene: Mr Henneberry and his wife have been evacuated from their home as police search for clues . WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW AT WCVB . His role in the saga came when he walked outside of his Watertown home early Friday evening after the shelter-in-place order was lifted in Boston, and the first place he went was to check his boat, that he calls 'my baby'. Earlier in the day, when he was still indoors, Mr Henneberry noticed that two of the pads that he puts in between the shrink wrap and his boat in order to prevent chaffing had fallen out of place. 'It was really windy, so I didn't think twice about it,' he said. As he tells it, the 66-year-old was not expecting to find anything out of the ordinary when he went to adjust the pads. 'Go out and get some air. I am just going to put the pads back. They were bugging me all day.  So I went out in the yard and felt the freedom that everyone is Watertown was feeling. When I pulled the strap, it was a lot looser than it usually is.  But again, the wind could have loosened things up,' he told WCVB. Damage: The boat is effectively ruined after the bullets and fire it took when police were getting the suspect out of his makeshift hide out on Friday evening . Caught: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was caught in the boat shortly after the shelter-in-place order was lifted by police on Friday evening following a day-long manhunt . Hand off: After realizing that a body was inside, Mr Henneberry immediately called 911 . Even when he saw 'a good amount' of blood on the inside of the cabin, he initially doubted himself, thinking back to whether he had accidentally been cut when he was inside the boat weeks earlier. Emotional: Mr Henneberry got choked up while talking about the victims who lost their lives, and others who lost limbs, in the bombing . 'And I looked back and forth a couple of times and my eyes went to the engine block and there was a body,' he said. He then ran back to his house and called the police, who immediately took over the scene. Mr Henneberry and his wife remain displaced from their home as investigators continue to comb over the boat and the property for clues. 'We had great sight and cover on what we had in the boat,' Boston Police Superintendant William Evans said in a Tuesday evening press conference. 'It was just a matter of holding until the tactical team came in to get him out.' Police did in fact find the second bombing suspect inside the boat, ironically named the 'Slip Away II'. Dzhokhar .

Israel Hospital for treatment from various wounds likely sustained from . the early Friday morning altercation with police, where his older . brother Tamerlan was killed. 'Slip Away is slipping away. But I say it . did its job. It held a bad guy and is going away like a Viking ship,' Mr Henneberry said to WCVB. Tracking: Police used infared cameras to track exactly where the suspect was hiding before they approached . Warning: Mr Henneberry said that he saw a 'good amount' of blood in the cabin, and then a body . He also said that he is aware of a social media campaign where supporters are raising money to buy him a new boat after his was damaged in the apprehension of Tsarnaev. Instead, Mr Henneberry wants people to donate to a fund set up for those who were injured in last Monday's bombing. 'I am lucky I am alive.  These other people were killed.  Sometimes, I just sit and say, ""Wow,""' he said. 'This hits you more afterwards when you think “My God, we probably slept last night, this guy could be in the (boat)… It’s surreal.’ Mr Henneberry's first interview comes as more continues to be revealed about the bombers and their family. 'Crude bombs': Both of the bombs were small, likely homemade devices and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material . Terror Attack: The two detonations went off near . the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 - . returning the specter of terrorism to the United States for the first . time since 9/11 . Suspects: Dzhokhar, right, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are accused of planting the Boston bombs last Monday . Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev apparently used an online magazine produced by al Qaeda as their guide for how to make the pressure cooker bombs that they set off at the finish line of last week's race, killing three and injuring more than 180 others. There were reports today that the 19-year-old confessed to the FBI that he and his brother were the ones behind the bombing and that they acted alone. He also reportedly said that they were driven to commit the attack because of their feelings against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Dzhokhar remains in a Boston hospital but he is expected to be transported in the next few days as his condition was downgraded from 'serious' to 'fair'.

He sustained unspecified damages during the course of the last week, most likely from the firefight with police on Friday morning that led to the death of his brother. Dzhokhar is reportedly telling investigators that the deadly attacks were spearheaded by his brother, Tamerlan, who is thought to be the more radical of the two. Tamerlan, a 26-year-old father of one, allegedly went through fits of rage, both verbally and physically abusing his wife who he called a 'slut and a prostitute'. Federal investigators have already questioned his wife, 24-year-old Katherine Russell, and the brothers' parents are thought to be on their way to America for questioning from their native Russia. It was revealed earlier today that no relatives have claimed Tamerlan's body.","Watertown resident David Henneberry spoke out for the first time after he discovered the second bombing suspect in his boat .

Child murderer Stuart Hazell is 'worse than Ian Huntley' because he killed a member of his own family, Tia Sharp's grandmother said today. Christine Bicknell, 47 sobbed as she said she had loved the convicted drug dealer and had no idea she was living with a 'monster' for five years. 'People portray him as Ian Huntley. But no, he's worse than Ian Huntley. OK, he took two little girls that he knew but Stuart took his step grand daughter - that makes him worse,' she told ITV's This Morning. Soham killer Huntley abducted best . friends Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both ten, and then killed them . in his Cambridgeshire home a decade ago. But Ms Bicknell says his crime, although disgusting, does not match Hazell's, adding: 'Tia loved him unconditionally and I thought he loved her unconditionally as well. 'He couldn't have loved me in the first place. He knew she was my life. She was my life. You don't take the love from someone you love surely?' she said. Scroll down for video . Bereft: Tia Sharp's grandmother Christine Bicknell sobbed today as she described her relationship with her granddaughter's killer Stuart Hazell . For most of his life Stuart Hazell was a jobless petty criminal who solved his problems with alcohol and drugs. But his partner Christine Bicknell stood by him as he committed serious . offences and went to prison because 'I thought I knew the real Stuart'. They . became a couple in 2007, four years after he had a two week affair with . Ms Bicknell's daughter Natalie Sharp, 31, who was Tia's mother. This . relationship gave him access to Christine's five grandchildren, who he . smoked marijuana in front of while drinking lager and vodka because her . family trusted him '100 per cent'. On her first impression of Stuart Hazell, Christine said, ""I liked him. We chatted. We were friends... I worked in the pub he drank in. I knew he had previous but it didn't affect me. It wasn't part of my past, that was his past.' Revealing why she fell in love with him, she said: 'He was a gentle giant - regardless of his reputation - ok, he'd get argumentative, but normal every day arguments, no violence, no abuse. He did lots around the house; he hoovered. The only thing he didn't do was iron.' Deceived: Tia's grandmother Christine Bicknell insisted that the true nature of Stuart Hazell came as a total surprise as she thought she knew the real him, but now says he is 'worse than Ian Huntley' But Ms Bicknell's faith was never repaid as last August he murdered the 12-year-olf schoolgirl in the most depraved way, and the man she now says is 'rotten to the core' was jailed for 38 years without parole yesterday. 'I thought I knew the real Stuart,' she told the Daily Mirror, 'I thought I could see a loving, gentle caring man who’d gone astray but wanted to change his ways. 'I actually felt sorry for him because I thought his terrible childhood had scarred him and that was the reason he turned to crime, drinking and drugs. 'He told me he’d never had a normal home life – so I gave him that. He had a ready-made family…and a granddaughter he appeared to dote on. 'He used to talk to me about his childhood and cry like a baby. It would . usually happen when he’d done something wrong, and he wanted sympathy,' she said. 'But now I know nothing would have changed that man – and he can’t blame his actions on what others did to him. He was rotten to the core.' Killer: Soham killer Ian Huntley murdered Holly Wells (right picture, left) and her best friend, Jessica Chapman . Hazell was taken into care at a young age after his father was sent to prison and earned his first conviction at the age of 14. He told a psychologist his absent mother was a prostitute who locked him in the house without food and claimed he was raped aged 16 while staying at a homeless hostel in Soho. He spent his 20s in and out of court. His first meeting with the Sharp family came some time in 2003 when he met Christine Bicknell while she worked as a barmaid at the Raynes Park Tavern. She introduced him to her daughter Natalie Sharp and they had a brief two-week-long relationship. Then in April 2003 Hazell was jailed for 34 months for supplying cocaine. After his release he renewed contact with Christine Bicknell and they started going out on April 23, 2007. A week later he moved in to her home at 20 The Lindens. Under pressure from Christine Bicknell, Hazell managed to get a job as a window cleaner and helped look after the grandchildren while she was out at work at a care home. Bereft: The mother of Tia Sharp, Natalie Sharp (right), hugs a loved one outside the Old Bailey, yesterday. She had a brief fling with Hazell around a decade ago . In February 2010 he was convicted for possessing a machete and went to prison for a year, but his loyal partner stood by him after he told her 'You’re the most important thing in my life.' Tia Sharp was said to 'idolise' the man she had known since the age of seven and became known as his 'clingon.' But Hazell became sexually obsessed with the young girl and on three nights in July 2012 filmed her sleeping at his home. He also secretly filmed her rubbing cream on to her legs. Detectives believe he deliberately removed the bathroom door at the house - supposedly to paint it - so he could spy on the schoolgirl. He is also thought to have modified the light socket in her room to create a 'spyhole'. Scene: Police sniffer dogs leaving Tia Sharp's grandmother's house in New Addington, where Hazell suffocated her while he was babysitting . Hazell's obsession also led to him searching for indecent images of children who wore glasses like Tia. It is thought vodka-fuelled Hazell attempted to sexually assault Tia in the early hours of the morning. Tia, described by Christine Bicknell as 'not the sort of girl you could groom', must have fought back before being suffocated by Hazell using her own duvet. Hazell then moved her dead body into the sexual pose graphically revealed to the jury at the Old Bailey during the trial. Her blood was also found on his belt and on a sex toy. 'The idea of that just makes me feel totally sick. I didn’t have a clue any of that was going on. He may have had it rough when he was young, but that can never be an excuse for killing Tia,' Ms Bicknell said. 'He murdered my granddaughter that night. That’s one fact he’ll never be able to worm his way out of.'","Couple met in 2007 and Christine Bicknell believed he was the 'perfect man'

The children were pronounced dead at the scene when emergency services arrived at the £1.2million semi-detached house in an affluent part of Wandsworth, south London. His wife, Felicia, also 34, was arrested at the family home. She had apparently tried to harm herself but did not need hospital treatment. Mrs Boots, a jewellery designer who runs a website called Pink Tangerine, was being questioned by detectives from Child Abuse Investigation Command yesterday. They are understood to be looking at the possibility that former hair stylist Mrs Boots is suffering from post-natal depression. The couple, originally from Canada, had moved into the three-storey, five-bedroom house near Wandsworth Common only two weeks ago.

Then he said: “Help me, help me, help me”. ‘I thought his wife should come and help him, but I heard nothing from his wife. ‘Then he shouted: “I love my family. I love my children”. ‘It was like a mantra which went on for a while. It was shocking when the police arrived and we realised how serious it was.’ Neither of the children had any visible injuries and it is believed they may have been smothered. Oliver Jones, 27, a business consultant who lives opposite, said: ‘I arrived home when the first police car arrived and he was in floods of tears. The police were here from about 7.30 to about 9.30. The wife was led out to the police car. She seemed very calm and placid.’ Mr and Mrs Boots had previously spent five years renting a £2,100-a-month penthouse in an apartment block nearby. Mrs Boots worked as a hair stylist in Canada but turned to creating her own jewellery from her home-based studio under the name Pink Tangerine after moving to London.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 22:37 EST, 13 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:23 EST, 14 May 2013 . Acting Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Steven T. Miller repeatedly failed to tell Congress that tea party groups were being inappropriately targeted, even after he had been briefed on the matter. The IRS said on Monday that Miller was first informed on May, 3, 2012, that applications for tax-exempt status by tea party groups were inappropriately singled out for extra, sometimes burdensome scrutiny. At least twice after the briefing, Miller wrote letters to members of Congress to explain the process of reviewing applications for tax-exempt status without revealing that tea party groups had been targeted. Scroll down for video . Tea party protesters: Dozens of individual organizations have complained that the IRS treated them differently from liberal or politically neutral groups . On July 25, 2012, Miller testified before the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee but again was not forthcoming on the issue - despite being asked about it. At the hearing, Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Texas, told Miller that some politically active tax-exempt groups in his district had complained about being harassed. Marchant did not explicitly ask if tea party groups were being targeted. But he did ask how applications were handled. Miller responded, 'We did group those organizations together to ensure consistency, to ensure quality. We continue to work those cases,' according to a transcript on the committee's website. He added, 'It is my hope that some of the noise that we heard earlier this year has abated as we continue to work through these cases.' Informed: Acting IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller was told by staff in May 2012, that some groups' applications for tax-exempt status were improperly selected for extra scrutiny . Earlier, Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., had raised concerns with the IRS about complaints that tea party groups were being harassed. Boustany specifically mentioned tea party groups in his inquiry. But in a June 15, 2012, letter to Boustany, Miller gave a generic response. He said that when the IRS saw an increase in applications from groups that were involved in political activity, the agency 'took steps to coordinate the handling of the case to ensure consistency.' He added that agents worked with tax law experts ""to develop approaches and materials that could be helpful to the agents working the cases.' Miller did not mention that in 2011, those materials included a list of words to watch for, such as 'tea party' and 'patriot.' He also didn't disclose that in January 2012, the criteria for additional screening was updated to include references to the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. 'They repeatedly failed to disclose and be truthful about what they were doing,' said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Camp's committee is holding a hearing on the issue Friday and Miller is scheduled to testify. 'We are going to need to find out how much he knew,' Camp said of Miller. The Senate Finance Committee announced Monday that it will join a growing list of congressional committees investigating the matter. Clampdown: Obama was faced with questions about the performance of his administration's IRS on Monday. He said allowing the targeting groups for their political views was 'outrageous' The IRS apologized Friday for what it acknowledged was 'inappropriate' targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election to see whether they were violating their tax-exempt status. In some cases, the IRS acknowledged, agents inappropriately asked for lists of donors. The agency blamed low-level employees in a Cincinnati office, saying no high-level officials were aware. When members of Congress repeatedly raised concerns with the IRS about complaints that tea party groups were being harassed last year, a deputy IRS commissioner took the lead in assuring lawmakers that the additional scrutiny was a legitimate part of the screening process. That deputy commissioner was Miller, who is now the acting head of the agency. Camp and other members of the Ways and Means Committee sent at least four inquiries to the IRS, starting in June 2011. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, sent three inquiries. And Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House oversight committee, sent at least one. None of the responses they received from the IRS acknowledged that conservative groups had ever been targeted, including a response to Hatch dated Sept. 11, 2012 - four months after Miller had been briefed. Under scrutiny: Hundreds of small protests, like this one involving The Tea Party Immigration Coalition, have cropped up in 2013 in opposition to the president's immigration reform package . In several letters to members of Congress, Miller went into painstaking detail about how applications for tax-exempt status were screened. But he never mentioned that conservative groups were being targeted, even though people working under him knew as early as June 2011 that tea party groups were being targeted, according to an upcoming report by the agency's inspector general. 'It is almost inconceivable to imagine that top officials at the IRS knew conservative groups were being targeted but chose to willfully mislead the committee's investigation into this practice,' Camp said. 'This revelation goes against the very principles of free speech and liberty upon which this country was founded, and the blatant disregard for which the agency has treated Congress and the American taxpayer raises serious concerns about leadership at the IRS.' The IRS issued a statement Monday saying that Miller had been briefed on May 3, 2012 'that some specific applications were improperly identified by name and sent to the (exempt organizations) centralized processing unit for further review.' That was the unit in Cincinnati that handled the tea party applications. Influence: Tea party groups were instrumental in the tide-turning elections of 2010, when their fervor swept new conservatives to governors' mansions, statehouses and Congress . Miller became acting commissioner in November, after Commissioner Douglas Shulman completed his five-year term. Shulman had been appointed by President George W. Bush. On June 29, 2011, Lois G. Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt organizations, learned at a meeting that groups were being targeted, according to a draft of the report by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration. At the meeting, Lerner was told that groups with 'Tea Party,' 'Patriot' or '9/12 Project' in their names were being flagged for additional and often burdensome scrutiny, the report says. Lerner instructed agents to change the criteria for flagging groups 'immediately.' However, when Lerner responded to inquiries from the House oversight committee, she didn't mention the fact that tea party groups had ever been targeted. Her responses included 45-page letters in May 2012 to Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who chairs the committee, and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who chairs a subcommittee. Lerner also met twice with staff from the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee to discuss the issue, in March and in May 2012, according to a timeline constructed by committee staff. She didn't mention at either meeting that conservative groups had been targeted, according to the timeline. 'Knowing what we know now, the IRS was at best being far from forth coming, or at worst, being deliberately dishonest with Congress,' Hatch said Monday. On Monday, President Barack Obama said he first learned about the issue from news reports on Friday. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the White House counsel's office was alerted the week of April 22 that the inspector general was finishing a report concerning the IRS office in Cincinnati. But, he said, the counsel's office did not get the report and the president did not learn the focus until Friday. 'If, in fact, IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that had been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that's outrageous and there's no place for it,' Obama said Monday at a press conference. ""And they have to be held fully accountable, because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity, and people have to have confidence that they're applying it in a non-partisan way, applying the laws in a non-partisan way.","IRS targeted conservative groups for closer scrutiny .

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg - a political independent who has played a prominent role in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy -  has delivered a big boost to President Barack Obama by endorsing him for re-election. Bloomberg, a Democrat who became a Republican to run for Big Apple mayor in 2001 and ran as an Independent for re-election in 2009, said that Sandy had helped reshape his thinking about the presidential campaign. He had been pointedly critical of both Obama and Romney, saying that both men had failed to address properly the problems afflicting the nation. Scroll down for video . Support: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a political independent,has delivered a big boost to President Barack Obama by endorsing him for re-election. The pair are pictured together in 2008 . Backer: Bloomberg said that Superstorm Sandy had helped reshape his thinking about the presidential campaign. He is pictured viewing damage in the Breezy Point area of Queens in New York . But he said in recent days he had decided that Obama was the best candidate to tackle climate change, which the mayor cited as a contributory factor to the violent storm that took the lives of at least 38 New Yorkers and brought carnage costing billions of dollars. ‘The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the Northeast - in lost lives, lost homes and lost business - brought the stakes of next Tuesday’s presidential election into sharp relief,’ he wrote in an article for his own website ‘Bloomberg View’. ‘Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it may be - given the devastation it is wreaking - should be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.’ The timing of the endorsement is unexpected because Bloomberg this week publicly called on Obama to resist visiting New York this week because the city was too busy dealing with the disaster. Comfort: A recent poll found that 80 per cent of voters viewed Obama's actions favourably following the storm. He is pictured embracing Donna Vanzant during a tour of a neighborhood effected by Superstorm Sandy . At work: Michael Bloomberg is pictured updating New Yorkers on the city's response to Hurricane Sandy . But his backing is the latest indication that Hurricane Sandy could be a big factor in Tuesday’s election. Obama has already used it to burnish his bipartisan credentials and a Washington Post/ABC poll found that 80 per cent of voters viewed his actions favourably. Republicans dismissed the endorsement saying that Bloomberg, as the epitome of the monied east coast elite, would hardly sway voters in the mid-West battleground states. But there is little doubt that the Romney campaign would dearly have loved to have had the New York mayor’s backing. Obama said in a statement: ‘I am honoured to have Mayor Bloomberg's endorsement.  I deeply respect him for his leadership in business, philanthropy and government, and appreciate the extraordinary job he's doing right now, leading New York City through these difficult days.

Chris Grayling said it was 'inconceivable' the next Tory manifesto would not contain a pledge to scrap Labour's Human Rights Act . Tory ministers were last night urged by their own MPs to stop talking and ‘do something’ over the Human Rights Act. In a move designed to calm the nerves of backbenchers, Chris Grayling promised yesterday to scrap the controversial legislation. But this will not happen until after the next election in 2015 – and then only if the Conservatives win an outright majority. There was also confusion in Westminster over whether the Tories are planning to make a manifesto commitment to leave the separate European Court of Human Rights. Such a move would be hugely popular with Tory activists. But no final decision has been taken, despite briefings by Whitehall officials that the party was ready to advocate the nuclear option of pulling out. To lift party morale after the Eastleigh by-election debacle, Mr Grayling said it was ‘inconceivable’ the next Tory manifesto would not contain a pledge to scrap Labour’s HRA. The Tories made a similar pledge ahead of the 2010 election but have been thwarted by the Liberal Democrats, who refuse to countenance any changes. Mr Grayling said: ‘We cannot go on with a situation where people who are a threat to our national security, or who come to Britain and commit serious crimes, are able to cite their human rights when they are clearly wholly unconcerned for the human rights of others.’ But he stopped short of committing Britain to withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights, which the Human Rights Act enshrined into UK law. Mr Grayling said only that he wanted 'a dramatically curtailed’ role' for the Strasbourg court, which has come under fire for demanding the vote for prisoners. The judges have also blocked the deportation of terror suspects, including Abu Qatada. Some senior figures – including Home Secretary Theresa May – want the Tories to be ready to quit the ECHR. They believe it is doing huge damage to efforts to get rid of foreign criminals. Last month Mrs May unveiled plans to change the law so a foreign criminal can no longer block deportation on the grounds they have a human right to ‘a family life’ in the UK. But, crucially, there is no agreement yet to include the pledge to quit the EHCR in the next Tory manifesto. Insiders say such a dramatic step could split the party, with Attorney General Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke likely to resign. Some senior figures, including Home Secretary Theresa May, want the Tories to be ready to quit the European Convention on Human Rights . Scrapping the HRA, but remaining in the ECHR, would mean foreign criminals could appeal to Strasbourg. Britain would then have to decide whether to ignore the rulings – as other member states do – or back down. Backbenchers welcomed the commitment to scrapping the HRA but do not want to wait until after the 2015 election. Senior MP Mark Field said that if Mrs May and Mr Grayling were serious they should bring forward a Bill, defying Liberal Democrat objections. ‘We are in government. Either do something now, and call the Liberal Democrats’ bluff on this, or stay quiet,’ he said. ‘It’s that sort of cynicism, it’s just politicians saying words and not doing anything’. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the Tories always promised ‘jam tomorrow’ and claimed their supporters would no longer believe promises from the party.","Grayling promised to scrap Human Rights Act after 2015 election .

"By . James Slack, Home Affairs Editor . PUBLISHED: . 15:58 EST, 1 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:21 EST, 2 April 2013 . A Tory Cabinet minister today invites Ed Miliband to join forces to end the human rights ‘madness’ keeping Abu Qatada in Britain. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling says the system has gone ‘badly wrong’ when the UK cannot deport a man ‘who so obviously despises what we stand for’. Writing in the Daily Mail, he says that the Conservatives would change human rights laws immediately – but they do not have the votes needed in Parliament. Chris Grayling has called on Labour to the human rights 'madness' keeping Abu Qatada, pictured, in Britain . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said his party would change human rights laws but need Ed Miliband's cooperation . Ministers are being thwarted by their Liberal Democrat Coalition partners who have vowed to fight even modest changes to the law. But, in an audacious move, Mr Grayling is appealing to the Labour leadership to ‘support radical reform of our human rights laws’. He urges: ‘We have given up far too much of our own sovereignty. ‘We have given up too many of our own democratic rights. We need to reverse the changes.’ Mr Grayling’s offer, which could result in immediate legislation, places Mr Miliband in a hugely difficult position. Labour grandees, including ex-Home Secretary John Reid, have warned that the Qatada debacle is undermining faith in the entire human rights regime. Lord Reid said: ‘The danger in the  long run is that if people believe the law as it stands . . . is open to misuse, then the demand grows to throw out the whole thing.’ But, while helping to reform human rights law would be hugely popular, Mr Miliband would need the courage to carry his party with him. Many Labour MPs view the Human Rights Act – passed by Tony Blair  in 1998 – as an article of faith which  cannot be touched. Mr Grayling wants to legislate for a ‘dramatically curtailed role for the European Court of Human Rights in the UK’. One option is to prevent the court from overriding the clearly expressed wishes of the UK Parliament. Labour has repeatedly sniped at the Government over the failure to boot out Qatada, but has not said how it would tackle the issue after spending six years trying – and failing – to kick out the hate-filled cleric while in government. Last week, the Appeal Court ruled that Qatada could not be deported to Jordan on terror charges in case his right to a fair trial was breached. The judges accepted Qatada was ‘very dangerous’, but said this was ‘not a relevant consideration’ under human rights laws. The decision – which raises the . chilling prospect of Britain being stuck with the fanatic for life – was . based on an earlier ruling by Strasbourg. Mr . Grayling’s Daily Mail article  delivers a devastating analysis of the . problems the legislation – working in tandem with the European Court of . Human Rights – is causing for the Government. He says the remit of the . European Court has ‘gone mad’. Former Home Secretary John Reid warned that the Qatada debacle is undermining faith in the human rights regime while Theresa May wants to leave the agreement to make it easier to deport foreign terrorists . But he says it is for politicians to change the law, and reaches out  to Labour and the Lib Dems to find a solution, rather than limp on to the 2015 General Election without change. He says: ‘I would welcome an agreement from Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband to support radical reform of our human rights laws. We would deliver those changes at the earliest possible opportunity.’ The Qatada ruling has renewed demands for radical action. Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant said Britain must leave the European Convention on Human Rights in the wake of the defeat. Home Secretary Theresa May also wants to leave the agreement to make it easier to deport foreign terrorists and criminals. Yet, last week, justice minister Damian Green said the official position is that no preparations are being made to walk away. The statement reflects how the Tory Party is having to bend over backwards to keep the Liberal Democrats happy. In his LBC radio show last week, Mr Clegg said the Government remains determined to deport Qatada, but would not be prepared to ignore the court’s ruling.","Chris Grayling wants Ed Miliband to help change human rights laws .

Only three of the 11 men arrested over suspected sex offences in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal are likely to be charged, it emerged last night. Detectives believe there will be insufficient evidence to prosecute the majority of the suspects  quizzed under Operation Yewtree. Former BBC producer Wilfred De’Ath, 75, who was arrested over an alleged sex assault in 1965, was released  without charge on Monday evening. Eleven men have been arrested over suspected sex offences in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Former BBC producer Wilfred De'Ath, right, was released without charge on Monday night . And speculation was mounting last night that Freddie Starr would soon be told that he, too, will not be charged over claims he attempted to grope a 14-year-old in Savile’s BBC changing room in 1974. The police operation – which is thought to have cost £1million and has 30 dedicated detectives – has already been criticised by some as a ‘celebrity witch-hunt’. Earlier this month, one of Britain’s top prosecution lawyers was accused of hyping up the investigation as if it were a ‘box office event’ when he told the public to expect a dramatic new wave of celebrity arrests. If, as seems likely, only a handful of men are charged, there are sure to be uncomfortable questions for the police over the handling of the probe. Yard chiefs insist all arrests by detectives on Yewtree have been ‘necessary and proportionate’. But Mr De’Ath, who spent four months on bail before being cleared, accused officers of being ‘over-zealous’. He said the police had failed ‘lamentably’ to stop Savile’s reign of terror while he was still alive – so were now going ‘too far the other way’ in pursuing ‘spurious’ claims against others. Only three of those arrested under Operation Yewtree - the Savile inquiry - are likely to be charged . ‘My general comment would be that Operation Yewtree has gone too far,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘It is getting silly now.’ Other celebrities arrested by the Yewtree squad include the comedian Jim Davidson, PR guru Max Clifford and disgraced pop star Gary Glitter, all of whom deny any wrongdoing. Another celebrity – a man in his 80s who has not been named publicly – was interviewed under caution over sex allegations in November. Davidson, 59, was detained over historic sex allegations – not involving children – shortly before he was due to appear on Celebrity Big Brother in January and rearrested last week over new allegations dating back to 1978. His second arrest came a week after DJ Dave Lee Travis, 67, was rearrested over sex allegations involving adults. He too denies wrongdoing. At his £1million home in Stockbridge, Hampshire, Mr Davidson said yesterday: ‘The pendulum has now swung right to the other end; from doing nothing with Savile to this.’ He added: ‘The allegations against me are to do with adults and go back over 35 years, one is from 1978. And the only thing I remember from back then is Abba! PR guru Max Clifford, left, and comedian Jim Davidson, right, are among those arrested in the Operation . Gary Glitter, left, was also arrested and DJ Dave Lee Travis, right, was arrested over allegations involving adults . ‘It costs nothing to tell the truth . and all I can do is tell the truth. It costs to tell lies. If an . allegation is made, the police have to look into it whatever  the cost. ‘I just hope they look into my evidence with as much vigour and skill and I trust that they will.’ Freddie Starr, 70, who was arrested in November, weeks after the Savile scandal erupted, has also complained about his treatment. He was taken into custody near his home in Warwickshire and questioned over claims he tried to grope a woman called Karin Ward when she was 14. Ward, who waived her right to anonymity, claimed Starr had had a ‘very bad attack of wondering hands’ with her nearly 40 years ago. He vehemently denied her claims. It prompted Starr to seek an injunction to prevent the claims being aired, but his High Court application was rejected. He initially denied ever meeting his accuser, or appearing with her on Savile’s 1974 BBC show Clunk Click, but footage later emerged of him and Miss Ward in the same shot.

The comedian claims he has lost . £1million in earnings from cancelled shows. After police raided his home . and seized a computer hard-drive, address books, photographs and his . iPhone, Starr said: ‘It’s horrible. I’m being made to feel like a . criminal. ‘I’ve never ever been in trouble before and I haven’t got a police record. ‘It’s heartbreaking and it’s affecting my health and everything. It’s unbelievable. I’m absolutely drained.’ A friend of Miss Ward told the Mail she had not expected Starr to be arrested, let alone charged, over the alleged incident. The friend said: ‘Karin has always known there was a chance Starr would not be charged because it would probably come down to her word against his. ‘If she was the only witness, then a prosecution was always less likely to  go ahead.’ Earlier this month, Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor in the North West, said detectives will soon arrest a number of ‘very high profile’ figures suspected of child sex abuse. He described child-sex abuse investigations as a ‘growing industry’. Critics said Mr Afzal should not hype up any impending arrests like a ‘box office event’. A number of defence lawyers believe there should now be a new debate over whether those suspected of sex offences, particularly those allegedly involving children, should be named before they are convicted.

Three days earlier, he sat stern-faced through the Coalition’s latest ‘we’re all in it together’ Budget. But with a flatlining economy and the  row raging over benefits cuts, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg knew exactly where he needed to be – at his family’s £7million, 20-room, Swiss ski chalet. Leaving the stress of austerity Britain behind, he jetted out with his family for an Easter getaway at the luxury villa nestling between fashionable Klosters and the resort of Davos. Luxury: Clegg's family ski chalet had 20 rooms and is worth £7million. The Deputy PM has been skiing there since infancy . His family’s retreat – which comes complete with its own chef – has a large wooden balcony for sunbathing and magnificent views through the pine trees towards Lake Davos. Mr Clegg, 46, is enjoying his second holiday there this year with his wife, commercial lawyer Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, the daughter of a Spanish senator, and their three young sons. They flew out last Saturday and were enjoying the millionaires’ playground – a favourite of the Royal Family – days before the benefits cuts, which are due to come into force on Monday. The Deputy PM’s chalet – which would cost around £10,000 a week if it was available to rent – has been owned by his Dutch mother Hermance and her relatives for decades, and he has been skiing there since infancy. Regular: Clegg described his favourite ski morning which involved a 'huge, fattening, vein-blocking breakfast' then a lot of long runs from the top of the slopes . It was built by his maternal grandfather, who loved the area so much he became a Swiss citizen. Mr Clegg has previously recalled: ‘The family would go there every year. It was bucolic – we would walk over to the nearby farm and get fresh milk from the cows every morning for breakfast.’ Describing his perfect start to a ski day, he said in an interview with Ski and Snowboard magazine: ‘Up early, then a huge, fattening, vein-blocking breakfast, full of cheese and potatoes, like a rosti, washed down with a large hot chocolate. Then a lot of long runs, right from the very top all the way down.’ The chalet is one of his favourite bolt-holes to escape the pressures of political life. He said: ‘If there’s a hard moment in my work, I often think about my favourite places on the mountains. It’s very calming.’ This week, Mr Clegg was seen on the slopes in a Dainese designer helmet, Killy ski gloves and a trendy Patagonia jacket in ‘Lib Dem orange’. He was spotted gallantly carrying both his and his wife’s skis, balancing them on his shoulders like a pair of hunting rifles. On Thursday, on the way back to his villa, he stopped his people carrier and wound down his window when he saw some photographers, and asked: ‘Are you looking for me?’ Then he drove off. Vacation: This is Clegg's second holiday this year with his family, including wife Miriam . He had earlier driven to the Jakobshorn mountain, where the family took a cable car up to the 8,000ft peak. They spent three-and-a-half hours enjoying the slopes, rubbing shoulders with the super-rich. The warm weather saw many of his fellow skiers abandon the snow to sunbathe at mountaintop restaurants, where lunchtime bottles of wine sell for £70. One skier told Mr Clegg outside a restaurant that he was a fan of his and thought that he was doing a good job. Mr Clegg replied: ‘It’s very difficult at times.’ It is Mr Clegg’s second skiing holiday this year. His family also spent several days at the chalet in February. He has previously described himself as a ‘ski bum’ because he loves spending so much time on the slopes. A visit there in 2011 was embroiled in controversy when Mr Clegg admitted he ‘forgot’ he was supposed to be running the country in the absence of the PM. As well as the Swiss hideaway, Mr  Clegg, who is estimated to be worth £1.9million, also uses his father’s chateau in Bordeaux.","Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg jetted out for an family Easter getaway .

A loud, explosive sneeze is likely to come from an outgoing, demonstrative person while someone who’s shy will try and hold back, resulting in a stifled, Minnie-Mouse style expulsion, says neurologist Dr Alan Hirsch. ‘Sneezes are like laughter,’ he adds. ‘Some laughs are loud, some are soft. And it’s similar with sneezing. It will often be the same from youth onward in terms of what it sounds like. Personalities: A loud, explosive sneeze is likely to come from an outgoing, demonstrative person while someone who's shy will try and hold back, resulting in a stifled, Minnie-Mouse style expulsion (file picture) ‘It’s more of a psychological thing and represents the underlying personality or character structure,’ Dr Hirsch, also a psychiatrist and founder of the Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago, tells NBC in the US. Sneezing is a reflex action caused when irritants such as germs, pollen and dust infiltrate the nose lining and the brain sends out a message to get rid of it, triggering a deep breath that gets held in the lungs, tightening the chest muscles and building pressure. The tongue gets pushed against the roof of the mouth, forcing breath to rush out through the nose - all in the time it takes to go achoo! ‘I have world famous kitten sneezes,’ says Susan Frykholm, a 31-year-old multimedia sales specialist from Seattle, in the report. ‘I’m not trying to be cute but people usually start laughing at how ‘precious’ they are.’ ‘Mine are like a revolutionary war cannon,’ adds Dan Fine, a 54-year-old IT consultant who is also from Seattle. Tara Spicer, a 29-year-old copywriter from Washington, has her own reasons for her sneezing habits. Achoo: Sneezing is a reflex action caused when irritants infiltrate the nose lining and the brain sends out a message to get rid of it, triggering a deep breath that gets held in the lungs, tightening the chest muscles . ‘I’m a sneeze stifler. I’ve always pinched my nose to mute the noise. I think it’s a subconscious rebellion against my grandmother, who raised me much of my life, and took pride in her ear-shattering siren-sneeze,’ she says. Others describe sneezes sounding like screams or in rapid succession. ‘In general, sneezing is an involuntary phenomenon, part of the body’s mechanism of defense, a way of clearing out bacteria or other agents that would be injurious,’ Dr Gordon Siegel, a Chicago ear, nose and throat doctor tells NBC. ‘That being said, you can control to a degree the way it comes out.’ Dr Siegel, an assistant clinical professor at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine, tells how a friend used a colourful expression to punctuate his sneezes. ‘When he sneezes, he likes it to come out saying ‘horses***’ and he’s got it down,’ he says. ‘There is partial control of the final product.’ The experts say the bone structure of the face and shape of the nose may play a smaller role in the different sneezing styles. But Dr Siegel insists: ‘What we perceive as the sneezing sound is not really affected significantly by the nose structure.’ Most people don’t think too much about sneezing. They just happen naturally, he adds.","Outgoing people make loud, explosive sneezes, according to US study .

Commitment: In reply to a question from Labour former home secretary David Blunkett, Damian Green said the Government 'remains committed to the European Convention on Human Rights' Ministers yesterday admitted they have no plans to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights. A humiliating court defeat for the Government over its attempts to kick out hate-preacher Abu Qatada has thrown the convention back into the spotlight. Home Secretary Theresa May and Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant both want to ditch it to make it easier to deport foreign terrorists and criminals. But Damian Green, justice minister and fellow Conservative, said no plans were being made to do so. In reply to a question from Labour former home secretary David Blunkett, Mr Green said: ‘As set out in the Coalition agreement, the Government remains committed to the European Convention on Human Rights and has no plans to denounce or withdraw from it.’ Senior opposition figures concede that, as a result of the Qatada case, there is a growing clamour to reform human rights laws. Mr Blunkett said ministers were in a ‘terrible muddle’, adding: ‘I wish the Government would make their mind up. They either are in favour of Britain’s membership of the ECHR, as incorporated into the Human Rights Act, or they are not. ‘If as their answer indicates, they have no plans in this area, it would be sensible for them to get on with any positive changes they want to make to the interpretation of the convention and how this will be translated into the work of our judges.’ Yesterday Lord Reid, another Labour ex-home secretary, said the longer the debate went on the longer  ‘it undermines the belief in the court system, particularly human rights legislation’. Reform: Senior opposition figures concede that, as a result of the Qatada case, there is a growing clamour to reform human rights laws . On Wednesday, the Appeal Court ruled it would be a breach of Qatada’s human rights to send him to Jordan on terror charges, in case evidence used against him came from torture. Mrs May had secured assurances from the Jordanian government that no torture evidence would be involved. But this was rejected by the courts. The judges accepted Qatada was ‘very dangerous’ – but said this was ‘not a relevant consideration’ under human rights laws. In response, Mr Fabricant said on Twitter: ‘We MUST leave the European Convention on Human Rights!’ Change: Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) and Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant both want to ditch the European Convention on Human Rights to make it easier to deport foreign terrorists and criminals . Tory MP Robert Halfon said: ‘This is a shocking decision. It is an abuse of human rights because it does not take into consideration the human rights of those threatened by terrorism. ‘It is an abuse of Parliament because the judges have defied the clear will of Parliament which is get this man out of the country.’ His fellow Tory MP Mark Reckless said the Government had adopted the wrong legal strategy by trying to satisfy the test on torture evidence set down by the European court. The Law Lords had previously ruled it was safe to deport Qatada. The British courts changed their mind only after Mrs May asked them to consider the case again, in wake of the Strasbourg ruling against deportation. Mr Reckless said there had been a ‘craven surrender to Strasbourg’. Tory MPs blame Nick Clegg for thwarting all attempts to reform human rights law. They say Mr Green’s response to Mr Blunkett shows the Tory party is having to bend over backwards to keep the Liberal Democrats happy. In his weekly LBC radio show, Mr Clegg yesterday said the Government was determined to deport Qatada – but would not ignore the court’s ruling because that would be to act illegally. The Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘Theresa May has been out to Jordan. She is going to make sure that we strengthen those assurances from the Jordanians. ‘We are absolutely determined as a Government to deport this guy. I wish we could do it earlier, we are having to jump through these endless legal hoops but we will get there.’","Government defeat on Qatada deportation put spotlight on the ECHR .

The 72-year-old – who was dropped by Channel 4 in favour of a new racing team headed by Clare Balding – called his wife before the last race this afternoon to say he felt unwell. Unwell: Horse racing icon John McCririck was in hospital tonight after collapsing at the Cheltenham Festival . As he walked to meet her, he apparently took a turn for the worse and had to be treated at the edge of the parade ring by paramedics. He was then taken to hospital in an ambulance. Prior to his collapse, McCririck was seen sitting in the media centre alone, looking glum. He rose periodically to smoke a cigar on the balcony outside. Mr McCririck seen earlier today at the race meeting. He is currently suing Channel 4 for ageism and loss of earnings . The Daily Telegraph reported that Tanya Stevenson, who now does the Channel 4 betting, spoke to McCririck's wife and said she did not think it was too serious. She said: 'He doesn’t want to miss tomorrow’s racing or stay a night in hospital either. He’s going bonkers by all accounts.' BBC Sport's racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght tweeted: 'Hospital say racing pundit is comfortable but being detained overnight; said to be demanding to go to races tomorrow.' The commentator claims he was axed by Channel 4 for being too old. In a statement issued in January, he said: ‘After 29 years with Channel 4 Racing, on a rolling annual contract, I have been sacked without any consultation or cogent explanation. I am 72. 'For loss of future earnings, unfair career damaging, public humiliation, stress and mental anguish, I will be seeking £500,000.

It is alleged that a property tycoon slept with his PA then sacked her when his wife found out . A property tycoon slept with his PA then sacked her when his wife found out, a tribunal has heard. The chief executive allegedly treated his mistress to a car and a luxury flat in London during the course of their three-year relationship. He took her on holidays to Cuba and Australia and promoted her to a £40,000-a-year position, it  was claimed. He is even said to have asked the 32-year-old to arrange a threesome with an Australian employee – offering to help with her visa if she agreed. But when his wife found out, the 56-year-old boss fired the PA and told her: ‘Don’t you ****ing come back,’ the tribunal heard. London Central Employment Tribunal, which heard the case last week, ordered that none of those involved can be named. The chief executive, whose property company has a portfolio worth billions, routinely harassed women in his office, the tribunal was told. It was claimed he had a preference for recruiting pretty, young female surveyors and admin staff, and would call them ‘slappers’. The PA, who began her affair with her boss soon after she started at the company in 2008, claimed he got rid of her after a former business associate sent his wife a letter disclosing their affair. She told the hearing: ‘In December 2010, he told me his wife had received a letter from somebody telling her about our relationship, and about various details like the flat, and that we had gone on holidays. ‘After that, he started asking me to leave. He said that his wife was putting pressure on him to sever all ties with me. [But] he told me he wasn’t going to get rid of me just to please his wife.’ The pair continued to sleep together, but he became rude and dismissive in the office, she said. She wept as she added: ‘I did feel at certain times that if I didn’t sleep with him then he would get very angry.’ She claimed he eventually offered her a £50,000 tax-free redundancy package to leave, as his children would no longer speak to him because of his cheating, but that she refused. Two months later, in a heated phone call, he sacked her, she said. ‘I asked, “Are you firing me?” and he replied: “Yes, don’t you ****ing come back”, and told me I was sacked.’ The claimant told the hearing: ‘His attitude was that female staff  members could get ahead in business not on their merits but by using their sexuality. ‘When we were recruiting a receptionist, he instructed me to tell the recruitment agency not to send anyone fat, old or male. Accusations: A property tycoon slept with his PA then sacked her when his wife found out, a tribunal has heard. The chief executive allegedly lavished treats on the woman, including a swanky flat in London's trendy Belsize Park, pictured . Jetsetter: The chief executive is also alleged to have taken his mistress on swanky holidays to Cuba, pictured, and Australia . ‘Throughout my time at the company he would choose attractive female staff members to attend meetings with external parties or difficult clients and would say “we’ll ask her to wear a short skirt” or “we’ll ask her to wear a low cut top”.’ She also claimed he ‘pestered’ her to encourage an Australian staff member to have a threesome ‘in return for sponsoring her visa so she could stay in the UK’. David Massarella, representing the company boss, put it to the woman that it ‘simply didn’t fit’ that his client tried to force her out, because he had recently given her a pay rise, renewed the lease on her flat and said he would pay for her to take her property surveyor exams so she could further her career. Mr Massarella said the PA had repeatedly accused her boss of seeing other colleagues and even of spending the night with a prostitute. She said: ‘I’d heard from someone he was seeing a prostitute. At the time, we were having unprotected sex and I was concerned.’ But when he told her he had not slept with a prostitute, just gone out with her, his mistress said: ‘He always told me lots of lies.’ Asked why she would want to work for someone who was a habitual liar, she said: ‘I loved that job.’ Mr Massarella accused her of bombarding his client with texts and phones calls – at one point calling him 29 times in one day. She is suing the property company for unfair dismissal and sex discrimination. The hearing was adjourned.

An 84-year-old baseball lover who holds the world record for 'Most Durable Batboy' has celebrated a staggering 55 years on the field for a university team. Stan 'The Man' Bronson, Jr. first took to the field for the Tigers at the University of Memphis in 1958 and has been going strong ever since - earning campus renown and the moniker of 'living legend'. Bronson, who has a learning difficulty and a speech impediment, took up the honorary, unpaid role after he was fired from a job at the athletic department at Rhodes College in Memphis. His mother took him to the University of Memphis and they spoke with the football coach, Billy 'Spook' Murphy, NPR reported. Living legend: Stan Bronson Jr. has been the batboy for the University of Memphis Tigers for 55 years . 'Coach Murphy said, ""Well, son, I'm . sorry but I don't have money in my budget to pay for anybody else."" And . Stan said, ""Don't need money. Need a job"",' Bob Winn, associate athletic director, said. His first job with the university involved picking up footballs as team members practiced on the sidelines, and he worked as an equipment manager for the football team until he was in his 60s. Since 1958, he has also served as the team's batboy - the person who carries the bat to the team and lays out equipment for the game - and has become a stalwart on the field. He was awarded the title of 'most durable batboy' by the Guinness World Records at a ceremony in May 2007 and featured in the 2008 record book. The game's announcer, Jeff Brightwell, calls him a 'living legend'. Through the years: Bronson, who said he was fired from his former job for his 'attitude', grins in his role . Stalwart: Mr Bronson, pictured left at an early game, joined the Tigers as their batboy in 1958 . One of the boys: Bronson (front, right) has been a famous face on campus through the years . At work: As the batboy, an honorary position, Bronson retrieves the bats for players on the field . Even when the Tigers are losing, many . spectators stick around to watch Bronson carry out a famed tradition of . tipping his hat at the end of the seventh inning in recognition of the . fans who have come out to support the team that day. 'You . always want to see Stan come out and tip his cap,' Brightwell told NPR. 'He is probably one of the most recognizable figures... Everyone knows . and loves Stan.' Students . have praised Bronson across the team's Facebook page, while other fans . are known to give him rides or take him to dinner. 'He's . an icon of this institution,' Eddie Cantler, a former Memphis athletic . trainer, said. 'Stan is everything that is innocent and pure.' Record holder: Bronson won the Guinness World Record for 'most durable batboy' in May 2007 . Going strong: The university now unofficially oversees care of Bronson, who has a learning difficulty . Staying: Even though he is now 84, Bronson has no plans to leave the role at the university, where he lives . And even though he's reached a staggering 55 years on the field, he's not giving up just yet. Bronson is in fine health for his age and takes no medication. He now lives in an independent living community overlooking the campus, has a lifetime pass to the school cafeteria and the university unofficially oversees his care. The school does have concerns about his medical needs in the future and has thrown fundraisers for costs that he may later need to pay off. But he has no need for the money just yet. 'We think, really, quite frankly, that athletics has kept Stan alive and going,' Winn said.

Emirates flight attendant Evelyn Clarke, 28, was found dead in a car park after falling from a window on the eighth floor of a Dubai tower block in the early hours of Monday . A British air hostess who plunged to her death from a Dubai tower block told building staff ‘someone’s trying to kill me’ in the minutes before her death. Emirates flight attendant Evelyn Clarke, 28, was found dead in a car park after falling from a window on the eighth floor in the early hours of Monday. Miss Clarke apparently ran into the lobby without any shoes on as she sought refuge from a man she believed was following her. Police in Dubai are treating her death as an accident, but are continuing to question the last people who saw her alive. Detectives are also examining why Miss Clarke seemingly pulled the pin out of a dry powder fire extinguisher in a narrow stairwell, which filled the area with a thick black smoke. Staff at the residential block said they believe she may then have struggled to find her way down the stairs and opened the window, which is 3ft off the floor, to ‘escape the smoke’. Blackened fingerprints were still visible yesterday on the walls and window frames in the stairwell, as well as on a door, which led to a locked ‘lift mechanics’ room. A newspaper delivery man said Miss Clarke entered the Afaf building in Bur Dubai at about 4.15am and appeared ‘drunk’ and in distress. He also saw a man who Miss Clarke may have feared was following her. He said: 'She had no shoes on. I got into the elevator to go up to the fourth floor. But just as the doors were closing, the woman put her hand in to stop the lift and stepped inside. The man did not take the lift. ‘She was cowering with fear and it appeared she was being followed by the South Asian man. She kept saying “Someone is trying to kill me”. As she spoke, there was a strong smell of alcohol. I told her to call the police or I could do it for her. But she said no.’ Miss Clarke, from Ayrshire, Scotland, reportedly got out on the third floor and headed towards the stairwell, while the delivery man continued to distribute papers to the fourth and fifth floors. When he returned to the lobby he told security guard Mozammal Haque Bhulyan, who had been on a break when Miss Clarke arrived, about the incident. Mr Bhulyan, 33, told the Mail: ‘I . searched all the floors and, when I got to the second floor, I heard a . loud bang. I think now that was Miss Clarke falling.’ He . searched the building twice but initially did not think to check the . eighth floor, which holds a locked rooftop terrace and the mechanics . room, because it is usually for ‘authorised personnel’ only. However, when he failed to find Miss . Clarke, he opened the door to the eighth floor stairwell and was shocked . to discover it was filled with a black powder. He said: ‘I got very scared for her. I thought the powder was smoke, so I thought perhaps there had been a fire. Miss Clarke apparently ran into the lobby of the Afaf building (above) without any shoes on as she sought refuge from a man she believed was following her . ‘I ran to the watchman’s flat on the third floor and asked him to check the stairwell because there was smoke, while I went outside.’ The watchman discovered an open window and a woman’s brown handbag on the floor nearby. Next to the handbag was a pin for the fire extinguisher, which was still hanging on the wall. Mr Bhulyan said: ‘I think when she used the fire extinguisher she couldn’t see anything or anywhere to escape. Maybe she opened the window and fell or jumped.’ He walked around the outside of the building, where he found Miss Clarke’s body beneath the eighth floor window. He made the discovery at 4.37am, around 20 minutes after she entered the building. ‘She had already died,’ he said. Mr Bhulyan, a father-of-one from Bangladesh, added: ‘It is very sad.’ Miss Clarke had been working for Emirates since June and, two days prior to her death, had returned from a six-day working trip to Brisbane and Auckland . He questioned why she had entered the ordinary residential building, saying: ‘I don’t know why she was in here at night. She was definitely not living here. 'The air hostesses live in high-class buildings owned by Emirates. There is one just up the road. But this building is normal, it is not the quality that they are used to.’ He said he understood the newspaper delivery man saw an Indian man follow Miss Clarke into the building and loiter in the lobby. He added: ‘He did not enter the elevator and he was not a resident here.’ The delivery man added: ‘When I [returned to] the lobby, the man was still there and asked me in Hindi if the woman lived in the building. I ignored him and walked away.’ It is still unclear what Miss Clarke was doing in the residential Bur Dubai district, two miles from her flat. She is understood to have shared a three-bedroom apartment with fellow air hostesses in a 28-floor apartment block for Emirates staff, in the heart of the business district. Reports suggested she was on a night out with friends and may have gone on to an after-party when Dubai’s bars shut at 3am. She had been working for Emirates since June and, two days prior to her death, had returned from a six-day working trip to Brisbane and Auckland. Her parents Edmund and Maryann and brother Ryan, 23, are believed to have flown out to Dubai. A spokesman for Emirates said: ‘Our sympathies go out to her family who are currently being supported by our staff.’ On a Facebook tribute page, friends said Miss Clarke had ‘a heart of gold’ and ‘wanted to help everyone in need’. An Indian man also reportedly died the same night in Dubai from falling from a 10th-floor apartment.","Emirates flight attendant Evelyn Clarke, .

Students at the Oxford college once attended by Lady Thatcher provoked outrage last night over plans to hire a live shark as entertainment for a summer ball. The organising committee for students at Somerville and Jesus colleges planned to hire a live nursing shark to be displayed in a tank for their black-tie event on May 4th. But the plan has been met with condemnation from fellow students - with one accusing organisers of simply wanting to show that ‘we have got so much money sloshing around we can hire a shark.’ With tickets costing a minimum of £110 the sell-out event was billed by organisers as a ‘one night of decadence, debauchery and indulgence.’ Some students planned to have a nurse shark glide around in a tank for the 'debauched' summer ball . But now a group of outraged former students have written to college principal Dr Alice Prochaska asking her to intercede and ‘prevent any live animals from being used.’ One of the group, Claire Phipps, who graduated in 2011, criticised the organisers’ decision saying they were simply ‘showing off.’ She said: ‘We’re primarily concerned about the shark. ‘We don’t know where it came from in the first place, whether it was bred in captivity or captured in the wild, and we can’t find out as the committee won’t give us the details of the company they hired it from. ‘I am worried about the unnecessary stress for the animal of being transported and lots of people gawping at it. ‘This is about nothing more than showing off: “We’ve got so much money sloshing around we can hire a shark”.’ Somerville College, at Oxford, promised to throw a night of 'debauchery, decadence and indulgence' History graduate Matthew Hawkins echoed her concerns, saying the event risked shaming the university and should be boycotted by students. He said: ‘It’s worrying that a leading educational institution such as an Oxford college would allow that view of nature to be perpetuated, of animals as an extravagant, gaudy show. ‘If the organisers won’t cancel the shark then we won’t attend and we will ask others to boycott the event as well.’ The first signs of the stunt came earlier this year when organisers printed the Latin words for female shark ‘Ginglymostoma Cirratu’ on posters for the event. It was followed by the instruction: ‘You should really go look that up.’ Many students took it as a joke - but in February Miss Phipps e-mailed the chair of the ball committee Sam Levin to check and was shocked to find that they were hiring a shark from a company which supplies animals to film studios. The second-year biology student told her that anyone objecting to the idea could have a refund but maintained the animal’s welfare was not at risk. Jesus college has incurred the wrath of students, who say the event risked shaming the university and should be boycotted . Yesterday he told the Guardian that he cared ‘a lot’ for animal welfare and that the area around the tank could be quickly cleared during the event if it became distressed. He added that the idea of having a shark at the ball came from Baz Luhrmann’s 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, in which the star-crossed teenagers meet while gazing through a fish tank. He said: ‘As someone who cares a lot about animal welfare, I think we’ve ensured this shark is looked after. ‘It will have a guard and caretaker with it at all times to look out for signs of stress, and we’re keeping it there for only a short time. I feel confident that the shark will not suffer.’ In a statement the college said that staff were working with students to ensure ‘the highest standards of safety and ethics.’ But such comments provoked fury from animal rights groups who claim there is no excuse for using live animals for entertainment purposes. Andrew Tyler, director of animal rights group Animal Aid slammed the plans branding them ‘cruel’ and ‘idiotic.’ He said: ‘Oxford is supposed to attract the brightest and most intelligent of their generation but this clearly indicates that does not necessarily come with compassion and common sense. ‘This is clearly a cruel and pitiless thing to do. These are magnificent animals that belong in the sea. ‘You don’t need to be a shark expert to know that this is not in the interest of the animal, she will be absolutely terrified by having a lot of morons playing loud music around her. ‘Thankfully some of their fellow students have had the good sense to recognise that the organisers take note. ‘If they wish to be debauched and degenerate then let them do with respect to each other and not at the expense of innocent animals. The RSPCA said that it too was concerned about the conditions the shark would be held in. A spokesman for the charity said: ‘Using sharks in any type of event would require very careful planning to ensure their welfare, particularly in terms of transportation, housing and the potential impact of the event itself.'","Jesus and Somerville colleges wanted to hire live nursing shark .

The Trustee Savings Bank is making a comeback almost 20 years after it disappeared from the high street. Lloyds – which merged with TSB in 1995 – plans to launch the branches in the summer after the Co-op pulled the plug on a £750million deal to buy 632 of its banks. The Co-op yesterday said its change of heart was based on the ‘worsened outlook for economic growth’. Pain: Lloyds was being forced to sell the branches because it received a 2008 bailout from the UK Government and after its Co-op deal collapsed it is turning to the TSB brand . But Lloyds insisted its exit from the . deal will not affect the 4.6million branch customers of Lloyds and . Cheltenham & Gloucester, which is part of the same group, who will . now switch to TSB. Coming back: The 636 branches up for sale are to be re-branded under the TSB symbol last used in 1995 . This will give the new TSB Britain’s eighth largest . network of bank branches. The European Commission had ordered . Lloyds to get rid of the branches by the end of this year as a condition . of receiving a £20billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008. Now that the Co-op deal has fallen through, Lloyds intends to float  the revamped TSB brand on the Stock Exchange. But this is unlikely to happen until . next year at the earliest, so bosses will have to appeal to the European . Commission to extend the deadline for offloading the branches. In the meantime, insiders concede that . TSB will effectively be an offshoot of Lloyds, with Lloyds current . accounts, savings, mortgages and investments and staff, although . chequebooks and credit cards will be branded with the TSB logo. Once TSB is floated, it will stand . alone and compete with Lloyds and other lenders. Lloyds, which is 39 per . cent owned by the taxpayer, has seen its reputation plummet after being . rescued by taxpayers during the financial crisis and setting aside . £6.7billion to pay customers mis-sold payment protection insurance. Experts welcomed the relaunch of TSB but expressed dismay at the collapse of the Co-op deal. There were also concerns that TSB would only really be a mini-Lloyds until its flotation. Ministers had hoped the Co-op’s . purchase of the branches would create a big, independent competitor to . the main high street banks. Deal dead: Lloyds Banking Group's sale of more than 600 branches to the Co-operative Group has collapsed . Business Secretary Vince Cable said: . ‘It is very disappointing. I was really hoping this would happen. We . need more competition and we need more diversity in business lending, . and having the Co-op, a mutual, a new player in small business lending, . would have been a big step forward.’ Barclays Bank said yesterday its first-quarter profit fell a quarter from a year ago after a rise in losses in its European business and a hefty bill for the cost of a restructuring plan by its new chief executive. The London-based giant reported an adjusted pre-tax profit for the three months ended March of £1.79bn down from 2.4bn. It had hoped to make slightly more - £1.85bn. Profits were dented by a £514m charge to cover costs associated with 'Project Transform', CEO Antony Jenkins' plan to axe 3,700 jobs, prune the investment bank and reform the bank's culture after a series of scandals. Mr Jenkins said yesterday the bank was making good early progress with its overhaul. 'In our goal to become the 'Go-To' bank we have not chosen an easy path for Barclays, but we have chosen the right one,' he said. Consumer campaigner Richard Lloyd, . executive director of Which?, said: ‘This is very bad news for everyone . wanting to see more competition in retail banking. ‘This would have given more choice to . consumers who are sick and tired of shoddy service and unfair fees and . put more pressure on the big banks to work for customers, not bankers.’ TSB grew from humble beginnings to . become a major player on the high street, famous for its slogan, ‘The . bank that likes to say Yes’.

Unlike other banks, their customers . included labourers and servants – termed the ‘industrious poor’ – as . well as women and children. After being amalgamated into regional . institutions, they united in 1986, floating on the stock exchange to . form TSB.

Thousands of MMR vaccines have been stockpiled by the Government so anyone who has not had the jab can be immunised, it emerged last night. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs there was a 'national plan' in place in response to the epidemic in Swansea, where the number of measles cases has risen to 886. He said: 'I want to reassure you we are taking this extremely seriously. In terms of making sure we have sufficient numbers of vaccines, ensure that we are talking in a targeted way to communities and to schools, that's absolutely going on.' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has told MPs that thousands . of MMR vaccines have been stockpiled by the Government so anyone who has . not had the jab can be immunised . He told MPs on the Commons Health Select Committee yesterday that 'making sure we have sufficient numbers' of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was 'absolutely going on', The Times reported. Mr Hunt was asked about whether there would be a national MMR vaccination campaign by Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, who said in parts of her Devon constituency 30 per cent of children had not had it. Dr Wollaston said it was time for a 'national vaccination campaign' which would tell parents that by vaccinating their children 'you protect the whole community'. Health officials are expected to announce shortly a 'catch-up' programme for people who have not been immunised. The number of people infected with measles has shot up by more than 78 in just than five days, health officials have confirmed. Last week the disease claimed its first victim - a 25-year-old father-of-one from Swansea. Doctors warned this week that two million children are at risk of catching measles if the latest outbreak spreads. They said London, where nearly half of children have not had the jab, could be worst hit if cases of the disease spread from Wales. Teenagers aged 13 to 15 are most at risk, as many were not vaccinated from the late 1990s, when a now-discredited scientific report was published linking the MMR jab with autism. Labour MP Barbara Keeley, one of the MPs on the Commons Health Select Committee who questioned Mr Hunt yesterday, said MMR uptake was also low in parts of her Salford constituency. Many children were not vaccinated from the late 1990s, when a now-discredited scientific report was published linking the MMR jab with autism . Mr Hunt told MPs: 'We certainly must not think of this as something that's [just] happening in Wales. I receive regular updates from the Chief Medical Officer. We have comprehensive plans in place. 'We need to use this as a moment to slay the myth about MMR. I do detect a turning point in terms of the public's attitudes towards this but there is still that critical 11 to 15 year old age group that may not have been vaccinated because they were toddlers at the time the MMR scare was so appallingly whipped up.' MMR is administered in two doses - at around one year and again at age 4/5 before starting school. One dose provides 95 per cent protection against measles, mumps and rubella. Levels of uptake are now high - 89 per cent in England and 93 per cent in Wales and rising. The World Health Organisation recommends 95 per cent of the population have it for full protection. By 2004 first dose uptake had fallen to 80 per cent in England and 79 per cent in Wales meaning more than 100,000 children did not have it in that year alone. Typical symptoms of measles include fever, cough, conjunctivitis and a rash. Complications are quite common, even in healthy people, and about 20 per cent of reported measles sufferers experience them, including ear infections, vomiting and diarrhoea, pneumonia, meningitis and serious eye disorders. A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'We currently have enough vaccine to protect everyone who needs it. If your child has not had two doses of MMR, whatever their age, contact your GP surgery and make an appointment.' Jeremy Hunt also revealed to the committee that all 2,000 civil servants in the Department of Health would be expected to get regular 'frontline' experience in NHS hospitals - and that he had started already. Mr Hunt is understood to have worked at the A&E department in Watford General Hospital last week, doing cleaning, portering and observing clinical work. He will undertake different roles at other hospital trusts. He said: 'It's been great fun. I've learned a huge amount.' It was announced all policy staff including ministers would get experience of frontline NHS care following the report into the scandal at Stafford Hospital.","Health secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs a 'national plan' is in place .

"By . Wil Longbottom . UPDATED: . 06:55 EST, 8 February 2012 . Emails posted on the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission website after the Fukushima disaster last March have revealed the agency was kept in the dark about the scale of the crisis. The correspondence, posted after the earthquake and tsunami caused catastrophic damage to the nuclear plant in Fukushima, Japan, reveals experts in the U.S. disagreed over how to deal with the disaster. And while assuring the U.S. population that there was no danger, the NRC did not disclose a worst-case scenario which could have seen high levels of radiation affecting Alaska if Fukushima could not be brought under control. Panic: Smoke rises from the shell of reactor No 3 at Fukushima. Emails from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission reveal experts were kept in the dark about the scale of the disaster . Stricken: Hydrogen explosions causes structural damage to four of the reactors at the plant after the earthquake and tsunami struck on March 11 last year . One email, hours after the magnitude nine earthquake struck off the coast of Japan on March 11, and reported in the Washington Post, said: 'THIS IS NOT A DRILL. This may get really ugly in the next few days.' Three days later, another official said: 'It's frustrating, but we have very little factual info as an agency.' The NRC said it was on standby to help Japan cope with the disaster, but struggled to get through 'the fog of information' surrounding the damage at Fukushima, the Post reported. The emails also reveal experts disagreed on how to advise Tokyo Electric Power Co., which ran the plant. One idea, by physicist Richard Garwin, suggested using a 'shaped' explosion to break through the containment structure of damaged reactors to allow them to be cooled. 'Fog of information': U.S. experts said they were not getting accurate details of the scope of the Fukushima disaster after reactors melted down last year . Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told the Post: 'The emails provide a candid picture of the level of uncertainty and confusion within the U.S. government and indicates that even U.S. experts had major divisions about what was going on and how to best mitigate the crisis.' The agency was asked by several countries about pools used to house spent nuclear reactor fuel. At Fukushima, these peoples were either above or next to the reactors and NPR officials were worried they could leak or dry up - causing more radiation to escape. France, Germany and Japan sought access to NPR information on the pools on March 17, but it was reluctant to share the data over fears of potential attacks on reactors triggered by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Impact: Debris and stranded boats in Namie, Japan, after the tsunami last year. The NRC did not disclose the worst-case scenario which could have seen high levels of radiation reach Alaska . Mr Lyman added: 'There is a whole base of information about spent fuel fires and pools that the NRC is not sharing with the public. 'We understand that when you're concerned about terrorist attacks that you want to conceal information, but I don't think there's any reason to maintain such a broad blackout over this type of information.' Other emails reveal people in the U.S. calling for all nuclear power stations to be temporarily shut so tests could be carried out as well as Freedom of Information Act requests for details of correspondence on Fukushima. The emails, available on the NRC website, also reveal concerns over a U.S. reactor similar to one of the stricken units at Fukushima. The agency had been due to issue a licence extension to the Vermont Yankee nuclear reactor on March 16, but postponed it in the wake of the Japan disaster. A 20-year extension was eventually approved on March 21. Deserted: An empty shopping street in Namie, inside the 12-mile exclusion zone around the crippled Fukushima plant. The Japanese government has repeatedly been accused of withholding information on the disaster . It comes after a secret report by the Japanese government revealed last month that tens of millions of people may have had to be evacuated if the worst-case scenario hit Fukushima. The 15-page internal document, which was not released over fears of widespread panic, cast doubt on whether the Japanese government could have coped with an evacuation on such an unprecedented scale. Written on March 25, two weeks after the tsunami devastated the power plant, causing three reactors to melt down and generating hydrogen explosions that blew away protective structures, it revealed contingencies that would have required evacuation orders for residents within a 105-mile radius of the plant, including the whole of Tokyo.","One email reads: 'We have very little factual information as an agency'

The Daily Mail's front page from May 19 1943, which carried reports of the Dambusters raid under the headline: 'Heart of Ruhr Flooded' On May 16, 1943, 19 aircraft set out to destroy three dams in the Ruhr valley - the Mohne, the Eder and the Sorpe - and so damage a vital source of power to the key industrial area of Germany. The strategic targets not only supplied hydro-electric power, and water for steel-making, they also supplied drinking water. The squadron was assembled by Wing Commander Guy Gibson with only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission - using special bouncing bombs, invented by Barnes Wallis. They were not told that they would be bombing the Ruhr valley until six hours before the raid began, following weeks of practice over Peak District reservoirs. On the night of the mission - codenamed Operation Chastise - the 113 crewmen took off in three waves along two different routes to bomb the dams. Gibson attacked first at the Möhne at 12.28am, but five bombs were dropped before it was breached. The first wave’s three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the Eder which finally collapsed at 1.52am. Aircraft from the other two waves bombed the Sorpe but it remained intact. Although the mission was hailed a success, eight aircraft and 53 crew were lost during the raids.

It is not often that the president of the United States needs to seek fashion advice. But when Ronald Reagan was getting ready for a visit to England as a guest of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1982, his people had an important question for the Brits: Just what does one wear to go riding with the queen in the magnificent horse country surrounding Windsor Castle? The answer: Something smart, but casual, of course. Riding boots, breeches and a turtleneck sweater would do fine - no need for formal riding attire. Historical fashion secret revealed: Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, left, asked Britain's former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, right, what to wear before going riding with Queen Elizabeth II in June 1982 . Small talk: Reagan chats with Thatcher during State Arrival Ceremonies at the White House in February 26, 1981 . The fashion inquiry is but one tidbit contained in nearly 500 pages of formerly Confidential documents relating to the Reagan visit being made public Friday by Britain's National Archives. The dossier shows the British government - led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher - to be extraordinarily interested in pleasing the relatively new president on his two-day visit. British leaders also fretted that perennial cross-Channel rivals might triumph in the tug-of-war for presidential face time in a visit that had to be sandwiched between two summits on the European mainland. The papers show that top Reagan adviser Michael Deaver had a way of annoying his British counterparts with last-minute changes and requests, and also surprised them with some of his objectives. Deaver, remembered as a shrewd image-builder, said he wanted Reagan to be photographed outside of formal venues, so he wouldn't be seen ‘exclusively in white tie’ at palace functions, even suggesting that Reagan go to a village pub to soak up the atmosphere. Powerful politicians: Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, left, stands with, U.S President Ronald Reagan, second right, and Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at London's Buckingham Palace, prior to a dinner for summit leaders on June 10, 1984 . There were raised eyebrows, and bruised feelings, when the White House failed to formally reply in a timely fashion to an official invitation from the queen - the sort of invite that usually commands respect and a prompt reply the world over. The queen's invite was left to languish for weeks and weeks, something that the British believe is simply Not Done. ‘It is really for the president to respond to her invitation, which he has not done personally, something that I have pointed out several times here,’ writes Nicholas Henderson, Britain's ambassador to Washington, in a memo to the British Foreign Office. ‘As you know those surrounding the president are not deliberately rude: It is simply that they are not well-organized and do not have experience of this sort of thing.’ William F. Sittman, a special assistant to Reagan who was involved in planning the trip, told The Associated Press that it is possible the delay in responding to the queen was caused by first lady Nancy Reagan's insistence on consulting her astrologer before travel plans were finalized. ‘You have to remember that Mrs Reagan was very strict about his schedule, and she would consult her astrologer to see if this was the right time to travel,’ he said. ‘Sometimes she would back up departures.’ Familiar company: Reagan meeting with Thatcher during an economic summit in Venice, Italy, in June 1987 . The documents make clear that Europe's leaders were desperate for Reagan's attention at a time of high Cold War tensions. A memo from U.K. Cabinet Secretary Robert Armstrong on February 5 expresses concern that a gala, summit-closing dinner at the palace of Versailles outside Paris could delay Reagan's arrival in London. But he warns against pressuring the Reagan entourage to skip the meal at Versailles' Hall of Mirrors because ‘that would not please the President of the French Republic.’ Reagan's aides also worried the British by suggesting the president might have to skip the stop in London because accepting it might anger the Germans, who had offered a similar invitation. But feelings are smoothed over a bit when the Americans assure the British contingent that the Germans are not America's top priority. ‘Eagleburger emphasized how much the president himself wanted to go to London,’ stresses one confidential memo from the British ambassador, referring to senior U.S. diplomat Lawrence Eagleburger. ‘There should be no doubt about that. Eagleburger also said that at the moment the Germans were not America's favorite allies.’ Last dance: Reagan and Thatcher dance during the final state dinner of Reagan's presidency at the White House in Washington, D.C., on November 16, 1988 . The prospect of a chance to relax from international summitry with a bit of horseback riding with the queen seems to have helped carry the day for the Brits. Asked for the president's favorite type of horse, British planners are told simply that he wants a thoroughbred. He ended up riding Centennial, one of the queen's favorites, and wearing a perfectly fitted sports jacket above his sweater, going for an old-time Hollywood look he carried off with ease. Much of the actual visit was devoted to pomp and pageantry, or to relaxation, but Reagan did make one speech of consequence.
