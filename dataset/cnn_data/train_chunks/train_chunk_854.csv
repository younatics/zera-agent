"By . James Rush . A previously-unseen letter which describes the legendary football match of the Christmas Day truce during the First World War has been discovered. The letter was sent by staff sergeant Clement Barker four days after Christmas 1914, when the British and German troops famously emerged from their trenches in peace. Sgt Barker, from Ipswich, Suffolk, describes how the truce began after a German messenger walked across no man's land on Christmas Eve to broker the temporary ceasefire. Recount: The previously-unseen letter sent by Sgt Barker which describes the famous football game of the Christmas Day truce . Game: The letter, left, sent by Sgt Barker, right, recounts how the match began when a ball was kicked out from the British lines . British soldiers then went out and recovered 69 dead comrades and buried them. Sgt Barker said the impromptu football match soon broke out between the two sides when a ball was kicked out from the British lines into no man's land. His nephew Rodney Barker, 66, found the letter when he was going through some old documents following his mother's death. Sgt Barker wrote to his brother Montague: '...a messenger come over from the German lines and said that if they did not fire Xmas day, they (the Germans) wouldn't so in the morning (Xmas day). 'A German looked over the trench - no shots - our men did the same, and then a few of our men went out and brought the dead in (69) and buried them and the next thing happened a football kicked out of our Trenches and Germans and English played football. 'Night came and still no shots. Boxing day the same, and has remained so up to now... Optimistic: Sgt Barker details how things were 'looking rosy' after some of the Germans had given themselves up as prisoners . Family: Rodney Barker, left, found the poignant letter, which describes the truce in detail, from his uncle while going through documents following the death of his mother . Date: Sgt Barker wrote the letter on December 29, 1914, after the British and German troops had conversed during the truce . 'We have conversed with the Germans and they all seem to be very much fed up and heaps of them are deserting. 'Some have given themselves up as prisoners, so things are looking quite rosy.' His optimistic outlook proved quite wrong, as the truce was the last act of chivalry between the two sides and the war went on for four more years, with the loss of ten million lives. Passed: Sgt Barker's letter had to pass through the censors before it made its way to his brother Montague . The unofficial truce took place on December 24, 1914, in the trenches around Ypres. It started with German soldiers putting decorations up around their trenches and singing Christmas carols, including Stille Nacht - Silent Night. The British soldiers responded by singing O Come all ye Faithful. Soldiers on both sides then shouted Christmas greetings to each other and suggested meeting in no man's land when they shook hands and exchanged cigarettes. Sgt Barker joined the army in 1902 at the age of 18. He served with the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards and survived the Great War. In 1920 he left the army and worked for the Ministry of Defence. He died in 1945 aged 61. Mr Barker, a retired chartered surveyor from Fleet, Hants, said: 'I never met my uncle and found these letter amongst some of my dad's things after my mother passes away. 'It's amazing that it is so matter of fact. He is talking about clearing away bodies one moment and then a game of football the next. 'After 1914 there was gas and aerial bombardments and it got pretty nasty.'It's a famous event so it was a surprise to find out somebody from my family had such a close connection to it. 'At the time it was all hushed up because our troops weren't supposed to fraternize with the enemy.'It's an interesting insight and shows that the German troops in particular were pretty fed up even though the war was only three months old at this stage.' Cease-fire: German and British troops meet in no man's land during the Christmas Truce of 1914 . The letter was featured on a recent episode of the BBC's Antiques Roadshow. James Taylor, a historian at the Imperial War Museum, said: 'It is 98 years since the event so this letter is very significant. 'Various accounts of the truce exist so to have one surface after not been seen for almost a century is quite remarkable. 'This letter is of great historical value and the truce was the last bit of chivalry of the First World War. Survivors: Rodney Barker, left, with a photograph of his father and uncles, who all remarkably survived the conflict and the letter, right, which details the legendary moment . Brothers: A wartime photograph of Sgt Barker, left, and his brothers including Rodney Barker's father . 'The war had already been costly but it was about to get far worse. 'One of the reasons they were playing football was because they weren't able to communicate very well due to the language barrier. 'This was a way for them to share something. It wouldn't have been an organised match or anything, more of a free-for-all kick around. 'There is something appealing about the idea that nations could settle their differences in sport rather than war.'

Diego Forlan has become the latest Uruguay player to stick the knife into England following their 2-1 victory at the World Cup - by claiming that the Three Lions were 'afraid' of team-mate Luis Suarez. Liverpool striker Suarez punished two English defensive mistakes to bag a brace and knock Roy Hodgson's men out of the World Cup in Brazil after only two matches. And Forlan believes that England's players approached the game nervous as they knew what the 27-year-old was capable of having seen him score 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season.

The second one, he hit wide. A fit Luis would have scored that. 'And the third one, he scored to win the game. He never stopped fighting. 'That's Luis, he's never changed, not since I first saw him as a 17-year-old. 'I think England were afraid of him because they knew what he's done while playing in England.' What makes Suarez's feat more impressive was his admission that he was only '50 per cent fit'. The striker now has 41 goals in 78 appearances for Uruguay and will be hoping to fire La Celeste into the last-16.

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Trials are beginning for a British drug that could prolong the lives of thousands of women with advanced breast cancer. The drug, called irosustat, is designed to work with existing therapies to block the production of oestrogen, which fuels the cancer in two-thirds of cases. The pioneering study is being led by Professor Carlo Palmieri. He said if the trial shows the new pill is having an effect, it could be available within three years. ‘Most breast cancers need oestrogen to grow and there are two ways the body can make it,’ he said. ‘Currently, we’re only able to use a hormone drug to block one of these places, but with the introduction of irosustat, we’re hoping to prove that we can also block the other one.’ Tests: Trials are beginning for a British drug, irosusat, which  is designed to work with existing therapies to block the production of oestrogen (file picture) Each year around 50,000 women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer, and 12,000 die from the disease. Professor Carlo Palmieri, a medical oncologist at The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, collaborating with a team from the Linda McCartney Centre at the Royal Liverpool Hospital and the University of Liverpool, heads the pioneering IRIS study, which is being managed by Imperial College London. The drug was also developed at Imperial College London. After promising results in early tests, 27 women are being recruited for the trial. Professor Palmieri plans to run full-blown trials from 2015. He said: ‘It could possibly be in clinical use in three years and the good news is that this is a home-grown drug, it was developed in a lab in the UK.’ Collaboration: Oncologist Carlo Palmieri from the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in the Wirral is working with a team from the Linda McCartney Centre at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, pictured, and the University of Liverpool . The first patient was signed up to the trial in September and has been taking irosustat alongside her traditional hormone treatment, anastrozole, for the past four weeks. One of the first patients recruited said: ‘I found out I had secondary breast cancer in January, nine years after I’d had a mastectomy and was given the all clear. ‘It was a shock but I’ve always had the upmost trust in my doctors and knew they’d do what they could. ‘Unfortunately, my cancer is only treatable, not curable, so the main aim is to try and make sure it doesn’t grow. ‘A few weeks ago, I had a routine check-up and was informed that the cancer had become slightly more aggressive, so I was referred to Professor Palmieri, who told me about the trial. ‘I knew instantly that  I wanted to take part as I  have seven young grandchildren and will do anything to stay around for them for as long as possible. Checks: If the trials show that the new pill is having an effect, it could be available within three years (file picture) ‘I’ve only been taking the additional hormone treatment for three weeks but I’m optimistic about the future and if I hear that my cancer has shrunk, even a tiny bit, as a result, I’ll be over the moon.’ Thousands of women are given aromatase inhibitors (AI) drugs, which include anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane, after chemotherapy. The treatment aims to ensure that the cancer doesn’t come back, or to prevent the tumour from growing by shutting down the body’s supply of oestrogen. These drugs only work after the menopause in women with oestrogen receptor positive (ER positive) breast cancer – around two thirds. Irosustat is given alongside AI drugs to block a different pathway of oestrogen production, by stopping a reservoir of a precursor hormone from being converted into oestrogen.","Drug irosusat is being trialled by patients in Liverpool and the Wirral .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Confrontation: Michael Schmidt was shot by police after barricading himself in an apartment lobby . A Dallas lawyer was shot dead by police after he reported a burglary at his home and then barricaded himself in the apartment complex lobby. Police claim Michael Edward Schmidt started to fire at them when they responded to calls of a break in at about 1.45am on Thursday. Mr Schmidt, whose 20-year marriage had recently ended, was shot as he approached police during the confrontation. No one else was injured in the shootout, but Mr Schmidt's 11-year-old daughter was in his Glass House by Windsor apartment at the time. The shooting took place in the building's lobby and resulted in the windows being shattered by gunfire. The incident began when Mr Schmidt, 47, allegedly told an employee in the complex that his apartment was being broken into. But when police arrived, the father-of-four is said to have barricaded himself in the main lobby, where witnesses claim he fired several shots. Officers told Dallas News they tried to negotiate with Mr Schmidt but when he continued to shoot at them, they fired back. Mr Schmidt, who represented clients in medical negligence cases at his father's law firm, had recently separated from his wife. The couple had started dating when they were teenagers and had four children together. He was a leading lawyer, having been voted Super Lawyer seven years in a row and was listed as one of the 500 Leading Lawyers of America. His mother-in-law, Susan McMordie said . she was shocked to hear of his death, and added that the family were . thankful that his daughter had not been physically injured in the . confrontation.

"By . Matt Blake . A retired FBI agent has become the longest-held American hostage in history, more than six years after he was kidnapped in Iran. Robert Levinson, 65, has now been held for exactly 2,455 days - one day more than US journalist Terry Anderson who was released by his Iran-backed Hezbollah captors in 1991, according to the FBI. Levinson, who left the bureau in 1998, was working as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling on the Iranian island of Kish - a hotbed for organised crime - when he vanished in 2007. The last his family heard of him was in 2011 when they were sent video and photos of him an anonymous email sparking fears the Iranian intelligence services may be behind his abduction. Scroll down for video. This undated handout photo provided by the family of Robert Levinson, shows retired-FBI agent Robert Levinson, 64, dressed as a Guantanamo Bay detainee . Longest-serving hostage: Levinson has now been held for exactly 2,455 days - one day more than US journalist Terry Anderson (pictured) who was released by his Iran-backed Hezbollah captors in 1991 . The photographs were released by the family to renew public interest in the case and come two years after a hostage video and photographs of retired FBI agent Robert Levinson raised the possibility that the missing American was being held by terrorists. Levinson, a private investigator, disappeared in 2007 on the Iranian island of Kish. The Iranian government has repeatedly denied knowing anything about his disappearance, and the disturbing video and photos that Levinson’s family received in late 2010 and early 2011 seemed to give credence to the idea. Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson (pictured far left) with his family in Coral Springs, Florida . The extraordinary photos — showing Levinson’s hair wild and gray, his beard long and unkempt — are being seen for the first time publicly after the family provided copies to the AP. The video has been previously released. In response to Iran’s repeated denials, and amid secret conversations with Iran’s government, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement in March 2011 that Levinson was being held somewhere in South Asia. The implication was that Levinson might be in the hands of terrorist group or criminal organization somewhere in Pakistan or Afghanistan. The statement was a goodwill gesture to Iran, one that the U.S. hoped would prod Tehran to help bring him home. But nothing happened. A progression of images released by the FBI which shows the aging and hair growth of retired FBI agent Robert Levinson from before his kidnap in 2007 (1st left) to the first image released of him in 2009 to a more recent CGI 2011 image of the hostage . Levinson retired from the FBI in 1998 and became a private investigator. He was investigating cigarette smuggling in early 2007, and his family has said that took him to the Iranian island of Kish, where he was last seen . Two years later, with the investigation stalled, the consensus now among some U.S. officials involved in the case is that despite years of denials, Iran’s intelligence service was almost certainly behind the 54-second video and five photographs of Levinson that were emailed anonymously to his family. The level of expertise used to send those items was too good, indicating professional spies were behind them, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk publicly. While everything dealing with Iran is murky, their conclusion is based on the U.S. government’s best intelligence analysis. The photos, for example, portray Levinson in an orange jumpsuit like those worn by detainees at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay. The family received them via email in April 2011. In each photo, he held a sign bearing a different message. Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson with three of his daughters in Coral Springs in Florida before his disappearance . 'I am here in Guantanamo,' one said. 'Do you know where it is?' Another read: 'This is the result of 30 years serving for USA.' Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has personally and repeatedly criticized the U.S. over its detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. U.S. operatives in Afghanistan managed to trace the cellphone used to send the photographs, officials said. But the owner had nothing to do with the photos, and the trail went cold. It was that way, too, with the hostage video the family received. It was sent from a cyber cafe in Pakistan in November 2010. The video depicted a haggard Levinson, who said he was being held by a 'group.' In the background, Pashtun wedding music can be heard. Robert Levinson with one of his grandchildren before his disappearance in 2007 on an Iranian resort island investigating cigarette smuggling . The Pashtun people live primarily in Pakistan and Afghanistan, just across Iran’s eastern border. Yet the sender left no clues to his identity and never used that email address again. Whoever was behind the photos and video was no amateur, U.S. authorities concluded. They made no mistakes, leading investigators to conclude it had to be a professional intelligence service like Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security. Levinson’s wife, Christine, provided the photos to The Associated Press because she felt her husband’s disappearance was not getting the attention it deserves from the government. 'There isn’t any pressure on Iran to resolve this,' she said. 'It’s been much too long.' Though U.S. diplomats and the FBI have tried behind the scenes to find Levinson, of Coral Springs, Florida, and bring him home, both presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have said little about his case and have applied little public pressure on Iran for more information about Levinson’s whereabouts. Christine Levinson has watched more public pressure result in Iran’s release of a trio of hikers, a journalist named Roxana Saberi and a team of British sailors captured by the Iranian Navy. Everyone has come home except her husband. Washington’s quiet diplomacy, meanwhile, has yielded scant results beyond the Iranian president’s promise to help find Levinson. 'We assumed there would be some kind of follow-up and we didn’t get any,' Christine Levinson said. 'After those pictures came, we received nothing.' In one meeting between the two countries, the Iranians told the U.S. that they were looking for Levinson and were conducting raids in Baluchistan, a mountainous region that includes parts of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan, U.S. officials said. But the U.S. ultimately concluded that the Iranians made up the story. There were no raids, and officials determined that the episode was a ruse by Iranian counterintelligence to learn how U.S. intelligence agencies work. An expert on Russian organized crime, Levinson retired from the FBI in 1998 and became a private investigator. He was investigating cigarette smuggling in early 2007, and his family has said that took him to the Iranian island of Kish, where he was last seen. Kish is a popular resort area and a hotbed of smuggling and organized crime. It is also a free trade zone, meaning U.S. citizens do not need visas to travel there.","Robert Levison, 65, disappeared from the Iranian isle of Kish in 2007 .

"By . Sanchez Manning . and Nick Craven . The Government’s controversial High Speed 2 rail link will be dealt a huge blow tomorrow as MPs demand that the top speed for trains on the line should be slashed by 40mph. The proposal is just one of a damaging series of criticisms of the £50 billion HS2 project contained in a leaked parliamentary report seen by The Mail on Sunday. The slower speed would add ten minutes to the predicted journey time from London to Birmingham, making it only 25 minutes quicker than current trains. High Speed (ish): The journey time from London to Birmingham could be just 25 minutes shorter than it is now under plans to cut the speed of HS2 trains from 225mph to 185mph - to curb emissions . Critics already say that the project is a waste of money and the marginal savings on journey times do not justify the enormous cost. The Environmental Audit Select Committee’s findings come just weeks before a crucial Commons vote on legislation that must be passed to give the HS2 scheme the go-ahead. The MPs’ report says: . The MPs’ criticisms came as campaigners from the HS2 Action Alliance issued an expert report claiming HS2’s figures on electricity consumption and carbon footprints are ‘highly biased’. The Alliance says the real carbon impact of Phase 1 from London Euston to Birmingham will be more than double the official estimate and equivalent to the emissions of 1.44 million homes, or 5.4 per cent of households in the UK. Route: The line will run from London's Euston station to Birmingham on a different route to the one now used . The MPs recommend that ‘the legally binding commitment to reduce emissions makes even a small reduction [in maximum train speed] desirable. HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport should therefore examine the scope for requiring a reduced maximum speed for the trains until electricity generation has been sufficiently decarbonised to make that a marginal issue.’ Dr Richard Wellings at think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the new revelations showed HS2 does not make sense. He said: ‘Already the time savings are quite small. The problem is if they reduce the speed further then the argument that this project is going to give time savings is further diminished. 'The most obvious thing to do to if they’re worried about carbon emissions is not to build it at all. From an environmental point of view it makes more sense to make better use of existing lines.’ Current journey time  1hr 24mins at 118mph . HS2 original plan   49mins at 225mph . HS2 new proposal   59mins at 185mph . Last night environmental campaigners heaped criticism on the Government for its lack of commitment to protecting wildlife and woodlands likely to be affected by the line as it cuts a swathe through some of England’s most picturesque areas. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) accused Ministers and HS2 Ltd of putting profits before conservation. Ralph Smyth, from CPRE, said: ‘In a bid to pursue economic growth at any cost as quickly as possible, HS2 Ltd has failed to make any changes that would protect the environment. ‘More measures and more funding will be needed if our cherished landscapes, ancient woodlands and wildlife habitats are to be protected.’ And he predicted that with the select committee report ‘the heat’ will now be on Government to respond with ‘credible promises’. During a month-long inquiry, the Woodland Trust warned MPs that at least 48 ancient woodlands plus protected species such as bats and water rats were under threat. Wildlife: The move threatens species of bat, water rat and several trees, according to the Woodland Trust . Last night the charity dismissed claims by the Government that such environmental destruction could be offset through the planting of trees and vegetation elsewhere. The Select Committee’s report will be considered by MPs when they vote on the HS2 Hybrid Bill at its second reading later this month. This Bill must be passed into law to grant permission to the HS2 scheme, which will eventually see 225mph trains running between London to Leeds and Manchester via Birmingham. But the HS2 Action Alliance questioned how rigorously routes have been surveyed to assess the environmental effects. Spokesman Richard Houghton said: ‘There is absolutely no way proper surveying or research of the route could have possibly been carried out to any credible extent in such a short period. ‘The current Hybrid Bill has been described as a developers’ charter because it is laced with clauses  that will allow them to build  on Green Belt and currently protected countryside.’ An HS2 Ltd spokesperson said: 'The levels of environmental protection set out in the Environmental Statement are higher than for any other project of such a significant scale. This includes a commitment to plant more than two million trees along the route of Phase One. 'The committee has acknowledged that the aim of ‘no net biodiversity loss' is a challenging one. There may be opportunities to achieve a net gain as the project develops and these will be considered fully. 'HS2 Ltd acknowledges the need to complete the outstanding protected species surveys as soon as possible and this work continues. We share the committee's regret than some landowners have refused access for environmental surveys and hope they will now grant this access. 'We will contribute to the Government's response to the committee once the entire detail of the report has been given due consideration.'","Details are in leaked Parliamentary report seen by The Mail on Sunday .

HS2's environmental plans also 'not full enough and could endanger bats'
The maximum speed on the line should be cut from 225mph to 185mph to reduce carbon emissions.
Environmental surveys on the impact on ancient woods and wildlife have not been carried out on nearly half the land along the route.

Challenged: Liberal Democrat minister Simon Hughes faced tough questions on the flagship discussion show . In contrast, Miss Reeves was simply to be asked two soft questions: whether her party supported a financial bail-out for Ukraine and whether Labour agreed with the Government’s handling of the crisis. Lib Dem justice minister Simon Hughes was also lined up for more questions than Miss Reeves, including multiple queries about G8 talks and a Ukrainian bail-out. The Mail has seen a copy of the questions and prompts to be sent to Mr Dimbleby. The email was seized on by the Conservatives who claimed it proved bias in favour of Labour by the Corporation. Other guests on the show – screened last week – were the Times columnist David Aaronovitch, the Daily Mail’s Amanda Platell and former Kremlin adviser and Russian commentator Alexander Nekrassov, who later tweeted that there ‘should be an alternative question time … with an impartial presenter and all panellists given equal opportunities to speak’. ‘Now that the dust has settled I must say that last week’s was an appalling programme, biased and hijacked by liberals,’ he added. Contrast: There was a long line of issues on which to challenge Tory grandee Lord Heseltine . Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen . said: ‘This leaked document confirms what viewers could see in front of . them – bias is endemic at the BBC.The viewing public, and licence fee . payers, deserve better than this. But under the new leadership things . seem to be getting worse not better. ‘The BBC should get a grip and hold a proper inquiry into bias into their flagship programmes.’ But a BBC spokesman said: ‘We are satisfied that the programme was . fair, balanced and followed our guidelines on impartiality. Bias: John Humphrys admitted the BBC naturally attracts liberal-minded people . 'Question . Time goes to great lengths to ensure the panel and audience is balanced . and reflects a wide range of political views. 'The programme is a free . flowing discussion with David balancing moderating the debate whilst . allowing it to naturally develop.’ Question Time, screened on Thursdays on BBC One, is made by independent production firm Mentorn. It . typically attracts 2.7million viewers although audience figures peaked . at more than 7million when it controversially invited the BNP’s Nick . Griffin on the show. Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys admitted earlier this week that there is a ‘broadly liberal’ bias at the BBC. But he put this down to the BBC hiring the ‘best and the brightest’ university graduates where left-wing views were common. ‘The BBC has tended over the years to be broadly liberal as opposed to broadly conservative for all sorts of perfectly understandable reasons,’ he told the Radio Times. ‘The sort of people we’ve recruited - the best and the brightest - tended to come from universities and backgrounds where they’re more likely to hold broadly liberal views than conservative.’ He also admitted the BBC was ‘grotesquely over managed’ and that its reporting on issues such as immigration and the European Union has not been sufficiently sceptical.

A crime museum in Gloucestershire is displaying the bullet-ridden skull of a pro-Nazi officer who was executed with his own gun as part of a macabre exhibition of Holocaust relics . Medical Syringes recovered from Auschwitz at the time of liberation. It is believed they were used to carry out gruesome medical tests on camp prisoners . Gold dental caps that were removed by the Nazis from Jewish inmates on their arrival to Auschwitz during the holocaust years . Museum curator, Andy Jones, 52, said: 'The new exhibit features a collection of artefacts recovered at the end of the holocaust. 'The muzzle worn by a German Shephard dog in Auschwitz is the only one on display in the world. 'The . prison guards would remove the muzzles and unleash the poison fanged . hounds onto the prisoners - including pregnant Jewish women. 'Artefacts like the Jew's gold teeth reveal the brutal side of the holocaust. 'The Nazis would remove the prisoners crowns and gold teeth as they came into the camp.

"Washington now believes terror network is on brink of defeat . By . Christopher Leake . Updated: . 03:20 EST, 29 August 2011 . Al Qaeda’s second-in-command has been . killed in Pakistan amid speculation that he was targeted by an unmanned . U.S. CIA drone aircraft. The death of Libyan-born Atiyah Abd . Al-Rahman – who had been considered as a possible successor to the . group’s leader Osama Bin Laden after his death earlier this year – is . such a major blow to the terror network that American intelligence . officials claimed last night it was on the verge of defeat. Al-Rahman, Al Qaeda’s former . operational leader, rose to be its No 2 after U.S. Navy Seals killed Bin . Laden in a dramatic raid on his Pakistan compound in May. Dead: Atiyah Abd Al-Rahman is believed to have been killed in a U.S. drone attack . Last night, sources within US . President Barack Obama’s administration said Al-Rahman, an explosives . expert, was killed on August 22 in the lawless Pakistani tribal region . of Waziristan. U.S. officials would not say how . Al-Rahman was killed. But his death came on the same day that tribal . leaders in the area said CIA drones had struck a vehicle and a guest . house. Such attacks by unmanned aircraft are . Washington’s weapon of choice for killing terrorists in the . mountainous, hard-to-reach area along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Al-Rahman, second-in-command to the . new Al Qaeda leader, Egyptian-born Ayman Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri, was . a close confidant of Bin Laden and once served as his emissary to Iran. He was allowed to move freely in and out of Iran as part of that . arrangement and has been operating out of Waziristan for some time. Last autumn, the U.S. government posted a $1 million reward for information on Al-Rahman’s whereabouts. Lethal weapon: Unmanned drones are the weapon of choice for the U.S. as they hunt down Al Qaeda operatives hiding in Pakistan's mountainous terrain . Al-Rahman, 38, a fanatical Islamic fundamentalist, linked up with Bin Laden as a teenager in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet Union. He joined Al Qaeda in the early Nineties then fought in Afghanistan. In 1993 he moved to Algeria to serve as a liaison between Al Qaeda and Algerian radicals fighting a civil war against the military government in the North African nation.Intelligence analysts learned only in June 2006 that Al-Rahman was a leading player in Al Qaeda when the U.S. military recovered a long letter he had written to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian fighter who ran Al Qaeda’s operations in Iraq. After Navy Seals killed Bin Laden, they found evidence of Al-Rahman’s role as Al Qaeda’s operational chief. U.S. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said last month that Al Qaeda’s defeat was within reach if the U.S. could mount a string of successful attacks on the group’s weakened leadership. ‘Now is the moment, following what happened with Bin Laden, to put maximum pressure on them,’ he said. ‘If we continue this effort we can really cripple Al Qaeda as a major threat.’",Washington now believes terror network is on brink of defeat .
"By . Gerri Peev, Political Correspondent . Low-fat diets do not curb heart disease or help you live longer – the real enemy is sugar and carbohydrates, according to a leading scientist. Current dietary advice is based on flawed evidence from the 1950s that has demonised saturated fat and put public health at risk, he said. James DiNicolantonio, a cardiovascular research scientist in New York, said: ‘We need a public health campaign as strong as the one we had in the 70s and 80s demonising saturated fats, to say that we got it wrong.’ Leading scientist James DiNicolantonio says low-fat diets do not curb heart disease or help people live longer ¿ the real enemy is sugar and carbohydrates . Writing in the journal Open Heart, he added: ‘There is no conclusive proof that a low-fat diet has any positive effects on health. Indeed, the literature indicates a general lack of any effect (good or bad) from a reduction in fat intake. ‘The public fear that saturated fat raises cholesterol is completely unfounded.’ Experts believed the low-fat diet would lead to less obesity and diabetes – when the exact opposite was true, he added. Evidence shows a low-carbohydrate diet – as opposed to a low-fat diet – actually improves cholesterol. However, he believed that processed foods should still be avoided. British experts last year claimed that faulty interpretation of scientific studies had perpetuated a myth that a high-fat diet is bad for the heart. People were advised to reduce fat intake to 30 per cent of total energy and saturated fat intake to 10 per cent. However, research now fails to show a link between saturated fat intake and risk of cardiovascular disease, with saturated fat actually found to be protective. Sweden has become the first western nation to develop dietary guidelines rejecting the low-fat myth, in favour of low-carb, high-fat nutrition advice. Professor Tom Sanders, of King's College London says people should choose foods containing unsaturated oils such as fish and nuts . Dr DiNicolantoni said: ‘From these data, it is easy to comprehend that the global epidemic of atherosclerosis, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and the metabolic syndrome is being driven by a diet high in carbohydrate/sugar as opposed to fat, a revelation that we are just starting to accept.’ The best diet to boost and maintain heart health is one low in refined carbohydrates, sugars and processed foods, he said. Brian Ratcliffe, professor of nutrition at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, agreed that the evidence failed to support advice to cut fat and saturated fat. ‘Many who adhere to dietary dogma have chosen to ignore the uncomfortable facts that did not fit the hypothesis’ he said. But Professor Tom Sanders, head of diabetes and nutritional sciences division in the School of Medicine at King’s College London, said Dr DiNicolantoni had misrepresented the scientific evidence. ‘Refocusing dietary advice on sugar and away from fat modification and reduction is not helpful,’ he said. Prof Sanders, who advises the industry-backed Global Dairy Platform, said: ‘Dietary advice to avoid fatty meat products, choose reduced-fat dairy produce, and to restrict intakes of cakes, biscuits and puddings, which are often both high in  saturated fat and sugar, and to select foods containing unsaturated oils such as nuts, fish and vegetable oils remain good sense. Those who fail to learn the lessons of history are likely to repeat its errors.’ Alison Tedstone, director of nutrition and diet at Public Health England, said: ‘It is reasonable to conclude that a reduction in saturated fat intake will lower blood cholesterol, which may reduce the risk of developing heart disease.'","Low-fat diets do not curb heart disease or help you live longer, scientist says .

"By . Darren Boyle . As thousands of veterans remember the sacrifice of their fallen comrades who gave their lives during the opening days of Operation Overlord, life at many of the locations that saw the heaviest fighting continues as normal. In a fitting tribute to the fight against Nazi tyranny, young children are enjoying the freedom secured by those brave men and women on those dark days 70 years ago as the allies struggled for a foot-hold on mainland Europe. By the end of the first day, in the region of 160,00 allied troops had made it ashore along a 50 mile stretch of the Normandy coastline at a cost of 4,000 lives. Scroll down for video . US Army Rangers marching to their landing craft on June 5, 1944 in Weymouth, Dorset on their way to capture a coastal defence battery protecting Omaha Beach . The barbed wire has long since been removed from the Dorset holiday town of Weymouth, which one of the launchpads for the invasion of Europe . In the middle of the chaos of Omaha beach, US troops struggle ashore after their landing craft is sunk by murderous German fire from the cliffs above . Today, tourists enjoy the sunshine on the beach near Colleville sur Mer although a bucket and spade has replaced the M1 Garand rifle as the tool of choice . Omaha Beach, which was protected by overhanging cliffs had some of the most intense fighting of D-Day. Yesterday President Barack Obama visited the area as a 'powerful manifestation of America's commitment to human freedom'. President Obama said that 'by daybreak, blood soaked the water' and 'thousands of rounds bit into flesh and sand'. He also spent time at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial where almost 10,000 white marble tombstones overlook the battle site. After the success of the initial assault, US troops flooded Omaha to reinforce the beach head and break out into the French countryside before a counter attack . Today the only threat of counter-attack comes during a game of beach football on the sands where the second front in Europe against Adolf Hitler was opened . At the time of D-Day, supreme commander of the Allied invasion forces was smoking four packets of camel cigarettes a day. During the preparations for the invasion, cartographers printed 17 million maps. The invasion was a logistical nightmare, with industry spending months preparing seven million jerry cans to carry fuel as troops advanced from the beach head. Special tanks were deployed on D-Day to destroy some of the four million mines which had been deployed to kill and maim soldiers and disable armour. Elements of the US 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division are dug in behind a concrete wall on Utah beach preparing to advance towards La Madeleine . Over the past 70 years the concrete wall has crumbled allowing easier access for families going home after an enjoyable day in the surf . US paratroops who dropped into Normandy carried almost 55 kg of equipment, including two morphine syringes, 'one for pain, two for eternity'. They also carried 24 sheets of toilet paper in their emergency ration packs, as well as four chocolate bars and some tobacco. In the aftermath of D-Day a lone soldier stands guard beside the remains of US fighter aircraft which has crash landed on Juno Beach during the assault . Two rubbish bins mark the spot where a US fighter aircraft crashed on D-Day, while changing huts have replaced the broken ammunition crates strewn across the sand . On Juno Beach, British and Canadian reinforcements are faced with wading past the bodies of hundreds of dead soldiers, killed during the opening attacks. Soldiers are warned they must clear the beach without stopping, leaving behind injured comrades because of the intense fire from the defending Germans. US troops march up a hill overlooking Omaha Beach passing concrete bunker which had been earlier raking machine gun fire across the first troops to hit the sand . The concrete bunker remains as a reminder of the occupation while visitors to the beach today arrive in family saloons rather than amphibious tanks and landing craft . By the end of D-Day, the allies had landed 156,000 troops in Normandy suffering 10,000 casualties. Of the casualties, an estimated 4,000 lost their lives. Within five days, almost 330,000 troops had crossed the English Channel supported by 54,186 vehicles carrying 104,428 tonnes of supplies. 158640 . 101611 . 136255 . 316071 . 112199 . 101890 . 71080 . 89769 . 118887 . 199321 . 96160 . 149374 . 108205 . 60233 . 46040 . 171040 . 123833 . US Army troops use a heavily fortified German bunker that they have just captured, overlooking Omaha beach as signal post . A plaque on the front of the bunker remembers the events of 70 years ago outside Saint Laurent sur Mer as tourists walk past the immaculately tended grouds . To assist the invasion, French railway workers sabotaged 37 lines leading to the area to prevent the Germans from moving large numbers of troops into Normandy. Among the best trained troops on D-Day were two British commando brigades who were used on Sword, Juno and Gold beaches. Many of them had been subjected to live fire training exercises and harsh conditions in the Scottish highlands. As the allies made their way inland they were met by thousands of German troops willing to surrender, many held in temporary camps such as the one in Nonant-le-Pen . Today there is little sign of the Nonant-le-Pin internment camp which has been returned to farmland . Former German soldier Paul Golz was captured by American troops three days after D-Day. He was manning a machine gun near Sainte-Mere-Eglise when an American tank appeared when he surrendered. He was moved to a British ship where he ate for the first time in several days. 'I told myself, man I want another meal - and I queued for a third time and ate for the third time,' he remembered. 'Then a British officer shouted - ""what the hell is going on here? We only have 800 POWs on board but 3,000 eat?""' Farmyard animals didn't escape the carnage after these four cows in Les Dunes De Varreville were killed by an artillery burst which showered them in shrapnel . Farmer Raymond Bertot was 19 when US troops took a rest in his farmyard which is only a short distance from Utah beach . The body of a German soldier lies in the main square of Place Du Marche after it was captured by US troops who landed in Omaha beach . Today, there is no sign of the damage caused by heavy shelling during D-Day although the buildings were rebuilt with a few subtle differences . However, in the weeks following D-Day French towns such as Caen suffered extensive damage as German defenders attempted to prevent the march on Berlin . Today, the Rue Saint-Pierre has been rebuilt and is enjoyed by shoppers and tourists .","One photographer armed with a handful of D-Day photographs went out to find the original locations .

"By . Damien Gayle . 'No remorse': Chantelle Hayward was jailed for 27 months for a 'vicious and unprovoked' assault on three young men in Swindon on New Year's Eve . A man smashed over the head by a woman on a drunken rampage escaped injury thanks to his Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer fancy dress. The victim was one of three young men attacked by Chantelle Hayward, 21, at a hotel bar in Swindon, Wiltshire, on Christmas Eve last year. In what was described as a 'vicious and unprovoked' assault, she smashed a bottle on one of them, injuring him so severely his friends had to use clothes to stem the bleeding. She held a sharp object at the throat of a second victim, then smashed a bottle over the third - who police say was only saved from serious injury because his Rudolph costume softened the blow. White marks on the top of the fancy-dress outfit show where the fabric was ripped during the attack. Hayward was jailed for 27 months at Swindon Crown Court today after she admitted three counts of assault including grievous bodily harm. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Jennifer Gray of Wiltshire Police said: 'She has shown no remorse for her actions which are likely to have left her victims with lifelong physical and mental scars. 'I hope that her jail sentence will help her victims and their families and friends come to terms with what happened on that fateful night.' Following the court hearing the victims released statements describing the physical and emotional trauma they had suffered. The victim who was saved by his . reindeer costume said: 'I used to think that going out was about good . vibes, but now I’m more negative. 'If . I do go out I look around me and try to see who might cause trouble. I . used to love organising music events, but what Ms Hayward did has . completely ruined it for me. 'I now notice when venues serve drinks in glasses and glass bottles, seeing them as weapons.' Protective: A model wears the costume for a police photograph, left.

I now go out less than I did and when I do go out I’m always watching my back. 'Ms Hayward knew what she had done but she did not admit to it until the very last moment. She had so much opportunity to tell the police. 'I’ve been so stressed and upset, fearing going to court. It’s just made everything worse and harder to deal with. 'She’s obviously only thought about herself and not what she has put me, my friends and my family through.' The third victim, who suffered the most serious physical injuries, added: 'It took a matter of months for my body to recover. However, it is the emotional trauma which has affected me even more severely. 'I was due to go out for New Year with my friends. However I felt too ill and was too nervous to go anywhere - I rarely go out any more.'","Chantelle Hayward, 21, launched 'vicious and unprovoked' assault on three young men at a hotel bar on New Year's Eve .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Rupert Murdoch faces trouble on both sides of the Atlantic today following claims the FBI has 80,000 News Corp emails in their possession while a corporate probe into the company continues to gather pace. According to reports, the FBI has copies of at least 80,000 emails  - all of which are said to have been taken from the servers at News Corp, Mr Murdoch's parent company, in New York. The messages were not included in evidence submitted during the British phone hacking trial - and so could not be reported until the jury reached its verdicts, it is claimed. Scroll down for video . The FBI are allegedly in possession of 80,000 emails taken from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp servers . Reports of the FBI emails come amid suggestion two of the mogul's former editors - Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson - were cautioned as part of a corporate probe into News UK . The collection, which is said to be held by the FBI on a single disk, is thought to include some messages sent by former CEO of News International Rebekah Brooks, The Daily Beast reports. It is currently unknown what the messages contain - or what the FBI is planning to do with them. A spokesman for the FBI refused to comment on today's claims when approached by MailOnline. It is understood that many of the emails were made available to Scotland Yard's Operation Weeting as long as 16 months ago by the Bureau. The FBI was provided with the emails after they were disclosed by News Corp to the United States Department of Justice. It is unclear whether they were then shared with the Crown Prosecution Service or with defence lawyers. A News Corp executive said today: 'Reports that there are new hacking allegations or newly . discovered emails are false. 'We . voluntarily produced material to the Department of Justice more than a year ago . and we understand that material was fully available to the authorities in the . UK well before the trial.’ One report today suggested that the prosecution told the trial about their existence in April, towards the end of evidence being brought. However the emails themselves were not used. The twist comes amid reports Mrs Brooks and former News of the World editor Andy Coulson were cautioned as part of an on-going corporate investigation into Murdoch's News UK. According to the Independent, Mrs Brooks and Coulson were formally cautioned by Scotland Yard in May 2012 following a probe into the company - formally known as News International -  over hacking and bribing offences. A corporate charge for News UK would have serious implications to the running of News Corp. Mr Murdoch leaves his home this morning. The alleged corporate probe is separate to the individual hacking prosecutions this week - which saw Coulson found guilty of conspiracy to intercept voicemails . Mr Murdoch was said to be at News UK's Wapping base today for talks following the hacking trial verdict . News UK today refused to comment on the corporate charge and the allegations of cautions for Mrs Brooks and Coulson. The alleged caution is entirely separate from the hacking trial which culminated this week with Coulson - David Cameron's former director of communications - being found guilty of conspiring to intercept voice-mails. Coulson will be sentenced next week - as will five other former employees of the company who pleaded guilty to phone hacking. Mrs Brooks, however, was cleared of all charges. It has also been suggested today that Mr Murdoch himself will be questioned by the Met while in London this week. However, a spokesman for News UK categorically denied this was the case. Ms Brooks, who was cleared of all phone hacking charges in court this week, is said to have been cautioned by Scotland Yard in May 2012 . The News Corp boss was seen leaving his central London home this morning and is rumoured to have gone to the company's east London base in Wapping. It is suggested Scotland Yard has been sitting on evidence News UK could face corporate action as far back as October 2011. Andy Coulson was found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones earlier this week. He is also said to have been cautioned by Scotland Yard . Bosses were then informed the company was under suspicion in May 2012, it is claimed. Until that point, it is thought News Corp cooperated with police fully - a stance which changed when minutes from the Management and Standards Committee were requested. This is thought this move led to the confirmation that the company was being investigated - and not just individuals. Shortly afterwards, News UK lawyers are said to have met with the Met and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to argue corporate action would 'kill' the company. Lawyers are said to have argued such action would 'not be in the public interest' as it would lead to 46,000 jobs being jeopardised. It was around this time that Fox News and 21 Century Fox, Mr Murdoch's film and television companies, were separated from his newspaper businesses. The Met is yet to hand over its evidence to the CPS, reports suggest. Scotland Yard today told MailOnline they were 'not prepared to discuss' any of the allegations. When asked whether Mr Murdoch was also facing questing, they said 'no comment'. Labour MP Tom Watson told the Independent: 'It has now been revealed that a number of executives have been interviewed under caution, and now that the individual cases have been resolved, I am sure the Metropolitan Police will apply their customary urgency and pass their work on potential corporate charges to the CPS.'","FBI has up to 80,000 News Corp emails taken from company servers, it is claimed .

"By . Gerri Peev . and James Chapman . A senior minister last night risked causing fury in Downing Street by mocking the ‘Eton mess’ at the heart of Government. As it emerged that David Cameron has rebuked Michael Gove for highlighting the ‘preposterous’ number of old Etonians at the top of government, Baroness Warsi appeared on television with a spoof newspaper front page fuelling the row. The Communities Minister - who attends Cabinet but is not given the full Cabinet minister status - echoed the Education Secretary’s view that there needed to be more state school pupils like her at the heart of government. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Baroness Warsi on The Agenda with her spoof Eton Mess front page . Baroness Warsi told ITV's Agenda that she wanted to see less 'Eton Mess' and more 'bread and butter pudding' in the government . Incredibly, she appeared with a mocked up newspaper front page she apparently designed herself bearing the headline ‘Number 10 Takes Eton Mess off the Table’. It featured a picture of David Cameron and the faces of other old Etonians in Number Ten - chief of staff Ed Llewellyn, bumbling Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin and policy chief Jo Johnson - in a pudding bowl. Holding up the front page on ITV’s The Agenda, Lady Warsi said: 'Mine is this one, which is the story that we had earlier this week about Michael Gove talking about people at the top of the Cabinet. 'Number 10 takes Eton Mess off the menu, and replaces it with bread and butter pudding.' Lady Warsi, the former Conservative Party . chairman, went on: ‘Michael [Gove] was making an incredibly serious . point that it can’t be right that the seven per cent of kids who go to . independent school end up at the top tables, not just of politics, but . banking and law and every other profession.’ In an extraordinary swipe at the Prime Minister and his advisers, Baroness Warsi mocked them up in a pudding bowl . She added that the Education Secretary ‘wants to create a first class, a world class state system which means that in future years you will have more pupils from state schools, people like me, around the Cabinet table and in that I fully support Michael Gove.’ Mr Gove said in a newspaper interview at the weekend that the number of old Etonians in Mr Cameron’s inner circle is ‘preposterous’. He told the FT: ‘It doesn’t make me feel personally uncomfortable because I like each  of the individuals concerned, but  it’s ridiculous. ‘I don’t know where you can find some such similar situation in a developed economy,’ The Education Secretary has told colleagues his remarks were not meant to embarrass the Prime Minister. They were interpreted as a jibe at London Mayor Boris Johnson, another old Etonian, since Mr Gove is said to have decided to support Chancellor George Obsorne as Mr Cameron’s successor. Last night it emerged that Mr Gove - who won a scholarship to private Robert Gordon’s College - was admonished by the Prime Minister over the weekend for his attack on the influence of Eton. A Cabinet source told the Mail: ‘He was b******d ’. The Education Secretary is understood to have accepted that he had blundered. The Spectator magazine quoted another source saying Mr Gove had been ‘torn a new one’. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today insisted he was not interested in where people went to school. The 61-year-old, who attended Greenhead Grammar School in Yorkshire, told LBC 97.3 radio: 'I'm anything but posh, but frankly I don't think you should judge somebody on where they came from and whether they went to Eton or Shenfield High. 'I'm not even slightly worried about people inside the Government who went to Eton. There are two people with ministerial responsibilities that went to Oakbank grammar school in Keighley in my department and I'm not worried about that. 'We shouldn't be worried so much about where people come from as where they are going.' Eton College's chapel. The school was attended by the Prime Minister and costs £33,000 a year . Earlier a Cabinet said that Lady Warsi’s mock front page would be seen as ‘a weak joke’. The . peer was said to have been furious when she was demoted as party . chairman in the 2012 Cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister.

"By . Joe Bernstein . It’s the toughest and most exclusive Double in world football – winning the Champions League and World Cup in the same year. Since 1992 when the European Cup changed to its current format, only two players have achieved it out of thousands who have tried. Christian Karembeu (Real Madrid and France 1998) and Roberto Carlos (Real Madrid and Brazil, 2002) are the pair who made history, but others will try to take the first step to joining them when Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid play in the Champions League final in Lisbon on May 24. Path to glory: Christian Karembeu was part of the France side that beat Brazil 3-0 in the 1998 World Cup final . Heart-breaker: Roberto Carlos takes a free-kick as Brazil beat England 2-1 in the 2002 World Cup quarter-final . Four years . ago, Wesley Sneijder came very close, winning the Champions League with . Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan before and reaching the World Cup final, . which his Holland team lost to Spain. Xabi Alonso’s hopes of a double were ruined by his suspension for Saturday’s final but there are others who dare to dream. THE ODDS ON WINNING THE WORLD CUP AND CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . 11/2 - MARCELO (Real Madrid and Brazil) Of all the star names still in the running, Marcelo  is the only one who can claim to play for both market leaders Real Madrid and Brazil. His biggest task will be nailing down a place at left-back. He faces tough competition from Fabio Coentrao with Real, and Maxwell for Brazil. In with a shout: Brazilian Marcelo vies for the ball against teammate Gareth Bale during Friday's training . 8/1 - ANGEL DI MARIA (Real Madrid and Argentina) Has come good in the second half of the season to earn a place in the Real side. Argentina manager Alex Sabella, who is also spoilt for choice, will take him to the World Cup. He’s got the unique joy of setting up chances for Ronaldo for his club, and Messi for his country. Coming of age: Angel Di Maria's form has been vital in helping Real Madrid reaching the Champions League final . 8/1 - SAMI KHEDIRA (Real Madrid and Germany) Missed five months of the season with a knee injury but has timed his return to perfection. Would be a football fairytale if he emerged from the treatment room to win the two biggest trophies in the game. Alonso’s suspension gives him a better chance of playing in Lisbon on Saturday. Slice of luck: Sami Khedira may start in Lisbon after Xabi Alonso was ruled out through suspension . 10/1 - IKER CASILLAS and SERGIO RAMOS (Real Madrid  and Spain) The pair were all part of  Spain’s World Cup-winning team in 2010 and expect to go to Brazil this summer. Casillas is out of favour in La Liga but he’s the man to turn to for big occasions, Spain’s captain and holder of three Champions League winners’ medals. Dani Carvajal also plays for Real and Spain but is less likely to feature. Leading man: Iker Casillas has dropped down the pecking order at Real Madrid in the last couple of seasons . 11/1 – JOSE SOSA (Atletico Madrid and Argentina) A right-winger whose loan move from Metallist Kharkiv to Atletico in January couldn’t have worked out any better with a La Liga title already in the bag and maybe more to follow. Unlikely hero: Jose Sosa (left) tackles Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez as Atletico pipped Barca to the league title . 15/1 JUANFRAN, DAVID VILLA, KOKE AND DIEGO COSTA (Atletico Madrid and Spain) Costa is going to get a hostile reception in his home country of Brazil having chosen to play international football for his adopted Spain. But he won’t care if he arrives as the La Liga and Champions League winner with Atletico. Injury threatens his appearance in Lisbon though. On the verge of greatness: Striker Diego Costa (far right) was pivotal in Atletico's capture of the league title . 33/1 - KARIM BENZEMA AND RAPHAEL VARANE (Real Madrid and France) Being  left out of France’s 2010 World Cup squad didn’t do him any harm because the campaign ended in a players’ ‘strike’ and early exit. Since then he’s been scoring goals in bucketloads for Real. Varane is rated the best young centre-half in the world. New lease: Karim Benzema had scored 22 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid this season . 35/1 - CRISTIANO RONALDO, FABIO COENTRAO AND PEPE (Real Madrid and Portugal) If Ronaldo can pull off the Double and help Portugal win the World Cup, he’ll leapfrog Lionel Messi as the greatest player of his generation and possibly Pele and Diego Maradona as the greatest of all-time as well. Pepe is among the best defenders in the world. Unstoppable: Cristiano Ronaldo defies gravity as he controls the ball during Madrid's match against Bayern Munich . 40/1 – THIBAUT COURTOIS AND TOBY ALDERWEIRELD (Atletico Madrid and Belgium) Courtois will leave Chelsea embarrassed if he ends up with one major trophy, let alone two, as they have allowed him to stay in Spain on loan. 66/1  - DIEGO GODIN, CHRISTIAN RODRIGUEZ AND JOSE MARIA GIMINEZ (Atletico Madrid and Uruguay) Even if they pull off a surprise on Saturday, Luis Suarez’s injury diminishes their World Cup prospects. 250/1 – LUKA MODRIC (Real Madrid and Croatia) He will pull the strings for Real in the Champions League final but it’ll be a miracle if he’ll emerge triumphant in Brazil this summer, particularly with Croatia facing the host nation first. Old friends: Luca Modric and Gareth Bale were teammates at Tottenham before finding their way to Madrid . (* Odds compiled by Ladbrokes.

"By . Gerri Peev . Militant: Unite Union boss Len McCluskey . The bullying tactics used by unions are to be investigated by the Government. Ministers had wanted to conduct a wider inquiry that would also have scrutinised how businesses behave during disputes, but the TUC refused to take part because it said the review was too political. The move was prompted by last year’s Grangemouth oil refinery dispute, when company bosses were accused of blacklisting workers’ leaders, and union members intimidated managers and their families. The Government has now revised the terms of reference and appointed leading lawyer Bruce Carr QC to lead the six-month probe solely into the behaviour  of unions during strikes, looking at the alleged use of extreme tactics, including the so-called ‘leverage’ policy. It comes after the Daily Mail exposed the intimidation carried out by the Unite union. During its dispute with Grangemouth owner Ineos, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey sent a ‘leverage team’ to visit bosses’ homes, where they would protest in front of neighbours. One Ineos director said he had feared for his wife and two young children after 30 protesters arrived at his home, telling his neighbours he was evil. Another manager said Unite activists had appeared on his drive with flags, banners and an 8ft inflatable rat, adding: ‘They were trying to humiliate me, trying to portray me as a nasty boss, a nasty capitalist.’ Former Labour candidate Jonathan Roberts quit the union in disgust, saying Mr McCluskey was putting the entire union  movement at risk, adding that ‘picketing the family homes of company bosses and intimidating their children’ was not a ‘decent’ way of representing workers. Mr Carr, who will report to Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, and Business Secretary Vince Cable, will also investigate whether the law on union disputes was tough enough. Mr Maude said: ‘This Government’s long-term economic plan is building a stronger, more competitive economy to secure a better future for Britain. ‘Trade unions can play a constructive role in the modern workplace, but allegations of union industrial intimidation tactics – which include attempts to sabotage business supply chains – are very serious and may be damaging our economy’s competitiveness, which would make our future less secure. That’s why it’s right to have this review to get to the bottom of these tactics and to determine whether the existing law is effective.’ Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: ‘This review may have been announced with great fanfare by the Prime Minister, but the delay in setting it up, the limited terms of reference and the exclusion of the promised consideration of employer behaviour, such as blacklisting, confirms that it was never anything more than a headline grabbing party-political stunt.’","Ministers wanted inquiry to scrutinise businesses' behaviour .

"By . John Drayton . Thomas Muller has been told by Bayern Munich chief Karl-Heinz Rummenigge he needs to ask if he wants to leave for Manchester United this summer. According to reports in German newspaper Bild, the forward would be open to joining Louis van Gaal's revolution at Old Trafford this summer in a move worth £37million. Van Gaal was the manager who installed Muller as a first-team regular at Bayern during the 2009-2010 season and the prospect of a reunion would tempt the Germany  forward. VIDEO Scroll down for five of the best goals scored by United target Thomas Muller . On the move? Muller has been linked with a £37m transfer to United after growing frustrated at Bayern . Sharp-shooter: Muller, seen here scoring against Manchester City in the Champions League earlier in the season, has a proven goalscoring record . Shopping spree: Muller would be re-united with Louis van Gaal, the manager who made him a first-team regular at Bayern, if he decided to move to Old Trafford . But first he needs to persuade the club's chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge to sell him. Rummenigge told Bild: 'If a player does not feel comfortable with Bayern Munich, he must come to my office. Then you have to talk about it.' Muller, 24, has started 24 Bundesliga and eight Champions League matches this season but has only completed the full 90 minutes in 18 of these and reportedly considers this insufficient for a World Cup year. He passed up the opportunity to commit his future to the German champions, replying, 'No comment, no comment' in English when quizzed on his future by Bild. Muller added: 'I do not comment on rumours.' Struggle: Muller was unable to influence the outcome of Bayern's Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid last month . Glimpse into the future: How Muller would look in Manchester United colours . Muller has scored 25 goals this season, including one against United in the quarter-final, second leg of the Champions League. He is contracted to the defending European champions until 2017 and it would take a bid in the region of €45million (£37m) to convince Bayern to sell. United will reportedly have as much as £200m to spend this summer as they attempt to re-build their squad and reputation following a disastrous season under David Moyes. Shortlist: Toni Kroos would also interest United if Bayern were willing to sell the talented midfielder . Wanted man: United also have an eye on Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus . Van Gaal is the heavy favourite to take over after his duties with Holland at the World Cup and has earmarked a number of German players he wants to bring to United. Muller is alongside Bayern team-mate Toni Kroos, while Borussia Dortmund players Mats Hummels and Marco Reus have also been linked.","Manchester United transfer would tempt Thomas Muller .

"By . John Edwards . Follow @@JEAlty . Louis van Gaal is planning to announce his arrival as Manchester United manager by pulling off the spectacular signing of Bayern Munich forward Thomas Muller. Muller’s Bayern team-mate Toni Kroos and Borussia Dortmund pair Mats Hummels and Marco Reus have all been linked with Van Gaal, who will be confirmed as David Moyes’ successor next week. But informed sources in Germany have revealed that Muller is the name at the top of Val Gaal’s wanted list and that he is the one manager the Germany striker would leave his home club for. Wanted man: Louis van Gaal wants to sign Bayern Munich forward Thomas Muller for Manchester United this summer . Forward planning: Dutchman Van Gaal is set to be appointed as Manchester United boss next week . New look: Our mocked-up version of how Muller would look in a Manchester United home shirt . Frustrated figure: Muller, pictured here tussling Real Madrid's Gareth Bale, is not happy with his role at Bayern . Muller is unhappy with his role on the fringes of Bayern’s starting line-up under Pep Guardiola and has become increasingly frustrated at being left on the bench for key games, such as the Bundesliga showdown with their main rivals Dortmund and Champions’ League tie against United. Bavarian-born, he saw himself spending his entire career at the Allianz Arena but has been forced to contemplate the unthinkable of seeking a fresh start. According to sources close to him, Van Gaal’s imminent appointment as United boss has turned his sights towards Old Trafford. While there have been widespread reports of some players being at odds with the Holland coach, due to his confrontational style, Muller readily concedes he owes his standing as one of Germany’s foremost forwards to the 62-year old. As manager of Bayern, Van Gaal promoted Muller from the junior ranks and helped establish him as one of the Bundesliga’s most accomplished finishers. Undecided: Ryan Giggs' role next season is not known . History: Muller, pictured here in action against United, was brought through Bayern's youth ranks by Van Gaal . New man: Louis van Gaal (right) has been appointed Manchester United boss and could bring Patrick Kluivert . Van Gaal has not forgotten how he responded to being given his opportunity and has been alerted to the stand-off that has developed between him and Guardiola. Though United are not exactly short of strikers, with Robin Van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Javier Hernandez all vying for places, Van Gaal is renowned for being single-minded about the players he wants and will not hesitate to move for Muller. Persuading Bayern to do business may be a different matter. Under contract until 2017, Muller is hugely popular with team-mates and supporters, who see him as the face of the club due to his Bavarian roots and the way he graduated through the youth ranks. Target: Borussia Dortmund forward Marco Reus is being eyed by Van Gaal as part of his new look United . On the move? Bayern midfielder Toni Kroos has been on United's wishlist for some time . But that won’t stop Van Gaal dipping into his massive transfer budget and trying to lure him to Old Trafford to form a new-look strike partnership alongside Van Persie. Should he succeed, it would leave a further question mark against the future of Rooney, who would be left hoping Van Gaal might consider using him just behind the main strikers.","Louis van Gaal wants to sign Bayern Munich's Thomas Muller this summer .

"By . James Rush . Bravery: Norwegian spy Sven Somme fled to Britain after spending two months evading capture and execution following an epic escape from his German captors . The incredible bravery of a member of the Norwegian resistance who escaped his German captors by trekking 200 miles across snowy mountains has been revealed. Sven Somme fled to Britain after spending two months evading capture and execution following an epic escape. During his time in the resistance, the spy photographed strategic German military bases in his home country using a covert camera and sent tiny microfilms to the Allies hidden under stamps on letters. Now, some 70 years later, an incredible archive of secret documents he gathered has been found. Mr Somme was caught by the Germans in 1944 and arrested for spying, an offence punished by firing squad, but managed to break out of his handcuffs and tip-toe past his sleeping guard. He was pursued by 900 enemy soldiers with sniffer dogs and trekked for 200 miles across snow-capped mountains, even swinging from pine trees so not to leave footprints behind. He eventually reached neutral Sweden and safety. Following the death of his widow, his daughter, Ellie Targett, who lives in Herefordshire, found the intelligence documents that very nearly got him killed during a clear out. They included parts of envelopes containing tiny maps and intelligence reports hidden under the stamps in the top right corner. Mrs Targett, 60, found secret instructions sent to Mr Somme from the resistance that had been written in invisible ink over a mundane, typed letter on a piece of A4 paper. And she also uncovered the Nazi warrant, printed in both German and Norwegian, calling for Mr Somme's immediate arrest and a hand-drawn map on grease-proof paper he used during his escape. Mrs Targett took the documents, along with the pair of Brogue leather shoes her late father wore during the early stages of his flight to freedom, to a recent Antiques Roadshow event. Mr Somme managed to swap the brown leather shoes for a pair of mountain boots that were given to him by a family who had sheltered him. Demonstration: Sven Somme demonstrates how he leapt from tree to tree so as not to leave tracks during his escape (left). Right, Mr Somme is pictured with his wife Primrose, who he met in Britain . Documents: His daughter has now found an incredible archive of secret documents he collected while working as a spy . Incredibly, they had kept the shoes and gave them to Mrs Targett when she retraced her father's escape in 2004. Mrs Targett said: 'I knew my father was a spy for the resistance and that he was told he was going to be executed when he was caught because he wrote a manuscript in English as soon as he was safe. 'But I wasn't aware that he kept all these secret documents. My mother had them and when she died all of their stuff ended up in my garage. 'I went through it and found all sorts of documents. I knew what some of them were because he had said that he sent and received microfilms hidden under postage stamps. Warrant: Mr Somme's daughter also found an arrest warrant issued by the Nazis for his capture . 'I scanned one onto my computer and blew . it up and it was instructions from the resistance movement to . photograph the German U-boat bases that led to him being captured.' Mr Somme was a fisheries officer when Norway was occupied by the Germans in 1940. He . and his brother Iacob joined the resistance movement and fed vital . information about German military bases and size of units back to the . Allies. Iacob Somme was . executed by the Gestapo for his part in the famous sabotaging of the . hydro plant in Telemark the Germans were using to build the nuclear bomb . in 1943. Mr Somme, who . was aged 43 at the time, was captured when German soldiers saw the sun . reflect off his camera lens while he photographed a U-boat base on the . island of Otteroy. Mrs Targett, from Leominster, . Herefordshire, said: 'His instructions were to photo German military . torpedo batteries and submarine bases on the west coast. 'How many troops are in that area and where are they billeted, that sort of thing. 'He was spotted and he hid his camera under a stone because he could see the Germans running up to him and firing shots. 'He told them he was watching the birds and talked his way out of it. 'When he tried to get off the island there were two soldiers waiting for him on the jetty - they had found his camera.' Mr Somme was taken to the mainland by . boat and while the vessel was docked overnight he  managed to escape . after his guard fell asleep. Secret: Mr Somme's daughter, Ellie Targett, found intelligence documents that very nearly got him killed during a clear out . Archive: One of Sven Somme's secret letters hidden under stamps (left).

He . walked passed five armed guards because they thought he was a civilian . and fled up the mountains. 'Within one hour they found he was gone and sent 900 troops and a pack of blood hounds after him. 'He . went through ravines and streams before he bagan walking up the . mountains in his shoes. The higher he got the worse the snow was. 'He . was found by a friendly family who gave him a new pair of mountain . boots. When he escaped he only had an old pair of office shoes which . were no good and would have given him frostbite.' Discovery: One of the letters Sven Somme sent to the allies (left). Mr Somme's detailed maps were hidden under stamps (right) Mr . Somme hid out in a safe house for five weeks until false papers were . made for him before he walked across the border into Sweden. When he arrived in Britain he was given a private audience with the King of Norway who was in exile.

Revealed: The documents found by his daughter include detailed maps . Graham . Lay, the specialist from the Antiques Roadshow, which is due to feature . Mr Somme's archive this Sunday, said: 'The resistance was incredibly . important to the Allies winning the war. 'Without . these amazingly brave men and women, it's very likely that the outcome . of the Second World War would have been completely different.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Door trouble: James Allan's getaway was thwarted when he had trouble distinguishing the difference between push and pull . In the cut and thrust of armed robbery, negotiating a door is likely to be the least of your problems. However, it was a door that led to the undoing of criminal James Allan when he had trouble working out which way it opened. In a scene which could have come straight from the film Snatch, the robber's getaway was thwarted when he failed to distinguish the difference between the door's 'push' and 'pull' mechanism. Described by his own lawyer as 'bumbling and incompetent', Allan spent some time grappling with the complex device before losing his cool. Out of frustration, the 28-year-old took off his balaclava - only to reveal his face to the store's CCTV camera. Allan then kicked a panel near the door, smashing it in two, and knocked over a display before falling to the ground. He then demanded shop manager Amanda Croke let him out. The embarrassing blunder mirrors a scene from the 2000 crime film Snatch, where two robbers make a disastrous attempt at raiding a bookies. As they try to make their escape by pushing a door that won't open, they both collapse, exhausted, on the floor and take off their balaclavas in full view of the CCTV camera. However, the door then opens inwardly into the shop, pushed by a customer on the other side. Allan was jailed for three years at Oxford Crown Court for the raid on the Martin McColl newsagents, in Abingdon, Oxfordshire on March 2. Allan, of no fixed abode, ran off with just £134.98 after holding the shop up with a toy gun and ordering the till to be emptied. He admitted robbing Ms Croke and . possession of an imitation firearm, being jailed for three years for the . robbery and two years for possession of an imitation firearm, to run . concurrently. On screen stupidity: A scene from Snatch where robbers try to escape by pushing a door that opens inwards . Busted: The exhausted pair take off their masks... and realise the game is up when a CCTV camera captures their faces . A customer of the betting shop opens the door from the other side... simply by pushing it . After Ms Croke had to open the door for him, Allan ran off and was found by police in . the same road three hours later with the balaclava in his pocket and having thrown the weapon in a nearby . bin. Nikki . Duncan, prosecuting, told the court: 'When he was put in the back of . the police car he immediately started to cry, told police he needed to . pay the rent, and said: ""I’m sorry, it’s not fair on them - are they . alright?"".' The court heard that Allan, who had no previous convictions, had developed a Class A drug addiction . three years previously which had left him in debt to drug dealers who . had suggested the robbery. David Rhodes, defending, said his client acted in desperation. He added: 'It was totally unsophisticated, it was bumbling and incompetent. His actions after the robbery demonstrated Mr Allan is pathetic rather . than callous. 'You were only supposed to blow the bl**dy doors off!' The classic scene from the 1969 Michael Caine film The Italian Job . Complex: Allan tried to push the door open, despite it displaying a sign reading 'pull' Jailed: Allan was sentenced after pleading guilty to his crime at Oxford Crown Court (pictured) 'He hit rock bottom, he was sleeping on sofas in crack houses. The . drug dealers threatened him with something metal to his neck and . suggested one way to pay it back would be to rob a shop and they gave . him this imitation plastic toy gun.' Allan had also stolen four cheques from his father, John Allan, two of which he made out to himself in cash, stealing £1,600. He asked for the offence to be taken into account. Sentencing Allan, Judge Gordon Risius said the defendant had expressed genuine remorse. He . said: 'I accept you would not have acted as you did if you and your . family had not been threatened with violence, but it makes no sense . trying to get yourself out of trouble by doing something criminal . yourself.'","James Allan was seen grappling with a door that opened inwards .

"By . Sara Smyth . Angela England falsely accused a taxi driver of rape because she wanted her partner to feel guilty about leaving her alone in the vehicle . A 42-year-old woman who falsely accused a taxi driver of raping when she didn't have enough money to pay for her fare has been jailed for 20 months. Angela England made the allegation when her partner Jacqueline Scott left her in the car to get money from a cash machine, but did not return. Her claim that she was driven to a nearby school and raped was disproved by CCTV footage and the taxi's tracking device. Mold Crown Court heard the driver was later arrested in front of his colleagues while waiting in a taxi rank with other drivers. He was forced to strip naked at a North Wales police station for an intimate and 'embarrassing' examination. Richard English, defending, said he was an 'entirely innocent' party who was the victim of Ms England's anger towards her partner. He said the accusation was not borne out of malice towards the driver, but was an attempt to make her partner feel guilty about leaving her in the car and not returning. Following the accusation, the driver had to endure verbal insults from customers who called him a 'rapist' and a 'bloody foreigner'. The court heard that clients who knew about the allegations threw their money on the ground rather than handing it to the accused. As a result of the false claims, his license was suspended and he lost about £2,000 in earnings. Mr Philpott, prosecuting said the taxi driver was held in a police station for 18 hours. 'He could not sleep or eat during . this time because of his anxiety. He was unable to work when he was . released and could not face people for at least a week. 'Fortunately his boss was very . helpful and accepted what he said because he trusted him. His licence . was taken away and while he was on bail he had no income and could not . work as a taxi driver.' The mother-of-two from Manchester pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice in May last year. She said she had tried to improve herself by training as a nurse but had a history of abusive relationships which had caused her to self-harm and attempt suicide. 'She recognises the awful harm she has caused and has apologised to him by letter and through this court,' said Mr English. Robert Philpott, prosecuting, said: 'Ms England was working at a hotel in North Wales with her then partner Jacqueline Scott. Mold Crown Court today hear how the taxi driver's business was affected by the allegations. As well as enduring an intimate 'embarrassing' examination, he lost about £2,000 while his licence was suspended . They finished work early and at 3.15pm joined a 60th birthday party celebration in Llandudno where they stayed until 11.10pm when they moved to the Cross Keys pub and stayed until 1am. 'The journey was uneventful until he stopped near Mochdre and said the fare would be £16. Ms English had £10 and her partner had no money,' said Mr Philpotts. While he was keen one of the ladies should go and get money from a cash machine the result was that Scott got out of the car and walked the short distance back to their home. About 25 minutes later Ms English appeared at their home looking dishevelled and made the allegation that she had been raped. Mr Philpotts said: 'It is his good fortune that the taxi company have tracking devices fitted to their vehicles.” Recorder Greg Bull QC said: 'False allegation of rape is a terrible thing which effects not only the person against whom you make the accusation but it effects the prospects of women genuinely raped from receiving justice in their case. 'I accept in your case this allegation was made not out of malice to the taxi driver but to cause disruption to your partner. You resented the fact she had walked off.' The starting point for a prison sentence was three years, but the judge said he reduced it to take her guilty plea into account and to reflect her psychological difficulties.","42-year-old Angela England made the accusation after her partner left her in the taxi and didn't return with money .

The shocking disclosure comes in a risk-assessment dossier, prepared by officials pushing for the closure of four out of nine A&E units in North-West London and obtained by The Mail on Sunday. It comes as our campaign against the cuts gathers pace, and as: . Asked whether he would order a review of the closures in light of public opposition, Mr Hunt restated the policy of his predecessor, Andrew Lansley, that changes must be ‘locally led’ by health professionals, and that ‘the interests of the local community must be key’. Critics say that, in fact, many doctors oppose the cuts, as does the public. Where A&E units are facing closure, NHS bosses have insisted that they have only one aim – improving patient care – and not saving money. Critical list: A&E units are being closed or downgraded, with the public being urged to voice their discontent . For example, in adverts designed to persuade sceptical residents of the benefits of radical closures in North-West London, NHS bosses say it is a ‘myth’ that the cuts have been drawn up in order to save money. Yet the secret report from the ‘cluster board’ responsible for commissioning health care for the two million people in the area clearly states that one objective is to deliver £1 billion of savings by 2014. The ads also state that it is a ‘myth’, that the changes will put patients’ lives at risk. Yet the internal report, discussed at a closed meeting on September 7, identifies a ‘significant’ risk of adverse effects. Its most damning section concerns a ‘new risk’ to ‘Objective One’, the reorganisation itself. The risks are that the closure plans are ‘not accepted by patients, politicians and public’, that the care provided by GPs is ‘not robust enough’ to support the enormous extra burdens the closures will impose, and that the ‘new pathways of care’ will therefore not be successful. The consequences – graded ‘code red’ for being ‘significant’ and ‘serious’ – would, the dossier admits, be ‘poor patient experience and outcomes’, ‘service gaps’, and the whole system becoming ‘unaffordable’. Last night a spokesman for the  NHS in North-West London insisted that the risks would only apply if planned improvements to ‘out-of-hospital’ GP care did not go ahead. He said: ‘We have said very clearly, in public meetings and in all our documents, that no changes would be made to any hospitals before we had first spent three years implementing the out-of-hospital changes.’ As to the £1 billion savings target, he said the NHS had never hidden its hopes to save money, but insisted that was not the main aim. The spokesman’s statements drew a furious response from Labour MP Andy Slaughter, whose Hammersmith constituency includes two of the doomed A&Es, Hammersmith and Charing Cross. Ealing and Central Middlesex are the others. ‘It’s all very well saying no department will close for three years, but the decision will be announced in 2013,’ he said. ‘Once you’ve done that, how will the A&Es attract staff? They’re likely very quickly to wither away.’ Meanwhile, The Mail on Sunday today reveals another 11 areas where millions of patients could face longer journeys for A&E. In Hertfordshire, A&Es at Hemel Hempstead and St Albans have already been replaced by downgraded units, while Welwyn Garden City’s A&E will close next year. In Burnley, Lancashire, there is a growing campaign to reinstate the A&E ward closed four years ago. And the A&E at either Redditch or Worcester in the West Midlands will be closed, with no decision on which made yet. Nearby Kidderminster Hospital already only has a minor injuries unit after its A&E was closed down, but it could now lose this too. NHS chiefs say: ‘This change is being led by clinicians, who have said that doing nothing about the A&E situation is not an option. The proposed changes will improve patient safety and quality of service.’ Acute medical services at Neath Port Talbot hospital in South Wales were moved to Swansea and Bridgend last month. Although not strictly an A&E department, the unit could have treated heart attacks and strokes. Three other hospitals stand to lose the ability to treat major trauma cases such as car accidents, effectively downgrading the departments. The policy is designed to centralise specialist services, but many critics fear it is risking lives. Retired nurse Patricia Wright, 65, used to work at Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath, which lost its capacity to deal with trauma cases four years ago. She said: ‘Ambulance staff have told me that some patients didn’t make it as they had to be taken the 15 miles to Brighton.’ A hospital which complained that a Mail on Sunday article was ‘seriously misleading’ for reporting its casualty unit’s future was in doubt has been forced into a U-turn. Stafford’s A&E department has been closed between 10pm and 8am since last December – a move it originally said was temporary. But now bosses have had to cancel plans to reopen it at night, forcing about a dozen patients to travel long distances to alternatives every day. Backtracked: Stafford Hospital has reneged on a plan to reopen its A&E . When we launched our campaign in July, we said the department’s long-term future was doubtful, prompting a hospital spokeswoman to demand a correction, saying: ‘We are planning to reopen our A&E overnight from October.’ But that plan has now been permanently shelved after the GP-led clinical commissioning groups, which cover the hospital’s area, said they were concerned about the A&E’s ‘sustainability’. The hospital has a £46.6 million deficit, and a spokeswoman refused to rule out the possibility of the A&E closing altogether. Lyn Hill-Tout, chief executive of the hospital trust, said in a written statement: ‘We will not reopen against their wishes, but will work with them to provide alternatives.’ The hospital spokeswoman was ‘unavailable’ to comment about her  earlier complaint.

"By . Martin Robinson . A Home Guard inspired Dad's Army of computer security experts will be set up to protect Britain's businesses and help the armed forces at times of national emergency, it has emerged today. These 'reservists' will work alongside a new team of internet boffins who had helped the Government protect the UK from cyber attack during last summer's Olympics. Official figures show that 90 per cent of all big business in Britain was attacked online in 2011 - costing them at least £250,000 each. Security: Inspired by the Home Guard portrayed in Dad's Army - the Government is forming a team of reservists to protect Britain's businesses and armed forces from cyber attack . Online industries are worth £82billion a year to Britain, so Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has announced the measures to protect those that 'suffer at the hands of such threats'. As part of the plan the Ministry of Defence will set up a 'cyber reserve' it could bring in when it needed help. While three universities: De Montfort University, the University of Worcester and Queens University Belfast, will be used to train their students in computer security to form the next generation of British cyber guardians. 'We are constantly examining new ways to harness and attract the talents of the cyber security specialists that are needed for critical areas of work,' Mr Maude said in a written answer to Parliament. Home Secretary Theresa May wants security services to be able to snoop on email and internet records, but Nick Clegg is seeking to delay the Communications Data Bill . 'To this end, the MoD is taking forward the development of a ‘cyber reserve’, allowing the services to draw on the wider talent and skills of the nation in the cyber field.' The Dad'd Army idea is 'currently in development', he said, adding: 'Working with the private sector to improve awareness of the need for better cyber security continues to be a priority'. Water and power firms in particular are being targeted by foreign countries launching cyber attacks against Britain. The services ‘upon which daily life depends’ risk being disrupted by hackers working for the UK's enemies, officials claimed. Internet terrorism from ‘hostile foreign states’ is now one of the top four threats Britain faces. The scale of the problem comes as Home Secretary Theresa May stepped up her call for more powers to track email and internet use. She claimed people will ‘die’ without more powers to track terrorists, paedophiles and criminals online. A major Coalition split was laid bare as Mrs May took a swipe at Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg for blocking new internet powers to break up criminal plots on sites like Facebook and Skype. The £2billion law – dubbed a snoopers charter - would store billions of pieces of private information from emails, Facebook, texts and internet use. In a thinly-veiled swipe at her Cabinet colleague, Mrs May said opponents of her legislation are 'putting politics before people’s lives’. Mrs May said opponents of her Communications Data Bill had to 'look victims of terrorism in the eye', like those caught up in the 7/7 London bombings . Mr Clegg wants to delay the Communications Data Bill until 2014 to strike a balance between security and liberty’. But Mrs May said: ‘The people who say they’re against this bill need to look victims of serious crime, terrorism and child sex offences in the eye and tell them why they’re not prepared to give the police the powers they need to protect the public. ‘We would certainly see criminals going free as a result of this. There will be paedophiles who will not be identified and it will reduce our ability to deal with this serious organised crime,’ she told The Sun. Mrs May suggested . the new laws were needed to prevent a repeat of the 7/7 London bombings . or the shootings of two female police officers in Manchester in . September. ‘The . shootings of Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone brought everybody up sharp to . show the extent of the problem that can be caused by criminals. ‘It . would be harder for us to crack into organised crime gangs, and yes we . could see people dying as a result of not being able to have access to . this information.’ She went on: 'Criminals, terrorists and paedophiles will want MPs to vote against this bill. 'Victims of crime, police and the public will want them to vote for it. It's a question of whose side you're on.' However, a committee of MPs and peers is . expected to issue damning criticism of the measures this week, arguing . ministers have not made the case that is really needed. The Home Office insists the proposed storage of website visits for 12 months, along with use of Skype and even online games consoles, will protect national security. Without it, police and the security services will lose their ability to track the activities of crime gangs and paedophiles over time, they argue. Cyber attacks have been launched against the supplies 'upon which daily life depends,' including power firms . Officials warn that new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images. Gaps in coverage already mean the authorities have no access to a quarter of all communications data. The plans would cover when and to whom a phone call was made, not what was said. The content of emails would also not be stored, just details of who sent and received them.","Home Guard of cyber experts will protect UK business and armed forces .

He is only just back on the market after separating from his long-term girlfriend. But if Prince Harry was looking to find a new woman to take his mind off Cressida Bonas he had plenty of options at his best friend’s wedding. An array of beauties were among those invited to celebrate Guy Pelly’s marriage to Lizzy Wilson, the granddaughter of the Holiday Inn hotel empire founder. And the newly single prince made sure that he celebrated with them as he tried to put his relationship troubles behind him. While earlier in the day he had appeared subdued – though the yawns may have been a legacy of the three-day pre-wedding party – come the evening reception, surrounded by glamorous and beautiful women, his mood quickly picked up. The prince, who was spotted ‘twerking’ on the dance floor, was having such a good time at the ‘unbelievably wild’ party that he made the band play five encores as he kept the party going beyond the 1am finish time. And while his brother dominated the dancefloor, it was William who jumped on the stage singing the Isley Brothers’ Shout . Jimmy Church, whose Motown band provided the entertainment, told the Daily Mail: ‘It was a great night, it was unbelievably wild. ‘Prince William was in front of the stage moving to the music, and then all of a sudden it got to him and he got up on the stage and was singing and dancing. He was getting down and I was getting down.’ Mr Church said there were a number of women who tried to get close to Harry. He added: ‘Harry was dancing with the ladies. There were just so many, he was surrounded. Glamorous: An array of beauties were among those invited to celebrate Guy Pelly's marriage to Lizzy Wilson .

Natalie Sharp wept uncontrollably and had to be physically supported by her partner, David Niles, as she left a message saying she wished she could have been there to ‘protect’ the 12-year-old. She wailed ‘my little girl’ as she placed an orchid and teddy at a makeshift shrine yards from the home of her mother, Christine Sharp, where Tia’s body was discovered on Friday, a week after she was reported missing.

Last message: Ms Sharp's partner David Niles lays the flowers and note on the memorial . Incomparable loss: Miss Sharp is comforted by Mr Niles and a family friend as she walks away from the memorial . Miss Sharp, 31, spent five minutes at . the scene before becoming so overwhelmed with grief that Mr Niles and . another family friend had to carry her back to a police minibus. The card for Tia, signed by Miss . Sharp, Mr Niles and their two young sons, read: ‘Our baby girl. We love . you very much. Always will. Sorry babe this never should have happened. I . wish I was there to protect you. Police finally discovered Tia's body and admitted they should have found it sooner . ‘We know you’re safe now and you’re at home with us everywhere we go.’ Her visit came hours after . 37-year-old Stuart Hazell was charged with murder. As well as being . Christine Sharp’s current partner, Hazell also at one time had a . relationship with Natalie Sharp. Tia, who lived in Merton, South . London, regularly stayed with her grandmother. It was on Friday that . investigators discovered the 12-year-old’s remains inside the house . Hazell shared with Sharp in New Addington, near Croydon. Officers had previously conducted a . full search of the house and a second sweep using dogs trained to detect . dead bodies. Colleagues suspect the body was behind a door connecting . the loft to that of an adjacent property. Sources claimed a team who spent two . hours searching the property last Sunday did not check the neighbouring . loft space because they needed a search warrant. A further search of Sharp’s house . began on Friday morning when a junior officer insisted a sniffer dog was . ‘indicating’ towards a bedroom ceiling. The officers themselves could . also smell decomposition. Initially a senior officer co-ordinating the search said the loft had already been checked but was persuaded to change his mind. Colleagues lifted the loft hatch and . saw a large ‘container’, possibly a rigid suitcase, containing Tia’s . body with her arms and legs sprawled outside. 'Why did this happen?': Tia's biological father, Steve Carter, lays flowers at the scene of the makeshift memorial .

Right, the grief is etched on his face as he turns to look at the camera. His left arm bears the name 'Tia' in Gothic writing . The Metropolitan Police issued a . statement at the weekend apologising for any ‘distress’ caused by the . delay in finding the body. Senior officers have launched an internal review into why the search operation failed. Tia’s natural father, Steven Carter, . 30, who split from her mother shortly after she was born, visited the . scene yesterday to lay a yellow rose with a pair of purple angel wings . attached. A sea of flowers, teddy bears, candles and angel wings have been left in tribute to Tia Sharp outside her grandmother Caroline Sharp's home . Amongst the memorial of flowers was an emotional note written to 12-year-old Tia . Distraught community: A father holding his son in his arms places a bouquet on the shrine for Tia near her grandmother's home in New Addington, Croydon . Tragic: Two mourners leave tributes at the makeshift shrine which has sprung up since the discovery of the body on Friday . 'Sleep tight little angel': Many of the tributes to Tia included poignant notes . Guarding the crime scene: Police have been heavily criticised for failing to find Tia's body sooner . Accompanied by his father, brother and three female friends, he wept as he asked: ‘Why did this happen?’ Hugging his son, his father replied: . ‘There is no reason. She never harmed anybody, son. No child deserves . this, especially my granddaughter.’ Mr Carter, who has Tia’s name . tattooed on his arm, had earlier spoken of his horror at being ‘only . feet away’ from his daughter’s body after travelling from his home in . Northampton to help search for Tia last weekend. He said: ‘That first night I stayed . outside the house and they wouldn’t let me in, and Stuart Hazell walked . over to me and put his hand on my shoulder and looked me in the eye.

"By . Freya Noble . Leeza Ormsby, an Australian resident, has spent the last three months locked up on the Indonesian island of Bali on drug charges. On Tuesday, the 37-year-old was charged with possession of marijuana after half a hashish cigarette weighing 0.3 grams was found in her purse back in February. The New Zealand-born woman was reportedly very distressed, and told reporters outside her cell that she wishes to see her family and 'I just want to go home.' Charged: Leeza Ormsby was charged with possession of marijuana on Tuesday, pictured here moving from a police office in Denpasar, Bali in April . Transferred: The New Zealander was originally held in Denpasar city police jail but was moved to Kerobokan for the duration of her trial . Ormsby is likely to be sent home within months, as Bali police confirmed on Tuesday they had completed their investigation into the single charge, and handed her portfolio to prosecutors. She was caught after police reportedly received a tip-off, and has spent the past few months in Denpasar at the city police jail. More...

Ormsby has recently been transferred to Kerobokan prison, where she will stay for the duration of her trial. More charges: Ormsby could face  further possession charges if more evidence comes to light about drugs found in this villa . The Daily Telegraph report that prosecutor Ni Luh Putu Oika Ariani said investigators didn't have enough evidence to prove that an additional 132.2 grams of MDMA and 26.06 grams of hashish found inside a Bali villa at the same time belonged to Ormsby. However if more evidence comes to light, the Sydney resident could face a sentence of up to 12 years for these primary charges, plus a secondary charge for personal use which carries four years. Ormsby's lawyer Ary Soenardi said the defense he was preparing was based solely on the evidence involving the half-smoked joint. The lawyer: Ormsby's representative Ary Soenardi said he will prepare his case based only on the 0.3 grams of hashish found on the woman, pictured here addressing media in February following Ormsby's arrest . 'She didn't buy the joint, it was given to her by somebody she met at the beach the day before her arrest. She can't remember if she smoked it or not ... and she can't remember who the person was. It was another foreigner,' Mr Soenardi said according to The Sydney Morning Herald. The only Australian-based woman now in Kerobokan jail, Ormsby is not the first local female to have seen the inside of the notorious jail. Released on parole earlier this year, Australian Schapelle Corby spent almost a decade there for smuggling drugs into the Bali, though she still maintains they were planted in her boogie board bag back in 2005.","Leeza Ormsby arrested in Bali in February over drug possession .

"By . Gerri Peev . Democracy should keep pace with the 'way we live our lives', Jenny Watson, the head of the Electoral Commission said . Britain must move to online voting because more of us are doing the weekly grocery shop via the internet, the UK’s elections watchdog has said. Democracy should keep pace with the ‘way we live our lives’, Jenny Watson, the head of the Electoral Commission said. The ‘Ocado’ generation and young people in particular were switched off by the old-fashioned system. ‘Technology has changed rapidly in the last decade. Unless our electoral system keeps pace with the way many voters live the rest of their lives - where the way they bank and the way they shop has been transformed - it risks being seen as increasingly alien and outdated,’ she said. She warned that just 56 per cent of 19 to 24 year olds were registered to vote, compared to 94 per cent of those aged 65 or older. As technology advanced, e-voting was ‘not an issue that can stay on the slow track any longer’. Steps had to be taken to ‘drag’ the electoral ‘system into the 21st Century’, she said. Miss Watson admitted that e-voting was ‘radical’ but dismissed any comparison with voting in X-Factor style reality TV shows. ‘Before anyone accuses us of simply equating the act of voting in an election with shopping online - or indeed with voting in the X Factor - let me be clear. Voting is a serious and important civic act - citizens’ chance to change the people in power.’ A balance had to be struck between increasing voter turnout and cutting fraud, she said. The Electoral Commission is also exploring other ‘modernising’ ideas including allowing those who forget to register to sign up on polling and cast their vote. From June, the Electoral Commission will start to move people individually onto an automatic electoral roll. This would end the ‘19th Century concept’ that a ‘head of the household’ is responsible for registering everyone. She warned that just 56 per cent of 19 to 24 year olds were registered to vote, compared to 94 per cent of those aged 65 or older . The move comes amid evidence of electoral fraud - particularly in Labour strongholds - where ‘phantom’ and unwitting voters were signed up for postal votes. While some experts feared that large numbers would fall off the electoral roll under the new individual voter registration system, the Electoral Commission said it was using data matching with the Department for Work and Pensions to make the system more secure. Millions will be transferred onto the electoral roll, after their National Insurance number is verified. Miss Watson said many voters were ‘baffled’ that they could not sign up to the electoral register online. They could print off forms from the internet but these still need to be put in the post. The most high profile country to use electronic voting for its general election is Estonia. But to stamp out fraud, voters have to use biometric identity cards - which the British government and privacy campaigners vehemently oppose.","Young people switched off by old-fashioned system, Jenny Watson said .

A topless diner who tested the limits of New York City's recently relaxed attitude towards partial nudity has been pictured with her arms draped around grinning police officers. Model Cheyenne Lutek was photographed last weekend at Verso Restaurant in Alphabet City exposing her bare breasts while astounded patrons looked on. Now the model and photographer Allen Henson have upped the ante by taking their X-rated stunt on to the streets of Manhattan on Sunday - encountering two of New York's finest who were more than happy to pose with the glamorous, topless blonde. Law and order: Model Cheyenne Lutek poses up half-naked with two grinning NYPD cops. It is entirely legal for women to appear in New York City streets partially nude . Henson tweeted: 'A nice stroll on a New York Summer evening. With @Cheyenne_Lutek and a couple of NYC's finest boys in blue.' In May, the New York City Police Department released an official memo cited by The New York Times . informing all police officers that it is not illegal for women to walk . around the city shirtless, and that they should not be cited for public . lewdness or indecent exposure. The . order given to the city’s 34,000 cops stems from a 1992 New York State . Court of Appeals, which states that baring one's chest in public is . legal for a woman as it is for a man. Miss Lutek and Mr Henson hit a trendy Italian restaurant last weekend where the photographer pulled out his camera and proceeded to snap pictures of the X-rated scene. This unidentified woman walked into a restaurant, sat down clothed, then too her shirt off while a man snapped photos . Hot spot:  The owner of Verso restaurant in Alphabet City promptly rushed over and asked the woman to put her shirt back on, but she protested she had the law on her side . Verso's owner Labinot Baraliu rushed over the table and demanded that the half-naked woman put her clothes back on. In response, Miss Lutek insisted that it was 'perfectly legal' to go topless in the restaurant. 'In 15 years [in the restaurant business] I've seen all kinds of things, but not this,' Baraliu explained to  the East Village blog EV Grieve. 'It was funny, but at the same time I was like ""WTF — is this really happening?""' After exchanging a few words with the owner, the couple were escorted out of the bistro. Despite the legislation because a restaurant is private property, its patrons are subject to whatever rules the business has in place.",Model Cheyenne Lutek posed on a Manhattan street with two NYPD officers .

A brachioplasty procedure targets the upper arm . Excess skin can potentially be pulled up and tucked into the armpit with an axillary brachioplasty or mini arm tuck . 'There are two types of brachioplasty procedures that can be performed, and this depends upon the amount excess skin and concentration of fat. If excess hanging skin is located and limited to within a couple of inches from the armpit, then this excess skin can potentially be pulled up and tucked into the armpit with an axillary brachioplasty or mini arm tuck. 'For patients who have excess skin that extends from the armpit to the elbow, the best option is to completely remove the excess arm fat and skin.'

"By . Gerri Peev . Former Tory MEP Stanley Johnson said it would be unreasonable if his son was not able to make a pitch . Boris Johnson must be allowed to stand in a Conservative leadership contest even if he is not an MP, his father demanded yesterday. Former Tory MEP Stanley Johnson said it would be unreasonable if his son was not able to make a pitch for the Tory party’s top job if David Cameron steps down after the 2015 general election. London Mayor Mr Johnson is not currently an MP and has said he has no plans to stand before his second term runs out in 2016. But Mr Johnson senior called on the party to change the rules so his son could stand. His father waded into the leadership speculation last night by revealing: ‘It would not be a reasonable expression of the way things are if there were to be an election in the Tory party for leader under whatever rules they have - it just wouldn’t be reasonable if Boris somehow was not able to be a candidate.’ Mr Johnson added that, if his son was still mayor, ‘it would be up to the party to find a way of making sure the proper candidates are there’. He pointed to 1963 when Alec Douglas-Home mounted a leadership campaign from the House of Lords where he was a hereditary peer before becoming an MP. ‘Alec Douglas-Home was not a member of the House of Commons. He was a peer but they found a way,’ Mr Johnson said. He added: ‘Don’t tell me it wouldn’t be possible to have a system whereby you say: OK life has moved on, there are now important elective offices. ‘Maybe even an elected MEP could stand. At the moment, it says only an MP can stand. Well how reasonable is to say we exclude the MEPs? If you say exclude the MEPs, how reasonable would it be to exclude the mayor of a major city?’ Mr Johnson is not currently an MP and has said he has no plans to stand before his second term runs out. His father says he should be able to go for the top job if David Cameron steps down after the 2015 general election . Mr Johnson has already been privately urged to make a return to the Commons before the general election by the Prime Minister and Chancellor. In theory, Mr Johnson could juggle the final year of his mayoralty while serving as an MP. There will be pressure on the Prime Minister to follow his predecessor Michael Howard and quit immediately if he fails to win a majority. Mr Howard stood down straight after losing the 2005 election, giving the relatively unknown Mr Cameron six months to prepare his campaign and emerge as a serious contender. The Mayor’s father also let slip that his son was a closet fan of Europe. Mr Johnson senior – who served as a European Commissioner twice and an MEP – said his son ‘is a very good pro-European. He basically had a perfectly good European upbringing, he went to the European School. Don’t tell me he is not. You can’t be called Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson without having a European vocation.’ Yet the London Mayor just days ago told a newspaper that being in the EU was ‘not the be all and end all’. ‘Pulling out would be much less disastrous than people claim. There wouldn’t be a great implosion, just as there wasn’t when we refused to join the euro.’ His father’s candour could deter rank and file Eurosceptic Tories from backing Mr Johnson.","Stanley Johnson says party must ensure 'proper candidates are there'

"By . Gerri Peev . Boris Johnson denounced ¿humiliated¿ critics of HS2 for pretending they were worried about wildlife and ancient woodlands . Opponents of the HS2 line are worried their house prices will plunge and are hiding behind ‘b*llocks’ environmental concerns, Boris Johnson has said. The London Mayor waded into the row over the £50 billion project, denouncing its ‘humiliated’ critics for pretending they were worried about wildlife and ancient woodlands. Mr Johnson’s attack came as David Lidington, the Europe Minister, threatened to quit if generous concessions were not made to constituents affected by the railway. While some Tory ministers were under pressure from voters to oppose the HS2 Bill at second reading last night, Mr Johnson declared he had always been a fan of big infrastructure. In a swipe at critics, he told Total Politics magazine: ‘It’s b*llocks. They’re not campaigning for forests, they’re not campaigning for butterflies. They pretend to be obviously, but what they’re really furious about is that their house prices are getting it.’ Mr Johnson added: ‘People are in the humiliating position of having to pretend that there’s some environmental objection that they have, that the great crested grebe is going to be invaded or whatever. What they care about is their house prices. It’s tragic we have protest groups talking about ‘this ancient woodland’ when actually there’s no tree in this country that’s more than 200 years old.’ He added that the average life expectancy of a tree could not be ‘more than 60 years’. Mr Johnson urged the government to adopt the ‘French approach’ and wave an ‘absolutely massive chequebook’ at concerned residents to buy their homes off them for ‘top dollar’. ‘Then when the whole thing goes in and is a success and generates a movement to the area, lifts the economy and the prices go up, well who’s quids in? The Government,’ he added. Last night Mr Lidington threatened to resign if the government did not mitigate the impact of the high speed line by building a tunnel under the Chilterns. He was in Estonia last night so missed the vote but insisted he would have abstained anyway. ‘I have decided to abstain, but I have been and remain opposed to HS2, I’ve fought alongside campaigns and the Prime Minister knows my views,’ he told the Bucks Herald newspaper. The London Mayor said critics of the £50bn scheme were actually worried about house prices 'getting it'. Pictured is a graphic explaining how long each route will be shortened with the new line . ‘I will resign at a later stage of the bill if they don’t get mitigation, and that for me includes a Chiltern’s tunnel.’ Mr Lidington defended his decision not to vote against and immediately quit: ‘If I stood down I would just be one more MP that is against HS2, but by staying in I have the inside track, it’s a pragmatic political judgement.’ Tory whips appeared to turn a blind eye on ministerial absences for the vote, with newly promoted Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom also away on urgent business in Brussels, while Attorney General Dominic Grieve was in the north east on a ministerial visit. Plans for HS2 were expected to pass a Commons hurdle despite a threatened rebellion from dozens of Tories. A poll released by ComRes found that 31 per cent of Conservatives were opposed to HS2. The same proportion of Labour MPs were also against the London to Midlands and the North line, despite the party officially backing the Bill. Some three in ten Lib Dems were also in favour of abandoning HS2. Protestors at an anti-HS2 rally. A poll released by ComRes found 31 per cent of Tories were opposed to HS2 . Although Labour whipped MPs to vote for the Bill, Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor is still lukewarm on the project. There are suspicions that the party would abandon the project if it got into power, channelling the tens of billions into other pet projects. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told MPs it was not helpful to call critics of HS2 ‘nimbys’ or Luddites. But he added: ‘This is a decision which we cannot duck. We have waited long enough. ‘Built right, on time and on budget, HS2 can help our great cities thrive... This project deserves careful scrutiny but Britain deserves it to go ahead.’ Work on the line is expected to begin in 2017.","Johnson attacked critics of HS2 for saying they were worried about wildlife .

"By . Andrew Levy . and Gerri Peev . Poverty is not a barrier to success at school, a respected international organisation said yesterday. Factors such as poorly educated parents and run-down neighbourhoods condemn underprivileged families to a cycle of ‘social disadvantage’, according to some education experts. But the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development dismissed the assumption as a ‘myth’. Research shows children from disadvantaged backgrounds in some countries outperform the wealthiest children in other nations in maths, it said. Poverty is not a barrier to success at school, a respected international organisation said yesterday . The poorest ten per cent of pupils in Shanghai are generally more advanced than the richest 20 per cent of children in the UK, for example. The gap between wealthy Shanghai children and underprivileged British children is equivalent to six years of education by the age of 15. In the Netherlands, children from the poorest families can be up to a year ahead of a child from a similar background in the UK at the same age. The findings suggest the social and economic background of a pupil is far less important than the quality of the teaching in their school and the education system in which it operates. OECD spokesman Andrew Schleicher said the data ‘debunks the myth that poverty is destiny’. His intervention will lend weight to the argument of those who say fundamental problems in education should be addressed to help more poor children go to university rather than so-called social engineering, under which top universities have been encouraged to accept candidates with lower grades if they come from deprived backgrounds. Details were released the day after Michael Gove said money matters in education but not as much as ‘attitude - ambition, expectation - an ethos of excellence’. The Education Secretary said improvements in a range of areas including the curriculum, exams, discipline and the quality of teaching meant the days of the ‘bog standard’ comprehensive were numbered as state schools catch up with the independent sector. Details were released the day after Michael Gove said money matters in education but not as much as 'attitude - ambition, expectation - an ethos of excellence' Interviewed on ITV’s This Morning yesterday, he added the flexibility being handed to maintained schools meant they had freedoms similar to those of fee-paying institutions, like choosing whether to set homework or dedicating every afternoon to extra-curricular activities to build character. ‘All that I really want to do is to try and make sure that children from poorer homes, whose parents can’t afford private schools, get an education every bit as good,’ he said. The OECD analysis was based on tests sat by tens of thousands of 15-year-olds in 40 developed countries or major economic regions in 2012 - before Coalition reforms began to take effect. These have already shown that the UK remained a middle-ranking nation overall under Labour despite tens of billions extra being pumped into education. Further research into the maths skills of the most deprived ten per cent of pupils found those in big-spending Britain were not keeping pace with high-performing areas such as South Korea, Singapore and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China. Mr Schleicher added: ‘Poverty isn’t destiny. For example the poorest 15-year-olds in Shanghai... do as well as the ten per cent most privileged students in the United States and 20 per cent in the UK. ‘The data clearly show that, for many countries, the issue is not just with poor kids in poor neighbourhoods but with many kids in many neighbourhoods. ‘The bottom line is that the country where you go to school seems to have a much greater impact on your learning outcome than the social background of your family or even your country.’ Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said Mr Gove was ‘absolutely right’ to say attitude trumps funding. But he added: ‘The OECD figures show how vastly better our competitors are doing.‘We get complacent about our top schools but they are doing pretty badly on the international scale.’","Research .

Every diesel and petrol car would be scrapped by then or earlier if there are enough technological advances. The extraordinary policy, contained in the Lib Dems’ ‘green manifesto’ launched this week, has the backing of senior figures including party president Tim Farron. The plan to ban conventional cars comes even though party leader Nick Clegg uses a gas-guzzler himself . The manifesto also outlines plans to give councils support to introduce more congestion charging in towns and cities to encourage greater take-up of public transport. The plan to ban conventional cars comes even though party leader Nick Clegg uses a gas-guzzler himself. The Deputy Prime Minister and David Cameron both use cars –  usually a Jaguar or a BMW – from Scotland Yard, with a link to the control room, to ferry them to engagements. In an earlier Lib Dem policy paper – Green Growth and Green Jobs – MPs and activists said: ‘Liberal Democrats would specify that by 2040, only ultra-low carbon vehicles will be permitted on UK roads for non-freight purposes. If technology permitted, we would bring forward this date.’ Street lights would also be dimmed where appropriate to cut down on energy use. The Deputy Prime Minister and David Cameron both use cars - usually a Jaguar or a BMW - from Scotland Yard, with a link to the control room, to ferry them to engagements . Other controversial policies in the manifesto launched on Monday include a pay as you throw bin tax called a ‘variable waste charge for households’. The party also opposes any plans for additional runways at Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted and is against a new Thames Estuary airport touted by London Mayor Boris Johnson. A Lib Dem spokesman said the green manifesto was a submission for consideration by the overall party. On the car ban, he added: ‘The companies need the incentive to change. 'It is not beyond reasonable ambition to suggest the industry can adapt to a zero-emission target within the next 25 years.’ But Paul Watters, head of public affairs for the AA, said: ‘You can’t suddenly turn the clock off between 2039 and 2040. It needs to be a longer time frame.’ An RAC spokesman said: ‘This will be pretty unfair for a lot of motorists who invest in cars with the intention of keeping them for a long time.’","Every diesel and petrol car would be scrapped under the plans .

"By . Gerri Peev . Liberal Democrat Stephen Williams attacked the rule that councils had to hold a referendum if they wanted to raise council tax by more than two per cent . The Liberal Democrat’s local government minister has described his own department’s flagship policy on council tax as ‘absurd’. Liberal Democrat Stephen Williams attacked the rule - handed down by his own Department for Communities and Local Government - that councils had to hold a referendum if they wanted to raise council tax by more than two per cent. He also suggested that town halls should be able to impose a new ‘bedroom tax’ on hotels in tourist areas. And in comments at a fringe event at his party’s conference in York, Mr Williams also suggested that planning Minister Nick Boles was ‘hated’ by his own party. Mr Williams said of the coalition’s council tax policy: ‘A referendum on tax rises is absurd. If we had it for income tax, VAT, then the country would probably grind to a halt.’ He then went on to spell out his vision of giving councils powers to introduce even more taxes, saying ‘Why shouldn’t we generally provide that local government can set new taxes, possibly across a range of areas?’. ‘You could have a genuine ‘bedroom tax’ on hotels, for instance, in major tourist areas - seaside towns, and cities like York. The city council would have done very well out of us this week if there was a £1 tax on every room. That’s where I want us to get to.’ The Minister offered a bleak assessment of the impact his own Department for Communities and Local Government was having because of its cuts. ‘Some district councils, because of the fall in central Government grant, are undoubtedly going to get into severe financial difficulty - and viability questions will probably be asked over the next two to three years,’ he said. Planning policy was ‘constantly changing’ under the coalition. ‘Nick Boles is hyperactive in that area - which is good in a way,’ Mr Williams said. ‘He’s hated by a lot of Tory MPs - but he’s quite a good colleague to work with in that he’s thoughtful, he’s creative, he knows his stuff.’ And in comments at a fringe event at his party's conference in York, Mr Williams also suggested that planning Minister Nick Boles was 'hated' by his own party . Despite his apparent disdain for the referendum trigger for council tax rises, a statement put out on the Liberal Democrats’ own website in December openly trumpets the policy as a coalition achievement. It said: ‘The coalition has given councils the ability to freeze council tax for up to 6 years. This has helped ease the squeeze on family budgets.This has meant average family has paid £600 less in council tax since 2010.’ Mr Williams also attacked a New Homes Bonus which offered grants to councils based on the number of new houses that were built. The Bristol West MP said: ‘The New Homes Bonus - speaking freely as a Lib Dem MP - I’m not a fan of. I don’t think it’s an incentive, necessarily, for local authorities to give planning permission. I don’t think it’s actually driving decision-making on the ground.’ Mr Williams had been speaking at a Lib Dem conference event. A senior Lib Dem spokesman said that Mr Williams had been reprising an old policy for a tax on hotel rooms which had since been rejected by the party. The spokesman added: ‘He was talking about his personal views and taking soundings from our councillors. He was trying to do a bit of fact-finding..He was not making any sort of government speech or a pronouncement on behalf of his department.’","Lib- Dem Stephen Williams .

Ghana's World Cup campaign has been thrown into chaos after star players Sulley Muntari and Kevin Prince Boateng were sent home following an 'unprovoked attack' on an FA official. Both players were suspended indefinitely and ordered home from Brazil after a team meeting on Tuesday descended into violence. Ghana's FA claim Muntari launched 'an unprovoked physical attack on Moses Armah', which resulted in his suspension, while Boatang was sent home for a 'vulgar' tirade at team manager Kwesi Appiah. The timing of the suspension couldn't be worse for Ghana, who face Portugal this evening in a decisive World Cup clash which could see them eliminated from the tournament if they lose. Scroll down for video . Suspension: Kevin-Prince Boateng (left) and Sulley Muntari have been sent home from Ghana's squad . The decision to suspend Muntari was taken in the wake of his alleged unprovoked physical attack on Mr Armah, who is a member of the Ghana Football Association's Executive Committee. A statement released by the FA this afternoon read: 'The . Ghana Football Association (GFA) has suspended Sulley Ali Muntari . indefinitely from the Black Stars with immediate effect.'

"By . Martin Jay In Beirut . Radical Islamic cleric Omar Bakri is facing the death sentence after . being charged with being the mastermind of a terrorist cell in Tripoli, . Lebanon . Omar Bakri, a radical Islamic cleric who once praised the London bombers as the ‘fantastic four’, is facing the death sentence after formerly being charged with being the mastermind of a terrorist cell in Tripoli, Lebanon, his adopted home since fleeing the UK in 2005. According to Lebanese reports yesterday, Bakri, who was once the subject of terrorist investigations in the UK, was interrogated by a Lebanese military judge on Monday before being charged with organising a terrorist cell in Northern Lebanon. Bakri, whose real name is Omar Bakri Fustoq, was arrested on May 25 and has always denied being part of Al Qaeda although he regularly speaks highly of their affiliated groups both in Syria and in Lebanon. His own extremist group in the UK also had many Al Qaeda members amongst its ranks. Authorities in Lebanon believe Bakri is linked to Al Qaeda and is responsible for a series of attacks both on Army personnel in recent months and inciting sectarian fighting in Tripoli, which left 30 dead and over 160 wounded. Omar Bakri, believed to be 54 now, was previously the London-based spiritual leader of the extremist group Al-Muhajiroun. He lived in London where he was known as the Tottenham Ayatollah. Bakri was under investigation by UK police after he called for young British Muslims to take up arms and join Al Qaeda. On the London bombings it was also reported that Bakri referred to the four suicide bombers who killed 56 people on July 7 as 'the fantastic four'. He said the British people were to blame for the terror attacks on the capital because they 'did not make enough effort to stop its own government committing its own atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan'. He also sparked outrage when he said on TV that he would not inform police if he knew Muslims were planning a bomb attack on a train in the UK and supported Muslims who attacked British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Tottenham ayatollah: Omar Bakri on stage with Abu Hamza at the Rally for Islam in Trafalgar Square in 2002 . In March he told The Daily Mail when speaking of the troubles in Tripoli ‘only jihad salafi can save it and save Lebanon’. He added: ‘This country needs to be made an Islamic state, obviously ... but I know the security services are getting ready to nab me soon’. The radical Islamic cleric was under house arrest in Tripoli since Lebanese security forces released him from jail in 2010, after striking a deal with the Shia extremist group Hezbollah. Bakri was sentenced to life following a terrorism conviction, but was released on bail after witnesses recanted their testimony. If found guilty of the current charges against him in Lebanon though, Bakri will face the death sentence.","Omar Bakri was leader of extremist group Al-Muhajiroun in London .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke introduced the private outsourcing of court interpreters in the hope of saving £18million a year . Dozens of trials have been abandoned because of a 'catastrophic' shortage of interpreters which has forced courts to rely on Google Translate, MPs have been told. Ken Clarke's shambolic outsourcing of legal translation services is blamed for putting public safety at risk after suspects were released back on to the streets when interpreters failed to turn up. The National Audit Office has found that between January and March this year, 182 trials in  magistrates courts, and an unknown number in crown courts, have collapsed. In one case in Ipswich in March, the failure of a Lithuanian interpreter to appear meant that Google Translate, a comparatively crude and time-consuming online translation service, had to be used. A trial is declared 'ineffective' if it has to be abandoned on day one. It is then rescheduled at huge cost to taxpayers, with some defendants having to be freed on bail in the meantime. The total of 182 does not include other delays caused by the interpreter shortage, such as trials having to be adjourned day after day. Magistrates, solicitors and translators warn that inadequate standards of interpretation could lead to miscarriages of justice and make British courts the 'laughing stock' of the world. Courts across England used to rely on local interpreters but in January this year the former Justice Secretary controversially handed a monopoly on translating to a private firm, Applied Language Solutions. Magistrates have lodged more than 5,000 complaints against the firm after it failed to send interpreters to a fifth of trials, sent people speaking the wrong language, or translators who are simply incompetent. In one case the defendant's wife acted as an interpreter. In another, ALS sent a Romanian to translate instead of a Roma speaker.  The full depth of the scandal emerged in submissions to a justice select committee inquiry. MPs were told that a murder trial went ahead with a beautician translating, even though she did not understand the words 'friction' or 'deterioration'. Standards were allegedly so lax at the firm that a director of another translation company was able to sign up his cat Masha as an ALS translator – and the cat was offered jobs. Many police forces also use ALS and in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, three Hungarians had to be released on bail as an interpreter could not be found. Mr Clarke's reforms were supposed to save £18million a year, but a minister admitted in the summer that there will be no savings this year. A spokesman for Capita, which took over the running of ALS earlier this year, said performance had improved, with more than 95 per cent of bookings now being filled and complaints down.","National Audit Office finds 182 magistrate trials between January and March have collapsed due to lack of interpreter .

"By . Associated Press . Thomas Berger, the witty and eclectic novelist who reimagined the American West in the historical yarn Little Big Man and mastered genres ranging from detective stories to domestic farce, has died at age 89. Berger's literary agent, Cristina Concepcion, said Monday that he died in Nyack Hospital in a New York City suburb on July 13, just days before his 90th birthday. He had been in failing health, Concepcion said. One of the last major authors to have served in World War II, Berger wrote more than 20 books, including the autobiographical Rinehart series, a Little Big Man sequel and The Feud, about warring families in a 1930s Midwest community. Thomas Berger was an author who enjoyed both critical acclaim and commercial success - though he is perhaps best known for a movie made from one of his books . Dustin Hoffman played Berger's most famous character, Jack Crabb, in the 1970 film 'Little Big Man' The Feud was recommended for the 1984 Pulitzer Prize by the fiction jury but was overruled by the board of directors, which awarded another Depression-era novel, William Kennedy's Ironweed. Berger's biggest mainstream success was Little Big Man, published in 1964 and an ultra-wry tale of 111-year-old Jack Crabb, who alleges that he was abducted by Indians as a young boy and later fought with the Cherokees in the Battle of Little Big Horn. The novel was adapted into a 1970 movie of the same name, starring Dustin Hoffman and directed by Arthur Penn. A leading American Indian writer, Sherman Alexie, would cite Little Big Man as an influence on his screenplay for the 1998 movie 'Smoke Signals.' Other Berger novels made into films include 'Neighbors,' which starred John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, and 'Meeting Evil,' featuring Samuel L. Jackson and Luke Wilson. Berger's best-known work was his 1964 novel about a Wild West tall tale . Never as famous as such contemporaries and fellow veterans as Norman Mailer and Kurt Vonnegut, Berger became the kind of writer who made fans feel special just for knowing about him. Admirers regarded him as unique and underappreciated, a comic moralist equally attuned to the American past and present. 'Berger's books are accessible and funny and immerse you in the permanent strangeness of his language and attitude, perhaps best encapsulated by Berger's own self-definition as a ""voyeur of copulating words,""' Jonathan Lethem wrote in a 2012 essay. 'He offers a book for every predilection: if you like westerns, there's his classic, Little Big Man; so, too, has he written fables of suburban life (Neighbors), crime stories (Meeting Evil), fantasies, small-town ""back-fence"" stories of Middle American life, and philosophical allegories (Killing Time).' Berger was born in Cincinnati, the son of a public school business manager and a housewife. He was a dreamer, seeking out new worlds on the nearest bookshelf. His favorite works included the legends of King Arthur and, since he was born close enough to the 19th century to hear firsthand accounts, histories of the Battle of Little Big Horn. 'Very early in life,' he once said, 'I discovered that for me reality was too often either dull or obnoxious, and while I did play all the popular games that employ a ball, lower hooks into the water, and, especially fire guns, I preferred the pleasure of the imagination to those of experience, and I read incessantly.' Berger served in the Army from 1943 to 1946 and used some of his experiences in Germany for his debut novel, Crazy in Berlin. He was an undergraduate at the University of Cincinnati, then a graduate student at Columbia University, where he studied under the critic Lionel Trilling and attempted a book on George Orwell, a lasting influence. Berger worked in libraries as a young man and for a variety of publications, from The New York Times Index to Popular Science Monthly. At a workshop at The New School for Social Research, Berger met such fellow students as Jack Kerouac, Mario Puzo and William Styron and a painter, Jeanne Redpath, who became his wife. He wrote short stories in his 20s but disliked the art form, believing he needed more space 'to create my alternative reality.' Little Big Man was his third novel. As he told American Heritage magazine, he began the book in 1962 with 'the intention of comprising in one man's personal story all the themes of the Old West that have since become legendary.' Jack Crabb was based on a fictional character, the blowhard Kit Carson in William Saroyan's play 'The Time of Your Life.' 'The book's appeal traces to two main currents: one, it's a tall tale in the great American tradition of Mark Twain, and, second, it's hip, modern and funny and anticipates appreciation and understanding of a vanished Indian culture by decades,' the critic Allen Barra wrote for Salon.com in 2006. In more recent novels, Berger satirized the frustrations of contemporary domestic life. In Best Friends, he contrasted the overachieving Roy Courtright and the underachieving Sam Grandy, with Grandy's wife trapped in the middle. The Houseguest was a comic gangster story in which a thug ingratiates himself with a Long Island family, then keeps them hostage - at least they think he does. In Adventures of the Artificial Woman, a technician unlucky in love constructs an ideal partner, only to have her leave him and become a movie star. 'I ... have never thought of my work as being funny except incidentally,' Berger once said, disputing the idea that he was a comic novelist. 'I write as I do because that's the way I instinctively look at things.'","Wrote Wild West tall tale that became a 1970 Dustin Hoffman film .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Nightmare: Cory Tschogl, 39, pictured has an Airbnb guest squatting in her condo . A California Airbnb host says a guest is squatting in her 600-square-foot Palm Springs condo and is now threatening to sue her. Cory Tschogl, 39, described the situation as a 'horror story' and says she begged Airbnb for help through scores of emails and phone calls but the accommodation marketplace failed to get the renter out. He now has renters' protection under California law because he's been there longer than 30 days and it'll take three to six months, a lawyer and thousands of dollars to evict him. The San Francisco-based rehabilitation therapist has used Airbnb without issue for about a year so when 'Maksym' asked to rent the condo for an extended period - a total of 44 days - she thought it would be fine. But as soon as he checked in he called her to complain about the tap water being cloudy and the gated-entrance to the condo, then demanded a full refund of the 30 days rent he paid upfront. For longer stays, Airbnb bills on a monthly basis rather than the total sum. Concerned that he was a shady character, she agreed to a refund and immediately alerted Airbnb to make it happen. However, after numerous attempts to make contact with the service, it took two days for a representative to respond. In that email, the rep said Airbnb had told the guest to leave. But Tschogl says the guest stayed in the condo. 'It became a confusing situation. Both I and Airbnb told the guest to leave, but he would not,' she told Business Insider. The company eventually paid her the two weeks' missing rent and offered to pay for the man to stay at a hotel for 30 days but he didn't respond to emails and his phone was cut off. After the . 44 days, Tschogl was desperate and texted Maksym saying his contract was . up and that she would shut off power at the condo. Tschogl . told the San Francisco Chronicle that the guest texted back saying he . was legally occupying the condo - which isn't untrue - and that loss of . electricity would threaten his work and therefore income. No help: Tschogl says she begged Airbnb for help through scores of emails and phone calls but the accommodation marketplace, pictured, failed to get the renter out .

Airbnb said in a statement: 'Our initial response to this inquiry didn't meet the standards we set for ourselves and we've apologized to this host. 'In the last week, officials from our team have been in incredibly close contact with this host and she has been paid the full cost of the reservation and we're working with her to provide additional support as we move forward.'

"By . Associated Press . President Barack Obama says he supports statehood for the nation's capital. Obama was asked Monday about the prospect of the District of Columbia becoming the 51st state during a town hall at a city school. The president said, 'I'm for it,' adding that he has been 'for quite some time.' However, he's aware that it would be a tough one to sell in Congress. Scroll down for video . I'm for it: President Barack Obama says he supports statehood for the nation's capital on Monday night . 'The politics of it end up being difficult to get through Congress, but I think it's absolutely the right thing to do,' he said. Obama has previously spoken in favor of giving the District voting representation in Congress, and the White House has consistently supported giving the local government full control of the city's budget and laws. Following his re-election in 2012, Obama added District license plates with the phrase 'Taxation Without Representation' to his official vehicles. He said he believed the people of D.C. should be represented like all other Americans. 'I think I've long believed that D.C. pays — folks in D.C. pay taxes like everybody else,' he said. Town hall: Obama was asked about the prospect of the District of Columbia becoming the 51st state during a town hall at a city school . 'They contribute to the overall well-being of the country like everybody else. They should be represented [in Congress] like everybody else,' Obama said. 'And it's not as if Washington, D.C., is not big enough compared to other states. There has been a long movement to get D.C. statehood, and I've been for it for quite some time.' D.C. Vote executive director Kimberly Perry applauded the president's comments. He told DCist.com: 'President Obama's support for D.C. statehood shows that he understands the injustice we face every day. 'The President has repeatedly proposed greater autonomy for D.C., only to see those proposals die because of partisan squabbling in Congress. 'We hope the administration will now request that its Senate allies hold a hearing on the D.C. statehood bill.'","Obama was asked Monday about the prospect of the District of Columbia becoming the 51st state during a town hall at a city school .

"By . Associated Press . Raising beef for the American dinner table does far more damage to the environment than producing pork, poultry, eggs or dairy, a new study says. Compared with the other animal proteins, beef produces five times more heat-trapping gases per calorie, puts out six times as much water-polluting nitrogen, takes 11 times more water for irrigation and uses 28 times the land, according to the study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Cows are not efficient at converting feed to protein for human consumption, said lead author Gidon Eshel, an environmental physics professor at Bard College in New York. Scroll down for video . Damaging: This June 18, 2009 file photo shows cows grazing in Rock County, Nebraska.  Compared to the other animal proteins, beef produces five times more heat-trapping gases connected to global warming per calorie . Eshel used U.S. government figures to calculate air and water emissions and how much water and land were used in the lifetime production of beef, pork, poultry, dairy and eggs. While other studies have looked at the issue, this is one of the most comprehensive pieces of research quantifying and comparing the U.S. environmental costs of different meats and other animal protein. The beef industry called the study 'a gross oversimplification of the complex systems that make up the beef value chain.' Kim Stackhouse, sustainability director at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said that the industry has improved its environmental sustainability in recent years and that the U.S. produces beef with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions of any country. In the study, pork, poultry, dairy and eggs all had comparable environmental footprints, so close there were no statistically significant differences among them, Eshel said. But cows were off-the-chart different. The study did not look at plants or fish raised for human consumption. Cows burp major amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that is dozens of times more potent than carbon dioxide. Their digestive system makes them produce considerably more methane than pigs, chickens or turkeys do, Eshel said. The manure used to grow feed for cows also releases methane, as does their own bodily waste. Because they are bigger and take longer to put on weight for meat, cows eat more food over their lifetimes than other animals raised for protein. Polluters: Cows are not efficient at converting feed to protein for human consumption, said lead author Gidon Eshel, an environmental physics professor at Bard College in New York . Nitrogen, from fertilizer runoff, can harm rivers, lakes and bays, causing oxygen-depleted 'dead zones.' The use of irrigation water is a major issue out West when there are droughts, like the current one in California. So much land used for farming changes the biodiversity of a location, Eshel said. 'It really looks like beef is a lot worse environmentally than these other meats,' said Ken Caldeira, an environmental scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science. Caldeira wasn't part of this study, but has a separate study of beef's greenhouse gas footprint around the world, published this month in the journal Climatic Change. Eshel calculates that the average American who switches from beef to pork would reduce the equivalent of 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide a year, which is about nine days' worth of the nation's per capita greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA calculates that it is the same as the emissions from 61 gallons of gas or what comes out of the smokestack from burning 580 pounds of coal. Caldeira said his calculations found that ""eating a pound of beef causes more greenhouse warming than burning a gallon of gasoline."" Even though pigs have the reputation for being dirty, the data shows that they 'come out pretty clean' when compared to cows, Eshel said. The message from the study is 'whenever possible try to replace beef with other sources of protein from animal sources,' said Eshel, who said he doesn't eat meat now but used to raise cattle on a kibbutz in Israel. Nutrition scientists Marion Nestle at New York University and Malden Nesheim at Cornell University said the study makes sense, was done carefully and is important. Caldeira, whose study examined livestock and greenhouse gas internationally, found that livestock accounted for 9 percent of the world's total greenhouse gases, and their overall output has increased 51 percent since 1961. He also found that the developed world - including the U.S. - decreased its carbon emissions from livestock by 23 percent, while the developing world has more than doubled its emissions in that category. So overall greenhouse gases from livestock rose by more than 50 percent. Countries like the United States are importing beef from developing countries, potentially skewing the results, Eshel said.","Raising beef for the American dinner table does far more damage to the environment than producing pork, poultry, eggs or dairy .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Washington D.C. man was officially cleared on Monday of a murder he didn't commit, but that sent him to prison for more than a quarter-century. Kevin Martin was convicted of the 1982 murder of Ursula Brown based on faulty evidence from an elite unit of FBI forensic investigators who have been responsible for the wrongful convictions of at least five people. In Martin's case, prosecutors claimed they had found one of his pubic hairs on one of Brown's sneakers, which was enough to get his court-appointed attorney to convince him to accept a plea deal - even though he maintained that he didn't commit the murder. Innocent: Kevin Martin was finally officially innocent of a murder that he didn't commit, but landed him in prison for 26 years . Plea: At the advice of his initial attorney, Martin pleaded guilty to manslaughter after prosecutors told him they had found his pubic hairs at the crime scene . Martin pleaded guilty under what is called an Alford plea, a rare plea option that allows the accused to not admit guilt, but acknowledges that prosecutors have enough evidence to get a conviction. 'I was just getting pressure from all ends,' he said. 'My lawyer kept . telling me nobody is believing that you are innocent man. Too much . evidence is pointing, saying that you were there.' Martin spent years trying to convince people that he wasn't guilty, but it wasn't until Bernie Grimm, a lawyer with the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project, got involved in 2001 and started looking into his case. 'He believed in his lawyer, he believed in the prosecutor and he . believed in the judge,' Grimm told MyFoxDC.com. 'It was a disaster.' Evidence: Evidence in the case was lost for years in a warehouse, but when it was found investigators found DNA that proved Martin's innocence . Following his conviction, the evidence against him that was collected by prosecutors was lost. When it was recovered, the supposed hair that led to Martin's plea was not with the other evidence. However, other DNA evidence that wasn't revealed when Martin initially was charged with Brown's death was discovered along with the old evidence - and it exonerated Martin. The DNA evidence belonged to William Davidson, a man who initially pointed the finger at Martin for Brown's murder, and who currently is serving a life sentence. 'This whole system was against me,' said Martin. 'I kept crying out . saying I was innocent -- the whole time -- I didn't have anything to do . with it. I wasn't there. It was like nobody was hearing me. I feel I was . by myself.' Martin was released from prison and placed on parole in 2009, but he wasn't officially cleared of any involvement in the crime until Monday, after a lengthy battle with the courts. Free: Martin now lives in California and is engaged to be married . 'I think this demonstrates that it is never too late to do justice,' U.S Attorney Ron Machen said. 'Thirty years ago, Mr. Martin was unfairly . branded a rapist and a murderer. He wasn't guilty of those crimes, and . today, he was exonerated and it highlights the importance of our hair . and fiber review.' The FBI continues to re-examine cases that relied on hair analysis from the tainted forensic unit that caused Martin to plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit. 'We have had over 30 assistant . U.S. Attorneys going back through thousands of cases looking to see if . we could have gotten it wrong years ago,' Machen said. Martin currently lives in San Francisco and is engaged to be married. Now that he's been exonerated, he stands to receive $50,000 for each of the 26 years that he was wrongly imprisoned.","Kevin Martin was convicted of the 1982 murder of Ursula Brown .

"By . Associated Press . The Montana Supreme Court will today publicly reprimand a judge who gave a lenient sentence to a rapist after suggesting the 14-year-old victim shared some of the responsibility for the crime. District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings is scheduled to appear before the court in Helena, where one of the justices will read a censure statement prepared in advance. Baugh will likely get an opportunity to address the court, and the censure will then go into the record, state Supreme Court clerk Ed Smith said Monday. Montana District Judge G. Todd Baugh reads a statement apologizing for remarks he made about a 14-year-old girl raped by a teacher in Billings, Montana, last year . The censure is a public declaration by the high court that a judge is guilty of misconduct. 'It's a process basically to publicly reprimand them for their conduct bringing dishonor on their position and the court's judicial system,' Smith said. The judge sent Stacey Dean Rambold to prison for just 30 days last year after he pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse without consent. Rambold was a 47-year-old business teacher at Billings Senior High School at the time of the 2007 rape. The victim was one of his students. She committed suicide while the case was pending trial. Baugh said during Rambold's sentencing in August that the teenager was 'probably as much in control of the situation as the defendant' and that she 'appeared older than her chronological age.' Under state law, children younger than 16 cannot consent to sexual intercourse. After a public outcry, Baugh apologized for the comments and acknowledged the short prison sentence violated state law. He attempted retroactively to revise it but was blocked when the state filed its appeal. Stacey Dean Rambold (pictured) pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse without consent and was only sentenced to 30 days in prison . The Supreme Court ordered Baugh to be censured on the recommendation of the Judicial Standards Commission, and also ordered him to be suspended for 31 days. Chief Justice Mike McGrath wrote in the order that Baugh had eroded confidence in the court system. The last Montana judge was censured by the Supreme Court was District Judge Jeffrey Langton of Hamilton in 2005. Langton had pleaded guilty to a drunk-driving charge, then was placed on probation for violating the terms of his sentence. Rambold has been free since last fall after serving the original sentence. After his release, Rambold registered as a sex offender and was to remain on probation through 2028. Prosecutors appealed Baugh's sentence, and the Supreme Court in April ordered a new sentencing in the case by a different judge. The re-sentencing is to take place on Sept. 26 by District Judge Randal Spaulding of Roundup. Baugh, who is the son of former Washington Redskins quarterback 'Slingin'' Sammy Baugh, plans to retire when his term expires in December after three decades on the bench.

"By . Associated Press . Eleven parents of some of the 276 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Islamist extremists have died since the mass abduction without knowing their daughters' fate. Seven fathers were among 51 bodies brought back to their hometown of Chibok earlier this month after an attack by Boko Haram in the nearby village of Kautakari. At least four more parents have died of heart failure, high blood pressure and other illnesses which residents blame on the trauma caused by the kidnapping three months ago. Loss: 11 of the parents  have died since the 276 Nigerian schoolgirls were abducted by terror group Boko Haram three months ago . Community leader Pogu Bitrus said: One father of two of the girls kidnapped just went into a kind of coma and kept repeating the names of his daughters, until life left him.' Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan is meeting with many other parents of the schoolgirls today, as well as some classmates who managed to escape. For months the parents have been asking to see the president and he finally agreed last week to a request from Pakistani girls-education activist Malala Yousafzai. Around 57 students managed to flee shortly after they were captured, but a committee investigating their disappearance said 219 of the girls are still missing. According to a mediator working with Boko Haram two of the girls have died of snake bites while around 20 have fallen ill. Residents have warned that there is a famine looming in Chibok because food stocks are being depleted by the growing population. Four or five families are having to share small houses because nearby villagers who survive  assaults are swarming into the town. Family: Martha Mark, the mother of kidnapped school girl Monica Mark cries as she displays her photo. It is not known whether Martha was among those who died . Devastated: Some of the parents sit outside a Chibok compound during a meeting with officials (file picture) Bitrus added: 'There are families that are putting up four and five other families. Livestock has been looted by Boko Haram so villagers are arriving empty handed. Worst of all, no one is planting though it is the rainy season.' Every village in the neighboring Damboa area has been attacked and ransacked, along with all the villages bordering Cameroon. The attacks continue despite the fact the military placed the area under a state of emergency in May 2013. They are also struggling to get supplies in because the town has been cut off by frequent attacks that have left the roads filled with burned out cars. Commercial flights into the area have also been stopped and the government has halted charter flights. Demands: The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Sheku, repeated in a video this week that he would exchange the abducted girls for detained extremists . The number of soldiers guarding Chibok has increased from 15 to around 200 since the kidnapping but they have done little to increase security. They often refuse to deploy to villages under attack even though there is advance warning 90 per cent of the time. Most of the schoolgirls are still believed to be held in the Sambisa Forest — a wildlife reserve that includes a mixture of thick jungle and open savannah. The forest borders on sand dunes marking the edge of the Sahara Desert. Sightings of the girls and their captors have been reported in neighboring Cameroon and Chad. Chibok and nearby villages are targets because they are enclaves of staunch Christians in predominantly Muslim north Nigeria. Displaced: Villagers from Borno State who survive Boko Haram assaults are swarming to Chibok, depleting vital supplies. Earlier this month an attack on Maidguri (pictured) killed 18 people . Residents feel so abandoned that they appealed this month for the United Nations to send troops to protect them. The U.N. has repeatedly urged Nigeria's government to live up to its international responsibility to protect citizens. President Goodluck Jonathan insists his government and military are doing everything possible to ensure the girls' release. The Defense Ministry says it knows where they are but fears any military campaign could lead to their deaths. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau in a new video released this week repeated his demands that Jonathan release detained extremists in exchange for the girls — an offer Jonathan has so far refused. After three months, few Chibok residents believe all the schoolgirls will ever return home.","Seven of the fathers were killed in an attack on nearby village of Kautakari .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Accused: Danish Irfan, 22, is accused of battering his sleeping wife to death with a hammer, hitting her 10 times after he found a text message she had sent to another man . A 'possessive and controlling' husband battered his sleeping wife to death with a hammer, hitting her 10 times after he found a text message she had sent to another man, a court heard. Danish Irfan, 22, hit his wife Ridda Zanab’s skull so hard that fragments of bone were forced into her brain, killing her within minutes. A jury heard the sustained attack, which involved at least 10 blows as his wife lay sleeping under a duvet, was sparked by the discovery of a text message she had sent to a man named Rob, which read: 'I luv yu, mwahhh, gud nyt.' The 21-year-old victim had only given birth to the couple's daughter two months before her death. After the killing at their home in Bradford, West Yorkshire on November 3 last year, Irfan changed his blood-stained clothing and took their baby in a taxi to where her mother and sister lived nearby. Prosecutor, Jonathan Sharp, told Bradford Crown Court on Monday that Irfan told a series of lies to his wife’s family saying that the deceased had 'kicked off' and left their home. Irfan said he needed to leave the baby with them because he had to go to work, but instead he travelled to Manchester Airport where he unsuccessfully tried to get himself deported back to Pakistan as his student visa had expired. The jury heard that Irfan, who has admitted manslaughter but denies murder, made his way to London where he eventually obtained a false passport and used it to fly to Islamabad from Heathrow Airport. However, he told a friend that he had killed his wife before he left the country and when police broke down the door to their home on the afternoon of November 4 they found Ms Zanab’s body. The police obtained an arrest warrant for Irfan and in February the defendant alerted the authorities to the fact that he was returning to Heathrow where he was detained and charged with the murder of his wife. Outlining the case to the jury, Mr Sharp said Irfan and his wife were from very different backgrounds. He said Ms Zanab had been born in Bradford and had a Westernised outlook on life. 'She liked a night out and she had a rebellious streak to her,' said Mr Sharp. The . court heard she had a number of boyfriends before meeting Irfan when . she was just 19, and that he had only been in the country for six or . seven months. Victim: Ridda Zanab, 21, who the court heard had a Westernised outlook on life, had only given birth to the couple's daughter two months before her death . 'By all accounts he did not share Ridda’s pleasure in going out,' said Mr Sharp. 'Ridda’s family did not approve of him and their relationship was kept partly secret. When they got married no family members were invited.' The couple initially lived together in the Huddersfield area where in December 2012 Ms Zanab was taken to hospital with red marks on her neck. Irfan admitted he had tried to smother her with a pillow and strangle her. Just one month later Ms Zanab fell pregnant and the pair moved back to Bradford. 'According to her family Danish became more possessive and controlling and did not like Ridda seeing her friends and family,' said Mr Sharp. Traditional: The court heard that Irfan did not like his wife going to work or wearing western clothes - and had become jealous . 'Danish objected to the idea of Ridda going to work or wearing western clothes. He also became more jealous.' Mr Sharp said that after the birth of their daughter in September last year, Irfan became more jealous and it was suggested he was tracking her on his iPhone. He told the jury that by late October Ms Zanab had come to the conclusion she was no longer going to be a loyal wife and in the days leading up to her death developed a relationship with another man. She was spending a lot of time with a close friend known as ‘Rob’, the jury was told. The court heard that Ms Zanab had told Irfan their relationship was over and would stay out until the early hours of the morning. On the day she was killed, Ms Zanab came home at 4.42am. She had sent the text message to ‘Rob’ shortly after midnight. Mr Sharp said some time that morning, Irfan read it. 'The defendant came into the bedroom, he was holding a hammer. He repeatedly struck her to the head, swinging at least ten hard blows down on her skull,' he told the jury. Mr Sharp said Ms Zanab died within minutes of the attack from massive brain damage. Giving evidence, Ridda’s sister, Saima Parveen, told the jury she seemed happy with Irfan, who worked in a takeaway, but then she saw her crying in hospital in December 2012. Mrs Parveen told the court her sister had said to her: 'Danish tried to strangle me'. She added that Ms Zanab was terrified and had red marks on both sides of her neck. 'I was really angry,' she said. 'I said ‘What on earth have you done to her?' Evidence: Bradford Crown Court was told that by late October Ms Zanab had come to the conclusion she was no longer going to be a loyal wife and in the days leading up to her death had developed a relationship with another man . Mrs Parveen said Irfan had replied: 'She makes me really angry.' Ms Zanab’s mother, Nazeem Shah, said she refused to see her daughter after she married a man the family did not know. Ms Zanab had lied to her that she was suffering with cancer to persuade her to meet up again, the court heard. Mrs Shah said she heard a loud bang on one occasion when she was on the phone to her daughter, and had taken a taxi to Ms Zanab's house where she was told that Irfan had smashed the TV set up with a hammer. Mr Sharp told the jury that the killing was not disputed by Irfan, but they would have to consider what was acting on his mind at the time. The trial continues.

"Trevor Alllen was crushed to death after a 17 ton lorry was driven over his head during a road-rage incident, a court has heard . A van driver was crushed to death after a 17 ton lorry was driven over his head during a road-rage incident, a court has heard. Trevor Allen, 56, was murdered after he stood in front of the DAF truck and trailer driven by Mark Slater, Chester Crown Court heard. The jury was told that another witness said they could hear the sound of bones breaking as Mr Allen, from Swinton, Salford, was crushed. Slater, 47, of Oldham, Greater Manchester claims it was an accident, and denies the murder of Mr Allen. Ian Unsworth QC, prosecuting, told the jury that after some sort of argument in the lead up to the fatal incident at around 8am on April 15 this year on the A57 road on the outskirts of Warrington, Cheshire. The court heard that both drivers had stopped on the single carriageway road. Mr Allen was out of his van and standing in front of the lorry, it was said. The prosecution said it would have been 'obvious' to Slater that Mr Allen was in front of him. Mr Ubsworth said Mr Allen was a 'well nourished' man of 16 stone who was wearing a high visibility jacket. Mr Unsworth continued: 'Not withstanding that, in all likelihood because the defendant was angry, he simply drove over Mr Allen. 'It is a matter of common sense that the defendant at the wheel of his very large, very heavy lorry, must at least have intended to cause very serious injury. 'Whatever had happened between the two men, you may think, nothing justifies the defendant’s behaviour in the way that he did.' Three eyewitness, other drivers on the same stretch of road, also saw the incident. Mr Unsworth said Michael Taylor, driving his Ford Transit van in the opposite direction, saw Mr Allen with his hands up standing in front of the lorry. Forensic examination showed the victim was dragged underneath with his head in the area of the front driver’s-side wheel. Kamil Miskiewicz, driving a refuse truck, saw Mr Allen with his arms outstretched, standing in front of the lorry. Mr Allen, 56, was murdered after he stood in front of the DAF truck and trailer driven by Mark Slater, Chester Crown Court heard. He denies murder, instead claiming it was an accident . Mr Unsworth told the jury: 'He described seeing Trevor Allen’s head explode and seeing his body twist beneath the vehicle. He could hear his bones being broken. The lorry continued to move forward.' Simon Feltham, on his way to play golf in his Audi A4, stopped near the scene further up the road where Slater’s lorry came to a halt. He spoke to Slater and dialled 999, the court heard. The defendant told Mr Feltham that Mr Allen had been 'throwing things' at his lorry and it 'all started down at the lights', the court heard. Ian Unsworth QC, prosecuting, told the jury that after some sort of argument in the lead up to the fatal incident at around 8am on April 15 this year on the A57 road on the outskirts of Warrington, Cheshire (pictured) Chester Crown Court heard that both drivers had stopped on the single carriageway road. Mr Allen was out of his van and standing in front of the lorry, it was said. The prosecution said it would have been 'obvious' to Slater that Mr Allen was in front of him . When police arrived the defendant told them the victim had pulled up in front of him so he had swerved to go around and Mr Allen then 'dived out' in front of his vehicle. He was charged with murder the next day. Mr Unsworth said an analysis of the lorry’s taco-graph suggested that before the fatal incident it had been stationary for nine seconds. Analysis also showed that before the incident the lorry had on several occasions increased and decreased speed and slowed down from 54mph to a stop after emergency breaking. The jury were told Slater accepts that he did drive over Mr Allen and caused his death, but denies murder and claims he simply did not see the victim standing in front of his vehicle. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Trevor Allen, 56, was 'murdered after he stood in front of truck and trailer'

"By . Becky Barrow And Ruth Lythe . Steve Webb, pictured, the Pensions Ministers, has revealed plans to slash a bonus paid out to those who delay claiming their State pensions . Millions of Britons have been warned their State pension payout will be hit by controversial changes sneaked out by the Government before ministers head off on holiday. At present, anybody can decide to delay claiming their State pension - and get a bonus worth around 10 per cent a year on their unclaimed State pension. More than 1.2million pensioners in Britain currently receive a higher State pension because they deferred it, typically for a few years although many delay for a decade. But Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, has revealed plans to slash this bonus in a move which will hit everybody who reaches State pension age on or after 6 April 2016. Rather than a bonus worth 10.4 per cent a year of their unclaimed State pension, they will get a bonus worth only 5.8 per cent a year. In a further blow, the rules are also being changed about how the money is paid to them when they eventually decide to start claiming their State pension. At present, they can either take a lump sum when they begin to claim the pension, or simply receive the higher weekly amount. From April 2016, the chance to take the lump sum, which is popular with pensioners who often use the money to indulge themselves with a holiday or a new kitchen, is being axed. Mr Webb came under fire today for putting out the statement about the explosive change on the last day of Parliament before the long summer recess begins. It was one of 31 ‘written ministerial statements’ put out raising suspicions that the Government was trying to bury the bad news. Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at the financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘The Government is using the last day of term to shovel out the less popular outstanding announcements before heading off on holiday.’ The impact of the technical change is eye-watering for future generations of pensioners who want to defer their State pension in order to receive a higher amount in the future. Take the example of two 65-year-old men who retire this year – Mr Smith receives his full State pension, worth £113.10 a week, and Mr Taylor defers it for ten years. Mr Taylor begins to receive his higher State pension in 2024. By 2030, the total amount that he has received from his State pension is higher than the total amount received by Mr Smith. That is, he is better off after just six years of claiming his State pension. Under the new system, it would take him 14 years of claiming his State pension after the ten-year deferral to be better off than Mr Smith, according to Hargreaves Lansdown. But the problem for Mr Taylor is that he will be nearly 90 by the time he reaches this moment, which is quite a gamble to take as he might die in his 60s, 70s or 80s. In a further blow, the rules are also being changed about how the money is paid to pensioners when they eventually decide to start claiming State pension . Alan Higham, retirement director at the investment company Fidelity Worldwide said: ‘It will be a big reduction in what people who defer their pension today under the current rules enjoy. ‘The new state pension [which comes into force in April 2016] is immensely complicated and there are winners and losers depending on whatever side of it you fall.’ Anybody who has already deferred their pension will not be affected by the changes, and will continue to accrue a higher State pension at the current rate of 10.4 per cent a year. People who reach State pension age before 6 April 2016 will also be able to defer under the current terms. But the change will hit anybody who reaches State pension age on or after 6 April 2016 and would like to defer their State pension. On 6 April 2016, the State pension age for a man will still be 65 and it will be around 63 for a woman. The State pension age is currently being increased to 65 for men and women in 2018, 66 in 2020, 67 by 2028 and will continue to rise, expected to reach 68 by 2036. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions, which was advised by the Government Actuary, said: ‘It is important to set a fair deferral rate for the new State pension.’ Angus Hanton, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, which campaigns for fairness between the generations, said: ‘This is a good step towards addressing increasing longevity but much more needs to be done. ‘A brave government would stop paying the State pension altogether to wealthy pensioners for the sake of younger generations already over-burdened with debt.’","Currently pensioners get extra ten per cent on unclaimed State pensions .

"By . Ian Drury . The Home Office squandered a staggering £347million on a botched IT programme to process immigrants’ paperwork, a damning report reveals today. Ministers introduced the flagship Immigration Case Work (ICW) project in 2010 to make it easier for officials to deal with asylum, visas and residency applications by foreigners. But despite investing so much taxpayers’ money in the programme, it was axed in August last year – after just three years – as a resounding failure. The Home Office squandered a staggering £347million on a botched IT programme to process immigrants¿ paperwork, a damning report reveals today . It ‘delivered significantly less than planned’ prompting officials to finally pull the plug on the scheme, says the National Audit Office (NAO). The spending watchdog said the failed programme was practically ‘unusable’ and delays and glitches meant it only ever worked for student visas. The computer system regularly ‘froze’, became unstable, and was incapable of linking with other Government systems. The embarrassing report, published this morning, reveals staff in UK Visas And Immigration and Immigration Enforcement still work from old-fashioned paper files which increases the risk of mistakes. The money wasted could have paid for the starting salaries of 15,000 new police recruits at a time when the number of officers is falling. Home Office chiefs are now introducing a new IT programme, called Immigration Platform Technologies (IPT), which is costing the public another £209million. Ministers introduced the flagship Immigration Case Work (ICW) project in 2010 to make it easier for officials to deal with asylum, visas and residency applications by foreigners . But ministers are expected to incur extra costs to maintain the older system - which is due to expire in early 2016 - until the new technology is ready to launch, the Nation Audit Office concluded. The extraordinary sums wasted will fuel concerns the under-fire department has failed to get a grip on its finances. The NAO’s latest report focuses on two of the Home Office directorates which were created following the break-up of the beleaguered UK Border Agency. But it said Home Secreatry Theresa May’s decision to split the former UK Border Agency because of its ‘closed, secretive and defensive culture’ had failed to result in widespread improvements. UK Visas And Immigration deals with 3.5million applications a year from foreigners wanting to visit and stay in the UK. Immigration Enforcement is tasked with getting people who do not have permission to stay here to leave. The NAO said the agencies, which have a 1.8billion a year budget, were still dealing with a backlog of 301,000 cases – including at least 31,000 pre-dating 2007. However, it said there had been ‘no significant performance falls’ since Home Secretary Theresa may broke up the UK Border Agency in February 2012. But NAO head Amyas Morse said: ‘We would have expected greater progress by now though in tackling the problems we identified in 2012 in areas such as specific backlogs and IT.’ Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘We abolished the UK Border Agency because it was weak and could not cope with the uncontrolled immigration we saw under the previous government – it was symptomatic of the chaotic system we inherited. This report shows the decision to split up UKBA was the right one.’","Immigration Case Work (ICW) project in .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . President Obama hasn't kept his health-care promises, but at least his Navigators were taught to be more honest -- even if some of them ignored that advice . Two documents released Monday about the Obamacare 'Navigators' couldn't be more different: A congressional report slammed the health insurance helpers for encouraging fraud, while the organization's own training manual encouraged workers to 'be candid, open, and honest' and 'build trust' with Americans seeking health care policies. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released its scathing indictment of the Navigator program in conjunction with a Texas field hearing. Investigators found that volunteers tasked with enrolling Obamacare customers were encouraging applicants to lie in order to get government subsidies and favorable premiums. 'Navigators from the Urban League of Dallas were captured on video,' committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa reported, 'encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance application so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies.' 'Navigators were also recorded advising an applicant to lie about her smoking habits to obtain a lower monthly premium,' the report added. In addition to advice reminiscent of Google's 'Don't be evil' rule, the Navigator training manual, provided a stark contrast with the Obama administration's performance since healthcare.gov's Oct. 1 rollout. 'Only offer consumers something that you are sure you can give them,' the manual insists. 'Don’t promise timelines you are not sure you can fulfill. Stick to deadlines ... and never make promises you cannot keep. If situations change, let consumers know as soon as possible.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, a hard-charging California Republican, has turned over countless stones in search of new avenues to criticize healthcare.gov and the rest of the Obamacare program . The government prepared a 217-page report to teach Navigators how to do their volunteer jobs, and it took four months to surface publicly . The Obama administration was so keen on keeping the Navigator manual a secret that every page carried a warning designed to discourage would-be leakers . President Barack Obama has been criticized widely for falsely promising that Americans with health insurance policies they liked could keep them under his signature insurance overhaul project. And the Department of Health and Human Services has missed or postponed more than a dozen deadlines in the Affordable Care Act's implementation. The training manual was surfaced by the conservative Franklin Center for Government & Public Integrity, and is hosted online by HealthReformGPS, a project of the George Washington University and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. It carries the government's 'Restricted Distribution' classification; each page bears the warning 'INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW.' The oversight committee's report also blasted local Navigator groups for collecting and mailing paper Obamacare applications – a violation of federal privacy regulations – and for falsely telling consumers that their credit scores could affect their eligibility for new health insurance plans. Like millions of Americans, Navigator groups were caught off guard when healthcare.gov failed to launch as planned. They lacked a contingency plan for the online flop, congressional investigators found. 'Our system is temporarily down': HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius held a Navigator photo-op in November but no one could reach healthcare.gov . Despite the president's repeated . urging during the chronically ill website's early weeks that Americans . could still enroll in Obamacare on paper or via telephone calls, those . methods also required someone to have access to the website. House Republicans still have their knives out over Obamacare, this time going after the 'Navigator' volunteers tasked with signing people up . Navigators were in the same boat, it turned out, unable to help people on the phone, or in person either with a laptop or a pen and paper. 'War Room' meeting notes from the healthcare.gov team's first month in action 'show confused HHS officials struggling to advise Navigators about how to respond to the inoperable website,' Issa's committee wrote. Notes from October 11, 2013 stated that '[t]he paper applications allow people to feel like they are moving forward in the process and provides another option; at the end of the day, we are all stuck in the same queue.' That dysfunction was on full display Nov. 19 during a Florida visit by HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. While reporters trailed her during a chat with Obamacare Navigators at a Miami hospital, one noticed that the site was crashing. 'The screen says, ""I’m sorry but the system is temporarily down,""' a television reporter told Sebelius, who could only mutter a surprised, 'Uh oh.'","House committee reports that some Navigators were advising consumers to lie about their income in order to qualify for subsidies .
Other volunteer health care helpers told Americans to deny their smoking habits so their rates would go down .
Navigator groups had no contingency plan for dealing with the failed launch of healthcare.gov, leaving them unable to help their own customers .
A secret training manual for Navigators is soaked in Obamacare irony, advising helpers to keep their promises and stick to their deadlines ."

"By . Kit Holden . If Manchester United manage to bring Mats Hummels to Old Trafford, it would be the finest transfer coup of the club’s recent history. Hummels has shown in recent years, and not least at the last World Cup, that he has the ability, the intelligence and the character to become one of football’s great defenders. A ball playing centre half, Hummels not only controls the pace of the game from the back, he can also make surging runs forward, both at set pieces and in open play. His pace and intelligence give him the versatility to play either in a high line or as a deep lying centre back. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mats Hummels training and celebrating with Germany . Eyes on the prize: The signature of Mats Hummels would be among Manchester United greatest transfers . Ever-present: Mats Hummels makes one of many tackles on Lionel Messi during the World Cup final . Right time and place: Hummels defensive capabilities were on show in the World Cup final . Over the last few years, Hummels has been perfectly suited to Jurgen Klopp’s revolution at Borussia Dortmund, both as a gifted player and as an on field leader. Under Klopp, he has won two German titles, a German Cup, and reached the Final of the Champions League in 2013. Unlike the likes of Mario Gotze and Marco Reus, however, Hummels is not a product of the Dortmund youth system. The defender learnt his trade at Bayern Munich, where his father was in charge of the youth system between 1995 and 2012. Bayern, though, squandered Hummels’ talent, loaning him out to Dortmund rather than giving him first team opportunities. In 2009, a permanent transfer was agreed. Hummels has since shown his former club what they are missing, pipping Bayern to several titles and vowing repeatedly never to return to the club. Under Jurgen Klopp, who as a player also trained under Hummels’ father, the defender has developed into one of Europe’s most impressive, modern defenders. He has shown his class not only in the yellow and black of BVB, but also in the white shirts of the national team. Rivals: Hummels came through the Bayern Munich youth system under his father but Borussia Dortmund have made the most of his talents . Lynchpin: Hummels is Jurgen Klopp's on-field leader, and has won two Bundesliga titles, a German Cup, and made the 2013 Champions League final with Dortmund . Hummels’ man of the match winning performance against France at the World Cup was his finest in a Germany shirt. It not only showed his footballing prowess, but also the strength of his will. He has had to fight almost incessant setbacks to establish himself under Joachim Low. Match-winner: Although Hummels has separated opinion in Germany he proved his worth in a fine showing against France in Brazil, capped off by the winning goal form this header . Just two years ago, Hummels was public enemy number one. His errors in the Euro 2012 semi-final saw Germany fall embarassingly against Italy. Hummels, who has always radiated confidence, was vilified not only for his mistakes on the pitch, but also his vanity off it. He was seen as arrogant, as a player who overestimated himself. Joachim Low seemed to share the view, and over the following years often left Hummels out of the first team, opting instead for Arsenal’s Per Mertesacker. Hummels and Dortmund were so frustrated that they accused Low of making it difficult for Dortmund players to succeed internationally. After . finally regaining Low’s trust with a goal against Italy last autumn, . Hummels then suffered an almost season ending injury, which looked set . to shatter his World Cup chances. But . the Dortmund defender fought back. His performances at the World Cup . were repeatedly brilliant, often being the only man to prevent Germany’s . wobbly defence from collapse. If Hummels’ international career shows one thing, it is that he has an immense . desire to prove himself on every single stage. He has not only the . quality to boost Manchester United’s defence, but also the character to . assimilate very quickly into Premier League football. Team player: After being perceived as arrogant in his own country Hummels has won fans and Joachim Low over . Home comforts: Hummels is embraced by his partner Cathy Fischer after the final at the Maracana . Whether he will leave Dortmund is another matter. When he extended his contract until 2017 two years ago, Hummels refused to add in a buyout clause, on the grounds that he did not want to leave the club on bad terms. His relationship to Dortmund and to Juergen Klopp is very strong. It will take Louis van Gaal a huge amount of persuasion to tempt the player to England. If he manages it, though, United fans may rejoice. Hummels’ quality is out of the question. His character, meanwhile, means that you can never ever write him off.

"By . David Kent . Arsenal have expressed an interest in Manchester City central defender Matija Nastasic. Arsene Wenger will move for a new centre-half if captain Thomas Vermaelen leaves for Manchester United. And Nastasic is on the Gunners’ radar as they make plans for the exit of Vermaelen. Talented: Matija Nastasic impressed for the champions Manchester City last season . On his way: Could Nastasic have played his last game for Manchester City? The Serbia international was watched extensively by Arsenal scouts during his time at Fiorentina, but City moved quickly to snap up Nastasic in 2012 as he developed a reputation as one of the best emerging defenders in Europe. Despite missing out to City, the North London club remain keen on Nastasic and are set to revive their interest should Vermaelen leave. Nastasic’s future at the Etihad Stadium is unclear this summer due to the pending arrival of Eliaquim Mangala from Porto. Roma are also interested in Nastasic, 21, who could cost £16million. Experience: Thomas Vermaelen is still a top player on his day . Frustrating: Vermaelen has endured his fair share of injury woes over the last few years . VIDEO Vermaelen could join Manchester United . Whether Vermaelen completes a move to Old Trafford remains to be seen, with the Gunners far from convinced about selling their skipper. The Belgium international has less than 12 months on his existing deal meaning he can leave on a free transfer next summer. But Wenger knows letting Vermaelen go, particularly after the departure of fourth-choice centre-back Bacary Sagna, would leave him alarmingly short of options in the position. It is understood Wenger would give serious consideration to a player-swap deal with United.

It’s a sink or swim thing but he’s definitely been swimming. ‘He’s had three attempts at a breakaway and made two of them,’ added Wilson. ‘To make a Tour de France breakaway is incredibly hard, everyone wants to be in them, and Saturday was a very, very strong breakaway.’ Strong debutant: The 21-year-old was appearing in his first Tour de France competition . VIDEO Kristoff takes second stage win as Nibali consolidates lead . Yates and his twin brother, Adam, have been two revelations of the season, with Adam winning the Tour of Turkey in May. It was in Turkey that Simon crashed and broke his collarbone — a setback that, ironically, opened the door to a start at the Tour while Adam was rested. Wilson said of both Yates brothers: ‘They know how to sniff out breakaways, they can climb and they know how to win races. They have an  awesome attitude.’ Meanwhile, there was heartbreak for Jack Bauer as the race left the mountains and arrived in Nimes. The 29-year-old New Zealander attacked at the start of the stage and almost held on for the win 222km later. Keeping up: Yates, centre, was part of the breakaway group during the eighth stage on July 12 . Instead, he was swamped by the sprinters in the final 20 metres and crossed the line 10th. ‘In the last kilometre I thought I could win,’ said Bauer, who, with breakaway partner Martin Elmiger of Switzerland, held off the rampaging peloton even as the sprinters’ teams hunted them down. The beneficiary was Alexander Kristoff, the Norwegian sprinter who now has two stage wins. Even he was sympathetic. ‘I hoped (Bauer) would hold on for second place,’ Kristoff said.","The 21-year-old, making his Tour debut, impressed in the previous stage .

'Becoming World No1 in heptathlon had really given me the confidence going in to the Games that I could post a big score and hopefully come away with that gold medal, but sadly it’s just not meant to be. 'All the advice is telling me that I risk long-term damage if I compete in a heptathlon in just over a week’s time and I have to take that advice for the sake of my career.' Neil Black, the performance director for British Athletics, said: 'Obviously we’ re really disappointed for Katarina as the Commonwealth Games was a big target for her this year, but the key thing is ensuring we don’t risk her long term career. 'We’re confident that with treatment and careful management she will still be in a position to compete in the long jump at the European Championships in Zurich next month, but a heptathlon starting next week could result in long term damage.'

The jacket of a shooter is there to aid in holding the rifle, ensuring the best accuracy, and to protect. There are strict rules in shooting when it comes to the proper equipment, as there would be in any major sport. There are rules regarding the jacket, trousers, and even 'undergarments'.

'Athletes must use only equipment and apparel that complies with ISSF Rules. Athletes are responsible for ensuring that all items of equipment and clothing used (complies) with ISSF Rules.' 'She was a gold medallist last time and now she won’t even get a chance to compete. It is really painful for her. I just feel so sorry for her,' Musa was quoted as saying by Malaysian media on Tuesday. 'We made a report when her bag did not arrive with the other luggage. We waited for three days... (Tuesday) is the last day for us to confirm the names. 'The rules clearly state that a rifle shooter must wear a jacket. 'We tried to borrow one but it did not fit her. We tried to make a new one but she said that she would need two months to get used to it.' Musa said Ayuni had been unable to stop crying and wanted to fly home immediately upon being told she would not be able to compete. However, Musa said she would have to stay with the team in Scotland and watch Muslifah Zulkifli take her place in the 10m air rifle and Suryani, who competed in the 2012 London Olympics while 30 weeks pregnant, take over for the 50m prone. 'The licence for all her firearms is under her name. We cannot send her back immediately,' Musa said. 'This is all so unfortunate. She’s taking it badly. She is sad, we are all sad.'

"By . Ryan Lipman . Researchers in Melbourne could be on the verge of a medical breakthrough after pinpointing three types of stem cells in umbilical cord blood, which could be the key to preventing cerebral palsy. As part of a trial to prevent the disorder, babies in Victoria will be given back their own umbilical blood, reported The Herald Sun. Cerebral palsy is a physical condition affecting posture and movement, due to damage to the developing brain during pregnancy or shortly after birth. New hope: A trail will see babies in Victoria given back their own umbilical blood in a bid to prevent the cerebral palsy . One Australian child every 15 hours is born with cerebral palsy according to Cerebrapalsy.org.au. Often caused by oxygen deprivation around the time of birth, about 700 Australian babies are born with cerebral palsy each year, making it the most common childhood physical disability. Researchers at the Monash Institute of Medical Research found that giving back umbilical cord blood to newborns within 12 hours of birth could prevent the likelihood of birth asphyxia, which causes brain damage. During the Annual Congress of the Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand, scientist Courtney McDonald revealed researchers were in the process of determining the link between umbilical cord blood and brain repair. The Ritchie Centre at Monash Institute of Medical Research, pictured, is leading the way in preventing the disorder . 'Cord blood works, but we want to know what’s the best cord blood to give back,' Dr McDonald said. 'These particular cells can actually stop the inflammation which causes damage. They can help the baby’s own brain repair itself, and help these blood vessels become stronger.' The Ritchie Centre's research is focused on three types of stem cell and their characteristics: anti-inflammatory T-regulatory cells, Endothelial Progenitor cells, which stimulate blood flow to injured areas and the brain-repairing Mesenchymal stem cells. Part of the team's research involved taking umbilical cord blood from lambs and then isolating the specific stem cells. Once this was done, the stem cells were then injected back into the animals 12 hours from the time of injury, Dr McDonald said. The results from the study will form the basis of a national human clinical trial, which will see babies at risk of cerebral palsy given the umbilical cord blood in the first few days after birth. Mesenchymal stem cells, pictured, are one of the three singled out by researchers and are able to help fix damaged nervous tissue in the brain . 'The results that are coming out of our studies and the clinical trials overseas are so promising. It’s going to happen. It has so much potential,' Dr McDonald said. The trial will be led by Professor Euan Wallace and Associate Professor Michael Fahey. In 2012, a world-first trial at Monash Medical Centre saw pregnant women whose babies were not developing normally, given an antioxidant. Doctors believed this was capable of stopping their babies from suffering brain damage in the womb and developing cerebral palsy, reported The Age. Research centres around the world are testing the success of stem cell therapies. In South Korea, human clinical trials appear promising with children aged between six months and 10 years old, who received donated cord blood together with other rehabilitation therapies, showing improvements in cognitive function and motor skills.","A Victorian trial will see babies given their own umbilical blood back .

One-fifth of those questioned in a new poll said they organised a trip within three months of a break-up, with the majority saying they needed to 'take their mind off the split'. But an optimistic one-quarter said they booked a holiday with the idea of finding a new love interest. All by myself: A fifth of newly-single Britons said they book a holiday within three months of a split . Party time: Back in 2009, Katie Price headed to Ibiza to get over her split from Peter Andre . Ibiza topped the list of holiday destinations chosen by newly-single Britons, according to the poll by sunshine.co.uk. The White Isle is where Katie Price chose to forget all her worries after splitting from former husband Peter Andre. The Greek island of Rhodes was the second favourite destination for broken-hearted holidaymakers, followed by Ibiza's neighbour Mallorca. Cyprus and mainland Spain made up the top five destinations for newly-single Britons. Fresh start: While the majority of heartbroken Britons book a trip to get away from it all, a quarter admitted they hoped to meet a new partner . While taking their mind off the break-up and meeting a new partner were the most popular reasons for travel, a further 13 per cent said their friends convinced them to treat themselves to a break. And 17 per cent said they were already due a holiday. Chris Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: 'It was interesting to see all of the typical party destinations in the top five list of heartbreak holiday locations, with resorts such as San Antonio, Faliraki, Magaluf, Ayia Napa and Marbella probably the hardest hit by heartbroken holidaymakers.’ 'Getting a bunch of friends together for a few days in the sun or even going away with family can be a good way to get some distance from everything and return home to the UK with a clearer head... and maybe a new partner!'","One-fifth of Britons organised a trip within three months of a breakup .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Misery: Tailbacks reportedly stretched back to Cheshire after a fatal accident involving three motorbikes between junctions 14 and 15 on the M6 in Staffordshire . A man has died after three motorbikes and a car collided during a pile-up on the M6 today. Motorists were left stuck in their cars for up to five hours in sweltering conditions following the accident at about 9am. Police said the accident was caused when a HGV lorry blew a tyre between junction 15 of the M6 and Yarnfield, near Stone, in Staffordshire. As traffic slowed down to avoid debris in the road, three motorbikes and a car collided. A 63-year-old man, from the Blackpool area, was seriously injured and died on his way to hospital . Three other people, including the man's female pillion passenger, 49, also suffered serious injuries but they are not thought to be life-threatening. The road has now been cleared but the tailbacks were said to have stretched more than 14 miles all the way back to Cheshire. Many people were stranded on the motorway and were forced to get out their cars to try and cool off as the mercury topped 35 degrees on the ground.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Young British tourists will be taking unnecessary risks with their health when they head off on their holidays this summer – because many do not take adequate precautions. A new survey compiled by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the travel association ABTA has found that over a third of Britons between the ages of 16 and 24 do not bother to take out travel insurance before they visit a foreign destination. Taking a chance: Over a third of young Britons travel without insurance (picture posed by models) Some 38 per cent of Britons in this age group do not think travel insurance is necessary – despite the danger of high hospital bills – according to the research. And almost half of holidaymakers in the same age bracket are cavalier about travelling without an insurance safety net - saying they are prepared to take the risk. Nearly one in five think their adventures are covered by the British taxpayer – 16 per cent assume that the government will pay for their health costs if they become ill while abroad and do not have a travel insurance policy to cover their expenses. And almost half – 42 per cent – refuse to take out travel insurance because they say it is too expensive. A worrying number of British youngsters also have the wrong impression about the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). Nearly one in five believe that the card acts as a full insurance policy while abroad – when it only provides access to state medical care in countries that are part of the European Economic Area (EEA) – all members of the European Union, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Switzerland also comes under the EHIC remit. Life's a beach: Young Britons are putting themselves at risk, says the FCO (picture posed by models) The survey’s findings should be a wake-up call for young people, FCO minister Mark Simmonds stresses. ‘It’s the time of year when people are preparing to travel abroad for summer trips, including some for the first time without their parents,’ Mr Simmonds says. ‘Arranging comprehensive travel insurance should be at the top of their to-do list before departing. An accident or emergency abroad can end up costing thousands, and it’s often the family who is left to cover the costs. ‘Although we will do what we can to support people who encounter difficulties while abroad, the FCO cannot cover medical bills or fly them home.’ Victoria Bacon of ABTA adds that ‘every year ABTA sees tragic cases of young people who have had an accident while on holiday overseas that requires serious medical help. ‘In some cases, parents are presented with massive medical bills because their children went on holiday uninsured.’","More than one in three young Britons go on holiday without insurance .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It is the sunshine enclave that has long lured British holidaymakers to its beaches – and its popularity shows no sign of waning, according to a new survey. What’s more, this much-visited place in the sun is not Spain, but its neighbour Portugal. Research by a holiday insurance firm into what – in the eyes of British travellers – makes for a great holiday destination, has placed Europe’s most south-westerly country in the top spot. A place in the sun: With pretty towns such as Lagos, Portugal's Algarve region is big with Britons . Schofields questioned 2,614 British holidaymakers who have enjoyed a beach break in the past 12 months, and stayed in a holiday home. The study asked them to rate five European holiday enclaves on the basis of accommodation, food, entertainment, local welcome, and overall enjoyment factor. Portugal achieved an impressive total of 41 out of a possible 50, and scored highly (out of 10) on accommodation (nine), food (eight), entertainment (seven), local welcome (eight) and overall enjoyment (nine). This meant that it eclipsed Greece (38 out of 50), the UK (35) and Italy (32). France, perhaps surprisingly, finished bottom of the poll with a total score of 30, and low ratings of just five for local welcome and six for overall enjoyment. It might be suggested that the absence from the survey of Spain – a country that has almost become a second home for Britons – rather detracts from the results. Grab your bucket, bring a spade: The beaches along the south coast of the Algarve are a haven for sun-seekers . But equally, Portugal offers plenty of attractions to please sun-worshippers seeking a week on a lounger – not least its southern Algarve region, where the likes of Faro, Albufeira and Carvoeiro are festooned with hotels in sight of the seafront. ‘Portugal seems to be the destination of choice at the moment for British holidaymakers,’ says Phil Schofield of Schofields Holiday Home Insurance. ‘What we found interesting is that the high point of almost every holiday is the accommodation, which scores highest or joint highest out of the categories for all countries except Italy.’ While the UK only finished third in the table, it did top a sub-category. According to the survey, holidaymakers who had stayed in the UK were twice as likely to return to the same place compared to those who had holidayed anywhere else in Europe.","Portugal scores an impressive 41 out of 50 when assessed as destination .

Apparently having a glass or two of Pimms or Champagne or just saying ‘I was there’ are good enough reasons – and sometimes the best aspects – of making a trip to Wimbledon. Londoners place the most importance on the quality of their seat compared to other regions, with 36 per cent saying having a great view of tennis was their top priority.

However, fans from Yorkshire and the Humber value this the least (16 per cent), according to ticket resale marketplace StubHub. Wimbledon goers from the South West rank soaking up the atmosphere in the ground the higher than anywhere else in the country (32 per cent), while when it comes to being able to say ‘I was there’, Scottish fans list this first (24 per cent).

"By . Catherine Eade . While efforts to find missing Malaysian passenger plane MH370 continue, the families of passengers have begun to receive initial compensation payments of $50,000 (£30,000). Six Malaysian families and one Chinese family have received the money to date, according to Malaysian deputy foreign minister Hamzah Zainudin. Zainudin stressed that the government has not yet declared the plane lost, but says talks with 40 more Chinese families are already underway to ascertain they are . the rightful claimants. Missing: The news echoes the surroundings of the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared in March. Pictured, Malaysia Airlines aircraft parked on the tarmac at Kuala Lumpur International Airport . Hamzah heads a committee to support . the missing passengers' next-of-kin and says full payment to the families - who can claim can claim up three times the initial amount - will be made later. Under International Civil Aviation Organisation rules, passengers' families can claim up to US$175,000 (£103,000), regardless of fault, in a plane crash. Malaysia Airlines' insurer, a consortium led by Germany's Allianz, is making the payments. Flight MH370 veered . off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 and . is believed to have crashed into the Indian Ocean far off the west . Australian coast. The search area has changed several times, but no sign of the aircraft, or the 239 people aboard, has been found. Countries involved in the search, including Malaysia, Australia, United States, China, Japan, Britain, South Korea and New Zealand, have carried their own costs to date. Meanwhile during talks between Malaysia and Australia on cost-sharing for the search, a Malaysian official claimed that both countires would split the bill 50/50. But Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss declined to say whether the country was considering an even split of the bill for a search that could take months, if not years, and cost tens of millions of dollars. The government expects to spend 90 million Australian dollars (£49 million) on the search by July 2015. Countries are continuing to negotiate on how to fund the next phase of the sonar search of almost 56,000 square kilometers (21,600 square miles) of seabed beneath water up to 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) deep. Countries involved in the search, including Malaysia, Australia, United States, China, Japan, Britain, South Korea and New Zealand, have carried their own costs to date. But Malaysian government lawmaker Jailani Johari, chairman of Malaysia's Liaison, Communication and Media Committee, told reporters in Kuala Lumpur this week that future costs 'will be shared 50-50' between Malaysia and Australia. The Australian government has repeatedly said it owes it to families of the passengers and crew aboard Flight 370 to do all it can to solve the mystery of the airliner's disappearance. It has placed no time limit on how long the search will continue. A Chinese survey ship is mapping the ocean floor ahead of a sonar search for wreckage by specialist deep-sea private contractors. That search is expected to begin in August and take eight to 12 months. Truss said China, the homeland of most of the missing passengers, was continuing to carry its own costs for the survey work. But China is under no legal obligation to help pay the multimillion-dollar bill for the private contractors.","Seven families so far have received compensation .

The study found that the fixed camera on the M60, Junction 25, in Greater Manchester clocked 9,326 speeding offences in 2013 - generating an estimated £189,140. The research also discovered that eight out of nine councils changed speed limits in their area last year, while 15 per cent of drivers who received speeding tickets in the same period were caught out by recent changes to speed limits. The study found that the fixed camera on the M60, Junction 25, in Greater Manchester clocked 9,326 speeding offences in 2013 (file picture) Police and council data obtained by a freedom of information request by LV= car insurance, other busy speed cameras include one situated on the A13 Thames Gateway (westbound) to Scratton Terrace in London (8,002 offences issued), and one of the M54 between junction one and three in Staffordshire (7,403). Overall Police handed out almost 400,000 fixed penalty notices for speeding and 73,944 court summons last year, equating to motorists paying out £22 million in fines. This figure excludes those who took a speed awareness course to avoid paying a fine or receiving points. Most drivers who were caught speeding said they were spotted by one of Britain’s estimated 3,353 fixed speed cameras (58 per cent), with a significant proportion caught by police with a camera at the roadside (28 per cent) or police without a camera (12 per cent). On an average day, it is estimated that there is now a fixed or mobile camera in operation for every 67 miles of British road. Since 2009, one in seven motorists (14 per cent) have been caught speeding and 22 per cent of these have been caught more than once. Police figures show that the number of motorists caught speeding slightly increased last year with the total number of offences up by three per cent compared with 2012. A speed camera  in Leeds West Yorkshire. It is estimated the camera has been responsible for £250k of fines, the bus lane cameras is reported to have issued 6,259 fines in 10 months . It would seem that one in six drivers (15 per cent) were caught out by recent changes to local speed limits, with a further one in five (19 per cent) saying that the speed limit was not clearly displayed so they were unsure what it was at the time they were caught. On average 15 changes per council area were made to speed limits last year, with the majority of these introducing new slower zones in their area. Among those drivers caught speeding more than once, nearly half (43 per cent) were caught speeding in the same location on more than one occasion. Many of these drivers believe that the location of this speed camera is unfair as the speed limit has recently changed at that location (21 per cent) or that the speed limit changes too abruptly (18 per cent). John O’Roarke, managing director of LV= car insurance, said: 'It can be easy for motorists to become complacent when they get behind the wheel, especially when they drive on the same roads day in and day out. 'However, it's important that drivers always concentrate on the road so they can spot any new road signs, changes in speed limits, and are aware of what other motorists are doing.'","Camera on the M60, near Manchester clocked 9,326 speeding offences .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Even footballers need good English and maths, David Cameron has told his son Arthur to emphasise the importance of working hard at school. The Prime Minister revealed how the eight-year-old had challenged his claim that every job requires good literacy and numeracy. Mr Cameron insisted that even star players need to have basic English and maths so they can ‘read the contract and count the money’. David Cameron, appearing at an event with Chancellor George Osborne, said even footballers need to have good qualifications in maths and English . England striker Wayne Rooney hired a private tutor in 2007 to help him study for GCSEs in maths and English at the age of 22, having failed to sit them as a teenager. Mr Cameron expressed his exasperation that tens of thousands of people applying for jobs do not have the basic skills employers need. He insisted that English and maths are ‘vocational subjects’ and not just an academic pursuit. He revealed how car giant Mercedes had received 30,000 applications for just 5,000 apprenticeships, but too few people had maths and English to a decent standard. Half of young people start adult life without getting GCSE A*-C in 2 English and maths. The government warns that adults who lack literacy and numeracy skills tend to be less productive at work, earn lower wages, are more likely to suffer from ill health and experience social exclusion. Speaking at an event in Hertfordshire yesterday, Mr Cameron told construction workers: ‘We have got to remind young people that English and maths are vocational subjects. England striker Wayne Rooney hired a private tutor in 2007 to help him study for GCSEs in maths and English at the age of 22, having failed to sit them as a teenager . ‘I tell my children there is not a job in the world that does not require English and maths. ‘My son says what about football players? I say well you have got to be able to read the contract and count the money. Everything requires English and maths.’ The Prime Minister stressed the need to create a skilled UK workforce in order to make sure jobs in the country go to British people. During an event at leading construction company Skanska's offices in Hertfordshire, Mr Cameron was asked how the Government could make sure British jobs went to British workers. He said: ‘I did one of these things at Mercedes the other day and they said they were trying to take on 5,000 apprentices. I said: “How many people did you have apply?” ‘They said 30,000. I said “my God how did you decide how to get the apprentices?” and they said the trouble is, of the 30,000 that apply, not enough have the basic English and maths.’ The UK Independence Party yesterday launched a poster campaign warning that EU migrants want to take the jobs of Brits. Ukip has paid for billboards across the country to be emblazoned with messages such as: ‘26million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?’ Another has a picture of a construction worker begging on the street, with the slogan: ‘EU policy at work. British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour.’ But Mr Cameron insisted that improvements were being made to ensure that Britons can compete in the jobs market. The PM said: ‘I think if you look back five or 10 years ago we had a real problem there in that when we did generate jobs, a lot of those jobs were going to people from overseas coming here quite understandably to do those jobs because we were not creating a skilled workforce here at home. I think we have made some big, big improvements. ‘During this Parliament so far we have made 1.6 million apprentices. I want to get to two million apprenticeships by the end of this Parliament.’","Prime Minister challenges idea that star players do not need qualifications .

"It might look small and unassuming but this radio controlled car is faster than an Audi R8, which costs around £80,000. The fluorescent wedge-shaped radio controlled car is far from a standard toy as it has a blistering top speed of 188mph (303km/h) - the top speed of Ferrari’s classic 288 GTO. The miniature car is called the R/C Bullet and is completely handmade with specialised materials and components, a little like the construction of a Formula One car. Super speedy: The miniature car is called the R/C Bullet (pictured) and is completely handmade by record breaker Nic Case using specialised kit, a little like the construction of a Formula One car . Despite measuring 2ft (60cm) in length, the car is faster than some of the world’s most covetable supercars, including the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish and Bentley’s Continental Flying Spur – which certainly have speedy-sounding names - but have top speeds of 183mph. Audi's R8 has a top speed of 185mph. It is also a record breaker and is the world’s fastest radio controlled car, Autoblog reported. The Bullet car sounds like a full-sized power car as it zooms past so fast that if you blinked you might miss it. The car has carbon fibre wheels to withstand the forces created by high speeds, an incredibly aerodynamic body - which was tested in a wind tunnel - on top of its light-weight carbon fibre chassis and special tyres to supply the grip needed for a record-breaking run. The wedge shape helps it have enough down force to stay glued to the track at such high speeds and an all-wheel drive system gives it plenty of traction. Good things come in small packages: The fluorescent wedge-shaped remote controlled car is far from a standard toy as it has a blistering top speed of 188mph, which is faster than a £80,000 Audi R8 (pictured) It also has high speed motors and a long-range radio so it can complete long runs in a straight line to set its top speed, according to RC Groups. It was built by radio controlled car enthusiast Nic Case, 50 from Southern California, who is no stranger to setting records. Earlier versions of the Bullet reached almost 162mph (259km/h) in 2008 and 172mph (276km/h) in November 2013. He is now determined to power through the 200mph (322km/h) barrier.","Nic Case from Southern California drove the car on the record-breaking run .

"By . Deni Kirkova . and Katy Winter . There were scenes of hysteria at H&M in London today as shoppers queued overnight to get their hands on the newly unveiled Isabel Marant Pour H&M collection. Hundreds of eager fashion lovers snaked in a line down Kensington High Street as dawn broke this morning, some sitting on camping chairs and clutching flasks of coffee as they waited to be handed a precious wristband that would allow them 10 minutes in the store. Frenzied fashionistas flocked to H&Ms around the world for the global launch. Shoppers were kept in check in Tokyo stores where security was especially tight. Chloe - who was first in the queue from 3.30am - got everything she came for . Francity (left) and Christian stocked up on Marant goodies for friends and family, but missed out on boots . As is always the way with H&M's . celebrity collaborations, it was clear you had to get in quick. Shoppers . who had waited in line from 4am were left disappointed after missing . out on the Isabel Marant boots - one of the most popular items from the . collection. The much sought-after fringed . footwear sold out in every size in just 20 minutes in the High Street Kensington branch after doors flew open . following a countdown at 9am. The £149 boots are now on eBay for as . much as £410. Disappointed Francity, 27, and his brother Christian, 18, from Paddington, had waited in the freezing cold outside since the early hours of the morning. They were shopping on behalf of their sister Francita, 30, who had given them £800 and wanted a beaded . jacket, leather lace-up trousers and the coveted boots. Friends had also requested items from the brothers, who didn't want anything for themselves. The fervour surrounding the launch has . clearly not been over-hyped. Mammoth queues formed outside H&M . stores as early as last night as eager fans of the French fashion house braved chilly weather for the chance to grab a piece of the most anticipated collaboration of the high street store to date. With the shop doors yet to open the H&M website had already gone down due to unprecedented high demand, and remained out of action for hours, with a message telling customers they were in a queue and to 'try again'. The brothers queued from 4am but still missed out on two pairs of boots they wanted . The £149 boots are sure to fetch at least three times their RRP as demand soars . Outside the High Street Kensington store, Chloe, 25, an actress from London was first in line. She had been queueing since 3.30am. 'I'm freezing, I can't feel my feet, I'm starving,' she admitted. 'I've just had one cup of tea which I ran to get from McDonald's at 5am. I can't believe I've been doing this for six hours.' It was clearly all worth it as Chloe, an actress, managed to pick up everything she came for including jackets, boots and jumpers for herself and her mother. 'Mum wants a skirt and Aztec belt. We both buy mainline Isabel Marant, but I hope this will be good quality for the prices I think it will be,' she told MailOnline as she waited for doors to open. The hysteria builds as store staff and shoppers join in for a countdown before doors open at 9am . Shoppers queue outside H&M High Street Kensington at 8am this morning - some from 3.30am . Coffee cups and papers scatters the outside of the High Street Kensington H&M after shoppers run in to get their hands on Isabel Marant . Chloe, who has been wearing Marant since she was 19, has brought a credit card and didn't know how much she would spend, but plans to economise for the rest of month to allow her to snatch up the coveted pieces. But as the anticipation built, queuing etiquette began to fly out of the window. Alecyss attracted a huge amount of bile having arrived at 7.30am, hours after many eager shoppers, but somehow managed to progress ahead of Fenia who had been patiently waiting since 4am. Meanwhile in Japan and China, shoppers were kept tightly in line by uniformed security staff as they lined up in their hundreds clutching shopping bags in anticipation. Once let loose, fashionistas grabbed all they could get their hands on. Young shoppers rush for clothes for the launch of Maison Isabel Marant's collection in Tokyo, Japan .

While the rest of us need to sharpen our elbows and brave hours of sub-zero queuing, celebrities have already been spotted out in the new range. Sienna Miller was one of the lucky few invited to a preview of the one-off collection at the Regent Street branch on Wednesday night and she wasted no time in acquiring one of the designs. The mother-of-one, 31, looked cosy in a wool and alpaca multi-coloured hooded cardigan from the range, which she teamed with a fawn top and skinny jeans. The London preview came just 24 hours after celebrities attended the New York preview of the same collection. Eliciting much envy, Princess Victoria of Sweden stepped last week wearing several pieces from the yet-to-launch coveted collection.

"By . Associated Press . President Obama called on Monday for the international community to focus on ending the fighting in the Gaza Strip, as Secretary of State John Kerry headed to the Middle East to make a renewed push for a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel. Voicing fresh concern about civilian casualties, Obama reaffirmed his belief that Israel has the right to defend itself against rockets being launched by Hamas into Israel. Yet he contended that Israel's military action in Gaza had already done 'significant damage' to the Hamas terrorist infrastructure and said he doesn't want to see more civilians getting killed. Scroll down for video . President Obama made a statement on the situation in Ukraine and Gaza, at the White House today. He said there were 'serious concerns' about the rising number of both Palestinian and Israeli deaths . 'We have serious concerns about the . rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli . lives,' Obama said. 'And that is why it now has to be our focus and the . focus of the international community to bring about a ceasefire that . ends the fighting and can stop the deaths of innocent civilians, both in . Gaza and in Israel.' As Obama spoke from South Lawn of the White House, Kerry was flying to Cairo, where he planned to join diplomatic efforts to resume a truce that had been agreed to in November 2012. He will urge the militant Palestinian group to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting. More than 500 Palestinians and 27 Israelis have been killed in that time. The Obama administration, including Kerry, is sharpening its criticism of Hamas for its rocket attacks on Israel and other provocative acts, like tunneling under the border. At the same time, the U.S. is publicly encouraging Israel to take further steps to prevent Palestinian deaths. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Israel and its military have standards for avoiding the deaths of innocent civilians, Israeli or Palestinian. Palestinian medics carry a man injured in Gaza City's Shijaiyah neighborhood that came under fire as Israel widened its ground offensive against Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday . 'We would like to see Israel take greater steps to ensure that they're adhering to those standards,' he said. Two Americans, Max Steinberg of California and Nissim Carmeli of Texas, who fought for the Israel Defense Forces were killed in fighting in the Gaza Strip. The State Department confirmed the names of the two U.S. citizens Sunday night. Cairo's cease-fire plan is backed by the U.S. and Israel. But Hamas has rejected the Egyptian plan and is relying on governments in Qatar and Turkey for an alternative proposal. Qatar and Turkey have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is also linked to Hamas but banned in Egypt. Making the rounds of Sunday talk shows, Kerry said Hamas needs to recognize its own responsibility for the conflict. 'It's ugly. War is ugly, and bad things are going to happen,' Kerry told ABC. Both Obama and Kerry have said Israel has a right to defend itself Kerry accused Hamas of attempting to sedate and kidnap Israelis through a network of tunnels that militants have used to stage cross-border raids. Kerry said on CNN's State of the Union that Hamas must 'step up and show a level of reasonableness, and they need to accept the offer of a cease-fire'. The nearly two-week conflict appeared to be escalating as U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon was already in the region to try to revive cease-fire efforts. Obama, in a telephone call Sunday, told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Kerry was coming to the Mideast and condemned Hamas' attacks, according to a White House statement. The U.N. relief agency in Gaza estimates that 70,000 Palestinians have fled their homes in the fighting and are seeking shelter in schools and other shelters the United Nations has set up. U.S. officials said Hamas could bring relief to the Palestinian people if it agrees to a cease-fire proposed by Egypt - a view Netanyahu is pushing as well. Netanyahu said in an ABC interview that Israel has tried to avoid killing Palestinian civilians by making phone calls, sending text messages and dropping leaflets on their communities. But Hamas doesn't give a whit about the Palestinians,' Netanyahu said. 'All they want is more and more civilian deaths.' The prime minister said his top goal is to restore a sustainable peace, but he then will ask the international community to consider demilitarizing Gaza to rid Hamas of its rockets and shut down the tunnels leading into Israel. Smoke rises after an Israeli missile strike in Gaza City, in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday.

"By . Nick Enoch . OMG. It's one of the most popular phrases of the modern technological age used by just about every teenage girl in Western civilisation. However, it seems the 'Oh my God' initialism O.M.G. is actually very 'last century'. It dates back to 1917 when British admiral John Arbuthnot Fisher first penned the expression in a letter to Winston Churchill. Lord 'Jacky' Fisher, as he was known, had been writing about some 'utterly [upsetting]' World War I newspaper headlines. A copy of the letter British admiral John Arbuthnot Fisher sent to Winston Churchill in 1917 where he used the phrase 'O.M.G' which has now become popular among teenagers . He wrote: 'I hear that a new order of Knighthood is on the tapis — O.M.G (Oh! My! God!)— Shower it on the Admiralty!!' The phrase, added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2011, is the colloquial shorthand for 'Oh My God', generally used in conversations to express surprise, embarrassment, excitement and disgust, according to the Urban Dictionary. It is normally associated with teenage girls and the phrase was thought to have originated from online chat rooms, most commonly used in online games, web chats and in text messages. It is frequently heard on reality TV shows too, including The Only Way is Essex. Lord 'Jacky' Fisher (left), as he was known, used it in a letter to the famous wartime prime minister about some 'utterly [upsetting]' World War I newspaper headlines . And indeed, it is a far cry from the upper-class world of Lord Fisher who was one of the most celebrated officers in the history of the Royal Navy. Lord Fisher began his career during the Crimean War and ended it during the First World War. He is widely credited for materially preparing the fleet for war, introducing the world's first all-big-gun battleship Dreadnought. However, he resigned as First Sea Lord in 1915 after falling out with the then First Lord Winston Churchill over the commitment to the Dardanelles expedition. Such is the power of writing in the digital age, typing on screen has become a major force in driving the evolution of language. Expressions such as OMG and LOL are cropping up more frequently as actual speech, bringing with them added layers of meaning. Never before has so much typed language migrated towards the spoken word rather than vice versa, according to the New Scientist. For example, LOL (pronounced as 'doll') goes beyond the meaning of 'laughing out loud' when it is spoken. It suggests a sense of belonging to a . particular 'tribe' - in this instance, the digitally savvy. And it . builds on earlier web language spoken by those 'in the know', such as . use of the term 'dot.com' which has since passed into the mainstream. Meanwhile, LOL - now defined as 'laughing out loud' - was first used in the 1980s in bulletin board systems (BBS), which were early forums where geeks gathered to talk about computing. It was first recorded around this time on Usenet - a BBS established at the University of North Carolina and the neigbouring Duke University more than a decade before the World Wide Web was developed. All this is scant consolation for the millions of 'textlexic' Britons who are unable to understand the abbreviations sent to them in phone messages. Six in 10 adults admit they have . received a message which left them baffled, thanks to the ever-growing . dictionary of initials and phrases, according to research published last . October. Even people in powerful positions can become confused, as became clear when David Cameron told the Leveson Inquiry that he believed 'LOL' stood for 'lots of love'. A survey of 1,000 adults found that many were aware of 'LOL' and 'C U L8R', which means 'see you later'. Many now use text shorthand in all forms of writing, from emails to status updates on websites such as Facebook. Some over-50s are slipping the odd 'BTW' ('by the way') or 'IMHO' ('in my humble opinion') into their emails, the research for online security firm SecurEnvoy showed. But four in 10 adults fear the practice has become so common that children are not learning how to write English correctly. Text language, like using '4' instead of 'for' or 'OMG' for 'oh my God', developed when the earliest mobile phones only allowed 160 characters on a text. Although that restriction no longer exists, Twitter has a 140-character limit and many use textspeak in all forms of written communication today as if it was a normal part of language. SecurEnvoy boss Andy Kemshall said: 'A quarter of the population tend to use text words rather than normal English. 'It shows the impact that texting and the mobile phone has had on society. The tendency to shorten words has stuck around. 'Given that 60 per cent have received a text that they didn't understand because it contained text speak, perhaps it is a worrying trend and a source of confusion and miscommunication.'","Expression penned in 1917 by British admiral Lord Fisher regarding some upsetting WWI headlines .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 08:08 EST, 7 July 2011 . Facebook last night announced a deal with Skype that will add live video chat to the social networking site - marking the latest step-up in the battle against Google. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said it was an 'awesome' development for Skype as his company takes on the might of the internet search engine. Google last week launched its Google+ service, which also has a feature that allows video calls. The two companies are now locked in a head-to-head technological race. Scroll down for video . 'Something awesome': Mark Zuckerberg said that it's video chat service with Skype will lead the way with social networking . Until now Facebook users have been limited to instant text chat and the move to incorporate Skype takes their game to the next level. Both companies agreed the deal to allow video chat to be integrated into the site which will mean people can have 'face-to-face' conversations with just one click of the button. Mr Zuckerberg also revealed that one in . every nine people in the world now has a Facebook account, while its . number of users has shot up to 750million. Google+, which launched on June 28, includes video conferencing for up to 10 people on its application called Hangouts. The new service is currently open to people on an 'invitation only' basis whereas anybody can have a Facebook account and the latest move by the site could hamper the success of Google+. Skype boss Tony Bates said that seeing the product used in Facebook was 'really gratifying'. Let's chat: The image on invitations for the announcement show a face in a speech bubble, which have strengthen rumours of a new Skype feature . Rumours of the deal began with invitations for the event, which featured the picture of a face inside a speech bubble. The . move could dramatically increase the use of Skype, which currently has . 170 million active users compared to Facebook’s 750 million. Skype on Facebook chat is very easy to use - particularly if you are already adept at speaking to people through the instant messaging service. Before getting started you will have to go to facebook.com/videocalling and click the application to allow video calling. Users then open the chat box with the person the wish to speak and then click on a small 'video' icon at the top of the chat box next to the 'settings' icon. That then opens up a screen which sends a message saying that someone is trying to call and gives the person at the other end of the line the option of accepting or declining the call. Friends can then chat to one another, just like on Skype, but without any need for email addresses or passwords to be entered. The . partnership would bring Facebook closer to Microsoft, which is one of . its shareholders after investing $240m in the company in 2007 and bought Skype for $8.5 billion in May. Mr . Zuckerberg said during a visit to Facebook's Seattle office last week that the company had an imminent launch, but revealed scant . details. He said the project had been developed at the 40-person Seattle office, Facebook's only major engineering centre outside of its Palo Alto, California headquarters. Philip Su, a Facebook engineer who developed the capability for Skype video calls on the site, told PCMag.com that people who frequently use instant text chat will get prompts to try out video calling. He also said that there are new features in the pipeline but exactly what they are has not yet been decided. Calls to other Skype users will be free, as is currently the case, but there could be a revenue opportunity through charging for calls to landlines and mobile phones. This is a service that is currently available on Skype but whether users of the site would have to buy Facebook credits is currently being explored. Scott Miller, Skype's director of global business development, said that a 'high priority' was to add Skype to Facebook's mobile Apps but there is no time scale for this to happen. There has been speculation in technology blogs in recent weeks about various mobile products in development at Facebook, including the release of a long-awaited Facebook app for Apple's iPad and a specialised app for photo-sharing on the iPhone. Speculation: There are rumours that the 'awesome' launch could be a new product for iPad users . Facebook's Seattle office has made a . mark on the company's mobile efforts, playing a central role in the . development of Facebook's unified mobile site, unveiled in March.

"By . Bianca London . The victim of a vicious acid attack which left her facially scarred for life has revealed she has started dating again - and that she is ready to find love. Naomi . Oni first hit the headlines in 2012, when acid was thrown over her face, head and body by her former friend Mary Konye as she walked home from work. The devastating attack, which happened as she made her way through Dagenham, burned off the now 22-year-old's eyelids, eyebrows and some of her hair. Scroll down for video . Looking for love: Naomi Oni, who was the victim of an acid attack two years ago, is putting her ordeal behind her and is ready to find love. She opened up in an interview with Closer magazine and had a makeover . She was left disfigured, and facing a court case against Konye, also 21 at the time, who was wearing a niqab veil disguise at the time of the assault - and who was jailed for 12 years over the attack. Naomi, who was scarred for life, has revealed that catching sight of her reflection in the mirror made her feel suicidal - and thought that no man would ever want to marry her. And she has admitted that, two months after the attack, her boyfriend at the time ended their relationship and she was left worrying that no other man would ever find her attractive again. Since then, surgeons have painstakingly . rebuilt her features and it's given her a new lease on life - so much so, she has even started dating again. While her recent . relationship didn't work out, Naomi explains that she and the man in question are . still friends and that the relationship really boosted her confidence. Positive outlook: Naomi said that the man she was seeing looked past her scars to the person she is inside, making her realise the attack doesn't have to ruin her life . Speaking to Closer . magazine about her date, Naomi said: 'He said I was gorgeous and . completely took me by surprise - he approached me in the street and said . he'd read about my story and thought I was so inspirational that he . wanted to take me out. 'Things didn’t work out with the guy I was seeing and we’re just friends, but it’s boosted my self-esteem. 'I'm enjoying being single at the moment but I'm ready to fall in love again with the right person.' At the time of the attack Naomi, 21, described how, on her way home, she got off at her bus . stop in Dagenham, East London, and felt a ‘presence’ before turning to . see someone wearing a niqab. She . then felt a ‘massive splash’ as the acid was thrown at her, scarring her . for life and disfiguring her face, dissolving her hair and eyelashes . and burning her tongue as she screamed. Scarred for life: Naomi Oni, at the time aged 21, was walking home on December 30, 2012, when acid was thrown in her face by Mary Konye, also 21 . CCTV . footage obtained by police after the attack showed Konye following Naomi . as she left her job as a shop assistant in Victoria's Secret in . Westfield Shopping Centre, Stratford, East London. Konye was sentenced to 12 years in jail in March, with Judge David Radford telling Konye her 'deliberate' and 'wicked act' had been devastating to Naomi in . his sentencing at a London court. Police and prosecutors had said Konye was jealous of her friend's looks . and spent months hatching a plan for the attack following a trivial . argument. The court heard that Konye told a . friend she planned to have her raped and wanted to disfigure Naomi, . saying: ‘I’m going to mess up the one thing that girl has – her looks.’ Former friend: Konye, left, was sentenced to 12 years in jail in March with Judge David Radford telling Konye her 'deliberate' and 'wicked act' had been devastating to Naomi Oni, right, in his sentencing . Konye even went as far as to claim in court that Naomi had asked her to throw the acid over her in a bid to copy burns victim Katie Piper, who had acid thrown in her face in 2008. Konye and Naomi had been friends since secondary school, but suffered a vicious . fallout in April 2011 when Naomi allegedly accused Konye of texting . her boyfriend and called her an 'ugly monster'. Naomi says she is glad that her former friend got a long prison term but adds that it doesn't change what happened. She told Closer: 'When I saw my . face, I couldn’t stop crying. I thought, ""Who’s going to want to marry . me like this?"" I felt so low, I didn’t want to live.' Despite her ordeal, Naomi is set on pursuing a career within the fashion and beauty industry and is enjoying single life. She added: 'The guy I was seeing looked past my scars to the person I am inside. It made me realise the attack doesn’t have to ruin my life.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A massive 400-foot deep sinkhole that has opened up in a Louisiana bayou has swallowed all of the 100-foot trees in the surrounding area and led to mandatory evacuations. About 150 people have been ordered to leave their residences after the 400-sqaure-foot gaping hole opened in Assumption Parish amid fears of potential radiation leaks and natural gas explosions. But despite the authorities enacting the mandatory evacuation, most people have decided to stay following allegations of a cover-up and industrial mis-management from the owners of a nearby salt cavern. Diesel sheen is seen on the water in an aerial view of the sinkhole. State officials said on that small amounts of diesel hydrocarbons were found in swamp water where an acre of swampland liquefied over the last week . As state scientists monitored the toxicity of naturally occurring radiation at a slurry hole in Assumption Parish, residents said Thursday they were furious with their public state officials because they think they have been withholding information. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality said the slurry hole near Bayou Corne is near areas that have been used for oil and gas exploration. Low levels of radioactivity may be remaining from the work, though not at harmful levels, officials say. 'Out of abundance of caution and because of the ongoing incident, I have decided to further enhance our monitoring efforts,' DEQ Secretary Peggy Hatch said in a statement. Officials said the first set of 15 samples from the area show that there are no detectable levels of naturally occurring radioactive material on the surface of the sinkhole and Hatch says they're confident residents aren't at risk for exposure. Bubbles come to the surface where pipelines come across Bayou Corne and a pipeline sign is seen on the right . Department spokesman Rodney Mallett said such material tends to accumulate in low levels on equipment used to drill for oil and gas. Gas bubbles have been erupting in the area for weeks. Residents have been especially alarmed at the possibility of a natural gas explosion after 28 residents in Grand Bayou had to evacuate their homes on Christmas 2003 because natural gas was seeping from a salt dome storage cavern and bubbling up into water wells. Residents have also been reporting earthquakes but despite a battery of tests conducted by federal, parish and local officials, no one has been able to figure out the source of the tremors. Randy Rousseau, who lives in Grand Bayou and owns a body shop in Belle Rose, said he's noticed tremors for years. He eventually moved out of his house because he didn't feel safe and has been unable to sell it because the property value plummeted after several small sinkholes opened up in his yard. The massive sinkhole has caused the governor to order the evacuation of 150 residents from the parish . Scientists said at a community meeting Tuesday the sinkhole might be related to a brine cavern owned by Houston-based Texas Brine Co. contained within an underground salt dome. It has been reported that local officials at Texas Brine have known since at least January 2011 that there have been problems with the structural integrity of a brine cavern that was plugged in June 2010. Officials did not mention those issues at the meeting. 'It's what I've been saying all along, that they've been hiding things,' Rousseau said. 'I think our local officials are trying to do the best they can, but I think they're being hindered by the higher-ups hiding things.' Rousseau said he was especially worried after a parish official had him fill out a form asking him to list his next of kin Thursday morning. 'That's a little disturbing to me. They said it's in case they can't reach us to evacuate. But I mean, come on. They can reach everyone,' he said. Rep. Joe Harrison, R-Napoleonville, said he wants more transparency and answers from the Office of Conservation. He said he had no idea about structural issues within the brine cavern until he read about them in the paper. Before: The sinkhole was much smaller last Thursday, pictured . 'There is a serious lack of competence now in the state, and we knew nothing. Nothing. Why did they close the mine? We didn't get any answers. It's a real lack of competence now,' Harrison said. Sonny Cranch, spokesman for Texas Brine, said they're continuing to monitor the area for any changes. 'We've installed booms around the perimeter of the sinkhole to contain any floating contaminants, the diesel, anything else,' Cranch said. Dr. Madhurendu Kumar, director of the state Department of Natural Resources' oil and gas division, said the sinkhole could have been caused by structural problems within the salt dome that sits underneath it. The wall of salt between the brine cavern and the salt dome might be thinner than experts were led to believe, he said. He said this sinkhole was unusual because it sits on the edge of the dome, when sinkholes normally sit right on top. Some residents in the area said that they had been experiencing tremors for years before the enormous sinkhole opened up . Officials said the sinkhole, which has swallowed up and liquefied a 372-foot wide circle of swampland, has not grown in size since Saturday. The owners of four natural gas pipelines nearby were asked to depressurize and vent off their pipelines as a precaution after the slurry area bent a 400-foot-long section of pipeline. Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Friday in Assumption Parish and ordered an immediate evacuation of 150 homes and several businesses. The evacuation remains in effect. Officials said on Friday it will be at . least 40 days before they get definitive answers about an enormous . sinkhole that opened up in Assumption Parish. Mark Cartwright, president of United Brine Services, a subsidiary of . Texas Brine Co., said the company spent the last week 'intensely . focused' on an emergency response as they try to figure out the cause . behind a sinkhole near Bayou Corne. Low levels of radioactivity may be emanating, though not at harmful levels, officials said . Cartwright said they'll be drilling a relief well to investigate a . brine cavern they own, which is housed within the Napoleonville salt . dome. It will take at least 40 days to drill the well, and scientists . have speculated that the 372-foot-wide and 422-foot-deep sinkhole might . be related to structural problems within the cavern, he said. 'Our efforts are going to be more focused on diagnostics, and looking . into what caused this event,' Cartwright said at a press conference in . Gonzales. Commissioner of Conservation Jim Welsh ordered the company Thursday . to drill a well and investigate the salt cavern and 'further evaluate . potential causes of the subsidence near its well site,' as well as . obtain samples of cavern content. Cartwright said the company was just as shocked as anyone else when . the sinkhole erupted last Friday, swallowing up an acre of bald cypress . trees and leaving diesel fumes and slurry water in its wake.","Fears that low levels of radiation are being emitted from the sinkhole and residents are being asked to leave .

"By . Jaya Narain . Tragic: Henry Tattersall was found hanged in his bedroom after racking up a large bill for Xbox games on his mother's credit card . A schoolboy of 13 hanged  himself after he racked up a £420 bill on his mother’s credit card by downloading games on to his Xbox, an inquest heard. Henry Tattersall borrowed the card to buy computer games over four days, as a Christmas present to himself. When the bank statement arrived in the post his mother Eve confronted him over the amount of money he had spent. The teenager later went to his bedroom and did not respond when he was called down to dinner. His 16-year-old sister Holly went up to get him and found her brother hanged in his room. Despite efforts to resuscitate him he was later pronounced dead. The youngster was found to have written on his Facebook page 15 minutes before he was discovered: ‘I’m going to kill myself.’ Henry was the second pupil from the same school to kill himself in just six months. Classmate Declan Gatenby, 13, was found hanged in July last year after a row with his parents over their confiscation of his mobile phone. The pair had both been at Fearns Community College, in Bacup, Lancashire, although Henry – who was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) – moved to Brambles East special school, in nearby Darwen, in September. An inquest was told the credit card statement arrived in the post at the family home in Rossendale, on November 25 last year while Henry was at school. Miss Tattersall, 35, told the hearing: ‘I personally believe that Henry was very shocked at the amount of money he had spent. He was upset that I was upset. He was upset that he had spent the money and we weren’t in a position to be able to afford that amount of money. He spent £422 over four days on it.’ Scroll down for video . Fanatic: Henry was devoted to Burnley FC, whose staff lined the streets for his funeral . Tributes: Henry's family described him as 'cheeky, funny and impulsive' after his death . Many parents have complained of unexpectedly high bills inadvertently incurred by their children's digital purchases. Parents frequently link their credit cards to online accounts on mobile phones, tablets and games consoles, not knowing that children can then use the cards to buy games and add-ons for hundreds or even thousands of pounds. In Henry Tattersall's case, his Xbox account was apparently linked to his mother's card, meaning he could download expensive games with no restrictions. Another common mistake made by parents is to download an apparently free mobile app, not knowing that their children can make in-game purchases using a Google or Apple account. A study released last year revealed that parents had lost £30million thanks to children's unauthorised purchases. The Office of Fair Trading launched an investigation into the lack of protection for parents whose children accidentally rack up huge bills following a number of high-profile examples. Eight-year-old Theo Rowland-Fry, from Bristol, spent nearly £1,000 on additional features for a Simpsons game which he was playing on the family iPad. And Danny Kitchen, five, racked up a bill of £1,700 on a zombie game which was supposed to be free. Costing anything between £4 and £50 each, online video games can be downloaded to an Xbox and played immediately. Miss . Tattersall said she could hear Henry talking out of his upstairs . bedroom window to a friend at 4.20pm on the day he died, but that he did . not respond when she called him down for his dinner at 5pm. As well . as Henry’s Facebook message there was a discussion on the social media . site between some of his friends about Declan Gatenby’s grave. Detective . Inspector Jim Elston said there was no evidence from Henry’s phone that . he had been bullied or had researched suicide methods prior to his . death. Coroner Richard Taylor recorded a verdict of misadventure, adding that he believed Henry ‘intended to be found’. He . said: ‘I am always suspicious and sceptical as to the intentions of . children of such a young age as to whether or not they actually . understand what’s going to happen to them. Leaving his door open? It . strikes me that he had a very guilty conscience, but he clearly dwelt on . this and was upset at what happened. ‘Maybe the conversation on . Facebook about Declan Gatenby’s grave meant it was a spur-of-the-moment . decision … I believe that he hoped to make a point and expected to be . found. I don’t believe it was his intention to end his life.’ Miss Tattersall said: ‘Henry’s death was a complete waste. ‘The . Henry I’m holding on to is the one running up the front steps, face . beaming, with two bags of Christmas shopping and his pupil of the week . award … [he] has left a massive hole in the family that cannot be . filled.’ For confidential . support call the Samaritans in the UK on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A computer virus that steals bank details and empties money from accounts has been found on Facebook. Eric Feinberg, who controls the U.S National Football League Facebook page, discovered the malicious links were being posted on his brand's page by fake profiles. The links are believed to be controlled by the Russian Business Network - an online criminal gang accused of stealing internet users' identities and private information. Fake Facebook profiles were found to be posting malicious links to brand pages such as the U.S National Football League page. When these links were clicked on it would install a computer virus called the Zeus Banking Trojan onto the user's PC . The Zeus Trojan is a computer virus that gets its name from the Trojan horse the Greeks used to enter the city of Troy undetected in order to ransack the city. It hides in malicious links, attachments and on infected web pages. When a person clicks these links or visits the webpage the Trojan horse is installed on their computer. It then sits undetected ready to strike. Zeus can scans all the personal files and steal any private information. The . malware is also able to collect login details, even if they aren't . stored in documents on your PC, using keystroke logging. Keystroke logging, also known as keylogging, can record which keys on a keyboard are being pressed. Zeus can then wait until the user types in their online banking address and login details and steal them. Once they have the logins, the cybercriminals can enter your online accounts and steal your money. The link discovered by Feinberg was for a page called 'Bring the N.F.L to Los Angeles'. The page has since been removed. Security firm Trend Micro claim that there may be many more hidden on pages, or even being spread inadvertently by Facebook friends. When a Facebook user clicks the links the Trojan - which gets its name from the Trojan horse the Greeks used to enter the city of Troy undetected - is installed on their computer. It then scans all the personal files and steals any private information. The malware is also able to collect login details, even if they aren't stored in documents on your PC, by using keystroke logging. Keystroke logging, also known as keylogging, can record which keys on a keyboard are being pressed. It can then wait until the user types in their online banking address and login details and steal them. The Zeus Trojan uses keylogging to record every key that is pressed on a person's keyboard. When the user enters an internet banking address and login details, the Trojan can steal them, sign into the account and drain all the money . To avoid falling victim to the Zeus malware don't ever click on unknown links. If you want to check a link's source, copy and paste it into a site such as URL X-ray. The site safely shows you the intended destination of a link. If you're unsure about its safety - don't click it. Install antivirus security on your PC and on your mobile devices, such as Lookout or AVG. To avoid people gaining access to your internet banking accounts, sign up for two-step verification. Each time you login a unique code will be sent to you separately - as a text message for example. This means even if someone has your login details, they won't be able to access the unique code. Once they have the logins, the cybercriminals can enter your online accounts and steal your money. It is a six-year-old malware program that has seen a resurgence recently on Facebook and other social network sites. The Zeus Trojan, also known as ZBOT, has infected millions of computers worldwide - with reports claiming 3.6 million are in the U.S alone - and can sit in the background dormant and virtually undetected. In a blog post, Trend Micro claimed that incidents of the Zeus have risen steadily this year and peaked last month. The Zeus virus traditionally targets computers running Windows. Security experts at Kaspersky Lab also discovered five new variants of the Zeus trojan that specifically affect BlackBerry and Android devices last year. This means that if a malicious link is clicked via the Facebook app or mobile site on these devices, the owner may still be at risk. A spokesperson for Facebook said that the site actively scans for malware and offers various security options including the Scan-and-Repair Malware scan that can search for and remove malware from mobile devices.","The virus, called the Zeus Banking Trojan, is being hidden on Facebook in infected links .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . A holiday weekend turned to tragedy Friday night when four people died and dozens were injured after three boats collided near a Miami marina after a Fourth of July fireworks display. Witnesses reported seeing bodies flying through the air and tossed overboard from the impact of the collision that killed Andrew Garcia, Tori Dempsey, Kelsie Karpiak and another unidentified individual. One survivor Catherine Payan, 24, still remains unresponsive in a nearby hospital. Tragedy: Kelsie Karpiak (left) and Tori Dempsey (right) both died as a result of the horror crash . Unthinkable: Andrew Garcia (left) was found dead in the water by his father. Catherine Payan (right) miraculously survived but is unresponsive in a hospital bed . The horrific scene unfolded after . 10.30pm after the three boats, including a 36-foot yacht collided in . what authorities called a 'mad dash' for the marina. The other two boats . were smaller fishing-type watercrafts, said police. Multiple . law enforcement agencies responded to the crash Friday night near the . Dinner Key Marina in Miami, with officers plucking several people out of . the water. Garcia, an avid fisherman and boater, is believed to have been behind the wheel of the vessel carrying Karpiak and Payan, as well as another female, when it slammed into another boat, police sources told WSVN. He was instantly ejected into the water as the boat ricocheted into another one - his body was found in the harbor along with Dempsey's, police said. Payan sustained severe head trauma, sources told WSVN, her long-term prognosis is not known. Rescuers . were alerted by one of the boaters at about 10:45pm He said he'd . been hit by another vessel and that his 36-foot pleasure craft was . taking on water, authorities said. 'We kept getting report after report of more people in the water,' Miami Fire Rescue Lt. Ignatius Carroll said during a press briefing. Destroyed: one of the boats in the collision sustained heavy damage . Helping hand: That same boat had to be towed to shore . Mobbed with emergency responders: Firefighters, paramedics and police flooded the scene late last night . The chaotic scene only grew worse as police had trouble determining how many people were actually in the water. 'The numbers kept growing and growing,' said Carroll. Eight people were initially transported to Miami hospitals. Garcia's father aided in the search for his son. 'I’ve paid the ultimate price, I’m out on my boat looking for my son’s body,' his father Jack Garcia texted a WFOR reporter. Jack Garcia is a retired fire boat captain from Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue. Carroll detailed the manic search and rescue effort in the moments after the crash in comments reported by the Miami Herald. EMTs were simultaneously performing CPR on three people as shouts of more bodies in the water kept calling out. Boats were going back and forth from water to land with people scooped to safety. 'We had boats motorcading back and forth bringing in injured people,' said Carroll. 'They were out there in the dark. What was really challenging was you don’t know how many people were on the boats. In a hurry: Emergency workers carry an injured person on a stretcher on Friday night, July 4, 2014 after three boats collided near a Miami marina around the end of a fireworks display . Medivac: Emergency workers bring another injured person to a helicopter for quick transport to a hospital . Lucky to be alive: Emergency workers treat a handful of the dozens injured in ambulances away from the docks . 'There were people who were traumatized, injured, confused,' said Carroll. 'We weren’t getting accurate counts of people. We were trying to determine, did we have everybody? And then we found out there was still a possibility two people were still missing'. The boaters are believed to have been taking in a fireworks display a short time earlier. 'My understanding is they may have been out there enjoying the fireworks display, and typically after the fireworks are over, everyone makes a mad dash for the nearest marina,' said Jorge Pino, a public information officer with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. However, Pino cautioned that the exact circumstances were still under investigation. Carroll recounted how anxious relatives waited for news of their loved ones at the dock. One man, he recalled, worried about his two grandchildren. Both arrived safely to shore. 'We were relieved to be able to let him know that they were OK,' Carroll said. Karpiak was a cheerleader during high school and even performed in the 2007 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, according to the Miami Herald.","Andrew Garcia, Tori Dempsey, Kelsie Karpiak and another individual were killed after being thrown from their boats .

"By . Matt Blake . An outraged son has told how his 95-year-old mother begged to die as she spent her last day alive waiting for an ambulance in agony - for almost four hours. Devastated Eric Dennington, 73, said he felt totally helpless as he could do nothing for his dying mother Nora except try to reassure her that paramedics were on their way. But as the hours ticked by with still no sign of help, her crippling abdominal pains grew worse until all she could do was cry out:  'I just want to die.' Ambulance chiefs have now apologised to him after carrying out an investigation into the heartbreaking incident. Write caption here . Mr Dennington said: 'She had agonising stomach pain and we were told the ambulance would be a blue light job and would be with her very quickly. 'But by the time she got to hospital it was nearly four hours. 'No-one should have to wait for an ambulance that length of time in any circumstances. 'I was disgusted.' The furious pensioner added: 'I couldn't do anything for her and it was difficult for her to move because she was in such pain. 'I couldn't give her anything. I'm not a medical man and as far as I knew the ambulance would be there any minute. 'When the reception rang to see where the ambulance was they were told it was on its way.' Mr Dennington, of Trimley St Mary, near Ipswich, Suffolk, said that when the 999 vehicle finally arrived it was a St John Ambulance. Happy memories: Eric with his mother Nora in 2005. Ambulance chiefs have now apologised to him after carrying out an investigation into the heartbreaking incident . And in a new cruel blow the crew were not able to administer the crucial morphine his mother so desperately needed. The distressed family was then forced to wait further as a paramedic was called. 'We keep reading of similar cases and . the situation doesn't seem to get any better,' said Mr Dennington, who . worked at East Anglian Building Supplies, Felixstowe, for 20 years. 'I feel very let down.' As . well as making a formal complaint to East of England Ambulance Service . NHS Trust, he has also written to his MP Therese Coffey to voice his . concern and demand action. An ambulance was called at 3.31pm but not sent until 6.36pm. It eventually arrived at Mrs Dennington's Deben View care home in Woodbridge, Suffolk, just after 7pm. There . was then a further nine-minute delay until a paramedic could arrive and . after that Mrs Dennington was taken to Ipswich Hospital. Ambulance chiefs say crew rotas are to . be revised to increase cover in the county following concerns about . demand outweighing resources. An . East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust spokeswoman said in Mrs . Dennington's case the doctor's receptionist said 'the doctor had asked . for an ambulance within an hour but did not request an emergency . vehicle, simply transport'. The hour-deadline was not met because the service was so busy, she said. But . officials did call to check on Mrs Dennington's condition twice during . the delay and were told she had not worsened and had no critical . symptoms. 'We have written . to the complainant with a full apology and the results of an . investigation conducted into this incident,' said the spokeswoman. 'This was a request for non-emergency transport to hospital based on a GP's assessment that the patient had stomach pain and no critical symptoms. 'Occasionally demand outweighs resource and regrettably this was one of those times' - Spokeswoman, East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust . 'Due to workload with patients in greater immediate need we did not pick up the patient within the hour requested but made regular calls to check her symptoms hadn't worsened.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . The father of a Connecticut man who admitted to killing his mother at Christmastime has questioned how his emotionally troubled son was able to seriously harm himself while he was supposed to be on suicide watch. Robert Rankin said state officials told him last month that his 23-year-old son Robert Owen Rankin - known as Bobby - had an ‘accident’ and jumped over a second-floor railing last month. Dennis McMahon, the young Rankin’s attorney, said officials told him it was a suicide attempt. Scroll down for video . Rankin, pictured in a previous court appearance, was put on suicide watch, but last month he managed to jump over a second-floor railing and almost killed himself . A 2012 file photo of Margaret Rohner and her son Bobby Rankin, who the day after Christmas 2013 viciously killed her with a fireplace poker . ‘I’m very concerned with the fact he was on suicide watch and how he ended up in this situation,’ the elder Rankin said on Tuesday, following his son’s latest court appearance. Bobby Rankin, who is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia, appeared in Middletown Superior Court in a wheelchair, wearing a metal halo on his head and a cast on his right arm. McMahon said his client damaged three cervical discs in the fall, which he said could have killed his client. McMahon said Bobby Rankin told him that he attempted to kill himself because he wanted to see his late mother, 45-year-old Margaret Rohner. Bobby Rankin is facing a murder charge but has yet to enter a plea. His case was postponed on Tuesday until June 3. McMahon said he wants to get his client independently evaluated by a psychiatrist, adding how he didn’t think his client understands what is happening to him. Robert Rankin, 23, confessed to police that he awoke the morning after Christmas Day and then viciously slaughtered his own mother. This is the last picture of the Connecticut man, posted to Facebook on Christmas Day . Slaughtered: Margaret Rohner was allegedly disemboweled by her own son on the day after Christmas and found naked and sliced open at the bottom of the stairs of her own Deep River, Connecticut home . McMahon said his client is being housed at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution, where he is being treated in the prison hospital and receiving ‘very good medical care.’ During Tuesday’s court appearance, Bobby Rankin softly answered yes to a couple of the judge’s questions. He no longer has the bushy beard he wore at his arraignment. Police have said Bobby Rankin admitted to viciously attacking Rohner on Dec. 26 with a fireplace poker and knife, leaving her eviscerated body in the living room of her Deep River home. ‘I don't know exactly what the stuff . was, like octopus tentacles,’ he would coolly recount to police. ‘I . killed my mother because she is pretty much responsible for everything . that has gone wrong in my life.’ Rankin said he woke up with a plan to snap his mother’s neck, reports NBC Connecticut. He said she began to scream as soon as he'd wrapped his arms around her throat. Police swarmed the home Deep River, Connecticut home after 1pm on December 26 and encountered a grisly scene . 'I don't know exactly what the stuff was, like octopus tentacles': Police asked Rankin what he'd pulled from his mother after slicing her open and his response was chilling . Shocking: Rankin (left) said he disemboweled his mother (right) because she 'is pretty much responsible for everything that has gone wrong in my life.' At left, a photo of Rankin was posted to Rohner's Facebook wall with the caption, 'My great kid Bobby Rankin and I had a good day today!' When that didn’t work, he said he fetched a fire poker and hit or stabbed her in the neck before continuing to choke her. She still clung to life, however. Before continuing the slaughter, Rankin said he removed his clothes to ‘gain additional strength.’ Rankin described to police his mother’s ‘fighting, punching and screaming’ during the attack and as he returned to his bedroom to get a knife and finish her off. He said he stabbed her at the belly button with a buck knife and sliced upwards. Once she 'stopped screaming,' Rankin said he then removed his mother's clothes. ‘I just want you to know that she put up a damn good fight,’ court documents say Rankin told his father. ‘ She is a strong woman.  I give her credit for that.’ Bizarre: Rankin said he pulled out his mother's intestines and stomach 'see if there was a baby' Police say Rankin coolly recounted the gruesome tale after first confessing to his father Robert Rankin Sr, who then called Connecticut State Troopers . Disgusting: Rohner was found naked and disemboweled at the bottom of the stairs of her home . Along with blood thirsty rage came a bizarre curiosity. Rankin said he pulled out his mother’s intestines ‘like octopus tentacles’ in order to ‘see if there was a baby.’ After he killed her, he told police, he took a shower and walked the dog. Police would later find Rohner’s carved up naked body and the bottom of some stairs. Her entrails were found in a wood stove in the home and in a bucket beside the stove, according to court documents. After hearing the confession, Rankin’s father Robert Rankin Jr. called 911 around 1pm. ‘My son killed my ex-wife,’ the father said according to courant.com. '[She has a] big hole in her gut.' Scary: Police found intestines in the home's wood stove and in a bucket beside the stove . ‘I used the knife to kill my mother’: Police arrested Rankin at his home and took the buck knife he confesses he used to kill his mother . Rankin would soon back up his father’s story. ‘I used the knife to kill my mother,’ he told police, who then confiscated the buck knife. The trooper asked Rankin if anyone else had been involved. 'It was all me,' he said. According to courant.com, Rankin remained emotionless as he was questioned by police. 'I will tell you anything you want to know,' he said. 'I tried to make my mother responsible for the terrible things she has done.' Rankin was arrested and charged with murder. 'You were a beautiful loving caring person you will be truly missed fly with the angels,' reads a touching note posted along with the Facebook photo during an inconceivable tragedy . Friends of Rohner have described how . the divorced mother struggled to find appropriate mental health care for . her only son, who developed psychiatric problems about four years ago. Friends . also said Rohner had told officials at River Valley Services, a . state-run voluntary respite program for adults, that her son was not . taking his psychiatric medications and had asked that he be . hospitalized. The friends said River Valley staff told Rohner that they wanted to wait until after Christmas to address the issues. Robert . Rankin picked up the couple’s son a couple days before Christmas to . take him home for the holidays. He said he wasn’t warned by staff about . any issues concerning Bobby Rankin. Bobby Rankin’s case comes as state lawmakers consider ways to improve mental health services for young adults. A . task force on Tuesday voted on a list of recommendations for the . General Assembly to consider. But considering the legislature is set to . adjourn on May 7, it’s unclear how many, if any, will be approved this . year. Creepy: Rankin allegedly told police he tried to kill his mother first by choking and with a fire poker. When that didn't work, he said he removed his clothes to 'gain additional strength' before finishing the job .","Robert Rankin awoke the day after Christmas last year intent on murdering his mother in their Connecticut home .

"By . Jason Groves, Deputy Political Editor . Education Secretary Michael Gove has come under fire from the Lib Dems over funding for new school places . David Cameron was under pressure to intervene in a bitter row between Michael Gove and Nick Clegg last night, amid warnings it is overshadowing the Government’s record on education. A Whitehall source said the Department for Education had become ‘completely dysfunctional’ following clashes between Mr Gove and his Lib Dem deputy David Laws. The latest row saw the Lib Dems brand the Education Secretary an ‘ideologically obsessed zealot’ yesterday after it emerged he had transferred £400million from a fund for providing school places into his free schools project. It follows a clash last week when allies of Mr Gove accused Mr Clegg and Mr Laws of ‘lying’ over funding for their own pet project – free school meals for infant school pupils. Labour yesterday said parents would be appalled by ministers fighting each other rather than tackling the challenges facing the education system. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: ‘The Education Department is playing party politics between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats when they should be focusing on the education of our young people.’ David Cameron yesterday dismissed the row, but Downing Street is understood to be growing frustrated by the damaging headlines emerging from the department. A Government source said: ‘The sad thing is we have got a good story to tell on schools and that message is being lost.’ Other insults in the ongoing clashes included a baseless story that David Cameron’s 17-year marriage was on the rocks, allegedly spread by Lib Dems. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured with wife Miriam, has been accused of 'lying' about his free school lunches policy by a former aide to Mr Gove . Former education aide Dominic Cummings . branded Mr Clegg ‘self-obsessed, dishonest and revolting’. For his part, . the Deputy Prime Minister called Mr Cummings a ‘loopy ideologue’. Lib . Dem sources leaked details to friendly newspapers yesterday of the . £400million transfer by Mr Gove at the end of last year. The money from . the Basic Need fund, which helps councils to increase the number of . school places, was put towards meeting an £800million overspend in the . free schools budget. Lib Dem sources claim the move was opposed by Mr Laws and could jeopardise up to 30,000 new places. A . source described the move as ‘nothing short of lunacy’, adding: . ‘Michael Gove is so ideologically obsessed with his free school . experiment, he’s willing to see children struggle to get suitable school . places.’ A spokesman for Mr Gove dismissed the claims, pointing out . that the creation of free schools will create thousands of school . places. ‘From 2015, funding to councils for new school places will . rise by more than £200million a year,’ the spokesman said. ‘On top of . this, investment in free schools will provide tens of thousands of new . places in areas of need.’ The department split is so severe that . officials were yesterday unable to give an official statement on the . issue. It is understood one was vetoed by Mr Laws, leaving both sides to . brief their versions to the media. The Lib Dems, who backed free . schools, have stepped up attacks on Mr Gove and the project after polls . revealed thousands of teachers have deserted the party for Labour. A major coalition row has erupted over the fate of £400million for extra school places.","Education Secretary accused of using money to plug hole in free schools .

"By . Jason Groves . Pupils at one of Britain’s top public schools were facing investigation last night after being heard hurling abuse at David Cameron during a social event in the grounds of Westminster Abbey. Boys from £32,000-a-year Westminster School were heard shouting an obscene word at the Prime Minister as he gave a speech on tackling Islamic extremism in the grounds below their dormitory. The incident occurred as Mr Cameron delivered a short speech to the centre-right Policy Exchange think tank in College Garden, behind Westminster Abbey. Westminster School, where Nick Clegg was once a pupil, dormitories back directly onto the walled garden. Privileged: Pupils at the £32,0000-a-year Westminster School were heard shouting obsence words at the Prime Minister while he gave a speech below their dormitories . As the Prime Minister laid out the Government’s plans for tackling the threat posed by violent extremists a boy was heard shouting ‘a******’ at him from a dormitory window. Shocked witnesses, who included ministers, MPs and policy advisers,  said the insult was repeated more than once. One boy at the school was also heard shouting ‘Bedroom Tax b*****ds’ at Mr Cameron as he left the event on Wednesday evening. The taunt is a reference to the Government’s Spare Room Subsidy, which requires council house tenants to pay a premium for having a spare bedroom if they do not wish to move to smaller accommodation. It is unclear how many pupils were involved. One eye-witness said: ‘There was a shout mid-speech and one as he was leaving. The Prime Minister carried on during his speech without missing a beat really. It came from a male student who was watching from a window of the school.’ But another witness thought at least two boys heckled the Prime Minister. Westminster School is one of the most prestigious in the country and has a long connection with politics, having educated seven prime ministers over the centuries. Nick Clegg is a former pupil. The schools head master Stephen Spurr last night voiced dismay at the incident and pledged to investigate. Unfazed: Mr Cameron was said to have ignored the taunt and carried on his speech . He told the Daily Mail: ‘I will be investigating this matter. The pupils at this school are enormously interested in politics but they are also very courteous and like to listen. ‘They are willing to express their views but I will be very upset if they have been shouting out. I send my apologies to the Prime Minister and anyone else who was disconcerted.’ Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg last night condemned the abuse, which he said would have dismayed the philosopher John Locke, a Westminster old boy. Mr Rees-Mogg said: ‘People in a democracy are entitled to make their points of course, but it seems terribly bad manners to shout abuse at the Prime Minister. Then again, this is the school that produced Nick Clegg.’ Another Tory MP, who was present at the event, said: ‘It is pretty ironic that privileged kids at a £30,000-a-year school are shouting about the bedroom tax. I imagine their parents would be more worried about the idea of a window tax.’ A Downing Street source said that at least one shout was heard from the school during the Prime Minister’s speech, but insisted it was ‘not a matter of much consequence’. The first interruption came as Mr Cameron, who was educated at rival school Eton, was making the case for taking on the Islamic extremism blamed for fostering terrorism. ‘There were those on the last government and before that who seemed to think it was ok to tolerate extremist language, extremist rhetoric, extremist mindsets as long as you never tolerated violent extremism.,’ he said. ‘It’s almost like saying it’s ok with the BNP, it’s only Combat 18 (a neo-Nazi organisation) you have to worry about. ‘We don’t accept fascists in this country so we shouldn’t accept that argument when it comes to Islamic extremism in our country.’","Schoolboys heard shouting during speech on tackling Islamic extremism .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Chicago appears like a city in the clouds in this stunning photograph taken by a passenger from his plane window. Plane enthusiast and amateur photographer Mark Hersch captured the jaw-dropping scene of the city silhouetted in Lake Michigan from his seat on a Chicago-bound flight making its final approach. The late-afternoon image shows the low sun casting a golden glow on the water, which is visible beneath cloud cover. Stunning: Chicago appears like a kingdom in the clouds in this picture taken by plan passenger Mark Hersch of the city silhouette reflected on Lake Michigan . The buildings of the Windy City cast long shadows out into the water - while closer inspection reveals another passenger jet near the centre of the picture. Mark said the image is straight out of the camera, without use of image manipulation. 'I was flying home to Chicago from a business trip recently,' he said. 'It was a cloudy day, late in the afternoon. We were flying eastbound, made a pass by O'Hare International Airport, then made a sweeping 180-degree left turn over Lake Michigan for our final westward approach into the airport. Chicago, as seen from closer to ground level, was captured from an unusual angle through a break in the clouds by Mark Hersch . Mesmeric: The stunning picture of Chicago's skyscrapers, left, reflected onto Lake Michigan was taken by Mark Hersch, right, on his iPhone . 'I looked down and through a narrow break in the clouds, I saw the shadow of the Chicago skyline projecting onto the lake. Oddly enough, I am a very frequent flyer and almost always sit in an aisle set, but on this flight there were only window seats available. 'I grabbed my iPhone and snapped off a single shot, hoping I captured the scene. When I got home I opened the photo on my computer. Not only was I amazed at the shot, but I noticed I also captured another plane on a parallel approach - which you can see if you look closely at the clouds above the skyline in the centre of the image. 'My only regret is that the image is not as sharp as I would like; it's merely an iPhone capture, after all. Ironically, I am an avid amateur photography enthusiast, with some pretty expensive pro equipment.’",Mark Hersch glanced out of the cabin window in time to see the amazing optical illusion .
"By . Sarah Johnson . and Harriet Arkell . A father-of-five who ran a massive international sham marriage operation from his suburban family home has been jailed for six years. Immigrant Talib Hussain, 42, was the ring-leader of a gang that flew Eastern European women to Islamabad for bogus weddings with Pakistani men, who could then apply to live in the UK under European open borders laws. The scam - which Hussain orchestrated with the help of his ex-wife from his home in Rotherham, South Yorkshire - 'struck at the heart of the British immigration system', said a judge, as she sentenced 17 members of the gang for a combined total of more than 27 years at Sheffield Crown Court. Sham: Talib Hussain, 42, left, ran a massive international sham marriage operation from his home in Rotherham with the help of his ex-wife Rahina Zaman, right . More than 60 applications for UK . visas were submitted to authorities, accompanied by fake documents and . photos of the bogus weddings. But the UK Border Agency became . suspicious when they noticed the same people appeared in many of the . photos - and the same clothes were being swapped between brides, grooms . and guests. Today, Judge Rosalind Coe QC jailed . Hussain, saying he was the 'hub' of the operation and his house in . Rotherham was the 'engine room'. Judge Coe said: 'This was a very large, well organised, professional operation involving very many people. 'At the very hub of this conspiracy and running the operation was Talib Hussain and others.' Seventeen members of the gang were jailed for a total of 27 years and eight months at Sheffield Crown Court including nine fake brides - four Czech, four British Asian and a Slovak. Scam: Mohammed Ramzan (left), 59, Talib Hussain's brother-in-law, was jailed for three years, Mohammed Yasser (right), 22, was sentenced to eight months in prison . Jailed: Svetlana Krausova, 31, left, was jailed for six months for assisting in unlawful immigration, while mother-of-one Zuzana Holubova, 26, right, was sentenced to seven months . Judge Coe told them . deterrent sentences were needed as the scam 'struck at the heart of the . British immigration system.' She said: 'Participating in sham . marriages is a very serious matter. It is an abuse of the marriage . ceremony itself and an abuse of the immigration system.' The court had heard how Eva Holubova, . 19, flew to Pakistan with her boyfriend, also 19, to take part in fake . marriage ceremonies and was 'married' three times in the space of four . months. She told police Pakistani men offered her £250 for photos to pretend they were married so they could get visas to go to the UK. Her . boyfriend Peter Pohodko, from Slovakia, also took part in the scam and . was paid £300 for 'marrying' a 28-year-old Pakistani woman he claimed to . have met on his wedding day. The . phoney weddings were staged in Pakistan with 'brides' posing with their . 'grooms' for photographs suggesting that they had got married. One . woman returned to the UK with £1,000 in her bag while another who went . through a sham marriage already had a husband in the UK. Guilty: Briton Sabina Khan (left), 46, was jailed for eight months, Slovakian Kristina Popikova, right, was jailed for 12 months . Involved: Nadia Qureshi, left, was jailed for six months for assisting unlawful immigration to a member state, Michaela Yengyelova, right will serve 11 months for conspiracy to breach the UK's immigration laws . As . overseas nationals, the Pakistanis would have been granted leave to . live in the UK as 'husbands' of their spouses who, as EU citizens had . the right to live and work in the country. The . scam was discovered by staff at the British High Commission in . Islamabad when they noticed the multiple documents supporting . applications to marry and to settle in the UK were forged. Immigration . officers discovered the sham weddings took place in various private . homes throughout the Mirpur district in the south-west of the Kashmir . region. The ceremonies often married within hours or a few days of . meeting one another. Operation . Razorback led to 18 men and women being convicted after trial or . admitting conspiring to breach the UK's immigration laws or assisting . unlawful immigration between August, 2009 and September, 2010. Prosecutor . Sarah Wright told Sheffield Crown Court it was a sophisticated . conspiracy. She said: ‘This was a huge, well-organised and professional . operation.’ She said the . brides had no intention of living in ‘settled and genuine relationships’ with the men and the sham marriages were clearly undertaken for . immigration purposes. 'Professional operation': Veronika Pohlodkova, left, who recruited the brides, was sentenced to four years, while Louise Kelly, right, was jailed for eight months for assisting in unlawful immigration . Bogus weddings: Farah Khan, left, was sentenced to eight months, while Nikola Horvathova, right, was jailed for one year . A . total of 62 fraudulent visa applications were traced to 32 addresses in . the UK and the trail of false documents led to a semi-detached house in . Rotherham where the main organisers, brothers Talib Hussain and Tariq . Mehmood, 27, along with Talib's ex-wife, lived. Mehmood is now on the run. The address was described as the . ‘engine room’ of the conspiracy with Talib Hussain at its hub, and where . many of the forged documents originated. The . three brought the brides and grooms together, booked the flights and . arranged documents such as utility bills and bank statements - all for a . small fee. Hussain flew to . Pakistan on numerous occasions with the fake brides and Mehmood booked . the flights. Mohammed Ramzan, 59, Talib Hussain's brother-in-law, lived . across the street from their house and played a supporting role. More . fake documents were found here. Ms . Wright said of Talib Hussain: ‘He was charging considerable sums to . Pakistani nationals who wanted to come to live in the UK.’ He was said to have a ‘considerable’ property in Pakistan. Another support organiser Aftab . Hussain, 36, flew to Pakistan with two of the brides. He said Talib . Hussain paid £1500 for their air tickets and one of the women ‘posed for . something which was not a wedding but had the appearance of a wedding.’ None of the 62 suspicious visa applications was granted, but some certificates of approval to marry were granted. Talib . Hussain was said to be the ‘most culpable’ of the gang but it was . argued he did not make that much money out of it as his expenses in . flights and paying the women were so high. Many of the brides had modest means, the court heard. Sabina . Khan, 46, a single mother of three girls in the UK and a part-time . lunchtime supervisor at a primary school was paid £300 for one sham . marriage in Pakistan. Mother-of-five . Rahina Zaman, who was said to be poorly educated and reliant on . financial support, went along with the scam although she didn't make any . money out of it, the court heard. 'Engine room': Judge Rosalind Coe QC described Hussain's Rotherham home as the centre of the gang's illegal marriage scam . Talib Hussain, of Rotherham, was . jailed for six years and Zaman, also of Rotherham, was jailed for . two-and-a-half years. They both admitted conspiracy to breach the UK's . immigration laws. Mohammed Ramzan, of Rotherham was . jailed for three years and Aftab Hussain, 36, of Tinsley, for two years . after admitting the same offence. Eva . Holubova, now 19, was given ten months in a young offenders institution . and her boyfriend Peter Pohlodko, 19, both of Rotherham, got 21 months . in a young offenders' institution after they were both convicted of . conspiracy to breach the UK's immigration laws after a trial. Sabina . Khan, of Bradford, was jailed for eight months, Khalda Ahmed, 45, of . Rotherham, got a seven-month jail term suspended for a year and Nadia . Qureshi, of Sheffield, was jailed for six months after all three . admitted assisting unlawful immigration to a member state. A total of 62 fraudulent visa applications were traced to 32 addresses in the UK and the trail of false documents led to 27 Broom Grove, Rotherham (pictured) Veronika Pohlodkova, 36, and Zuzana Holubova, 26, Kristina Popikova, 34, and Michaela Yengyelova, 30, all of Rotherham, admitted conspiracy to breach the UK's immigration laws. Pohlodkova, who recruited the brides, was jailed for four years, Holubova for seven months, Popikova for 12 months and Yengyelova for 11 months. Nikola Horvathova, 25, of Tinsley, was found guilty of the same offence after a trial and jailed for 12 months. Svetlana Krausova, 31, of Tinsley, Farah Khan, 43, of Bradford, Louise Kelly, 27, of Bradford, and Mohammed Yasser, 22, of Bradford, all admitted assisting unlawful immigration to a member state. Krausova, Khan, Kelly and her boyfriend Nasser were each jailed for eight months. After the hearing Mark Bates of the UK Border Agency crime directorate said: 'This international crime group systematically abused the immigration system and showed a total disregard for the sanctity of marriage.'

"By . James Chapman . A 5p charge for plastic bags expected to cut their use by at least three-quarters will be introduced next year, the Queen told Parliament today. The levy - applying to supermarkets and larger stores - is to be implemented by the Government following a six-year campaign by the Daily Mail. Prime Minister David Cameron had previously warned stores that unless they significantly cut the numbers of bags being handed out, they would be forced to start charging customers – but the numbers given away have risen. Scroll down for video . Her Majesty smiles at Earl Marshall as she leaves Parliament after delivering the Queen's Speech. In her address she revealed the Government's plans to introduce a 5p charge on plastic bags . David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband walking through the Members' Lobby in Parliament before the Queen's Speech  today. The Prime Minister told supermarkets that they had to cut down on their use of plastic bags - or be forced to charge customers for them . Eight billion used in England each year: Environmental campaigners say the carriers, each used for just 20 minutes on average, take up to 1,000 years to degrade (file picture) More than eight billion disposable bags are used in England each year, or a staggering 130 per person. Environmental campaigners say the carriers, each used for just 20 minutes on average, take up to 1,000 years to degrade. As well as causing serious harm to marine animals and birds, they blight Britain’s coastline, with 70 bags littering every mile. Today’s Queen’s Speech, setting out the coalition’s programme for its final eleven months in power before the general election, confirmed plans to legislate for a 5p charge to be implemented by next October. The Queen told MPs and peers: 'My government will continue to implement major reforms to the electricity market and reduce the use of plastic carrier bags to help protect the environment.' Throwaway society: The Mail launched its Banish the Bags campaign in 2008 (above) in an effort to reduce the waste, cost and environmental damage associated with the billions of plastic bags given away each year . The new plastic bag charge is expected . to raise millions of pounds a year for charities and good causes likely . to be nominated by stores. Small and medium sized businesses, with 500 . employees or fewer, will be excluded to protect independent retailers. 'We are not trying to tax people. We are trying to change people’s behaviour, encourage much more environmentally-friendly behaviour' Ed Davey, Energy and Climate Change Secretary . Ministers expect the measure, which will require secondary legislation, to reduce bag use by between 75 and 80 per cent. A similar charge applying to single-use carrier bags has already been introduced in Wales and Northern Ireland, and dramatically reduced their use. Retailers in Scotland will start charging for bags in October 2014. Liberal Democrat sources claim the scheme faced opposition from the Treasury, which was concerned about being seen to impose extra costs on shoppers. Eco-friendly: Prime Minister David Cameron had previously warned stores that unless they significantly cut the numbers of plastic bags being handed out, they would be forced to start charging customers . But the success of charges in Wales . and Northern Ireland – and the public support they appear to command – . means the move has now attracted cross-party backing. The . Mail launched its Banish the Bags campaign in 2008 in an effort to . reduce the waste, cost and environmental damage associated with the . billions of plastic bags given away each year, a symbol of our throwaway . society. It swiftly . received cross party political support and was backed by a string of . major retailers, ranging from Marks & Spencer to Debenhams, B&Q . and WH Smith. Evidence from . the Republic of Ireland which introduced a bag levy in 2002 had led to a . 90 per cent reduction after its introduction in 2002. 'Changing people's behaviour': Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said the move would be a 'huge environmental step forward' Wales implemented a 5p charge which . was imposed on all retailers, regardless of size, in 2011. The number of . bags used there fell dramatically too – from 130 per person each year . to just 22. Northern Ireland . has also introduced a 5p levy, and Scotland will do the same next year. In 2011, Mr Cameron gave big stores an ultimatum, telling them to . drastically reduce the number of plastic bags, or be forced to by law. Green . campaigners will welcome today’s announcement that England is to . introduce a charge after numbers of bags handed out continued to rise. But they have complained about the exemption of biodegradable and paper bags, some which can also cause environmental harm. They . also insist that small and medium sized stores should not be excluded, . as the Government plans. The Association of Convenience Stores, which . represents smaller retailers, has suggested its members would be happy . to apply the charge too. Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said the move would be a ‘huge environmental step forward’. ‘We are very clear that none of this . money will come to government - we are not trying to tax people. We are . trying to change people’s behaviour, encourage much more . environmentally-friendly behaviour,’ he said. Ministers have previously suggested money raised by the new levy should go mainly to environmental charities. Groups such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England, Keep Britain Tidy, the Marine Conservation Society and Surfers Against Sewage have long backed the idea of a charge, saying plastic bags are littering England’s streets, countryside and beaches. They say carriers are extremely harmful to many species of wildlife which become entangled in them or mistake them for food. In a joint statement last night, Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that the speech - to be delivered by the Queen in the ceremonial highlight of the Parliamentary year - would be ‘unashamedly pro-work, pro-business and pro-aspiration’. The ‘revolution’ in pensions which forms the centrepiece of the Government’s final legislative programme will amount to ‘the biggest transformation in our pensions system since its inception’, and will ‘give people both freedom and security in retirement’, they said. ‘By no longer forcing people to buy an annuity, we are giving them total control over the money they have put aside over their lifetime and greater financial security in their old age.’ Government sources said a packed programme of 16 or 17 bills would demonstrate that the coalition has not run out of steam in the closing stages of the Parliament as they try to counter allegations that the final year of the Coalition will be little more than a ‘zombie’ Parliament. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the programme did not address the challenges faced by Britain. ‘We would have a Queen’s Speech with legislation which would make work pay, reform our banks, freeze energy bills and build homes in in Britain,’ he said.","Charge is expected to cut use of plastic bags by at least three-quarters .

"By . Jason Groves . German Chancellor Angela Merkel last night threw her weight behind Jean-Claude Juncker to be appointed EC president . Angela Merkel last night left David Cameron cut adrift in his fight to stop an arch-federalist seizing control of the European Commission. The German Chancellor threw her weight behind former Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker to be appointed EC president, despite Mr Cameron’s view that his opposition to reform is unacceptable to Britain. Downing Street confirmed Mr Cameron will force a vote on Mr Juncker tomorrow at an EU summit in Brussels – the first time one has been held on the appointment of an EU chief – but signalled he will respect the outcome. Mrs Merkel, who told German MPs it would be ‘no great drama’ if Mr Cameron is left isolated, was facing accusations of duplicity last night following reports that she had assured the PM last year that she would help him block Mr Juncker. A Brussels source said: ‘It’s not just that she changed her mind. Britain is upset because Merkel actively pressured Cameron’s allies to switch sides.’ With the possible exception of Hungary, Mr Cameron appears  to have no remaining support – leaving him facing a humiliating defeat at tomorrow’s vote. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, formerly . one of Mr Cameron’s few allies on the issue, also announced yesterday . that he will not now vote to block Mr Juncker’s appointment as president . of the European Commission. Britain has no veto on the issue and, . with the possible exception of Hungary, appears to have no remaining . allies – holding out the prospect of a humiliating defeat for Mr Cameron . tomorrow. Mrs Merkel was facing accusations of duplicity last night, following reports that she had assured David Cameron, pictured left, that she would help him block the former Luxembourg prime minster from the top position . But the Prime Minister – who is said to have warned Mrs Merkel that Mr Juncker is ‘a face from the Eighties who cannot solve the problems of the next five years’ – told the Commons yesterday he would take the fight against Mr Juncker ‘all the way to the end’. Yesterday, Mr Juncker said he was confident of securing the post but, in an apparent dig at Mr Cameron, was being forced to wait because common sense was ‘very unequally distributed’. Two pro-EU Cabinet ministers yesterday rounded on Mr Cameron over his public campaign to block Mr Juncker, warning it risked damaging Britain’s wider relations with Europe. Tory veteran Kenneth Clarke said the row was ‘out of all proportion’ to the threat posed by Mr Juncker, who he said was ‘not an arch-villain’. ‘No one knows what he’s supposed to have done wrong,’ he said. ‘The idea he’s an arch-federalist, a sort of public enemy number one which the media have made him in the last few days flat, is slightly exaggerated.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable also criticised Mr Cameron’s approach, saying: ‘It hasn’t been good for David Cameron. Mr Cameron warned he would take the fight against Mr Juncker 'all the way to the end' ‘I think he was right to take the position he did, but the way it’s been done, unfortunately, has not helped Britain punch its weight in Europe.’ In an arch response to Mr Cable’s comments, Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘We’re always grateful for advice, particularly 24 hours before a summit.’ But a Populus poll for the Financial Times yesterday suggested voters believe Mr Cameron is right to try to block Mr Juncker’s appointment. Some 43 per cent said he had taken the right stance, with just 13 per cent saying he was wrong. Mrs Merkel and Mr Rutte both last night telephoned Mr Cameron to urge him to drop plans to force a vote on Mr Juncker when EU leaders meet to discuss the issue tomorrow. Downing Street said that, despite the row, the pair had ‘underlined their support for Britain’s continued membership of a reformed European Union and their ongoing commitment to working with the Prime Minister as he renegotiates Britain’s relationship with the EU’. Number 10 also confirmed that Mr Cameron will force a vote – the first time one has ever been held on the appointment of an EU chief – but signalled he will respect the outcome. Meanwhile, the Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander reopened the row over the potential cost of Britain leaving the European Union by claiming new Treasury figures showed more than three million jobs would be put at risk. Mr Alexander, who once led the PR campaign for Britain to join the euro, said a new ‘Treasury analysis’ revealed that 3.3 million jobs are ‘connected to Britain’s place in Europe’. In a speech in Washington, he added: ‘That is the measure of the risk that isolationists would have us take.’ Tory sources last night dismissed the analysis, saying it was a ‘dusting down’ of previous, discredited figures. The Treasury declined to publish details of the analysis referred to by Mr Alexander. Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood yesterday dismissed Mr Alexander’s claim as a ‘lie’. Mr Redwood said it appeared to be a ‘rehash’ of previous claims, adding: ‘If the UK left the EU there would be a trade deal - as the rest of the EU has always accepted - because they sell us more than we sell them. ‘The claim that three million jobs would go is not news – it is not even interesting old news. It is simply a lie.’","David Cameron will force a vote on Mr Juncker at EU summit tomorrow .

"By . Jaya Narain . For Norma McGivern, her neighbour was a lifeline. Jacqueline Carolan helped the 76-year-old with her shopping, did small chores around the house and walked the widow’s pet dog, Alfie. The frail pensioner thought so much of her ‘best friend’ that they even went on holiday together . But Carolan, 46, was no Good Samaritan – she was ‘grooming’ Mrs McGivern in a bid to plunder her life savings, eventually stealing almost £2,000. Friends: Norma McGivern, 76, (right) was so close to Jacqueline Carolan, 46, (left) that the pair even holidayed to Ibiza together. However, Carolan was withdrawing money from Mrs McGiven's life savings each time she offered to take the grandmother's dog for a walk . Scam: Carolan persuaded the grandmother to reveal her PIN number as her elderly neighbour was fearful of using cash machines and withdrew a total of £1,870 from her account . And when Mrs McGivern discovered the shocking betrayal she suffered a massive heart attack, fell down the stairs and died. As . Carolan began a six-month prison sentence last night, Mrs McGivern’s . family condemned the fraudster and blamed her for the death. Her . daughter Pam Bryan, 48, said: ‘Jacqueline came across as such a lovely . lady but basically she had groomed her.’ Mrs Bryan said the two friends went on several day trips together and even went on a holiday to Ibiza in 2012. Stress: Mrs McGivern's daughter Pam Bryan, 48, believes the betrayal had contributed to her mother's death . Mrs . McGivern trusted her sufficiently that, last year, when Carolan asked . to borrow £100 for a holiday, she went with her friend to withdraw the . money at an ATM, revealing her pin number in the process. After . this, unemployed Carolan would visit Mrs McGivern on the pretext of . taking her shih tzu for a walk but would also take the bank card from . her handbag. She withdrew up to £250 on 14 occasions, stealing £1,870 . over three months. The court heard Carolan of Failsworth, near Oldham, used  the cash to pay for holidays and  manicures. Mrs . McGivern didn’t notice the disappearing funds at first because her bank . statements were sent quarterly. When she did, she told her family and . they alerted her to the unexplained withdrawals. She originally dismissed their fears about Carolan before a trap was set that caught her in the act. On . the day Carolan was arrested by police last December, Mrs McGivern . suffered a fatal heart attack. The grandmother was said to be absolutely . mortified that her friend and confidante had plundered her life . savings. Mrs Bryan said: ‘My mum couldn’t cope with the fact somebody had done that to her. ‘She . loved her and thought she was her best friend. I think this contributed . to her death. She would still be here today without all this. She would . easily have more years in her.’ Carolan, . who had no previous convictions, admitted fraud and was jailed for six . months. Sentencing her, Judge Lever branded Carolan’s behaviour as . ‘despicable’.

"By . Glen Owen, Political Correspondent . Tory health minister believes plain cigarette packets would have a positive impact on public health as people would be less attracted to the habit . A health minister has admitted for the first time that David Cameron is blocking the introduction of plain cigarette packaging – despite growing pressure from health campaigners who believe it would be the most effective way to stop teenagers from being attracted to the habit. Tory MP Jane Ellison, who told the Commons earlier this year that there would be draft regulations in place ‘by the end of April’, has now admitted: ‘There comes a point, as a minister, where you get things ready, then you basically wait until you are allowed to talk about them.’ Asked whether this referred to No10, she laughed and said: ‘I couldn’t possibly comment.’ Recorded at a meeting of the Tory Reform Group earlier this month, her words have emerged days after 600 clinicians wrote an open letter urging the Government to publish the plans. ‘Smoking-related disease remains the main cause of preventable deaths in  the UK, killing more than 100,000 people a year. It is necessary and logical to end the marketing of cigarettes and tobacco products through packaging,’ they wrote in the letter to the British Medical Journal. Although Ms Ellison believes removing the distinctive packaging of cigarettes ‘would be very likely to have a positive impact on public health’, many of her Tory colleagues argue the move would damage small businesses such as newsagents. Labour also claims that Tory Election strategist, Lynton Crosby, who has represented tobacco firms in the past, is influencing the hold-up. 600 clinicians wrote an open letter to the government saying: 'Smoking-related disease remains the main cause of preventable deaths in  the UK' Last night Luciana Berger, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Public Health,  said: ‘We now know the standardised packaging hold-up comes from Downing Street. 'There can be no excuse for further delay. The Government must bring forward the regulations it promised months ago. This is what Parliament has voted  for, concerned health professionals want, and what people support. ‘Cameron must do the right thing, and not cave into vested interests and stand up for the wrong people.’ Ms Ellison was not available for comment. A No10 spokesman said:  ‘It is not true that any attempt is being made to block this measure.’","Jane Ellison says Prime Minister is blocking plain cigarette package .

"By . James Tozer, Jaya Narain, Rosie Taylor And Amanda Williams . Angela Callaghan invented six children to fraudulently claim almost £43,000 in state benefits . A single mother who invented six children in order to falsely claim £43,000 in benefits, then helped other women copy her scam, has been jailed for a ‘flagrant and brazen’ fraud. Angela Callaghan, 42, cashed in on a loophole which means tax credits are paid out without claimants having to submit a child’s birth certificate. Over three years the mother of two claimed for six fictitious children, including twins she said she was looking after for her sister and one on behalf of her teenage daughter. Not content with that, jobless Callaghan – already a convicted benefits fraudster – began helping other Liverpool mothers to perpetrate the same fraud, receiving a cut of up to £700 from each. It drew comparisons with the notorious White Dee from Channel 4’s controversial series Benefits Street – with the crucial difference that Deirdre Kelly argued she was helping neighbours make legitimate claims. Callaghan’s scam cost taxpayers more than £55,000 in total until it was exposed. Yesterday she was jailed for 12 months, despite her lawyer asking for leniency because she has a – genuine – four-year-old son. Three other mothers who took part in the swindle, falsely claiming £4,151, £2,956 and £2,502, were given suspended sentences earlier this month. White Dee, the alleged 'star' of Benefits Street . Last night Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘This is an appalling example of flagrant abuse of the benefits system. Hard-pressed taxpayers are sick and tired of hearing of such abuse and this case shows exactly why we need sanctions and tough sentences for individuals who break the system.’ Callaghan had been given a community sentence for a £9,000 benefits fraud in 2008, but the following year she invented a twin of her then 16-year-old daughter, Adele, and began claiming tax credits in her name. Over a three-year period, she created fictitious children named Jordan, David, Lucy, Alex, Zach and Layla, Liverpool Crown Court was told. They included twins she claimed to be looking after on behalf of her sister, and a baby she said was her daughter’s but who was in her care. She made £42,925 between 2009 and 2012 and wrongly claimed a further £2,577 in child benefit payments for Adele by failing to declare that she had left full-time education. Neighbours of her £110,000 semi on a quiet street near Aintree racecourse in Bootle, yesterday told how the property had been refurbished, apparently using the proceeds of the fraud, including a new patio and wrought-iron gates. Liverpool Crown Court heard that Callaghan began abusing the benefit system in 2009 when she contacted the authorities to add additional children to her existing legitimate claim for tax credits for her daughter . In 2011 she began advising other mothers . on how to follow suit, ‘claiming a kick-back from the proceeds . wrongfully paid out as her reward’, said Kevin Slack, prosecuting. Mothers . already receiving tax credits would give her their passwords and bank . details, and she would call the helpline pretending to be them and . having recently given birth to twins, the court heard. This resulted in a . back-dated lump sum being paid into the recipient’s account followed by . further regular payments with no further proof required, said Mr Slack. ‘The . process of reporting changes of circumstances is designed to be simple . for the customer and the system relies very much on the honesty of the . person notifying the change,’ he added. After Callaghan admitted five . benefit offences, Sarah Phelan, defending, urged Judge David Aubrey, QC, . not to send her to prison. But the judge jailed her and the court heard . that Callaghan’s daughter, now 21, will care for her brother while she . serves her 12-month sentence. A spokesman for HMRC said: ‘We check . all the information provided for a tax credits claim and constantly . evolve these checks to ensure they remain effective. As this case shows, . we do detect fraud and we do stop it.’ Last year HMRC admitted . 1.4million tax credit claims – or one in five – were being overpaid, . with losses through fraud and error put at £850million a year.","Angela Callaghan concocted lies involving twins and imaginary babies .

"By . Jason Groves . 'We have a target': Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said immigration is a key issue . David Cameron’s hopes of cutting immigration from Europe were dealt a blow after figures showed a surge in the number of North Africans trying to enter the EU through Italy. The continental border agency estimates the total has already hit 60,000 this year. Even more have arrived than in 2011, the year of revolutions that became known as the Arab Spring. Once migrants have been accepted into Italy, they can then travel easily throughout the EU. Yesterday Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said ministers are well aware of public concern over the fact that Britain has  ‘virtually no control over’ immigration from the EU. Mr Javid said the Conservatives are determined to ‘change’ the rules as part of the renegotiation of Britain’s membership promised by Mr Cameron. He stressed that the Prime Minister’s pledge to reduce net immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the time of the election remains in place, despite a recent surge that has taken the number back over 200,000. Mr Javid said: ‘We’ve set a target and that remains in place. It hasn’t changed. We do recognise that we, as a country today, have much more control over non-EU immigration – and we have virtually no control over EU immigration. 'That’s something that we’d like to change, but that is much easier said than done at this point and requires renegotiating with our European partners and that’s something Conservatives are committed to.’ Mr Javid, the son of a Pakistani immigrant, told Total Politics magazine: ‘When I was campaigning in the 2010 election, a number of people on the doorstep would raise the issue of immigration with you, not in a “for or against” way, just concerns about the numbers. 'That’s a legitimate issue. If that’s what people are concerned about, politicians do need to listen and they do need to react.’ Crisis: Around 250 migrants from Sub-Saharian areas are hosted on a landing craft of Italy's Navy ship San Giorgio after being rescued in open international waters in the Mediterranean last week . Home Secretary Theresa May signalled this week that she backs curbs on free movement of migrants. Yesterday, former prime minister Sir John Major said the success of Eurosceptic parties across Europe meant Mr Cameron had allies. He told BBC Radio 4: ‘The results of these elections have made a renegotiation much easier. ‘It is apparent to governments right across Europe that reform of the EU is necessary, it isn’t working as it should, it isn’t working in the way European citizens think it should.’ Sir John said many people are ‘grinding their teeth’ in frustration at Brussels. But he warned that leaving the EU would ‘cost us billions’. He backed Mr Cameron’s plan to hold an In/Out referendum in 2017 following an attempted renegotiation. ‘I do believe the Prime Minister will win this referendum,’ he said. ‘There will be significant things that can be renegotiated.’","More migrants have arrived in Italy than in 2011 at start of Arab Spring .

"By . Jason Groves . Ministers are to sweep away planning restrictions on disused urban sites in a bid to reduce the impact of new house building on the countryside. Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles yesterday said that the Government planned to ‘augment’ its controversial planning reforms with the introduction of ‘practical ways of removing red tape’. These will include a ‘relaxation’ of the rules that make it difficult to convert warehouses and industrial premises into flats and housing estates. This could lead to the construction of a string of new housing developments on edge-of-town sites, reducing the need for house building in open countryside. Chancellor George Osborne (left) will unveil further details of the proposals in his annual Mansion House speech while Eric Pickles (right) believes that he has extracted firm commitments that the Green Belt should be protected from development in most circumstances . Plans also include a package of measures to ‘regenerate’ so-called brownfield sites, which have been developed before. Chancellor George Osborne will unveil further details of the proposals in his annual Mansion House speech in the City tonight. More... On the hunt for a home? The first-time buyer's guide to getting a mortgage and climbing onto the property ladder . The plans are expected to include a new presumption in favour of development on virtually all brownfield sites. Developers claim that brownfield sites are often too difficult and expensive to bring back into use. This stance has led to massive pressure on councils to free up green field sites for development – to the anger of many rural communities. Eric Pickles believes that he has extracted firm commitments that the Green Belt such as this area in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, should be protected from development . Tory MPs, under pressure from local residents, have been urging ministers to shift the focus for development from green field sites to urban locations. A Government source said the new proposals would make it easier for developers to build new homes on brownfield sites. ‘Our intention is quite clear that we want to see more development on brownfield,’ the source said. Ministers believe the changes could help balance the need for new housing development against the resistance to new housing estates in many Tory constituencies. Mr Pickles believes that he has extracted firm commitments that the Green Belt should be protected from development in most circumstances as part of the deal. Ministers are also bringing forward proposals to help regenerate Britain’s high streets, including planning reforms to make it easier to change disused shops into restaurants and leisure facilities.","George Osborne will unveil further details of the proposals tonight .

"By . Jason Groves . Ed Miliband will today pledge to bring back discredited rent controls ¿ despite warnings that the move could worsen Britain's housing crisis . Ed Miliband will today pledge to bring back discredited rent controls – despite warnings that the move could worsen Britain’s housing crisis. In a dramatic intervention in the free market, the Labour leader will vow to cap rent rises in the private sector and force landlords to offer long-term tenancies. Mr Miliband will claim new laws are essential to help millions trapped in ‘generation rent’ who are at risk of being ripped off by grasping landlords. But the move raises the spectre of previous attempts to control private rents, which have led to housing shortages and a decline in the standard of rented property. It will also reinforce fears that Mr Miliband’s left-of-centre agenda will involve widespread 1970s-style State intervention in markets. The Labour leader has already announced controversial plans to freeze energy prices and introduce Soviet-style land grabs against developers who fail to build houses. The populist policies have been branded ‘anti-business’ and led to warnings that they could spark a catastrophic collapse in investment. Rent controls have long been backed by the Left and are a key demand of the militant Unite union. But experts warn they have a disastrous history and could worsen Britain’s housing crisis. In a major report on housing last year, the respected Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors said: ‘All political  parties should make a commitment not to introduce rent controls in the private rented sector, as this would reduce the level of supply in the rented housing market at a time when the country is becoming more dependent upon the sector.’ Rent controls have a chequered history around the world. Supporters claim they have proved effective in countries such as Germany and Ireland, but they are blamed for the spread of slum dwellings under socialist regimes in Vietnam and Venezuela. They deter landlords from renting out their properties or from maintaining houses that are already rented out, leaving  tenants with dilapidated accommodation. In the UK, rent controls were introduced as a ‘temporary’ measure during the First World War and were only finally abolished by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. Labour last night insisted that its new plans do not amount to the return of traditional rent controls. Rent controls have long been backed by the Left and are a key demand of the militant Unite union . ‘Some landlords will not like this, but millions of tenants will,’ a source said. Mr Miliband will today say intervention in the rented housing market is a key plank in his agenda to tackle Britain’s cost of living ‘crisis’. Speaking at the launch of Labour’s local and European election campaign he will say the nine million people now living in rented accommodation have been ‘ignored for too long’. ‘The next Labour government will legislate to make three-year tenancies the standard in the British private rented sector to give people who rent the certainty they need,’ he will say. Under Labour’s plans most tenancy agreements would automatically last for three years. Although landlords would be free to set the rent at the start of the agreement, future rises would be capped by the Government. This could be based on inflation or the average increase in market rents and could vary in different parts of the country. There appears to be no provision for dealing with a sudden increase in interest rates, which could leave many landlords  unable to raise rents to cover their costs.","Miliband will claim new laws will help those trapped in ‘generation rent’

"By . Jaya Narain . With travel firms jacking up prices during school holidays, many parents have been tempted to take their children abroad in term time instead. The education authorities frown on such behaviour. But now one school governor has broken ranks. Paul Lawton ignored anti-truanting laws to take his 13-year old daughter Lucie-Ann out of school for 11 days so they could enjoy a fortnight in Spain. Sunshine: School governor Paul Lawton (left) has been fined for failing to ensure his child attended school after taking her on a family holiday in term time . Siesta: Mr Lawton enjoys a nap on holiday in Costa Del Sol . Paul Lawton, pictured in his garden, was ordered to pay the fine plus £70 costs . Some parents at the Macclesfield Academy in Cheshire, where Mr Lawton sits on the governing body, were outraged . Other parents have accused him of . setting a bad example but Mr Lawton, a farmer, said he was too busy with . work in the summer months, and had also wanted his daughter to visit . her godfather, who has cancer. The father of five added that he had saved £5,000 on the break on the Costa del Sol by going during term time. Mr . Lawton, 42, said: ‘To go when we did cost us £1,200 to fly the whole . family of seven to Spain with flights and transfers. The local authority issues a penalty notice to parents who fail to ensure their kids attend school. It equates to £60 per child, rising to £120 if it's not paid within 21 days. After 28 days, if the fine remains unpaid, the local authority is required to begin legal proceedings in a magistrate's court. Parents are prosecuted under Section 444 of the 1996 Education Act. 'If we had gone . three weeks later it would have been £6,000 and we can’t afford that. ‘I . think the Government should stop this ridiculous rip-off.

Cooling off: Mr Lawton called himself a 'keen and conscientious parent' who is passionate about education . One parent angry at Mr Lawton's actions said he has 'thrown the rule book out of the window' Fined: Natasha and Stewart Sutherland pictured arriving at Telford Magistrates Court. They were fined £630 and ordered to pay £300 . Earlier this month a couple were hit with a £1,000 penalty for taking their three children out of school for a foreign holiday. Stewart and Natasha Sutherland fell foul of a new law allowing councils to fine parents who fail to ensure their children attend class. They returned home from the week-long break to Rhodes – their first family holiday in five years – to find they had been fined £360. This was soon doubled to £720 because they did not pay up quickly enough, as well as £300 costs and a £63 victim surcharge.Education Act, subsections one and eight. Speaking after the case, Mr Sutherland, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service, said the week in question was the only one he and his wife could both take off work. ‘We had no choice but to plead guilty otherwise me and my wife could have been behind bars,’ added the 39-year-old. ‘Surely that would make our children’s education suffer more than a much-needed holiday? I can’t see the justice in it at all. When . Mr Lawton returned from Spain his own school requested that he and his . wife Emma, 33, be issued with a fixed penalty notice of £60 each by the . local education authority under anti-truanting laws. They . did not pay and were taken before magistrates where they both admitted a . charge of failing to ensure their child attended school and were each . fined £120 with £50 costs and £20 victim surcharge.

Mr Lawton told the magistrates: ‘We went to see my foster father . who has cancer and whose health is only expected to deteriorate. 'We . could ill afford to go, but my daughter is his goddaughter and he wanted . to see her.’ But magistrate David Coulston told him: ‘As a governor, you should have known better of the protocols of the school.’ Yesterday . Mrs Lawton said the holiday had been their first since the couple’s . honeymoon in Egypt. Her husband said he believed he was being singled . out because he was a governor, adding: ‘When I booked the holiday I . wasn’t a governor.

"By . Jason Groves . Pascal Soriot, the boss of AstraZeneca, said yesterday that he was willing to consider further bids from Pfizer despite warning MPs that the 'distracting' takeover bid could cost lives . The boss of AstraZeneca last night admitted he would consider selling out to Pfizer if the price increases – just hours after telling MPs the controversial bid could cost lives by delaying the development of anti-cancer drugs. Pascal Soriot, who has branded the  US bid a ‘distraction’ and said it would put lives at risk, also claimed the disruption from the potential deal was ‘manageable’. In an apparent change of tone, he made clear that the AstraZeneca board was willing to consider further bids from its bigger rival. Mr Soriot said: ‘We will consider offers that are made to us in the context of the value, the price that’s offered and the potential of the terms. But certainly the price is a very important dimension.’ He added: ‘We cannot rule out doing a deal because ultimately we have to make sure we represent the interests of our shareholders, and if the price that is offered reflects the full value of the company, of course we would have to make a positive recommendation.’ Yesterday, Mr Soriot had warned MPs that Pfizer’s bid will cost lives by delaying the development of anti-cancer drugs. He told the Commons business select committee that the £63billion deal would be a massive ‘distraction’ that would delay work on life-saving drugs. ‘What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed because our companies were involved in saving taxes or saving costs?’ he asked MPs. The firm’s research chief Mene Pangalos warned the deal would have a potentially ‘devastating’ impact, with wide-ranging implications for jobs, science and the development of life-saving drugs. Mr Pangalos told the committee that the history of mega-mergers in the drugs industry was that they are ‘very challenging to get through’. Yesterday Ian Reed, the head of Pfizer, was also questioned by MPs but refused to give guarantees on jobs . If the £63billion takeover of Astrazeneca by Pfizer goes, it will be the largest in British corporate history . He added: ‘There are a lot of job losses, there are changes in projects, changes in strategy, changes  in direction. It takes a long time to get through – it can be devastating.’ In a day of major developments: . Yesterday saw tetchy exchanges with MPs on the select committee, which is led by former librarian Adrian Bailey, but there was no  real interrogation of Pfizer’s plans for AstraZeneca, and Mr Read was able to bat away concerns about  its future. There are concerns that Pfizer could be using the takeover of AstraZeneca to strip the company of its assets and cut swathes of staff, concerns Mr Read sought to dismiss . Among the assurances Mr Read gave to MPs was that 20 per cent of the company's combined R&D staff would stay in the UK for at least five years after the deal . Mr Read also dismissed their worries about Pfizer’s reputation as an ‘asset-stripper’, saying it was ‘a company of high integrity’. He also confirmed that jobs would be lost but added: ‘I cannot say how many or where.’ Mr Read insisted that pledges made to ministers – including keeping 20 per cent of the combined firm’s R&D staff in the UK – were ‘legally binding’ and would last for at least five years following the completion of a deal. But MPs raised doubts about weak commitments. Tory MP Brian Binley dismissed Mr Read’s presentation as ‘a lot of sales talk, but short on facts’. Labour’s Willie Bain told Mr Read: ‘There are no commitments of any substance being made.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday held a 30-minute meeting with Mr Read, but when he emerged from the talks he called for ministers to intervene. He said: ‘There are serious concerns about this takeover. There are too many unanswered questions.’ Treasury sources said Chancellor George Osborne had held a 45-minute meeting with Astra boss  Mr Soriot yesterday afternoon. However, the Institute of Directors cautioned ministers against ‘mounting a British inquisition’ into the deal. Director general Simon Walker warned of the ‘growing politicisation’ of the deal.","Pascal Soriot told MPs yesterday that Pfizer takeover could cost lives .

"By . Jaya Narain . and Rosie Taylor . and James Tozer . A baby girl was mauled to death by a dog that neighbours had allegedly warned was dangerous. Ava-Jayne Corless, who was just 11 months old, suffered horrific injuries when the American pitbull terrier attacked her while she slept. Her mother, Chloe King, 20, and  boyfriend Lee Wright, 26, heard the commotion and rushed upstairs to rescue her from the jaws of the beast. Paramedics were called and took Ava-Jayne to hospital where doctors were unable to save her life. Scroll down for video . The 11-month-old died in hospital after suffering catastrophic injuries when she was attacked by the pitbull-type dog . 'I love you Twinkle, you are my world.' Chloe King paid tribute to her 11-month-old daughter Ava-Jayne, after she was mauled to death by a pet dog . Father Dean Corless, pictured with Miss King and Ava-Jayne, said: Dean Corless said: 'I just want to say what a wonderful and amazing mum Chloe is - Ava-Jayne could not have had anyone better. They are both the apple of my eye. Sleep tight Twinkle' Miss King and Mr Wright were questioned on suspicion of manslaughter and child neglect, and were today released on bail. Lancashire Police said: 'The two people arrested in connection with the death of Ava-Jayne Corless at Blackburn have both been released on bail pending further inquiries.' A police spokesman said last night that the animal was banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act of 1991. Senior officers have launched an investigation into reports that neighbours had called Lancashire Constabulary to complain about dangerous animals at the property in Blackburn. The incident happened at around 11pm on Monday while Miss King was visiting Mr Wright at his home 40 yards from hers . Faisal Shahzad, 35, fled after two dogs broke through his garden fence. ‘I had to run quickly into the house and barricade the door because they were tearing after me,’ said the taxi driver. ‘I’ve got three children and they were all in the house absolutely terrified. The two dogs were scary. I called the police and they said something would be done and my neighbour also called the RSPCA.’ Another neighbour, 80-year-old Brian Harrison, said: ‘That dog was a nightmare for neighbours and people were worried about approaching it. ‘It’s an absolute tragedy that should never have happened. ‘Only last year it mauled to death a neighbour’s cat and nothing was done about it.’ Kyle Perry, 19, was chased down the street by the dog. ‘It was a big dog and it used to just bark and bark,’ he said. ‘I have been chased by it down the street. It was terrifying.’ Blackburn MP Jack Straw said: ‘What . will it take to convince people not to keep dogs like this – and to get . across to all dog-owners, of every breed of dog, that no dog should ever . be left unsupervised with a baby?’ The incident happened at around 11pm on Monday while Miss King was visiting Mr Wright at his home 40 yards from hers.

Chief Superintendent Chris Bithell said previous contact with neighbours would form part of the police investigation. Last night,  police said the dog had been identified by experts as a pitbull. Owners cannot be prosecuted for dog attacks on private property until new legislation comes into force this spring. Miss King's boyfriend Lee Wright, who owned the dog, was arrested along with Miss King, on suspicion of Ava-Jayne's manslaughter. Both have been released on police bail . Family: Dean Corless, right, paid tribute to his daughter after her mother, left, was arrested along with her new boyfriend Lee Wright . Tougher sentences will be introduced under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill.Rachel Cunningham, of the Blue Cross animal charity, said: ‘We can only hope the Government’s planned changes to the bill will allow authorities to step in at the first sign of a dangerous dog and help prevent terrible events like this.’ Jennie Rudd, of animal welfare campaign group Naturewatch Foundation, said dog attacks were caused by irresponsible owners. She added: ‘If it has aggressive tendencies it is the owner’s responsibility to make sure it never gets near a child, and that it isn’t forced into situations where it feels it has to attack – because there is always a reason for a dog to bite.’ Police on Emily Street where Ava-Jayne was killed .

Horror: Four-year-old Lexi Branson was killed by a pet dog three months ago . In November last year, four-year-old Lexi Branson was mauled to death by a pet dog despite her mother's desperate attempts to halt the attack. Lexi, described as a 'happy and sweet' girl, died after being attacked at a flat in Mountsorrel, Leicestershire. It later emerged that the dog had been a stray until a couple of months earlier. In June 2013, a five-year-old boy was taken to hospital after being mauled by a dog in Co Antrim, Ireland. The attack happened at Carniny Primary School on the outskirts of Ballymena. It was later confirmed that the dog was being shown to schoolchildren as a last-day-of-term treat. Last May, Clifford Clarke, 79, was killed in a dog attack in his garden in Liverpool. The retired hospital porter suffered fatal injuries after being mauled by a bull mastiff cross which was reported to have found a way into Mr Clarke's garden from a neighbouring house. The dogs was shot dead by armed officers and two women were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. Two months earlier, Jade Anderson, 14, was mauled to death by four dogs while visiting her friend near Wigan. The girl was discovered by armed police at a friend's house amid a pack of aggressive dogs. The animals, who were not banned breeds, were put down. The owner of the animals was given a suspended 16-week sentence for animal cruelty last month. In November 2012, 71-year-old Gloria Knowles died after being attacked by a pack of dogs belonging to her daughter that she had gone to feed. The great-grandmother was found dead with multiple injuries at a house with five dogs in Morden, south London. In March 2011, Jude Keir, nine, suffered severe head injuries when he was mauled by a Staffordshire bull terrier outside his school in Scotland. The young boy needed 40 stitches and only survived because two people dragged the dog off him. In November 2009, four-year-old John-Paul Massey died after suffering multiple injuries when he was savaged by the family pet at his grandmother's home in November 2009. The animal, named Uno, was an illegal pitbull-type dog belonging to his uncle, who was jailed for four months.

"By . Becky Barrow . Midwives are threatening to go on strike for the first time in the history of the profession in a move which poses a real worry for pregnant women. The Royal College of Midwives said midwives in England are 'over-stretched, under-resourced and under-valued'. Founded in 1881, it is the first time in his 133-year history that the RCM has ever asked its members whether or not they are prepared to go on strike. The Royal College of Midwives said its members are threatening to go on strike for the first time in the history of the profession . Cathy Warwick, the chief executive, warned: 'The sense of anger and frustration among midwives is palpable. 'We knew midwives were angry about the derisory offer from the Government but this response from our members highlights just how unfairly they have been treated. 'Such an unprecedented response with such a large number willing to consider action should ring alarm bells with the Government.' Each year, nearly 700,000 babies are born in England, according to the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics. Around 20,000 midwives were asked if they were prepared to go on strike . The threat of a potential strike will fuel fears among pregnant women, who will worry about the impact of a strike on their chance of a safe delivery. The dispute was sparked by an annual pay offer of up to one per cent made to midwives in April this year, which they dismissed as 'derisory.' A typical midwife, who works full-time and has five years' experience, is paid £29,759, but many work part-time and earn a lower salary. For a new midwife who works outside London, the starting salary is around £21,500, according to the RCM. Around 20,000 midwives were asked if they were prepared to go on strike, with nearly half responding to the unprecedented ballot. Of those who did respond, two-thirds said they were prepared to take strike action if the bitter dispute continues. Ms Warwick insisted midwives in England 'will always think of the woman and her baby first.' An emergency meeting will take place in the next few weeks to decide whether or not to formally ballot midwives about staging a strike, which could take place within months. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: 'We are disappointed that unions are considering industrial action. 'There is still time for the unions to put patients first and accept our offer to come back to the negotiating table.'","Royal College of Midwives said midwives in England are 'over-stretched'

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Paul Revoir . Predator: Jimmy Savile's victims are preparing compensation claims for millions of pounds . Jimmy Savile's victims are launching compensation claims for millions of pounds, it emerged last night. They are to sue the BBC, NHS and the education authorities for failing to prevent the sexual predator and accomplices carrying out attacks over decades. The numbers coming forward have risen in recent days as victims become more confident about taking legal action after Scotland Yard branded Savile one of Britain’s worst sex offenders. Twelve claims for damages are being considered so far. It also emerged last night that the BBC ‘censored’ a series of emails that indicated senior executives were involved in the decision to axe a Newsnight investigation into Savile. The emails were due to be included in last night’s Panorama programme but were pulled at the insistence of corporation lawyers. Today the spotlight will shift to BBC director-general George Entwistle as he gives evidence to MPs on the Culture Select Committee about what he knew of the Savile scandal. He has insisted that he has nothing to hide despite facing persistent criticism for failing to get a grip on the crisis that has engulfed the corporation. Last year, then in charge of TV for the BBC, he went ahead with Christmas tributes to Savile – even as his colleagues gathered evidence that he abused children on BBC premises. MPs want to know why he didn’t show more curiosity when Director of News Helen Boaden told him that the Christmas schedules may have to be rearranged if the planned Newsnight report on Savile’s abuse went ahead. Scroll down for video . Under scrutiny: BBC Director-General George Entwistle is preparing to give evidence to MPs on what he knew about the Savile scandal . Last night Tory peer and former Culture Secretary David Mellor said there was ‘blood lust’ in the BBC and suggested Mr Entwistle could even lose his job. ‘It was always said about the BBC: “Assistant heads must roll whenever there’s a problem”. I think it’ll go beyond that – and that’s not me wanting that, it’s just me feeling it,’ he said. Censored emails: It emerged that the BBC 'censored' emails which were to be included in a Panorama special, Jimmy Savile - What the BBC Knew, but were pulled by corporation lawyers . Questioning: Newsnight editor Peter Rippon 'stepped aside' because of allegations of a cover up, appearing to play down the evidence of the victims. Pictured an email questioning the viability of the Newsnight story . Yesterday, in another dramatic day as the corporation grappled with what its own staff have branded its ‘worst crisis in 50 years’: . More than 200 victims have now told police they were abused by Savile over a 50-year period going back to the late 1950s. Criticism: George Entwistle went ahead with Christmas tributes to Savile last year - even as his colleagues gathered evidence that the presenter abused children on BBC premises . Asked if Mr Cameron would consider a judicial inquiry into the Savile scandal, his official spokesman said: ‘We have said before that we are not ruling anything out and that remains the case.’ The compensation move was revealed by Liz Dux, a lawyer at Russell Jones & Walker specialising in child abuse cases. ‘The allegation is that other members of the BBC were involved,’ she said. ‘It wasn’t just Savile and it was organised, so we weren’t surprised when the police said they believed there could have been a ring. ‘They are people who said they did tell someone, and nothing was done. One of the assaults happened in the middle of a canteen. ‘We have had some from every institution: Leeds General Infirmary, Broadmoor and Stoke Mandeville hospitals, Duncroft School, the BBC and a care home.’ Miss Dux said 12 claims for damages were being considered so far, on the grounds that institutions had ‘vicarious liability’ for the activities of their staff or their agents. On Friday, Scotland Yard said Savile may have been at the centre of a network of paedophiles who targeted more than 200 victims. Police are hunting accomplices of the paedophile presenter. Gary Glitter was said to have raped a 13-year-old girl in the Jim’ll Fix It’s BBC dressing room, while other celebrities have also been named. Essex County Council paid nearly £1million to four sex abuse victims earlier this year. If the BBC faces similar claims, its payout could run into several million pounds. Victim spoke out: Karin Ward, one of Savile's victims of child abuse, gave an interview to Newsnight 11 months ago while suffering from cancer. She told Panorama she was angry it was never broadcast . Culture Committee chairman John Whittingdale (left) said it was 'extraordinary' that Mr Entwistle had not been more curious and David Cameron (right) refused to rule out that the new director-general would have to quit . David Cameron said yesterday: ‘The developments are concerning because the BBC has effectively changed its story about why it dropped the Newsnight programme about Jimmy Savile.’ Yesterday John Whittingdale, the Culture Committee’s chairman, said it was ‘extraordinary’ Mr Entwistle had not been more curious when he was briefed on the Newsnight film last December. David Cameron refused to rule out that the new director general, George Entwistle, would have to quit over the Savile scandal and said he didn’t rule out further inquiries into the affair. Asked by Tom Bradby on ITV1’s The Agenda whether the BBC chief should immediately be sacked, he could only say that ‘I don’t think it’s a question of that at this stage.’ Claims: Scotland Yard branded Savile one of the worst sex offenders as twelve claims for damages are considered so far .

"By . Rob Cooper . Water death: Jacob Cockle, 28, died after being dragged out of the water near the Hayle Estuary in Cornwall . A photographer drowned taking close-up pictures of a whirlpool just seconds after he apparently told friends 'I just want one more phoograph'. Jacob Cockle, 28, was trying to capture footage of the dangerous tidal phenomenon at the Carnsew Pool in the Hayle Estuary, Cornwall. The disused man-made waterway was constructed by the Victorians in 1830 and was originally built to flush sand from the harbour. Friends say Jacob was in the water to take photographs of the large, fast-moving whirlpools it creates when he was sucked under. But they claimed he was pulled into the swirling vortex of water when he paddled too close to get the perfect photo. Jacob was pulled out of the water before RNLI lifeboat crews tried to revive him. He was airlifted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, where he was later pronounced dead . Lee Harvey, 35, a close friend of him for 20 years, said Jacob, of Penzance, Cornwall, was taking still photographs while his friend filmed him. But he says Jacob fatally went back for more photos and drowned at around 9pm on Tuesday. Lee said: 'Jacob was one of the friendliest, happiest and loving person you could ever meet. It is very hard to take. 'Jacob is a body boarder although he loved surfing and would also do that, he also loved filming whirlpools, which is what I believe happened. 'He went to the pools with a guy who he goes out there with - he isn't reckless. Jacob said he was going back for just one more photo. 'But then the guy lost sight of him and he went towards the centre of the whirlpools. 'The next thing he came out the other side and was unconscious. It is just such a tragedy and so hard to take.' Jacob's mother Carolyn Sheard, 58, said : 'All I can say is imagine if it was your child, we are obviously absolutely devastated. Death: Jacob Cockle died after getting into difficulties while trying to take close-up pictures in Carnsew Pool in Hayle Estuary, Cornwall, yesterday evening . 'He was a friend of everybody, he had so many friends and he held no grudges against any person at all. He lived life to the full.' The whirlpools are now part of a nature reserve but residents say while the water looks tempting to bathers the swirls are too powerful for even the strongest of swimmers. A spokesperson for the RNLI said: 'Being the first emergency services on the scene, the volunteer lifeboat crew immediately began giving CPR to the casualty who was unconscious when they arrived. 'After approximately five minutes the search and rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose also arrived on scene, after which the casualty was handed to the care of the helicopter crew and taken to Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro.' Police have appealed for witnesses to the tragic 9pm incident but are not treating it as suspicious. A . spokesman added: 'It is believed the male . may have been swimming in or near an area renowned for whirlpools.' Tragedy: Mr Cockle, 28, drowned in Carnsew Pool, near Hoyle, Cornwall . In December 2008 Jacob, of Hayle, cheated death while surfing after becoming trapped between a stone pier and a freak 30ft wave. He almost drowned when the monster wave emerged from nowhere and charged towards him at speeds of more than 40mph. Clinging helplessly to his board, he was tossed into the air 'like a rag doll' when the wave - with a mass of seven tonnes - broke over him at Newlyn, near Penzance in Cornwall. His work has also previously featured on the Mail Online. Andy Hughes, a former friend from the Royal College of Art, said on Facebook: 'We remember Jacob at college and have one of his great photographs on permanent display. 'I remember looking at his underwater shots, he was very good and will be missed by many'. Georgie Burdett wrote: 'RIP Jacob Cockle. Beautiful soul, positive personality, fantastic surfer, amazing photographer, all round good guy taken to soon'. Detective Constable Damien Ayling, of Devon and Cornwall Police, warned that whirlpools are highly dangerous. 'This . is a very dangerous area to swim. The amount of water and the speed of . the water is dangerous for anyone, no matter how strong that person . thinks they are at swimming, or no matter what equipment they use in the . water,' he told ITV News. David . Walker, leisure safety manager for the Royal Society for the Prevention . of Accidents, said: 'In general, currents can catch out even the most . experienced swimmers. 'For . holidaymakers looking for somewhere to swim, it is worth swimming on . beaches with lifeguards and between the safety flags. Also ask advice . about prevailing conditions and swimming information about the area.'","Jacob Cockle, 28, airlifted to hospital after being dragged from the water .

"By . Michael Seamark . and James Slack . and Rebecca Evans . Relief: Gary McKinnon with his mother Janis yesterday. He will not face any criminal charges . Gary McKinnon’s ten-year nightmare was finally over yesterday after police and prosecutors decided he will not stand trial in Britain. The computer hacker won his fight against extradition two months ago when Theresa May blocked US demands to send him there. That decision marked a victory for the Daily Mail’s An Affront to British Justice campaign. Now Director of Public Prosecutions . Keir Starmer has announced that the 46-year-old Asperger’s sufferer, who . medical experts warned would be very likely to kill himself if . extradited, will not face criminal charges in this country either. Speaking last night Mr McKinnon said: ‘This is the cherry on the cake, it’s just amazing. ‘It has been a terrifying experience hanging over me for so long. I now feel like a huge weight has been lifted from me.’ His mother Janis Sharp said: ‘This will be the 11th Christmas since his arrest and it is the first time we can celebrate. ‘We can all now finally breathe a sigh . of relief. I no longer have the feeling of constant terror that my son . will be taken away from me.’ The decision not to bring charges came on Mrs Sharp’s 64th birthday. She added: ‘I couldn’t ask for a better birthday present. ‘It’s just wonderful. The next thing I would like to get, impossible though it seems, would be a pardon from President Obama.’ Mrs Sharp said she hoped that the US . authorities would now drop their extradition warrant for her son, who . has always been willing to stand trial in the UK. Threat: The autistic alleged hacker was saved from extradition to the U.S. in October . ‘He regrets what he’s done. He wishes . he hadn’t done it. He wishes he hadn’t upset the Americans. We all . regret it. But I’m grateful to Theresa May that this is all over now.’ If extradited, Mr McKinnon, from Wood . Green, North London, faced up to 60 years behind bars for hacking into . Pentagon and Nasa computers looking for the existence of ‘little green . men’. But in a dramatic, 11th-hour decision . in October, the Home Secretary defied  American demands and blocked his . removal under the controversial 2003 Extradition Act. Her announcement, in a statement to . the Commons, drew cheers from MPs and marked a watershed for the Mail . campaign, launched in 2009 to allow Mr McKinnon to be tried here. Relief: Ms Sharp spoke of her joy at seeing her son cleared on Friday, which is her birthday . Saga: Mr McKinnon, pictured in 2005, has been embroiled in his legal battle for more than a decade . The campaign had attracted widespread . political support and celebrities had also added their voices in the . fight to keep him in the UK. Mrs May told MPs that his extradition . ‘would give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life that a . decision to extradite would be incompatible with Mr McKinnon’s human . rights’. His fate then rested in the hands of the DPP, who had to decide whether Mr McKinnon should stand trial in a British court. In a statement on behalf of the Crown . Prosecution Service and Metropolitan Police, Mr Starmer said nothing had . changed from 2002, when it was decided that the appropriate place for a . trial was the United States. He said: ‘Most of the witnesses are in the . US, as is nearly all the physical evidence and the bulk of the unused . material, some of which is sensitive.’ No charge: Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, ruled that Mr McKinnon should not stand trial . British prosecutors met US Justice officials last month to discuss transferring the case  to Britain. But Mr Starmer said: ‘The potential . difficulties in bringing a case in England and Wales now should not be . underestimated, not least the passage of time, the logistics of . transferring sensitive evidence prepared for a court in the US to London . for trial, the participation of US government witnesses in the trial . and the need fully to comply with the duties of disclosure imposed on . the CPS. ‘The prospects of a conviction against Mr McKinnon which reflects the full extent of his alleged criminality are not high.’ How Mail took up the fight . The Americans had been willing to . co-operate, said the DPP, but he added: ‘However, they do not consider . that making all the US witnesses available for trial in London and . transferring all of the US material to this jurisdiction would be in the . interests of justice given our representations and the reasons for the . decision that the US was the appropriate forum.’ Mr McKinnon’s lawyer Karen Todner . said: ‘I have mixed feelings about this – I am pleased he is not going . to be prosecuted because I wouldn’t want to think he would ever spend . any time in prison given his mental situation. ‘But I am disappointed because the . extradition warrant is still outstanding because he can’t travel . anywhere outside of the UK and will have this hanging over him until . it’s resolved.’","Gary McKinnon will not face charges, says Director of Public Prosecutions .

This . was the 35th meeting between the two men but only their second grand . slam final - the first came back in 2007 at the US Open - and second . match at Wimbledon. Federer won both of those clashes, and the third set appeared crucial to his hopes of a repeat.

But at the biggest moment of the match, Djokovic faltered and back came Federer again, the Swiss breaking serve to trail only 5-4 while his opponent lay sprawled on the ground. Still it looked like it would not be enough as Djokovic brought up a first match point, but Federer, the man who loathes Hawk-Eye, may revise his opinion after a challenge gave him an ace. The missed chances must have haunted Djokovic and he handed Federer a second straight break. Federer duly served out one of the most remarkable sets of his long career. The momentum was all with Federer, and physically Djokovic was struggling too, taking a medical time-out after the third game of the fifth set for treatment to his right leg. Federer piled on the pressure in the seventh game and brought up a break point but then netted a backhand. Djokovic held and suddenly he was the man pushing forward as Federer faced three break points. Each time the Swiss came up with an answer.The third, when he dug a half-volley off his toes, was one of the shots of the championship. But Djokovic was pressing intensely and two games later he brought up two match points. This time Federer could not fight back, the Swiss netting a backhand as Djokovic celebrated a hugely emotional victory after three hours and 57 minutes.","Djokovic took the game 6-7 (7/9) 6-4 7-6 (7/4) 5-7 6-4 to win the Wimbledon men's singles title .

"By . Snejana Farberov . 'Monster': Samuel Cabrera, 27, is accused of murdering his 3-month-old son by beating the child to death . A Philadelphia man has been arrested after police say he beat his 3-month-old son to death and then tried to make it look like an accident. Samuel Cabrera, 27, has been charged with murder in the death of Samuel Cabrera Jr, who passed away after suffering a slew of internal injuries. Last Tuesday, the toddler was rushed from his family's home in the 600 block of North 63rd Street to the Children's Hospital in critical condition. Doctors say all of the boy's internal organs had been crushed, and the toddler also had two broken bones and a ruptured spleen, NBC News reported. When Mr Cabrera and the victim’s mother had been questioned by police, the couple's stories did not match up. The mother, who has not been charged in the killing, allegedly told investigators that she and her boyfriend found little Samuel pale and unconscious. According to the woman, the boy suffered bruises after she and Cabrera pounded on his chest while performing CPR. The 27-year-old father, however, offered a different version of events, telling police that he was trying to get the family dog off he coach when he accidentally hit the baby. Crime scene: The tragedy unfolded in Cabrera's family home in the 600 block of North 63rd Street . Cover-up: When he was initially questioned by police, Mr Cabrera said he accidentally hit the boy while trying to get the family dog (pictured) off the couch . NBC 10 sources claimed that Cabrera eventually confessed to killing the boy. Besides little Samuel, the couple have been living with Cabrera's 15-year-old daughter and his girlfriend’s three children from a previous relationship. All four children are currently staying with relatives. Detectives say they spotted bruises on the suspect’s teenage daughter and are now trying to determine if she was also abused by her father. Mr Cabrera is due in court for a preliminary hearing May 1. Heartbreaking outcome: Little Samuel passed away at the Children's Hospital from what doctors described as crushed internal organs and ruptured spleen .","Samuel Cabrera, 27, initially told police he accidentally hit boy while trying to get dog off a couch .

"By . Alex Ward . Denies racist attack: Alec Baldwin (pictured with wife Hilaria Thomas today) denies being racist in an altercation with a photographer . Alec Baldwin has denied making a racist attack on a photographer but admits shouting abuse at a woman reporter during the altercation with paparazzi in New York. Photographer G.N. Miller claims Baldwin yelled racial epithets and other insults while he was trying to take photographs of the actor outside his Manhattan apartment on Sunday. New York Post reporter Tara Palmeri also says he shouted abuse at her as she tried to ask him questions about his wife Hilaria's lawsuit involving her work as a yoga instructor. Today Baldwin, 54, looking particularly drained and worn out, admitted that he had shouted abuse at the pair, yelling: 'I hope you choke to death.' In an interview with Gothamist he argued that while it was a hateful comment, it was not one meant to be taken seriously. The 30 Rock star allegedly called Miller, who is black, a racial epithet, a 'coon', 'a drug dealer', a 'crackhead' and made disparaging remarks about his mother, according to Miller's police statement. The New York Post claims that . the comments were recorded on Ms Palmeri’s tape recorder and that the . tape had been sent to police for investigation. Baldwin admitted today that he has struggled to deal with the press. He told Gothamist that: ‘The one . element of culpability I have is I did let it get to me, and I have been . confrontational with them.’ The . actor filed an assault complaint on Monday after the incident . while the photographer later filed a harassment complaint. Coffee run: Stepping out for a stroll to get a coffee, Baldwin looked particularly worn out today (right) compared to yesterday (left) as he admitted that he struggles to deal with the press hounding him, admitting that he has 'been confrontational with them' in the past . 'Choke to death': Alec Baldwin was questioned by New York Port reporter Tara Palmeri and admits telling her to 'choke to death' but denies saying a racist remark to photographer G.N Miller . Harassment claims: Alec Baldwin filed an allegation of assault against New York Post reporter Tara Palmeri, pictured left, and photographer G.N Miller but they also accused him of the same offence after the incident . Baldwin said that Miller had followed him as he walked along the street and kept putting his camera right into the actor’s face, making him feel threatened. Baldwin said: ‘I want to say on the record that I've had a lot of experience with this, and I've never had someone do it as blatantly as him.’ The New York Post reported that investigators were taking the allegations ‘very seriously’ and that Baldwin had been questioned by hate crimes detectives about the altercation. 'Outrageous' allegations: Baldwin refutes the allegations he made racist remarks toward Miller on Sunday but admitted that he did say to G.N. Miller and New York Post reporter Tara Palmeri: 'I hope you choke to death' Complaints made: A reporter tries to get comment from Baldwin yesterday in New York after he filed an assault complaint, while Miller filed a harassment complaint . Hate crime detectives: Police are said to be taking allegations 'very seriously' that Baldwin called Miller a 'coon' and a 'crack head' Baldwin refused to comment to a mass of reporters outside his apartment building today. Pursued: Baldwin had been approached on Sunday to comment on a lawsuit against his wife due to harsh conditions a New Yorker endured in her yoga class in January . Before the altercation on Sunday morning, Baldwin had been approached by a New York Post reporter and was asked for a comment about the lawsuit against his wife, Hilaria Thomas. The Post claims that Baldwin then grabbed the female reporter by her arm and said: 'I want you to choke to death.' She allegedly recorded the comment and played it to police. His wife, Ms Thomas took to Twitter to defend her husband. She posted: ‘Shame on anyone who says my husband is racist. If you could only see/hear the dangerous things paparazzi will do & the lies to get a “story”.’ Ms Thomas is being sued by New Yorker Spencer Wolff due to harsh conditions he endured during a yoga class she conducted, it was revealed last week. Mr Wolff says he suffered ‘serious’ and ‘severe’ injuries and ‘emotional upset’ during her January 15 class at Yoga Vida in Greenwich Village, according to the lawsuit he filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. The lawsuit does not specify exactly how Wolff was injured. Wolff does, however, cite the ‘overcrowded’ class and Ms Baldwin's ‘negligence’ as two of the causes of his alleged injuries. Ms Baldwin, 28, has been teaching yoga since 2005, according to Yoga Vida’s website.","Photographer G.N. Miller claims Alec Baldwin yelled racial epithets at him .

"By . Tamara Cohen . 'The opportunities are enormous': Drilling for shale gas should take place 'all over rural parts of the UK', Owen Paterson has declared . Drilling for shale gas should take place ‘all over rural parts of the UK’, Owen Paterson has declared. The Environment Secretary risks a clash with green groups over his plans for the controversial technology, but says Britain must cash in on gas trapped in rocks deep underground to ‘create prosperity and jobs’. He said shale has already dramatically reduced gas prices in the US, now a net exporter of energy, and it would be done safely in Britain. ‘The opportunities here are enormous,’ he said during questioning by a House of Lords committee yesterday. ‘I would like to see shale gas exploited all over rural parts of the UK.’ Mr Paterson said opponents of fracking, such as those who besieged an exploratory well in Balcombe in Sussex last year, were ‘doing a good job at alarming the public’ and admitted that the Government had to do more to convince the country of its benefits. And he said the supporters of fracking had to make their voices heard, as he conceded opponents are currently getting their message across more effectively on Facebook and Twitter. ‘We have to be more glass half-full’, Mr Paterson said. ‘The fact is I would like to see shale gas exploited all over rural parts of the UK. We need to get on the front foot.’ The shale gas thought to be beneath Lancashire alone could meet Britain’s need for half a century. David Cameron has thrown his weight behind a drilling programme and offered generous tax breaks for fracking firms announced in January. In addition local communities have been promised a £100,000 sweetener if a test well is ‘fracked’ near them, as well as one per cent of future revenues. Mr Paterson said ‘It really is important to convince people. There is absolutely no way we are cutting corners or cutting down the rigour of our environmental regulation, and done professionally and properly there is nothing to fear.’ He said people ‘shouldn’t turn their nose up’ at the community payments. ‘It’s very significant money’, he said. Opposition: Mr Paterson said opponents of fracking, such as these who besieged an exploratory well in Balcombe, Sussex, last year, were 'doing a good job at alarming the public' Greenpeace’s Lawrence Carter hit back: ‘Amidst the usual jumble of bogus claims and exaggerations, Paterson has spoken one embarrassing truth - the government has failed to convince the public that fracking is safe. 'This is why ministers are planning to speed up the issuing of fracking permits whilst stripping away legal protections for homeowners who don’t want companies drilling under their homes.’","Owen Paterson tells Lords committee 'the opportunities are enormous'

"By . Toby Harnden . A group of former U.S. Navy SEALs, other Special Forces troops and CIA operatives is to launch a national campaign to tell Barack Obama: ‘Mr. President, you did not kill Osama bin Laden, America did.’ The group, calling itself OPSEC, short for Operational Security, will also highlight the slew of national security leaks from the Obama administration, which Mitt Romney has also focused on. And in May, former and serving SEALS told MailOnline of their dismay that Obama had begun to use the killing of the terror mastermind to his own political advantage. Scroll down for video . Not in my name: Navy SEAL Ben Smith speaks out against the Obama administration's leaking of classified material . Spreading the message: OPSEC insists it is nonpartisan and not connected to any presidential campaign or political party . 'Intelligence and Special Operations members are angry and frustrated at how our work has been used for political advantage by officials across government, including President Obama himself who bears special responsibility as Commander in Chief,' Scott Taylor, chairman of OPSEC and a former SEAL, told Reuters. 'We want the American people to . understand the cost of these leaks and politicization both on those who . serve and on our national security and to hold those in positions of . leadership accountable if it doesn’t stop.' Last . month, Ryan Zinke, a retired SEAL commander and Republican state . senator, launched a new super PAC to run ads in swing states against . Obama. In 2004, the famous . Swift Boat ads of 2004 cast doubt on Senator John Kerry's Vietnam . service and could well have cost him the White House. Savvy: Obama pictured having breakfast today with military veterans in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Former Navy SEALs are to launch a national campaign criticizing him for using their work to his political advantage . Leaders of the OPSEC insist it is nonpartisan and not connected to any presidential campaign or political party. Its opening attack on Obama is a 22-minute film. In it, Ben Smith, a former SEAL, says: 'Mr. President, you did not kill Osama bin Laden, America did. The work that the American military has done killed Osama bin Laden. You did not. 'As a citizen, it is my civic duty to tell the president to stop leaking information to the enemy. It will get Americans killed.' The video also contains an emotional interview with Debbie Lee, mother of Marc Alan Lee, the first  Navy SEAL to be killed in Iraq, to honor her son's sacrifice for his country. MailOnline was the first to report . dissatisfaction among SEALs with what they saw as Obama's unseemly . attempts to highlight his own role in the death of bin Laden. Zinke was among those interviewed. Sacrifice: Debbie Lee (left) speaks on the OPSEC video. Her son Marc Alan Lee (right, with his mother) was the first Navy SEAL killed in Iraq . Their dismay was triggered by an Obama campaign ad entitled 'One Chance'. In it President Bill Clinton was featured saying that Obama took 'the harder and the more honorable path' in ordering that bin Laden be killed. The words 'Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?' were then displayed. The White House also marked the first anniversary of the SEAL Team Six raid that killed bin Laden inside his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan with a series of briefings and an NBC interview in the Situation Room designed to highlight the 'gutsy call' made by Obama. In a press conference, Obama trumpeted  his personal role and implied that Romney, who in 2008 expressed reservations about the wisdom of sending troops into Pakistan, would have let bin Laden live. Critical: a group of former Navy SEALs has slated Obama for national security leaks including information surrounding the death of Osama bin Laden . Compromised: The video released by a group of military experts believes that the assassination of Osama bin Laden (left) was compromised by the speed in which President Obama (right) announced it to the country . 'I said that I'd go after bin Laden if we had a clear shot at him, and I did,' Mr Obama said. 'If there are others who have said one thing and now suggest they'd do something else, then I'd go ahead and let them explain it.' Obama has sought to capitalise on his foreign policy record on the stump, emphasising the death of bin Laden, the end of the Iraq war and his plans to pull troops out of Afghanistan. But Romney and other Republicans have pointed to media stories reports about secret drone attacks, informers within al Qaeda and cyber warfare attacks against Iran that have helped boost image as a strong leader. Combat: The new video suggests that Obama is fighting personal political battles using the work of the U.S. military . Intelligence: Retired CIA officer Dave LaMorte (left) and operative Simon (right), who could not reveal his identity, spoke of the dangers that the American military were being placed in because of government leaks . Scott Taylor, president of Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund Incorporated and a former SEAL who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for a congressional seat in Virginia in 2010, said his group was a 'watchdog organisation' but added that the Obama administration 'has certainly leaked more than others'. Fred Rustmann, a former CIA case and now OPSEC spokesman, said its focus on leaks was 'not a partisan concern' but the Obama administration had been leaking ‘to help this guy get re-elected, at the expense of peoples' lives', adding: 'We want to see that they don't do this again.' The Obama administration is pointing to a CNN interview last month in which Admiral William McRaven, who oversaw the raid, said: 'At the end of the day, make no mistake about it, it was the president of the United States that shouldered the burden for this operation, that made the hard decisions, that was instrumental in the planning process, because I pitched every plan to him.'","Ben Smith, former SEAL, says: 'It is my civic duty to tell the president to stop leaking .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Seek and destroy: The lethal Predator drone is 27ft long and comes armed with Hellfire missiles . Drones are used for lethal and non-lethal purposes: they can track drug smugglers, monitor borders and search for earthquake victims, and environmentalists use them to catch illegal whalers and loggers. But hundreds of drones have crashed in the last 14 years with documents uncovered by the Washington Post that show many catastrophes have been narrowly averted, often by a few feet, or a few seconds, or pure luck. Military drones have slammed into homes, farms, runways, highways, waterways and, in one of the most serious accidents an Air Force C-130 Hercules transport plane collide with a drone in midair. The driving force behind the most sophisticated drones remains the military, who use them for spying and killing. Their proliferation has led to thousands of deaths, the disruption of entire communities and increased political instability. In August 2011, the enormous transport place was descending towards Forward Operating Base Sharana, in eastern Afghanistan when suddenly it crashed into the drone. 'Holy s**t!' yelled the Hercules’s navigator, 'We got hit by a UAV! Hit by a UAV!' The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was being flown remotely by a crew on the ground and smashed into the cargo plane’s left wing between two propellers. Jet fuel came pouring out of the wing. Luckily the crew of the Hercules were able to shut down an engine and landed within two minutes of the accident happening. Scroll down for video... Downed drone: The wreckage of a Predator drone that crashed into Kandahar air base in May 2011 . Flying blind: Air Force Maj. Richard Wageman operates a Predator from a ground-control station in Afghanistan on Oct. 25, 2008. A week later, he was the pilot of a Predator that crashed into a U.S. military base. The precise cause of the crash was undetermined . The impact left an enormous hole in planes' wing. About 50 seconds later, the drone operator came across the radio to inform the control tower he had lost track of his aircraft. The tower was able to set him straight. 'We had a, ah, C-130, um, that hit a UAV. I’m suspecting that it’s yours.' The official finding of what caused the crash was censored. Some of the documents obtained by the Washington Post indicate the air-traffic controller was at least partly blamed. Military officials said there has been only one other case of a midair drone collision, involving a helicopter and a small, hand-launched drone in Iraq a decade ago but there have been more plenty of other incidents on the ground. In one accident in Afghanistan, armed Predator drones crashed near residential areas in the city of Jalalabad twice in the space of six months. The first time, the drone smashed into a housing complex. The second was into a row of shipping containers. The military paid compensation to those who were affected. Mistake: An Afghan housing compound that was destroyed in another U.S. military drone crash in Jalalabad later that year . U.S. navy sailors and Filipino soldiers retrieve a drone after it had crashed into the sea off the.. southern Philippines city of Zamboanga . On another occasion, a drone was slammed into a 17,000 foot mountain because the 'pilot' was distracted by storm clouds. Maintenance of the drones has also been a cause of some accidents. A broken propeller downed one of the machines. In other instances a drone was flown by an inexperienced officer who forgot to turn the stabilizer on (or perhaps unforgivably, turned it off!) The unmanned aircraft took a nose dive soon after takeoff - and it was all caught on camera. Part of the reasons for so many accidents was the design of the Predator drone. It had only one engine, one alternator, one propeller. If any of those parts failed, the plane would come down. Collision: In one of the more shocking incidents, a drone flew into the wing of a C-130 Hercules military transport plane. The plane was just minutes from touching down,m but it could have resulted in a very serious accident . In September 2004 armed insurgents are holding parts of a US Army remote controlled drone. The US military cited mechanical failure as the most likely cause of the crash . Technology: The Predator's infrared camera can identify a human from 10,000ft in the air . On six occasions between 2006 and . 2012, records show, pilots intentionally flew straight into the side of a . mountain after their aircraft’s engines began to fail. The . thinking was it would be safer to fly into the ground in a remote area . than risk some kind of attempt at landing where the drone could fall on . someone. They're prone . to bad weather such as high wind, lightening and icing. A drone fell . into the sea after chunk of ice fell off the tail. Following the 9/11 attacks on New . York in 2001, the US military filled its shopping trolleys with every . type of drone on the production line and commissioned new ones. In 2000, the Pentagon had fewer than 50 . drones. A decade later, that number had soared to nearly 7,500. Most . were used for surveillance, but the number of weapons strikes kept . increasing, from 74 in 2007 to 839 by 2012. They bought the 38in-long Raven which fits in a rucksack and can be launched by throwing it into the air. They invested in the 27ft-long Predator with its Hellfire missiles, and later the more powerful Reaper version. Pakistani security personnel examine a crashed American surveillance drone some two kilometres inside Pakistani territory in the town of Chaman in the insurgency-hit Baluchistan province in August 2011 . Powerful: The Reaper model can ling in the air for about 18 hours but others have an endurance of weeks . The . Predator’s infrared camera can identify the heat of a human from . 10,000ft in the air, so from 8,000 miles away in Nevada a drone ‘pilot’ or operator can watch an Afghan as he lights a cigarette or talks to . friends. Then the US bought the 40ft-long Global Hawk with its long-range surveillance capability of 40,000 square miles a day. Drones . can fly low and slow over hostile terrain, and hover for hours, or all . day if need be. The Reaper can linger in the air for about 18 hours. Others have an endurance of weeks. Then there is the Vulture. Solar panels cover its massive 400ft wingspan and enable it to stay in the air for up to five years. Boeing has already produced a prototype for its Phantom Ray drone, roughly the size of a fighter jet, which flies itself. Since the drone program began, the Air Force has acquired 269 Predators. Going nowhere: More than 400 large U.S. military drones have crashed in major accidents around the world since 2001, a record of calamity that exposes the potential dangers of throwing open American skies to drone traffic . The . company that makes the drones says a redesign with two engines is . simply not possible because of the enormous amount of design work it . would entail. The Air Force . has acknowledged that Predators crash more frequently than regular . military aircraft, but officials said the drone’s safety record has . improved markedly. Sometimes, . the planes simply disappear. Few carry transponders that work when the . electrical power has failed because of the extra weight.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A piece of chewed bubblegum proves that New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez murdered his friend Odin Lloyd in an abandoned industrial park, prosecutors claim. Hernandez, 23, was yesterday charged with shooting Lloyd five times in what was described as an 'orchestrated execution' at the disused park just minutes from his mansion in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Yesterday at a hearing in Attleboro District Court prosecutors said that on the night of the murder, Hernandez stopped at a gas station and bought gas, cigarettes and crucially a packet of blue cotton candy-flavoured Bubblicious bubble gum. Scroll down for video . Murder charge: Prosecutors say a chewed piece of bubblegum can prove that football star Aaron Hernandez murdered his friend Odin Lloyd at an abandoned industrial park . Evidence: A chewed piece of bubblicious cotton candy bubble gum was found next to a spent bullet casing in the dumpster of the rental company where Hernandez had hired an SUV . Assistant District Attorney Willam McCauley told the court that the following morning, Hernandez returned the rental car to the hire company and exchanged it for a new vehicle. The returned car was subsequently cleaned at the rental company where police went through the dumpster and discovered a bullet shell casing next to which was a chewed piece of blue cotton candy Bubblicious bubble gum. Victim: Odin Lloyd was found dead less than a mile away from the $1.3million mansion of New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez . The casing, for a .45 calibre handgun, is understood to match those found at the scene of the crime. Mr McCauley said that surveillance video from Hernandez's own home security cameras show two friends arriving at his $1.3million mansion with the three of them leaving at approximately 1:12 a.m., with Hernandez at the wheel. After stopping at the gas station, Hernandez is said to have driven to nearby Dorchester where he picked up Lloyd. Apparently, Lloyd had misgivings about the meeting and sent text messages to his family. 'Did you see who I am with?' he asked. Then he responded, cryptically, 'NFL,' prosecutor said. Mobile phone records show that the last time Lloyd used his phone was to text his sister at around 3:23am. He wrote 'Just so you know.' At the moment the text was sent, . Hernandez's car was caught on camera going down a gravel road to the . industrial area where Lloyd's body was found before returning four . minutes later, at 3:27 a.m. Prosecutors claim that when Lloyd stepped out of the . SUV, Hernandez allegedly shot him one in the chest with a .45-caliber . pistol - knocking Lloyd to the ground. As . he lay on the ground, Lloyd reached up in an attempt to shield himself. Hernandez allegedly shot him four more times in the chest. At 3.29am Hernandez is seen returning home with video from his own surveillance cameras allegedly showing him carrying what Mr McCauley described as a 'large black gun'. Hearing: A member of the state's attorney's office went through the detailed evidence against Hernandez . It is believed that Hernandez, a tight end who had a $37.5million NFL contract, was angry at Lloyd because he had talked to the 'wrong people' at a nightclub. Hernandez is being held without bail, with the judge citing the gravity of the crime as the main reason behind his decision. Hernandez has hired two of the . nation's top criminal defense attorneys, who maintain that the evidence . against him is 'circumstantial.' According to the Boston Globe, . prosecutors revealed that Hernandez 'orchestrated' the murder of Lloyd . because he had talked to a group of people that Hernandez 'had trouble . with' at a Boston nightclub on Friday night. Dead Spin reports that prosecutors have a video showing Hernandez with a handgun saying 'You can't trust anyone anymore' before making the trip to pick up Lloyd. Prosecutors said Hernandez and his wo men picked 27-year-old Lloyd up at his house in Dorchester early Monday morning in the rented SUV. In custody: The state's attorney argued that Hernandez had the means to flee and should be held without bail before his trial . Weeping: Relatives of murder victim Odin Lloyd were in the courtroom when Hernandez was charged . Support: Hernandez's live-in girlfriend Shayanna Jenkins was visibly emotional when she left the courthouse without him . The investigation started more than a . week ago after semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd was found slain in an . industrial park in North Attleborough, on the Rhode Island line not far . from where the Patriots play. Video emerged of Hernandez being taken . from his home in handcuffs, which followed after Massachusetts state . police - wearing wetsuits and armed with metal detectors - combed . through a stream near his home yesterday. However, the officers left . empty-handed after turning up no new evidence in the execution-style . murder of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd, who was reportedly last . seen partying with Hernandez in Boston. A Massachusetts court said yesterday it had sealed documents related to the killing of Odin. Attleboro . District Court officials said documents related to the case, including . search warrants, have been impounded, meaning the public can't see them. Trouble: The Patriots player had a connection to the victim . Next step: After his arraignment, he was transferred by the Bristol County Sheriff's office . Get comfortable: The 23-year-old was dropped by the Patriots shortly after he was arrested Wednesday morning . On . Saturday, investigators and police canines searched Hernandez's . $1.3million mansion for a second time. They left with several brown . paper bags of evidence, but did not make an arrest. Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, was friends with Hernandez and was with him on Monday morning before he was shot in the head.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Santa threw Delta customers a late Christmas gift today after the airline's website allowed visitors to book round trip flights for as low as $20. Delta Airlines didn't intend to post the low fares, but they say they will honor the 'mistake fares' purchased on their site. Yahoo news reported that people began reporting the mistake fares on websites like flyertalk.com at 9 a.m. and that the low fares disappeared from Delta's website at 10:45 am. Earlier this morning Delta offered round trip flights on their website for as low as $20 . The fares were also available on Expedia.com, Priceline.com, and other travel websites. Delta issues a statement after customers wondered whether or not they would be able to use their inexpensive tickets to fly to their destinations. 'For a portion of the morning today, some prices on delta.com and other booking channels were incorrectly displayed, resulting in lower than usual fares for customers,' the airline said in a statement. 'The situation has been resolved, and the correct prices are being displayed. Delta will honor any fares purchased at the incorrect price.' ABC News reported that at 1 p.m. Google Flights still showed incredibly low fares and a fare from New York City to Los Angeles cost only $47 when it typically would cost $400. The blogs on Flyertalk.com were flooded with cheap Delta flight finds. 'Yeah, I see a bunch of crazy DL fares this morning on google flights. DTW-MIA for $31, DTW-PHX for $52, etc. What?? Clicking through yields much higher prices. Momentary fare misload or google flights confusion?' said commenter LBJ. Its a free ride once you've already paid, especially when you've already paid just $20 . 'Yup this one's crazy. OAK-MIA for $65 for NYE,' said flyertalk commenter cjwong88. Searching for 'mistake fares' is somewhat of a hobby for some travel enthusiasts who frequent the site. This isn't the first time an airline has had a 'mistake fare.' Yahoo reported that earlier this year, United Airlines accidentally made fares $0 and they honored the free purchases and allowed the customer to travel. ABC reported that Delta's contract of carriage states that in the event of an 'erroneous' fare, ' Delta reserves the right to cancel the ticket purchase and refund all amounts paid by the purchaser or, at the purchaser's option, to reissue the ticket for the correct fare.' However a rule enforced by the Department of Transportation says that an airline must honor a ticket purchase even if it was a mistake.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . Investigators dug at a mass grave site through the night searching for more bodies and any connection to the mysterious disappearance of 12 young people from a bar in an upscale area of Mexico City three months ago. Seven corpses covered in lime and sand were found Thursday in a shallow grave on a ranch in Tlalmanalco east of the capital, a federal agent said. By evening, more backhoes were seen entering the property as excavators continued the search. Mexico City prosecutor Rodolfo Rios, who confirmed the discovery of seven bodies, said DNA tests would take two to three days to determine if the remains belonged to the missing revelers. Hallowed ground: Vans belonging to Mexican authorities arrive at the entrance of a ranch where a mass grave was found in Tlalmanalco, Mexico . Police presence: A Ministerial Federal Police truck blocks the entrance to Rancho La Mesa Ecological Park during the discovery of seven corpses . Large-scale operation: Mexican police officers with K-9 dogs look for evidence in the surroundings of a park in the municipality of Tlalmanalco . They vanished from the after-hours Heaven club at midday May 26, just a block from the leafy Paseo de Reforma, the capital's equivalent of the Champs-Elysees in Paris, and not from the US Embassy. The bizarre disappearance resonated across the city of 9 million people because many had come to believe it was an oasis from Mexico's cartels and drug violence. The mass abduction of 12 mirrored crimes in drug-trafficking hot spots such as the western state of Guerrero, where 20 Mexican men from neighboring Michoacan disappeared, only to be found in a mass grave, or in Nuevo Leon, where the bodies of 17 kidnapped musicians were found at the bottom of a well. Mexico City officials have insisted since the Heaven kidnapping that large drug cartels do not operate in the capital. But the case has been a political liability, with local polls saying the public is overwhelmingly opposed to how the administration of Mayor Miguel Mancera has handled the investigation.

Worst fears: A relative of one of the twelve missing people who disappeared from Heaven club is covered with a jacket in Rancho La Mesa Ecological Park . Seeking closure: After hearing the news about the discovery of the mass grave, many relatives of the kidnapped bar-goers flocked to the area . Waiting game: Family members of youths who disappeared in May from a Mexico City nightclub listen to prosecutor Rodolfo Rios (foreground), who Mexico City prosecutor Rodolfo Rios, who said DNA tests would take two to three days . The federal agent at the ranch, who agreed to tell about the search only if not quoted by name because he was not authorized to discuss details of the case, said clothing found with the corpses made it ‘90 per cent sure’ that officials had found the Heaven victims. Other federal officials, however, told the Los Angeles Times that the remains might be as old as 6 months. Authorities kept more than a mile perimeter around the excavation site on a hilly ranch known as La Negra, where federal police and attorney general's trucks and large white vans could be seen. The private property next to Rancho La Mesa Ecological Park is walled and surrounded by rough terrain planted with oak and pine trees. The federal Attorney General's Office said agents had received information about possible illegal weapons on the property and obtained a search warrant. When they started looking around, they discovered the burial. Rural landscape: The private property next to Rancho La Mesa Ecological Park is walled and surrounded by oak and pine trees . Closely guarded: Authorities kept more than a mile perimeter around the excavation site on a hilly ranch known as La Negra . Uncertainty: A federal agent said clothing found on the bodies suggests there is a 90 per cent chance the remains belong to the kidnapping victims, but other officials said the corpses may be up to 6 months old . ‘They found a home that looked like a safe house,’ Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam told reporters. ‘We were operating under the belief it was a weapons case.’ Later, some of the relatives showed up on the property being excavated, crying and covering their faces from the media. ‘We have had three months with this anxiety,’ Maria Teresa Ramos, grandmother of Jerzy Ortiz, one of the missing, told Milenio television. ‘We are dying every day, little by little.’ Prosecutors have said the abductions from the Heaven bar were linked to a dispute between street gangs that control local drug sales in the capital's nightclubs and bars. They say the gangs are based in Mexico City's dangerous Tepito neighborhood, where most of the missing lived. The families insist the missing young people were not involved in drug trafficking. Unexpected find: Agents had received information about possible illegal weapons on the property and obtained a search warrant, only to stumble upon a mass grave . Surveillance cameras showed several cars pulling up to the bar at midday and taking the victims away. The kidnapping victims ranging in age from 16 to 34 years old included three women in their 20s and two teenage sons of accused crime bosses. A witness who escaped told authorities that a bar manager had ordered the music turned off, told patrons that authorities were about to raid the establishment and ordered those inside to leave. So far, five people have been detained in the Heaven case, including club owner Ernesto Espinosa Lobo, known as ‘The Wolf,’ who has been charged with kidnapping. Among the arrested are another bar owner, a driver and a security guard. A fifth, Jose de Jesus Carmona, 32, is under arrest pending charges. One suspect is still a fugitive. In another element of the case that is reminiscent of cartel warfare, one of the owners of the Heaven bar, Dax Rodriguez Ledezma, fled authorities only to turn up dead, his body dumped and burned in a rural area with that of his girlfriend and another friend.","Corpses found in shallow grave on a ranch east of Mexico City .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A Massachusetts man busted for . speeding had a pretty good excuse when he was pulled over: He had just . won a big lottery prize and was on his way to collect his cash. It turns out Thursday was 22-year-old Scott Lowe's lucky day in more ways than one. The officer who pulled him over in Hingham issued a verbal warning and urged him to drive safely. Lowe, of Rockland, told the officer he was speeding because he had won $50,000 on a scratch-off ticket and was on his way to Massachusetts State Lottery headquarters in Braintree to collect his winnings. Scott Lowe (left) not only dodged a speeding ticket, he sped off with thousands of dollars in lottery winnings . Scott Lowe was speeding to cash in this $50,000 winning scratch off ticket when he was pulled over . WCVB-TV reports that police say Lowe was shaking, and showed the officer his winning ticket. According to Hingham police Sergeant Steven Dearth, the man was driving on Sharp Street at 11 a.m. and was going 49 miles per hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone. After the warning, he went on his way and claimed his prize. The officer said, ‘You’ve got to get there slow, otherwise you won’t be able to use your winnings’,' Dearth told the Boston Globe. Lottery officials told the New York Daily News that Lowe filled out the paperwork for his winnings on Thursday and that he walked away with $35,000 after 30 per cent was taken out for taxes. Lowe was not photographed by the state Lottery because $50,000 is not considered a large enough sum of money to merit a photo for most media outlets. 'It came as a big surprise. It's certainly not the fashion in which most people make their way here to claim a prize,' spokeswoman Beth Bresnahan told the Daily News. 'He was very excited and a little shaky because of all the excitement.' The Hingham Police Department thought the event was amusing and shared the story on their Twitter. Luckily Lowe had his lotto ticket with him to prevent him from getting a speeding ticket. Lowe's mother spoke with the Daily News and said that she is slightly concerned for her son's safety because there have been robberies in the area and she fears his new found wealth may attract unwanted attention. The Mail Online contacted Lowe's mother who said she did not wish for her son's photo in the paper for safety reasons as well. The police were so amused by the incident that they decided to share it on their official twitter account .","Scott Lowe, 22, was speeding on Sharp Street in Mass. at 11 a.m. and was stopped for going 49 miles per hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone .

"By . Emma Innes . A mother who ballooned to 20 stone was shamed into shedding the pounds after she broke a miniature train because she was so fat. Kerry Hill, 30, gorged on pizza and greasy takeaways which saw her pile on the pounds as a teenager. At her heaviest, she tipped the scales at 20 stone and was a hefty size 24. Kerry Hill, 30, dropped from 20st to 12st 5lbs after her weight brought a miniature train to a standstill . The 999 call handler was too embarrassed to go shopping with friends or to celebrate her birthday with a party because she could barely walk. She realised enough was enough when she brought an entire train to a stand-still while on a seaside family holiday in Exmouth, Devon, in 2010. The mortified mother-of-two had climbed into the back carriage of the tourist train with her three-year-old son Archie when the carriage collapsed under her weight. She eventually joined Slimming World a year ago and ditched junk food and cooking with oil. She lost an incredible 7st 6lbs to weigh a trim 12st 5lbs and lost seven dress sizes to become a svelte size 12. Ms Hill, from Halesowen, West Midlands, said: ‘I had yo-yo dieted for most of my twenties but nothing ever seemed to worked and the slimmest I got down to was a size 18. Ms Hill dropped from a size 24 to a size 12. She was so large that she could barely walk and was unable to play properly with her young sons as she was too unfit . Ms Hill (pictured before her weight loss) says she started piling on the pounds as a teenager because she became hooked on pizza and takeaways . ‘I just ate loads of takeaways and pizza and also I went out a lot so I drank a lot of alcohol. ‘The main problem was I was not eating properly and would skip breakfast and then just eat packaged sandwiches for lunch and have takeaways in the evening. ‘There would always be that feeling of being the fat friend and if I was in a shop with friends they would be picking out all the nice clothes but there wouldn’t be anything in my size. ‘I used to have to buy all my clothes online and I would have to prepare outfits months in advance. When she decided to lose weight, Ms Hill joined Slimming World and cut out junk food and pizza from her diet . She decided she had to lose weight after she brought this tourist train to a standstill during a family holiday to Devon in 2010. She says she was extremely embarrassed by the experience . ‘I felt really isolated when I was overweight and I could barely walk, I was so unfit. ‘But the turning point was when I pretty much derailed a train in Exmouth. ‘It was mortifying, I just wanted to cry but I held it all in. The carriageway just gave way and I dislodged it. ‘The driver called back when the train wouldn’t move and said “there is too much weight in the back” and it was obviously me. Ms Hill (pictured before her weight loss) says she was so fat that she was embarrassed to go shopping with her friends and avoided parties as she could barely walk . Ms Hill said: 'Getting to a size 12 was amazing, I hadn't been a size 12 since I was a young teenager. Buying my first size 12 trousers and dresses was so good' ‘We then had to swap with a family who were sat in the middle of the carriage and he had to re-attach the carriage. ‘It was terrible, I can remember people were sniggering and giggling as we moved but I just tried to ignore it. ‘It was in the middle of the holiday and for the rest of the week I just felt so self-conscious, it really affected me. I realised I had to lose the weight.’ She added: ‘When I joined Slimming World it all changed. It was a diet that broke the weight loss down into manageable stages. ‘Initially I just wanted to get down to 13 stone but when I got there I realised I could carry on. Ms Hill has been named as a finalist in the Slimming World district Woman of the Year competition and has even set up her own Slimming World class, which she now runs once a week . ‘Getting to a size 12 was amazing, I hadn’t been a size 12 since I was a young teenager. Buying my first size 12 trousers and dresses was so good. ‘Now I eat regular meals and following Slimming World’s plan I never feel hungry and I exercise regularly. I run two to three times a week. ‘I can easily play with my two boys and although my youngest Freddie is only two-years-old, Archie is five-years-old so he has encouraged me through the weight loss. ‘He would say things like “how many stones is mummy now?” and he is much more aware of what he eats and like to be healthy with me.’ Ms Hill has been named a finalist in the Slimming World district Woman of the Year competition and has even set up her own Slimming World class, which she now runs once a week.","Kerry Hill, a mother-of-two, dropped to 12st 5lbs in just a year after being embarrassed that her weight was too much for a tourist train in Devon .

"By . Mark Duell . A top-secret £133million United States Air Force unmanned drone has flown in British airspace for the first time, it was revealed today. The Ministry of Defence said the Global Hawk aircraft flew at 50,000ft across several European countries, including the UK, after leaving an air base in the Mediterranean. It was part of the Nato trial Unified Vision, which aims to assist with the group’s Alliance Ground Surveillance system - expected to become operational with five of the remotely-piloted aircraft. Up in the air: The Ministry of Defence revealed today that the Global Hawk aircraft (file picture) flew at 50,000ft across several European countries, including the UK, after leaving an air base in the Mediterranean . Drone: The flights took place in 'controlled and segregated airspace at heights of approximately 50,000ft' On the ground: Royal Air Force controllers working at the London Area air traffic control centre Swanwick, Hampshire (file picture) Nato said the AGS will give commanders a 'comprehensive picture of the situation on the ground'. The flights took place in ‘controlled and segregated airspace at heights of approximately 50,000ft, well above the cruising altitude of commercial airliners’, according to an MoD press release. It added that the flights ‘made a useful contribution to understanding how remotely-piloted air systems (RPAS) can be safely integrated within the existing aviation framework’. Air Vice Marshal Phil Osborn said: 'It is good to see existing airspace procedures enabling the seamless integration of remotely-piloted air systems, such as the unarmed Global Hawk aircraft, within European airspace. ‘This trial will have helped with the development of the Nato Alliance Ground Surveillance system and the future airspace integration of RPAS.'

The controversial move would allow MI5 and GCHQ, the Government's eavesdropping centre, to step up surveillance operations over the UK. The announcement today comes two weeks after the Pentagon said the US was using at least one Global Hawk to aid in the search for the Nigerian girls kidnapped by Islamist militants Boko Haram. They became the first drones to be certified by the American Federal Aviation Authority for use in civilian air corridors with no advance notice.

"By . Marie-louise Olson . and Ryan Gorman . An unknown object that fascinated the country last month when it stopped the world’s most powerful tunnel boring machine digging underneath Seattle has finally been identified. And officials are shocked. The object is nothing more than an 8-inch diameter steel pipe, but it managed to grind to a halt an $80 million machine that is five-stories high with the world’s widest cutting face. Blocked by a pipe: The left image shows the steel pipe protruding through the machine's cutterhead. It has caused the massive boring machine to grind to a halt underneath Seattle . Identified: The project crew tweeted about their discovery on Thursday . Crews struggled for weeks to reach the object that was blocking ‘Bertha’, the boring machine, from moving forward 60 feet below the surface after it got stuck on December 6. After removing enough water and dirt they finally laid eyes on the mystery object. It is a 115-foot-long well casing that was used to measure ground water in 2002 in studies for the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement project, according to the Seattle Times. The incident has put project officials in a predicament with much to explain to tax payers, as they squabble over whose fault it is, and why the pipe was not known about before the project began. The well site was listed in reference materials provided to bidders as part of the contract specifications, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Taking shape: The tail end of Bertha can be seen up ahead of where a worker inspects the tunnel wall . Bertha is a five story-high drilling machine that was custom-built to drill the Alaska Way Viaduct tunnel beneath Seattle. It has more than 20 workers controlling it and drills a hole more than 57 feet in diameter. It can move six feet at a time and uses cutting tools are removable and are often replaced. For all its high technology, Bertha essentially operates blind; there are no front windows or cameras. It was named after Bertha Knight Landes, Seattle's only female mayor. ‘I don’t want people to say WSDOT . didn’t know where its own pipe was, because it did,’ said spokesman Lars . Erickson to the Times. However, . Chris Dixon, project director for contractor group Seattle Tunnel . Partners, said the builders presumed there would be no pipe in the way, . because casings are customarily removed after use. The . tunnel-machine crew first noticed metal pieces in Bertha’s conveyor . system in early December, after Bertha’s rotation shoved a 55-foot-long . segment of the pipe through the surface. But that didn’t stop the machine, which kept grinding forward just fine, according to Dixon. Officials initially thought it was likely a bolder that was blocking the massive machine. Dixon . told KIRO-TV the tunnel boring machine is able to cut through rock, . clay and concrete, but it can’t battle metal objects very well. Confusion: Matt Preedy from WSDOT, left, and Chris Dixon, project director for contractor group Seattle Tunnel Partners, right, are in conflict over whose fault it is that no one had anticipated the pipe . He . said pipes used for ground-water measuring are usually removed . afterward, which is why the crew did not expect to find the steel . casing. ‘We didn’t know the pipe was there. If we knew it was there, we would have removed it,’ said Dixon. Matt . Preedy from WSDOT refused to comment on whether the incident was due to . someone not reading the reference materials correctly. A plan for how the pipe will be removed has not yet been announced. Bertha is helping dig a tunnel that will replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct on Highway 99. The . problem with just walking down to the object is that it isn’t possible, . Bertha uses huge amounts of pressurized water to help it drill through . the earth. That water will . need to be drained for humans to safely enter. Massive: This is just one piece of Bertha, shown here while being built last year in Japan . A whole roster: It takes a team of 20 people to operate Bertha . How it works: Bertha bores through and breaks up large objects to move them out of the way on a conveyer belt . In the weeks leading up to the object being identified, many Seattlelites . joked about it being missing former Teamsters . leader Jimmy Hoffa, others thought it could be a buried train engine. Others thought it might date back to prohibition, or even further to the gold rush. Readers responding to the Seattle Times asking what they think the object is guessed everything from an asteroid to comedian Andy Kaufman or a UFO. The . number one response, though, was superstar defender Richard Sherman – . famous for shutting down opposing wide receivers almost every week, . The . tunnel is being dug to sink highway 99 underground for a two-mile . stretch down town in an effort similar to Boston’s big dig. The ambitious waterfront project was estimated to cost $3.1billion and be traffic-ready by late 2015.","'Unknown object' is an 8-inch diameter steel pipe casing .

Upton was taken into custody an hour later after a police dog tracked him into nearby woods, where he was found naked. Police said he didn't appear to be drunk or on drugs. D'Amico said it was unclear what the motive was for striking the trooper. He said Upton, 60, told police he was driving to Connecticut to visit his mother. Upton was arraigned on a count of first-degree murder in Town of Chenango Court. It could not immediately be determined if he had a lawyer. He was jailed without bail and couldn't be reached for comment by telephone. The trooper's killing occurred on I-81 northbound between exits 6 and 7, near the Pennsylvania line. Traffic was detoured onto U.S. Route 11. Skinner, 42, was from the Sidney barracks in Delaware County and was a 13-year veteran. The Binghamton resident is survived by his fiancee and two children, ages 12 and 15. In 2011, New York instituted a Move Over law, requiring motorists to slow down and move over when approaching police and emergency vehicles alongside roadways. Skinner is the second New York state trooper killed in a highway crash in the past six months. Trooper David Cunniff died in December from injuries he suffered when his cruiser was rear-ended by a tractor-trailer shortly after he pulled over a car for speeding on the state Thruway near Amsterdam. In April, Trooper Todd Madley escaped serious injury after a car sideswiped his cruiser while he wrote a traffic ticket along Interstate 690 near Syracuse. The driver was ticketed for violating the Move Over law. Skinner is the 15th member of the New York State Police to die in the line of duty since 2006, and his is the fifth line-of-duty death in the last 10 months, said the Police Benevolent Association of the New York State Troopers. The New York Daily News reports that Skinner is survived  by his his fiancee, Surrena, two children - 15-year-old Kyle and 12-year-old Erin ,his mother Sharyn, and his brother Shawn. 'Trooper Skinner selflessly dedicated 13 years of his life to the New York State Police, and his actions have impacted the lives of many,' Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. 'His commitment to the people of this State is commendable and will no doubt be remembered for years to come. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I offer my condolences to his friends and family, and express my deepest gratitude for Trooper Skinner’s service.'

"By . Chris Pleasance . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has branded Cliven Bundy a 'terrorist' and said a federal taskforce has been set up to deal with him . Senator Harry Reid has branded Nevada's last cattle rancher Cliven Bundy and his supporters 'domestic terrorists' who do not respect America. He added that a federal taskforce was being setup to deal with Bundy, who is accused of not paying federal grazing taxes for his cattle for 20 years, and reportedly owes the government $1million. The Bureau of Land Management tried to round up Bundy's cattle last weekend, but were forced to back down after hundreds of supporters, some carrying automatic weapons and sniper rifles, threatened violence. According to the Las Vegas Journal-Review, the Senate Majority Leader said: 'They’re nothing more than domestic terrorists. I repeat: what happened there was domestic terrorism.' 'Cliven Bundy does not recognize the United States. The United States, he says, is a foreign government. He doesn’t pay his taxes. He doesn’t pay his fees. And he doesn’t follow the law.' Reid accused the militia supporting Reid of deliberately putting women and children into the firing line so that, in the event of violence, they got hurt first ensuring the worst possible headlines. Meanwhile Mr Bundy has warned that he will never back down down from his fight. 'They will come, and I don't care,' he told MailOnline. 'The people and citizens of America will win this fight. We have God on our side and we will be better prepared for them next time.' He said supporters from across the U.S., many of the armed a prepared to defend themselves, were heading for the remote town of Bunkersville, about 80 miles from Las Vegas in southern Nevada. He said: 'People have been mobilized by what they have seen and heard and they will come here because they see it as their right to defend the land.' Bundy, a 67-year-old father-of-14 and registered Republican, stopped paying taxes in 1993 . The Government says Bundy (centre) owes them $1million, but he is refusing to pay or leave his land . Bundy, 67, won the first round of his fight with agents from the Bureau of Land Management after they released several hundred cows they had seized as part of a long running dispute over grazing rights in Nevada. Fears of an armed confrontation with dozens of armed militia who had camped out in a field leading to Bundy's ranch led federal officials to call off their operation on Saturday. Supporters of Bundy hailed the decision as a victory - but the decision was taken in part because Clark County Sheriff's feared violence could erupt at any moment. Many of the militia, who wore camouflage clothing and stalked the roads around the Bundy home carrying automatic weapons,said they were prepared to take on the federal agents in a fire fight. One was overheard boasting that he had two agent in his gun sight and could 'take them down.' The dispute between Bundy and federal land managers began in 1993 when he stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze public lands that are also home to imperiled animals such as the Mojave Desert tortoise. Officials tried to round up Bundy's cattle and evict him on April 12 but were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people, some of them armed, turned up and threatened to open fire . Surrounding Bundy's ranch, one armed man (not pictured) was heard saying he had officials 'in his sights' during the heated stand-off earlier this month . Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years. The government also claims Bundy has ignored cancellation of his grazing leases and defied federal court orders to remove his cattle. Last week, they began an operation to seize his cattle prompting the stand off and mini invasion by militia members from California, Arizona, Montana and Utah to rush to his support. Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie was able to negotiate a resolution after talking with Bundy. It has not been revealed if Bundy would pay the estimated $1.2m he owes to the Government. The dispute that ultimately triggered the roundup dates to 1993, when the bureau cited concern for the federally protected tortoise in the region. The bureau revoked Bundy's grazing rights after he stopped paying grazing fees and disregarded federal court orders to remove his animals. The fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management widened into a debate about states' rights and federal land-use policy.","Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid launches attack on Cliven Bundy .

Authorities say Scott Shacklett didn't see his young son Truett as he was mowing his yard in Lenexa, Kansas, on Sunday afternoon. The boy was flown to the hospital and then transferred to the University of Kansas Hospital for surgery. Scroll down for video . This is the home where Truett Shacklett, 4, was run over by his father on a riding lawn mower. He had already lost one leg, and could lose an arm as well . Vascular surgeons are still working to repair the damage to his arm so that they will not have to amputate it, KMBC-TV reports. Little Truett ha already lost his right leg below the knee and will require a prosthetic limb. Reverend Brian Wright, the pastor at the family's church, told KSHB-TV that Mr Shacklett is 'devastated' by the accident. The family and their eight children are active at Cedar Ridge Christian Church, Rev Wright said, and are relying on their faith to help them while Truett is in the hospital. Police say Mr Shacklett flipped over his riding lawn mower as soon as he realized he has run over his son. He pick the boy up and ran him into the house and called 911. The father, Scott Shacklett, is devastated by the accident. The father of eight is said to be by his son's side day and night . Rev Wright said doctors say Truett's young age is actually an asset. They said he likely won't be nearly as resistant to the prosthetic leg because by the time he is an adult, he will have been wearing it nearly all his life. The Amputee Coalition said about 600 children lose limbs to mower accidents every year. Experts recommend that a lawn mower be treated with all the caution of driving a car.","Truett Shacklett lost his right leg and could lose his right arm after being run over by a lawn mower .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron and Russian President Vladimir Putin held face-to-face talks today for the first time since the crisis in the Ukraine. The Prime Minister met Mr Putin in Paris at the Charles De Gaulle Airport ahead of tomorrow's D-Day commemorations in Normandy. It came after Mr Putin was warned that he has one month to end Russia's destabilisation of Ukraine or facing crippling economic sanctions. After the meeting Mr Cameron said he gave the Russian President a 'very clear and firm set of messages' during the talks and said the current situation is 'not acceptable'. David Cameron today became the first Western leader to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin since the Ukraine crisis began . The Prime Minister said: 'This was a meeting with a very clear and firm set of messages, which is that there is an opportunity for a successful, peaceful and stable Ukraine especially now there's been a presidential election. 'But the status quo, the situation today, is not acceptable and it needs to change.' Mr Cameron's aides said the meeting with Mr Putin was a chance to 'look him in the eye' and tell him his behaviour was unacceptable. Earlier today at a hastily-arranged summit of the G7 leaders in Brussels - which Mr Putin was barred from attending - the Prime Minister laid out a series of steps Mr Putin had to take if he is to avoid deepening international isolation. At a joint news conference with US president Barack Obama, Mr Cameron said Moscow needed to recognise the election of new Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, stop the flow of arms across the border and cease support for pro-Russian separatist groups. 'Russia's actions are completely unacceptable and totally at odds with the values of this group of democracies,' he said. 'The status quo is unacceptable. The continuing destabilisation of eastern Ukraine must stop. 'If these things don't happen, then sectoral sanctions will follow. The next month will be vital in judging if President Putin has taken these steps and that is what I will urge President Putin to do when I meet him later today.' Mr Cameron, is the first western leader to meet Mr Putin face-to-face since the current crisis. Russia, which had been due to host a G8 summit in Sochi, has been effectively expelled from the group it has been part of for almost two decades following its annexation of Crimea. The Prime Minister said he gave the Russian leader a 'very clear and firm set of messages' about its behaviour in Ukraine . Mr Putin did not appear particularly concerned about the Prime Minister's message. The Russian leader has been barred from the G8 following his decision to annex Crimea . Mr Obama urged Mr Putin to 'seize the opportunity' opened up by Mr Poroshenko's election in last month's presidential poll to negotiate a diplomatic resolution the crisis. 'We are at a point where Mr Putin has a chance to get back into a lane of international law. He has a president in Poroshenko who he can negotiate directly with,' he said. 'It's clear that he recognises that Ukraine needs to have a good relationship with Russia, but also rightly affirms the right of Ukraine to engage with the rest of the world.' Mr Obama also echoed Mr Cameron in warning that the western powers could not afford to allow the situation to 'drift' and Mr Putin needed to move quickly to show he was serious about finding a peaceful solution. 'The mere fact that some of the Russian soldiers have moved back off the border and that Russia is now destabilising Ukraine through surrogates rather than overtly and explicitly does not mean that we can afford three months or four months or six months of continued violence and conflict in eastern Ukraine,' he said. 'We will have a chance to see what Mr Putin does over the next two, three, four weeks, and if he remains on the current course, then we've already indicated the kinds of actions that we're prepared to take.' At a joint press conference earlier today, Mr Cameron and the US President Barack Obama said Russia's behaviour in Ukraine had been unacceptable and vowed to hit the country with more sanctions . While Mr Obama emphasised the importance of the G7 allies marching in 'lockstep', he expressed his concern over French president Francois Hollande's decision to go ahead with a £1 billion deal to supply two Mistral class helicopter assault ships to Russia. 'I have expressed some concerns - and I don't think I'm alone in this - about continuing significant defence deals with Russia at a time when they have violated basic international law and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of their neighbours,' he said. 'President Hollande understands my position. I recognise that this is a big deal. I recognise that the jobs in France are important. I think it would have been preferable to press the pause button. President Hollande so far has made a different decision.'","Prime Minister told the Russian leader the current situation 'not acceptable'

"By . Will Payne In Quincy, Massachusetts . and Jessica Jerreat . The sister of the young cancer victim from Massachusetts who inspired hit film The Fault in Our Stars has said watching the movie is like seeing her sibling have an extended life. Evangeline Earl described how watching the movie, based on the John Green book brought back memories - good and bad - of her sister Esther's fight against thyroid cancer. And, although Esther never had a boyfriend like the film's main character, Hazel, watching the onscreen romance blossom gave Evangeline a fleeting glimpse of what could have been. Scroll down for video . Memories: Evangeline Earl, pictured with Esther, left, says she was uplifted by the film inspired by her sister . Muse: Shailene Woodley plays Hazel Grace in the film version of The Fault in Our Stars. Ansel Elgort portrays Gus. The adaptation was inspired by Esther . Writing in the Washington Post, Esther's sister Evangeline, who volunteers at her family's This Star Won't Go Out cancer charity, described last week how the film brought back a flood of memories. 'Watching the movie, I couldn’t help feeling I was seeing my little sister on the screen,' she said. The Fault . In Our Stars opened at the movies last Saturday and instantly became a . smash hit. The . emotionally charged tear-jerker is the tale of the tumultuous . relationship between two teenage lovers starring Shailene Woodley and . Ansel Elgort who are both battling terminal cancer. The . film is based on Green’s best-selling novel of the same name, . which sold about three million copies worldwide and developed a huge . cult following. While the book is a work of fiction, . Green revealed the inspiration behind his main character Hazel Grace . – played by Woodley - came from his close relationship with . teenage, thyroid cancer sufferer, Esther. Inspiration: John Green became friends with Esther at a Harry Potter convention. He was heartbroken when she passed away . Ties: A family photo of Esther, center, with her siblings Abigail, Graham, Abraham and Evangeline . Evangeline added that although her sister had never had a boyfriend, and died shortly after her 16th birthday in 2010, the film inspired her to imagine what else Esther could have accomplished. 'Witnessing a life and a romance she could have had made me feel . unbearably sad and yet, oddly, uplifted. It’s as if, through Hazel, my . sister is able to continue having new experiences. As if she got a . sequel,' Evangeline said. The girls' mother, Lori, added that Esther had written in one of the many journals she kept about how she would have liked a boyfriend. ‘In . Esther’s journal she says, ""Oh, I may never get to kiss a boy"". She was . ready for romance. She wasn’t looking for a knight in shining armor; . she was more looking for someone with purpose, who was striving for . something. Gus [in the film] was ambitious and Esther would have liked that.' Evangeline added that the sassy attitude of the film's main character reminded her of how Esther had handled her own illness. Recalling a scene in the film in which Hazel reacts strongly to being prescribed more drugs, saying: 'Why stop there? I'm like the Keith Richards of cancer kids,' Evangeline said: 'My sister could be similarly flippant.' Despite often being bed-bound by her illness, Esther was vibrant and would write journals and make amusing and often poignant video blogs, where she discussed her cancer. Upbeat: Esther was a vibrant teenager despite the cancer diagnosis, and made amusing video blogs . Fan: Esther was obsessed with John Green's earlier books and started a group dedicated to his work . Evangeline said . that other parts of the movie, including a scene in which Hazel's father . carries her to his car as she gasps for air, reminded her of darker . moments in her sister's fight against cancer. ' 'It brought me back to one night in 2008, when watched my father carry my sister . Esther from her bedroom to an ambulance stretcher. 'I was . almost 17 and couldn’t imagine life without the person who understood . me when no one else could, who looked up to me even as I sat in awe of . her,' Evangeline wrote in the Washington Post. 'We didn’t think she’d make it through . the night. Yet, like Hazel, she regained her strength. She lived for two . more maddening, beautiful year.' Evangeline . said she was pleased that like her sister, the film's main character . was also a 'fangirl'. It was through a Harry Potter convention that . Esther got to meet Green, who wrote popular young adult books. Esther . was obsessed with Green’s earlier . books – starting fan a group dedicated to his work. After they met at . the convention in Boston in 2009 they became great friends and close . confidantes, after Green fell in love with Esther’s incredible courage . and spirit. Thumbs up: Esther wasn't worried about herself. But she was concerned about her parents and her family . Reality bites: In the film, Hazel can't believe a guy like Gus would ever be interested in her, but he proves his affection and gives her a reason to live. Their relationship is completely fictional, as Esther did not have a boyfriend. Her mother Lori explains Esther would have loved to have met someone like Gus . Green dedicated his book to Esther, and said he could never have written The Fault in Our Stars without having known her. 'Every word on that book . depends on her,' Green said, adding that her 'empathy, charm and snark helped inspire' him. While . he also drew on experiences he had working as a chaplain on a . children's ward, Esther's life also had an impact on his writing. Her . concern for making sure her family and friends would be OK after her . death, has also been reflected in story's character, Hazel. Evangeline . said: 'Like Hazel - who tells her mother that her ""greatest fear is . that when I’m gone, you’re not going to have a life anymore"" - Esther . was focused on what would happen to the people she loved. 'She . wanted to know that we would be all right, that we would miss her and . think about her, yes, but that we would move on with our lives and be . happy again.'","Evangeline Earl says she was uplifted by character inspired by her sibling .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Britain's churches are at risk of turning into giant 'bat barns', a Tory peer has warned. Lord Cormack said the flying animals were a 'terrible problem' for parishes - with the smell and mess of bat droppings proving an 'intolerable burden' for vicars. The former Tory MP said he had been told of one occasion when a vicar had to 'shake bat faeces out of her hair while celebrating holy communion at the altar'. The number of bats roosting in Britain's churches - particularly in East Anglia - is a menace to vicars, a leading Tory peer has claimed . He said bats were a 'menace' to churches and it was time for a fightback against nature lovers. Tory peer Lord Ahmad, speaking for the Government, said there was a 'bat helpline' to give free advice on helping churches deal with the problem. But Lord Cormack said: 'The impression is that bats matter much more than the worshipping community and this is exacerbated by the fact Natural England abrogated responsibility to the Bat Conservation Trust, who are quite legitimately a pressure group.' He added: 'This is a subject that is not sufficiently aired but it really is a very true danger. 'If this debate achieved only one thing - a better balance between the demands of English Nature and the needs of English Heritage - I would be well content.' Tory peer Lord Cormack said one vicar had to remove bat faeces from her hair while celebrating holy communion at the alter . The Bishop of Norwich, the Rt Rev Graham James, said there had been a lot of meetings with Natural England and the Government on the problem of bats and there had been some positive developments. But he added: 'It is always odd to me that our parish churches seem to be treated much more as barns than as houses. 'They are places where people gather and to eat - not just the sacrament of holy communion but more socially as well - and I doubt any other eating place would be allowed to be so unhygienic.' Musical impresario Lord Lloyd-Webber urged the Government to set up a national heritage memorial fund to protect and promote works of art in parish churches. The Conservative peer said: 'We have to fight passionately for the future of our parish churches.' He warned that protecting works of art like stained glass windows was beyond the means of some churches and suggested a fund should be created to do the job. Lord Lloyd-Webber said anything that people could do to further the use of churches as the centre of communities had to be good. 'We should have Wi-Fi in churches,' he added. 'If we have Wi-Fi you could have an app and that app could say look this is what this building is about.' Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, replying to the debate for the Government, said: 'Most medieval churches will have bats and it seems that Norfolk churches seem to have particular problems in this respect. 'Historical buildings, especially churches, play an important role in helping to protect the conservation and status of native bats. 'In a changing landscape churches can represent one of the few remaining constant resources for bats, thus giving them a disproportionate significance for the maintenance of bat populations.'","Tory peer Lord Cormack says bat infestations are 'an intolerable burden'

"By . Damien Gayle . A 90-year-old woman was locked away and left to starve to death by her own children, police say. Xiaoming Tsui survived a month of captivity in her bedroom by drinking water and eating a few porridge oats neighbours were able to throw in while her children were out. When police burst in at the end of last week to free her after a tip off posted online, her first words were: 'Please, feed me, feed me.' Horrific: Ninety-year-old Xiaoming Tsui is helped to wash after nearly a month in captivity with no food after her children allegedly hatched a plan to starve her to death because they were tired of caring for her . Her daughter and son are now facing charges of attempted murder after police accused them of 'a cold and calculating plan to get rid of someone they found expensive and tiresome to deal with'. A police spokesman said: 'The woman fell ill and to get rid of the problem of having to care for her, her children attempted to make her die from starvation in the locked room. 'They didn't send their mother any food, telling her it was so she didn't need the bathroom, and would allow no-one in to see her.' Neighbours in Yangjuan village in Hunan, China, who realised Mrs Xiaoming was not being given much to eat were able on several occasions to pass oatmeal up to her through an open window.

"By . Nick Enoch . Some of the earliest photos of Victorian women have come to light in a revealing and historical album of prints from the pioneering days of photography 150 years ago. The rare set of pictures taken by Lady Clementina Hawarden, one of Britain’s first female photographers -  whose work was avidly collected by Alice In Wonderland writer Lewis Carroll - is set to fetch £150,000 at auction. The photos, which date back to the 1860s, were taken by Lady Hawarden of her daughters and rank as one of Britain’s first ever fashion shoots. She is rated as one of the . most influential Victorian fine art photographers, blazing the way for . women in the profession when it was dominated by men.

She enlisted her daughters as models and got to work with a stereoscopic camera and set the standard to which aspiring photographers reach for today. Born Clementina Elphinstone Fleeming in . Dunbartonshire in 1822, she was the third of five children of a British . father, Admiral Charles Elphinstone Fleeming (1774-1840), and a Spanish . mother, Catalina Paulina Alessandro (1800-1880). One of five children, she grew up on the family estate, Cumbernauld, near Glasgow. Much . of Hawarden’s life remains a mystery. But in 1845 she married . Cornwallis Maude, an Officer in the Life Guards. In 1856, Maude’s father, . Viscount Hawarden, died and his title, and considerable wealth, passed . to Cornwallis. Hawarden and her husband had ten children, two boys and eight girls, out of whom eight survived to adulthood. In 1859, the family also acquired a . new London home at 5 Princes Gardens, in South Kensington. Much of the square survives as . built, but No. 5 has gone. From 1862 onwards, Lady Hawarden used . the entire first floor of the property as a studio, within which she . kept a few props, many of which have come to be synonymous with her . work: gossamer curtains; a freestanding mirror; a small chest of . drawers; and the iconic ‘empire star’ wallpaper, as seen in several of . the photographs.

It was also here that Lady Hawarden . focused upon taking photographs of her eldest daughters, Isabella Grace, . Clementina, and Florence Elizabeth, whom she would often dress up in . costume tableau. The girls were frequently shot - . often in romantic and sensual poses - in pairs, or, if alone, with a . mirror or with their back to the camera. Hawarden’s photographic exploration . of identity - and female sexuality - was incredibly progressive when . considered in relation to her contemporaries, most notably Julia . Margaret Cameron. Graham Ovenden said in his book, . Clementina Lady Hawarden (1974): 'Clementina Hawarden struck out into . areas and depicted moods unknown to the art photographers of her age. Her vision of languidly tranquil ladies carefully dressed and posed in a . symbolist light is at opposite poles from Mrs Cameron’s images... her . work... constitutes a unique document within nineteenth-century . photography.' Lady Hawarden's daughter Eppy Agnes (left), who is also seen facing the camera with another girl on the balcony of their London house . She exhibited, and won silver medals, . in the 1863 and 1864 exhibitions of the Photographic Society, and was . admired by both Oscar Rejlander, and Lewis Carroll who acquired five . images which went into the Gernsheim Collection and are now in Texas. Tragically, Hawarden was never to . collect her medals. She died at on 19 January 1865, after suffering from . pneumonia for one week, aged 42. It has been suggested that her immune . system was weakened by constant contact with the photographic chemicals. Now an important collection of 37 albumen prints by her and a pair of pencil sketches of her and her husband are to be sold. The images are derived from a single . album, the vast majority not represented in the Victoria & Albert . Museum’s collection, where the majority of her work is housed. Francesca Spickernell, photography specialist at Bonhams, said: 'It was pioneering for a woman to be taking photos like this at this point in the 19th century. On January 19, 1865, Lady Hawarden died after suffering from pneumonia for one week, aged 42. It has been suggested that her immune system was weakened by constant contact with the photographic chemicals. (Isabella, pictured) 'Her output was prolific and she won awards for her work. She struck out into areas and depicted moods unknown to the art photographers of her age. 'The photography scene at this point in history was dominated by males so for a female to achieve the amount of recognition she did in such a short space of time was a tremendous achievement. 'Most photography was very masculine and mostly architectural so these elegant, feminine shots really stood out at that time.' In 1939, her granddaughter presented the V&A with 779 photographs, most of which had been roughly torn from their original albums with significant losses to corners. Proper examination, and appreciation of this gift, was delayed by World War Two, and it was not until the 1980s that there was a detailed appraisal and catalogue of the V&A holdings. This comprises almost the entire body of Hawarden’s surviving work apart from the five images now in Texas, and small groups or single images at Bradford, Musie d’Orsay and the Getty. Some smaller images are arranged on album leaves that are still intact - measuring 322 x 235mm. As distinct from the V&A’s holdings, it is presumed that these images have been taken from an album which may have belonged to one of the sitters or their siblings. The most significant group in the present collection are all approximately 198 x 144mm. and tend to depict one figure in the first floor front room at 5 Princes Gardens. Curiously there are no images of this size in the V&A collection, but the presence of close variant images in a smaller format suggests that Lady Hawarden was using two cameras in the same session. The photographs have been in the same . private collection for the last 50 years and will be auctioned by .

A radiator sales director called Phil Neville was told to die and get cancer as he received a torrent of abuse on Twitter intended for his namesake following his commentary during England's World Cup opener with Italy. Former football referee Mr Neville, 60, said he received at least 1,000 tweets as Twitter users got him mixed up with the ex-Manchester United and Everton footballer. BBC commentator Neville has been criticised for his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during the game on Saturday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Radiator sales director Phil Neville (left) received a torrent of abuse on Twitter intended for his ex-footballer namesake (right) following his commentary during England's World Cup opener with Italy . Mr Neville, 60, said he received at least 1,000 tweets as Twitter users got him mixed up with the ex-Manchester United and Everton footballer . Mr Neville, of Hadleigh, Suffolk, has now offered to do a job swap with his football commentator namesake after he got caught up in the crossfire. Twitter users confused his Twitter handle, @philneville, with that of the ex-footballer, @fizzer18. Mr Neville said: 'I haven’t gone to the police because it’s not for me, but there are some very sad people out there.' He went on to say: 'Some tweets said ""I hope you die"" and ""I hope you get cancer"".' Mr Neville said he went out to watch the match with friends and left his phone at home. His mobile phone had been going off all night with alerts but Mr Neville went to bed and ignored them until the next morning. Ex-footballer Phil Neville has welcomed the feedback on his first live commentary and insisted the criticism 'will only make me better' 'I reckon I’ve had about 1,000 tweets,' he said. 'This weekend has been unbelievable, just unreal. There were a lot of Fs and Cs, particularly from Liverpool fans, but for me it’s been more fun than abusive. 'I just don’t take any notice. 'A few have said sorry when they have realised and have seen the funny side too. 'I have been able to laugh at it, it has been amusing and it just keeps getting funnier. 'Apparently he has said he will try to do better so I am sure my phone will come alive again.' Mr Neville, who played football before becoming a referee, has joked that he is available for commentary work. Since then he has been offered a possible opportunity to commentate on England's game against Uruguay on Thursday. 'I don't know what will come of it but I know a bit about football so who knows, maybe I could do a decent job,' he said. Mr Neville, who was the fourth official at a few Premier League matches in the 1990s, said he enjoyed watching the football match on Saturday. He said: 'I must admit that when listening in the first-half I didn’t realise it was Phil Neville, but he was terrible. 'It was only when they went back to the commentary team for the second-half and they said it was him that I realised - and I couldn’t believe it.' Some fans linked physio Gary Lewin's injury to Neville's performance in the commentary box . South Warwickshire police joined others on Twitter mocking BBC co-commentator Phil Neville . The ex-footballer Neville has welcomed the feedback on his first live commentary and insisted the criticism 'will only make me better'. He admitted the job is harder than he thought after hundreds of viewers complained about his on-air performance. A BBC spokeswoman said there were 445 complaints after Saturday night’s game, which pulled in a peak audience of 15.6 million viewers. Neville, 37, told Radio 5 Live yesterday: 'I think the biggest thing I learned is that co-commentary is harder than what I thought it was going to be. 'I welcome all the feedback you get and it's a welcome to the social media so you come in after a game you're hyped up, its just like playing doing a co-commentary, you're focused for 90 minutes, you turn your phone on and you’re getting some lovely messages. 'But I’m really looking forward to the game on Thursday, I’m back in the co-commentary booth and I will get better. It was my first live gig and I'm just glad I helped everybody sleep back home.' Neville, who said he 'really loved' working as a commentator, said: 'The feedback is [that] the content I put out was quite good, obviously the feedback is I need to show a little more excitement so I think you’ll see that on Thursday night.'","Radiator sales director received 1,000 tweets intended for ex-footballer .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . The backlog of passport applications threatening to ruin thousands of family holidays this summer almost doubled in just three months this year, MPs heard today. Passport Office chief Paul Pugh admitted 480,000 people are now waiting for their travel documents - some 200,000 higher than last year. Mr Pugh, who revealed he earns £104,000 a year, blamed a 'substantially higher intake' of applications. But unions told MPs the figure was even higher. By June 8 the number of people waiting for their passport had hit 493,289, union chief Mike Jones told the Home Affairs Select Committee. Just 12 weeks earlier, the figure stood at 289,892. Mr Jones, whose PCS union represents Passport Office staff, told MPs: 'They've lost control of the backlog.' Scroll down for video . Passport Office chief Paul Pugh, who earns £104,000 a year, told MPs the backlog had hit 480,000 - around 200,000 higher than usual . Mr Pugh admitted that he considered resigning over the fiasco. He said: 'Of course I've considered whether it would be right for me to have stepped down.' Mike Jones, the Home Office group secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union representing Passport Office staff, appeared before MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee this afternoon . Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz questioned the PCS's Mike Jones this afternoon as part of his investigation into the passport crisis . But when asked whether he would rule out taking Passport Office staff on strike during the crisis, Mr Jones refused, adding: 'We are keeping all of our options open.' He said he wanted the 550 jobs cut since 2010 reinstated and a 'guarantee' of no more privatisation. He added: 'We've got a crisis caused by a lack of jobs.' Passport chief Paul Pugh said any strike action would be 'extremely damaging'. He told MPs that even before strike action there had 'never been a challenging situation of this kind' in recent years. Mr Pugh apologised to families who suffered delays in their passport applications. Addressing Mr Pugh, the committee chairman Keith Vaz said: 'Would you like to take this opportunity to apologise to all those who have been waiting? I have a sheaf of letters from members of the public, from members of parliament, who are very, very angry. 'You don't seem to recognise the fact that people are very upset and angry. Would you like to apologise?' Mr Pugh replied: 'I absolutely recognise the anger and distress that some people have suffered and I would like to put on record that yes, in every case where we haven't met our service standards, where we haven't been able to meet the customer's needs, yes, certainly, we are sorry for that.' The Prime Minister last week apologised for the chaos after he revealed  there were at least 30,000 applications outstanding which had not been processed within the normal three-week limit. But it now emerges that his only accounts for a fraction of the true backlog. Amid mounting fury over the passport delays the Government was forced to take urgent action to deal with the crisis. Those who desperately need travel documents were told that they could get their applications fast-tracked free of charge, instead of paying an extra £55.50 a person. But this will only apply to those who have not had their passports back within three weeks and are going abroad in the next seven days. Minister also announced that those renewing their UK passports from overseas will be given an automatic 12-month extension. And families applying from abroad for passports on behalf of their children will be given emergency travel documents as well, the Home Secretary announced. Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog . The images showed boxes of applications piled in a spare room set aside for interviews. Officials at the Liverpool clearing house where the image was taken said the situation was 'a million times worse' in Durham . Standard passports cost £72.50 - or £46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get. Those needing a passport urgently can pay extra for a premium or fast-track service. The 'premium' service, costing £128, means passports can be collected within four hours of being approved. Under the fast-track service, costing £103, a passport is returned within a week of the application being approved. The Home Office has urged those who have already applied not to resubmit their application. But those that need to leave the country within the next seven days and have been waiting for their passport for more than three weeks can have their application fast tracked for free. British families abroad can get an automatic 12 months extension - while their children will be given emergency travel documents. The Passport Office has increased the number of examiners and call centre staff by a further 200 on top of the 1,000 staff already redeployed to deal with a surge in applications running at a 12-year high. Mrs May has drafted in emergency staff - earning up £70 an hour - to the Passport Office to clear the backlog. Around 100 Home Office staff based in the North have been asked to move to the Liverpool Passport Office for up to two months, a letter leaked to MailOnline revealed. This is on top of the 250 backroom staff at the Passport Office which have already been redeployed to the front line. The Government's attempt to head off the growing crisis came after MailOnline published pictures showing hundreds of boxes of passport applications piled on a sorting office floor. Last week passport office workers revealed the pressure they were being put under to clear the backlog. One whistleblower said workers were being left 'suicidal'. He said Mrs May did not have 'any idea' how bad the situation really was and claimed staff were at breaking point. Speaking anonymously, he said he had been working seven days a week for four months to clear the estimated 500,0000 backlog of applications. He said: 'We're tired, we can't concentrate. Theresa May hasn't got any idea. She doesn't now how bad things are.' As the Government moved to avert a summer holiday crisis, hundreds of families last week descended on offices - like this one in London - to renew their passport in person . The whistleblower was asked about the morale at the Passport Office. The worker said: 'It's suicidal. Suicidal. The staff are worn out. 'Management keep changing the goal posts. They come up with crazy ideas and say how can we help, but they don't have a clue. 'The overnight staff are only supposed to work until 9pm, but they are working till midnight. I'm just so tired. 'I just want people to know the truth. I'm worn out, really worn out and it's been going on for far too long.' He added that the Passport Office in Durham was 'a million times worse' than in Liverpool. He added: 'It's really bad - they are way behind.' The worker said that yesterday morning a woman 'burst into tears because of the pressure they're putting on us'. Theresa May ordered hundreds of staff to move from UK Visas & Immigration to the Passport Office, as this leaked letter to MailOnline revealed, to help clear the backlog. But unions said the move would leave other areas short staffed . Last night a spokesman for Her Majesty’s Passport Office said: 'There are currently approximately 480,000 active applications being processed. 'It is not unusual during peak periods for HMPO to operate with high numbers of applications in the system at any one time, with this year seeing the highest levels for 12 years. 'We are working to ensure that the vast majority of people continue to receive their passports within our service standards. 'We have also introduced a range of measures to help those who need to travel urgently, including free upgrades.'","MPs hear that by June 493,289 people were waiting for passport applications .

Police believe Lucas Templin was shot accidentally by his friend, also aged 11, after the boys found a loaded gun at the Frazeysburg home. The schoolboy, who had been best man at his father's wedding last weekend, died at the scene from a single gunshot to the chest. Victim: Lucas Templin died after a gun he and his 11-year-old friend were playing with went off . Friends: Ohio schoolboy Lucas, left, was playing at the home of his best friend, right, who is also 11 . Tragic accident: Bikes belonging to Lucas and his friend lean against the house where the 11-year-old was shot . The mother of the boy believed to have shot Lucas was outside mowing the lawn at the time and didn't hear the gunshot, or the ambulance arrive. Her neighbor, Rose McNemar, said she tried to comfort the mother and son, who have not been named, immediately after the accident. '[She] was a mess. I tried to comfort the little boy. He was shaking and . bawling. He had blood on him. He kept saying, ""Is he OK? He’s going to . be OK, Mom?"",' Ms McNemar told the Columbus Dispatch. The boys had been alone in the house for less than 10 minutes when the gun went off. Neighbors described hearing Lucas's mother screaming as she ran towards the house after hearing of the shooting. Loss: Lucas had been best man at the wedding of his father, Scott, last weekend . Lucas's grandmother, Cindy Swartz, . described the boys as 'best friends' and said her grandson had only just . celebrated his 11th birthday. The bike he had asked for as a present was still leaning on the porch of his friend's house the day after the shooting.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A gender non-conforming teenager from South Carolina is demanding to have a driver's license retaken after DMV staff barred him from wearing make up. Chase Culpepper claims DMV staff said the make up should be removed because the teenager didn't look like how a boy should. The 16-year-old, who wears androgynous clothing and make up, agreed to the staff's demands to get a license, but now wants to have the photo redone. Before and after: Chase Culpepper wore make-up to have his photograph taken (left) but was asked to remove it (right) and complied . Upset: Chase wanted to have the license picture, above, retaken after he was forced to remove his make up . Denied: A request to let Chase, a gender non-conforming teenager, get a new picture has been turned down . Big day: Chase had been excited about applying for a driver's license, but left the DMV offices upset . Chase says staff claimed that DMV rules stated that the photo needed to show the person as they appear normally, and banned pictures taken in 'disguise'. 'This is who I am and my clothing and make-up reflect that,' Chase said. 'The Department of Motor Vehicles should . not have forced me to remove my make-up simply because my appearance . does not meet their expectations of what a boy should look like.' Chase's mother, Teresa Culpepper, told WYFF4: 'They said he was wearing a disguise. It was very hurtful. He was absolutely devastated. That’s who he is 24/7.' The Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund has sent a formal letter to the South Carolina office, claiming that Chase's freedom to express gender was 'restricted'. Complaint: The Transgender Legal Defense wrote to the DMV after staff allegedly told Chase that wearing make up was a 'disguise' Lifestyle choice: Chase was hurt by the DMV's actions and believes the office banned make up because the teenager didn't meet their expectations of what a boy should look like . The letter also requests that Chase be allowed to have a new photo taken, 11 Alive reported. Mrs Culpepper said the DMV policy had ruined what should have been an exciting day for the teenager. 'Instead, he was singled out and discriminated against because he did not meet the DMV’s expectations of how a boy should look,' she told Pink News. 'I want my son to be able to be himself without discrimination or harassment. I love him that way and the government should not be telling him that he’s not OK the way he is.' Beth Parks, of the DMV, said that staff at the office had been following state policy, which had been updated in 2009 to say: 'At no time will an applicant be photographed when it appears that he or she is purposely altering his or her appearance so that the photo would misrepresent his or her identity.'","Chase Culpepper claims staff restricted freedom to express gender .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . School governors will have to demonstrate 'fundamental British values', under new rules set to be introduced in the wake of the Trojan horse 'plot' to radicalise school children. The Education Secretary Michael Gove has also listed for the first time the set of 'British values' which all schools must promote to combat extremism. Under new Department for Education rules new academies and free schools must promote 'respect for the law, democracy, equality and tolerance of different faiths, religions and other beliefs'. Scroll down for video . Education Secretary Michael Gove and the Home Secretary Theresa May clashed over how to combat extremism in schools. Mr Gove wants the Government to take a harder line on Muslim radicals, but Mrs May fears this could drive school children into the hands of the jihadis . But one Islamic group said some conservative Muslims could effectively end up being be barred from becoming school governors by the measures. The Muslim Council of Britain said the proposals were 'frankly speaking, quite dangerous'. Talha Ahmad, a senior member of the MCB, said: 'People may have different views, and those views might be informed by faith. 'But does that mean the secretary of state should have the power to arbitrate these ideas, so much so that they should not be part of an educational establishment?' Ministers insist the move is necessary in wake of a damning Ofsted report which claimed children in six Birmingham schools were at risk of radicalisation. School inspectors found hardline Muslim governors led an 'organised campaign' to change the character of ordinary state schools. The Golden Hillock School and Nansen Primary School were both branded 'inadequate' by Ofsted inspectors investigating allegations of a 'Trojan horse' plot to radicalise pupils . Governors at Satley School were accused of  'refusing to accept that the school is in a state of crisis' while governors at Oldknow Academy used the school's budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia for only Muslim staff and pupils. The Education Secretary, reacting to the findings, revealed how one school had played the Muslim call to prayer over loudspeakers in the playground while another had invited a hate preacher to speak even though he had previously called for 'victory to the Muslims in Afghanistan'. Mr Gove also attacked a school for banning non-Muslim pupils from subsidised school trips to Saudi Arabia. The Education Secretary's statement came after school inspectors Ofsted found a 'culture of fear and intimidation' had developed in some schools in the city. Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw also warned that Birmingham City Council had failed to support a number of schools in their efforts to protect pupils from the 'risks of radicalisation and extremism'. Some headteachers told inspectors that there had been an organised campaign to target certain schools in the city to change their 'character and ethos', Sir Michael said. Lee Donaghy, the assistant principal of Birmingham's Park View School which was placed in special measures over fears children were at risk of radicalisation, said many of the concerns over Muslim extremists were 'plain old Islamaphobia' He concluded: 'In several of the schools inspected, children are being badly prepared for life in modern Britain.' Following the revelations David Cameron said there had been a 'worrying' failure to push British values in schools and society. He said he wanted all school pupils to be taught about the Magna Carta. The Prime Minister's intervention came after teachers were told by the Education Secretary Michael Gove that they must in future 'actively promote British values'. Mr Cameron said these values would include 'a belief in freedom, tolerance of others, accepting personal and social responsibility, respecting and upholding the rule of law'. The new rules, revealed in the Guardian today, forcing schools to promote British values have been inserted into the funding agreement between academies or free schools and the Government. The new wording will apply to all free schools and academies opening or schools converting to academy status. Under the existing legal agreement the education secretary was only able to cut off a school's funding if there had been 'a serious breakdown in the way the academy is managed or governed' or if the Government regarded a governor as 'not a suitable person'. But the department's new rules allow ministers to close the school or dismiss its governors if they think any member of the academy trust is 'unsuitable' - if they have done anything 'aimed at undermining the fundamental British values'. A Department for Education spokesman dismissed claims that the rules were a threat to Muslims. 'There is absolutely no bar to Muslims becoming school governors,' the spokesman said. 'We want a diverse range of people, of all faiths and none, to serve on governing bodies. 'It is right that unsuitable people should not be able to become governors. 'We are clear that any behaviour which undermines the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs is incompatible with being a governor in a state-funded school in England.'","Michael Gove lists  'British values' which all schools must promote .

"By . Mark Duell . One of Britain’s tallest Maypoles has been secretly cut down by a council ahead of the Tour de France following health and safety fears. Experts had discovered the 75ft Otley Maypole was rotting during a risk assessment ahead of the cycling race, which passes through the town in West Yorkshire next weekend. The examination was prompted after a forestry officer who was walking past the Maypole noticed that it was leaning at an angle - and decided to do a full assessment. Cut down: Experts had discovered the Otley Maypole in West Yorkshire was rotting during a risk assessment . Stump: Council officials said that the situation was considered an emergency when extensive cubicle brown rot was found, so the structure had to be taken down . Council officials insisted that the situation was considered an emergency when extensive cubicle brown rot was found, so the structure had to be taken down. But local Liberal Democrat councillor Colin Campbell said: ‘I am very concerned that Otley's iconic Maypole has been removed. It was the largest permanent Maypole in Yorkshire, if not the world. ‘I understand the decision to cut it down but I feel there could have been more public discussion as a number of residents have been quite upset about its loss.’ His colleague Ryk Downes, another Leeds City Council councillor, added: ‘To bring the Maypole down was the right call. However, to do it in this way, with no consultation or planning is a disgrace. Felled: It is thought that a Maypole could have existed on the site in West Yorkshire as early as 1660 . Removed: A picture of the Maypole during the Otley Festival in 1907. The current pole has existed since 1962 . ‘What would have been a tourist attraction, helping put Otley on the map and in the minds of tourists from around the world at the Grand Depart is now nothing more than a shaved stump.’ 'To bring the Maypole down was the right call. However, to do it in this way, with no consultation or planning is a disgrace' Ryk Downes, Leeds City Council . The Otley Maypole was one of two on Manchester Square in Otley. A plaque on the green structure read: ‘A Maypole has stood on this site for many centuries. Present pole erected 1962’. It is thought that a Maypole could have existed on the site as early as 1660. The larger Maypole was owned by Leeds City Council while the smaller is the property of Otley Town Council. Cllr Ryk Downes said: ‘Now they dance around the smaller one - which is still standing - on Mayday and the huge one that was cut down was more of a monument. ‘Now we don't know when we will get a new maypole, but it won't be before the Tour de France, which is disappointing for the town. It is massive so it will take some time to source a new one. 150 years ago: This photograph taken in the late 1860s shows the maypole in front of thatched cottages . Sketch: It is thought that a Maypole could have existed on the site as early as 1660. This is an undated drawing . ‘Because of the massive size, when we do get one it is unlikely it will come in one piece. Also, when they took the other one down they took it apart in sections so it's not even lying anywhere whole.’ 'It was unfortunate that this had to be treated as an emergency but the risks of not doing so far outweighed the alternative' Mark Dobson, Leeds City Council . Cllr Mark Dobson, Leeds City Council’s executive member for the environment, said: ‘Extensive decay was detected at the base of the Maypole and that posed a serious risk to members of the public in what is a busy area of Otley. ‘It was simply not acceptable to put the public at risk by delaying action to deal with that situation. 'It was unfortunate that this had to be treated as an emergency but the risks of not doing so far outweighed the alternative.’ Two years ago Leeds City Council was fined £12,000 after two-year-old River Webster suffered serious injuries when a 16ft flagpole fell and hit her on the head in Otley Memorial Garden.","It comes before Tour de France which passes through town next weekend .

"By . Sally Lee . and Associated Press . and Aap . Australian correspondent for Al Jazeera, Peter Greste, has been jailed for seven years in Egypt. He listens to his verdict from the defendants cage during the trial . The Federal Government is set to formally request Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's intervention in the case of Australian journalist Peter Greste. Greste - along with his two other Al Jazeera English colleagues - was sentenced to seven years in jail after he was found guilty of fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's political situation, aligning himself with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. The trio - including Canadian-Egyptian acting Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian producer Baher Mohammed - were arrested on December 29 after a raid on their Cairo hotel they were using as an office and denied the accusations, saying they were just doing their job. The verdict has sparked international outcry and condemnation of the north African country. But late on Tuesday the Egyptian president dashed hopes of a prompt resolution, declaring local authorities 'will not interfere in judicial matters'. A government official said Mr Sisi cannot legally pardon Greste until a final ruling from the appeal court. Prime Minister Tony Abbott understood the president's position but added the Egyptian was a reasonable man. 'This is someone who does get it when it comes to the ordinary norms of justice and decency,' Mr Abbott told Sky News. He said it is important that Australia not resort to outrage when dealing with Egypt on the matter. 'I don't believe that loose language or emotive language is necessarily going to get us the right result for Peter Greste,' Mr Abbott said. Scroll down for video . Greste was charged with fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's national security last year and was arrested on December 29 . Greste looks out from the defendant's cage during a sentencing hearing in a courtroom in Cairo, Egypt on Monday . Dialogue between the two countries over the court verdict started in Canberra on Tuesday. With Egypt's ambassador to Australia currently in Cairo, his deputy - charge d'affaires Sherif Abdelaziz Bedeir Hussein - was summoned to a meeting with senior diplomats who expressed Australia's dismay at the sentences handed to Greste and his colleagues. Greste's parents, Juris and Lois Greste, vowed never to give up fighting for their son's release, indicating a pardon from the head of Egypt's government is 'probably the very first thing' they would consider. But Mr Sisi's more recent statement means the family might have to wait until the lengthy appeal court process has been exhausted before a pardon will be considered. 'My vocabulary fails to convey just how shattered we are,' Mr Greste told AAP. Mr Greste said his son had been jailed for upholding the principles of free speech, and that fight must never end. 'To us, it is not just affecting the Greste family. It is also a slap in the face and a kick in the groin to Australia, as well as all fair-minded people around the world,' he said. Shortly after the verdict was handed down on Monday, Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said she was 'deeply dismayed and appalled' by the severity of the sentence. Ms Bishop also added Greste was a well-respected Australian journalist. 'I have spoken at length with Peter Greste's parents. We understand that Egypt has been through some very difficult times and there has been some turmoil,' she said. 'This verdict does nothing to support Egypt's claim it's on a transition to democracy. 'Freedom and freedom of the press is fundamental to democracy. We are deeply concerned this verdict is a part of a broader attempt to muzzle the media freedom that upholds democracy around the world.' Peter Greste (left) and his colleagues, Egyptian-Canadian Mohamed Fadel Fahmy (centre) and Egyptian Baher Mohamed (right) were each sentenced to seven years in jail . Greste (left), an Al Jazeera journalist, was charged with fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's national security last year and was arrested on December 29 . Greste's brothers Andrew and Mike were in the court and were stunned by the unexpected verdict and sentence. 'I haven't seen anything yet which outlines the reasoning,' Andrew Greste told the ABC. 'It's very difficult to prepare for that. I don't know how you prepare for that. Greste has been described as a well-respected Australian journalist by Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop . 'Regardless of whether you prepare yourself, the emotions are just devastated, I'm gutted. It's unbelievable.' Andrew said he and Mike were not able to see their brother amid the chaotic scenes as he was whisked away from the mesh cage in which he was locked in the courtroom, but will visit him on Tuesday. 'We're not going to give up the fight to get Peter released because we believe he's completely innocent, he's done nothing wrong. It's just going to be a matter of looking at all the options.' On top of seven years' imprisonment, Greste's colleagues Mohammed Fahmy and Baher Mohammed received an extra three years on separate charges. Greste raised his fists in the air while Fahmy angrily shouted 'I swear they will pay for this', from the defendants' cage after the sentences were announced. 'They just ruined a family,' Fahmy's brother Adel, who was attending the session, said. He said they would appeal the verdict but added that he had little faith in the system. 'Everything is corrupt,' Adel said. Twitter exploded with messages of disgust and outrage for the jailed Australian journalist as soon as the news broke. Not long after the sentence was delivered, the hashtags #FreeAJStaff, #Greste and #AJTrial were trending on the social media site. 'I swear they will pay for this', Fahmy yelled after the sentences were announced . The three journalists from Al-Jazeera English who were each convicted on terrorism-related charges which has brought an outcry from rights groups . A photo of the back page of The New York Times - a blank page with the words 'this is what happens when you silence journalists' - was also circulating Twitter . Australian photojournalist Nigel Brennan, who was held hostage in Somalia in 2008, said: 'nothing like a dictatorship to show its true colours by squashing freedom of speech'. A photo of the back page of The New York Times - a blank page with the words 'this is what happens when you silence journalists' - was also circulating Twitter. Greste and his colleagues have been in custody in Cairo for six months. The judge also handed 10-year sentences to two British journalists and a Dutch journalist who were not in Egypt and tried in absentia. Two defendants among 14 others on trial in the case were acquitted, including the son of Mohammed el-Beltagy, a senior figure in the Muslim Brotherhood. The prosecution offered little evidence to back up the charges against them. The three and their supporters have said they were simply doing their jobs as journalists, covering the wave of protests led by the Brotherhood against the military-backed government installed after Morsi's ousted on July 3 by then-army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who is now the president. The police crackdown on the protests has killed hundreds and put thousands more in prison. The other defendants were mainly students, arrested separately, accused of providing the Al Jazeera journalists with footage along with a variety of other charges, including belonging to the Brotherhood. THE ARREST . Peter Greste and two Al-Jazeera English colleagues, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed, detained in December in a raid on their Cairo hotel room, used as an office to cover protests by supporters of ousted Islamist president. THE CHARGES . Accused of aiding the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood and faced terrorism related charges including 'spreading false news' to undermine Egypt's national security and make it appear the country was facing civil war. THE DEFENCE . They pleaded innocent, saying they were simply doing their jobs as journalists. THE EVIDENCE . Prosecution evidence included seemingly unrelated videos of trotting horses, a song by Australian singer Gotye, and a BBC documentary from Somalia. It also included other video footage found in their possession, including a report on a veterinary hospital in Cairo, Christian life and old footage of Greste from previous assignments elsewhere in Africa.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron has blown the row over the next EU Commission chief 'out of all proportion', veteran Tory Cabinet minister Ken Clarke said today. Mr Clarke said the front runner for the Brussels job, Jean-Claude Juncker, was 'not an arch villain' as had been portrayed. His remarks came after the Prime Minister vowed to fight against Mr Juncker's appointment until the end. Mr Cameron held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Dutch PM Mark Rutte over the appointment tonight. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Cameron explained that his opposition 'would not change'. Mrs Merkel agreed to hold a vote on the appointment, which Mr Cameron is expected to lose, at the two-day EU summit starting tomorrow. Minister Without Portfolio Ken Clarke today dismissed the Prime Minister's fight to stop Jean-Claude Juncker becoming the next EU Commission President . Mr Clarke said he was unsure why Jean-Claude Juncker was attracting such criticism. The former Chancellor said: 'Jean-Claude Juncker? I’m one of the few people – the Prime Minister’s another – who’s probably ever met Jean-Claude Juncker. He’s not an arch-villain.' He added: 'No one knows what he’s supposed to have done wrong. The idea he’s an arch-federalist, a sort of public enemy number one which the media have made him in the last few days is slightly exaggerated.' Mr Clarke said there were better candidates to lead the Commission - the Brussels' civil service which acts as the EU's government. But he said: 'I don’t think it is the most powerful post in Europe. 'This is another thing – I’m obviously feeling in a slightly laid back mood today – I think this is being put out of all proportion. 'There’s one key principle, which is what the Prime Minister goes on about, which is what the choice of who the president is [should be] made in the first place by the elected heads of the national governments and it’s subject to the views of the European Parliament, they have to approve. 'That is the thing that David has got excited about – I think he’s right.' Mr Clarke said it was more important for Britain to secure a good job for the British EU commissioner. 'My own personal opinion – this isn’t on behalf of the Government – I think that’s more important than who the president of the Commission is,' he said. The Prime Minister said he would fight 'until the end' against Mr Juncker's appointment, which is expected to be agreed by other EU leaders on Friday . Veteran Tory minister Ken Clarke said he was one of the few politicians, along with David Cameron, who had met Mr Juncker (right). He said the former Luxembourg premier was not an 'arch villain', but admitted he was not the best man for the job . The damning remarks came after the Business Secretary Vince Cable said Mr Cameron's handling of the row over Mr Juncker had damaged Britain's influence in Brussels. The Prime Minister has cross-party support for his bid to block Mr Juncker from being appointed president of the European Commission. Mr Cameron has vowed to fight 'until the end' the appointment of a man seen by the UK as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform. Business Secretary Vince Cable said Mr Cameron's behaviour had damaged Britain's influence in Europe . But on the eve of a summit where he is expected to find himself isolated on the appointment by fellow EU leaders, his approach was criticised by the Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister. 'It hasn't been good for David Cameron,' Mr Cable told BBC Radio 4's Today. 'I think he is right in principle that the appointment of the commission president shouldn't be foisted on heads of government. 'I think he was right to take the position he did but the way it's been done, unfortunately, has not helped Britain punch its weight in Europe.' Mr Juncker said he was confident of securing the post by the end of this week, 'if common sense prevails'. In an apparent dig at the Prime Minister's campaign against him, the former Luxembourg premier said he was being forced to wait for a decision because common sense was 'very unequally distributed'. Mr Cameron believes that the selection of a candidate chosen by the largest party grouping in the European Parliament would breach the principle that candidates for top jobs are nominated by national leaders and not by MEPs. Having apparently failed to recruit enough fellow leaders to form a blocking minority at this week's European Council summit, speculation is mounting that he might be prepared to deploy an arcane EU procedure nicknamed the 'L-bomb' to stop Juncker's candidacy. The 'Luxembourg compromise' - created in 1965 to assuage the anger of Charles de Gaulle at France being outvoted by smaller countries - allows an EU member to delay a decision which affects an important national interest until a unanimously acceptable solution can be found.","Veteran minister says former Luxembourg PM is not 'arch villain'

"By . Laura Clark . Just 50 pupils on free school  meals make it to Oxford or Cambridge each year – fewer than the number admitted from Eton. Figures published for the first time reveal a stark divide in access to leading universities according to family and school background. Fifty out of the nearly 30,000 pupils on free school meals due to low family income went to Oxford or Cambridge Universities in 2011 – the latest available figures – despite years of initiatives aimed at widening the mix of students.

Eton College in Berkshire, attended by the likes of David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson, produced 60 successful applicants in the same year. Westminster, where Nick Clegg was an old boy, produced 65 . The Department for Education breakdown showed how private school pupils were five times as likely to win places at Oxbridge as youngsters educated at state schools and colleges. Despite billions of pounds being spent over the past 15 years on outreach schemes, bursaries and funding aimed at opening up access to university, just one in 100 state school pupils made it to one of Britain’s top two universities – against one in 20 from private schools. And just one in ten state-educated teenagers went to a university in the elite 24-strong Russell Group – compared with nearly four in ten fee-paying pupils. The figures show that 1,373 state schools and colleges out of 2,177 sent no pupils to Oxford or Cambridge, while 287 got none into a Russell Group university. Five state secondaries failed to send a single sixth-former to  any university. The breakdown, which relates to those who left school or college in 2011, shows that 38 per cent of pupils from private schools went straight to Russell Group universities at age 18 – compared with 11 per cent of their counterparts from the state school system. The figures also show that areas which have retained grammar schools tended to send the most teenagers to the country’s top universities. Pupils from Reading were 30 times more likely to attend a Russell Group university than those from Portsmouth. Schools Minister David Laws said: ‘We are publishing this  data so people can see for themselves how different schools, colleges and local authorities perform. It is right that parents have as much information as possible on which to base decisions for their children’s education. ‘Some students will be aiming to get a job after college, others will be hoping to win a place at a great university. But all schools and colleges must ensure they deliver for all their students – whatever that student’s target. ‘Our reforms are working. More young people from disadvantaged areas in England are applying to university than ever before; more than 20 per cent in 2014, compared to less than 15 per cent in 2009.’","Fifty out of nearly 30,000 pupils on .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A California woman has embarked on a 24,300-nautical-mile journey with the hope of becoming the youngest woman to ever circumnavigate the globe in a single-engine aircraft - and her name just happens to be the same as another female aviator who famously tried to circle the planet 77 years ago. Amelia Rose Earhart took off Thursday from Oakland, California, in a single-engine Pilatus PC-12NG aircraft with co-pilot Theddy Spichtig. The pair expects the journey around the globe to take 17 days with stops in 14 different countries. When she is in the air, about 80 percent of her flight will be over water, the majority of which is open ocean. Scroll down for video . Amelia: Earhart, 31, hopes to become the youngest woman to circle the globe in a single-engine airplane . Amelia, too: Amelia Earhart disappeared over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 as she attempted to become the first woman to fly around the world . As for that other Amelia Earhart - the one who disappeared in the Pacific Ocean while trying to become the first woman to circumnavigate the globe in 1937 - there is no relation. However, Amelia Rose Earhart's family always thought they were distantly related to the famous aviator, and that is who the 31-year-old Amelia Earhart is named after. About 10 years ago, the contemporary Earhart started taking aviation lessons with the hopes of living up to her famous name and flying around the world. A few years later, Earhart learned she was not related to the famous pilot. 'If you believe anything for 30 years and are told it's not true, it's tough to take,' she told NBC News prior to her flight on Thursday. But Earhart - who also flies a helicopter for her job as a traffic reporter - still admired her namesake, and vowed to complete a voyage similar to the one that presumably claimed the life of the fearless aviator. Long flight: Earhart and co-pilot Theddy Spichtig expect the journey to take about 17 days . After years of aviation training, Earhart began her journey Thursday from the same Oakland airfield where Amelia Earhart started her doomed voyage nearly 80 years ago. 'When I think about the feelings of opening up the hangar door on the morning of the flight and seeing the same view that Amelia saw, it's really special to me,' she said. All aspects of the trip aren't the same, of course, and Earhart says that her plane has state-of-the-art equipment that her namesake didn't have the luxury of enjoying during her tragic flight. 'The reliability of a single-engine aircraft today in 2014 is vastly . different than it was back in the 1930s,' Earhart told Boston NPR radio . station 90.9 Wbur's ""Here and Now"" program. 'So, while there is still a . component of adventure with any flight over water, I felt most connected . to the Pilatus. It’s a beautiful aircraft. The cockpit is absolutely . state-of-the-art -- we’ve got synthetic vision, we’ve got dual GPS.' Training: Earhart began her flight training 10 years ago and also flies a helicopter as a traffic reporter . Earhart plans to make stops in 14 different countries on her 17-day trip to become the youngest woman to circle the globe in a single-engine airplane . Despite the fact that they share no familial ancestors, Earhart says recreating the journey will help her connect with her namesake - and hopefully inspire others. 'By recreating and symbolically completing Amelia Mary Earhart’s flight . around the world, I hope to develop an even deeper connection to my . namesake and also encourage the world to pursue their own adventures,' the pilot wrote on the website set up to document her trip. 'Amelia . believed that, ‘adventure is worthwhile in itself’ and it is that type . of attitude that spurs us to seek the unknown, push our limits and fly . outside the lines.' Earhart's journey can be tracked minute-by-minute on her website.","Amelia Earhart grew up thinking she was related to the famed aviator who disappeared over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Tony Blair has risked sparking sparking further controversy after helping poverty-stricken Albania take a step towards joining the European Union . The former Prime Minister has been widely criticised for his decision to open Britain borders to eastern European immigration in 2004 - allowing some 669,000 workers to settle in the UK. But Mr Blair has defended the decision and has been working to help the formerly Communist Albania be allowed into the club as well. Tony Blair has given advice to Albania since stepping down as Prime Minister. The Balkan country wants to join the European Union . Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama smiles during a press conference in Tirana this week after clearing the first hurdle on its long path to European Union membership . Mr Blair and his former spin chief Alastair Campbell forged strong links with Albania during the 1999 Kosovo war and last year became an unpaid consultant for the country. The Balkan nation has overcome concerns about endemic corruption and organised crime to be named an official candidate in Brussels. EU leaders today formally signed off the decision to allow Albania to start the process of preparing its application to join. Albania has failed to win the coveted status three times since 2009. Edi Rama, 49, the socialist prime minister, posed for a celebration selfie in the country's capital Tirana with Mr Campbell, which the ex-Downing Street communications chief posted on Twitter. Albania was isolated from Europe until 1985 while under the leadership of hardline Communist ruler Enver Hoxha. It only began to emerge as a democracy in 1991. Mr Campbell, a paid consultant, said: 'I have been offering advice, strategy, that sort of thing and just making sure that whenever I see people who are decision-makers anywhere in Europe I just try to break down some of the myths about Albania which have a powerful hold.' He was in Tirana when EU foreign ministers agreed to recommend Albania for candidate status on Tuesday. Mr Blair congratulated the country on his Facebook page, adding he had met Mr Rama last week. 'This follows the country’s continued efforts to reform and is a credit to its government and its people.' Albania is one of Europe's poorest countries - with a population of 3.2 million earning on average 10 times less than workers in Britain. While Britain has historically supported EU expansion, David Cameron has vowed to veto Albania's membership unless new rules are introduced to immigration. Mr Cameron has made clear that he will block any attempt to allow Albania to formally join the 28-nation bloc without new limits on freedom of movement. Countries including Britain and Germany have made clear it will not be allowed to proceed without further efforts to tackle corruption and the introduction of an independent judiciary. However, Downing Street today made clear that the it will use its veto to block further expansion of the EU without new rules to prevent migrants from new, poorer countries moving to the UK in search of work. A Number 10 source said: ‘It is absolutely clear that before Albania can ever join, the long-term transitional arrangements would have to apply. If they don’t, we won’t let them in. End of story.’ Mr Cameron is pushing the idea of new countries having to reach a set level of income per head before the borders are opened to the rest of the EU. It follows concerns about the influx of people from countries like Poland, and more recently Bulgaria and Romania, when they joined the EU. Former Downing Street director of communications Alastair Campbell posted this picture of himself with the Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama after the country was named as a candidate EU state . The prospect of EU expansion has emerged for the first time since the European Parliament elections, in which support surged for Eurosceptic parties. Mr Cameron believes the introduction of controls on freedom of movement for new controls could be a major gain in his plan to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership, before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister set out that all and any future accessions would have to be the subject of the new transitional controls that he wants to see, and that would apply to all and any future cases. ‘This is not a decision on accession, it’s a decision to at some point in the future, it could be several years down the line, this is the beginning of any negotiations. ‘There is a period of negotiations that in some countries’ cases has taken decades, any final decision, at the end of that process requires unanimity, and the Prime Minister is very clear the new transitional requirements he wants to see would have to apply to any and all future accessions.’ Albania will not be allowed to progress in joining the EU without major reforms on the use of fraudulent documents, money laundering, drug cultivation and human trafficking. As well as Britain, other countries taking a hardline stance include Holland, Germany, France, the Czech Republic and Spain. In a statement, the EU said Albania had to address issues such as the use of fraudulent documents, money laundering, drug cultivation and human trafficking. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said that, with the EU's decision, Albania had 'regained its lost dignity in the eyes of international partners.' 'It was not an easy job, Europe is not a door that opens easily. After the (European) elections, things could have gone in another direction. The reason I am thankful to European leaders ... is that they stood by the project of Europe,' he told reporters in the Albanian capital Tirana.","Former Prime Minister advising Balkan country on how to join Brussels club .

"By . Harriet Hernando . A jogger has captured the clearest picture yet of the elusive ‘Bristol Crocodile’ lurking in the waters of the River Avon. The 6ft predator was allegedly first spotted by a bus driver who prompted a full-scale police search back in February. A number of other possible sightings emerged but the mysterious creature has not been seen for five months. Scroll down for video . This picture of the 'Bristol Crocodile' in the River Avon, taken by Tamara Blanco, is the clearest yet . Tamara Blanco, 29, spotted the 'Bristol Crocodile' while she was jogging beside Clifton Suspension Bridge . But now Tamara Blanco, 29, who spotted the beast, has taken a clear photograph of what looks like a crocodile’s head and snout emerging from the water under the Clifton Suspension Bridge. Tamara, a Spanish national living in Southville, Bristol, said: 'I was running close to the Suspension Bridge and suddenly I saw something in the water. 'I had heard about a crocodile but that was a long time ago, so when I went home I checked on the internet and I saw that other people had seen it too. 'I felt scared at the time because the thing - whatever it was - was moving in the water. 'I wanted to stay to see it properly but there was no one around and I just didn’t feel comfortable.' Tamara, who works in clothes shop Zara, added: 'I could feel my hair start to stand on end and I thought ‘Oh my God, is it a crocodile?’ and I just left the place.' Fears a crocodile was on the loose in Bristol were first triggered when Avon and Somerset police Chief Constable Nick Gargan tweeted that a bus driver had reported a sighting from Bedminster Bridge. Joke: One local comedian put up this warning sign as the search for the crocodile continued . Mr Gargan revealed the police had launched an investigation, but a search 'found no trace' of the beast on Monday, February 3. A second sighting of the alleged crocodile came from mother-of-three Kelly Gray, 41, of Bishopsworth, who saw the beast two days later. Local Councillor Tom Aditya, 39, then captured video footage a week later. Since then the crocodile had not been spotted until Tamara was out on a run on Tuesday evening. Reptile expert ‘Crocodile Joe’ - one of Britain’s only approved reptile rescue specialists and a regular on BBC shows such as Blue Peter - said it is not impossible for a crocodile to survive in British waters. Clifton Suspension Bridge, where jogger Tamara Blanco believes she spotted the 'Bristol Crocodile' moving around in the water . However, he warned only a very large reptile could survive - and speculated it could be an alligator. He said: 'It would be hard for a crocodile to deal with the cold temperatures for five months as it would be unable to break down food. 'Having said that if it was a big crocodile it would probably be able to survive that long, and the relatively mild winter would have helped. 'It’s more likely that it would be an alligator because they don’t necessarily need warmer waters to survive. 'It’s quite difficult to tell what it is from the pictures, but while it’s unlikely it’s a crocodile it isn’t impossible.”","Tamara Blanco's hair stood on end when she spotted the creature moving in the water .

The security door fell on the child at a Rita's Water Ice store in north Philadelphia at around 4:30 pm, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. The girl was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital and died after arrival. 'Our hearts and prayers go out to the child's family,' said Linda Duke, a spokeswoman for Rita's Italian Ice, the shop's parent company.

Investigators say the metal security door detached and fell on a three-year-old girl who died . Wynter and her mom, Cheryl Larkin, had been attending a fundraising event for the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and Omega Psi Phi fraternity at the time of the incident . The victim has not been identified, but she was said to be with her mother at the time of the accident . 'Due to the current investigation we really cannot comment about the unfortunate incident.' Photos from the scene show the black metal gate lying on the sidewalk, pink balloons still tied to it in front of the shop's red and white striped awning. Several popped balloons appear trapped underneath the gate, which businesses typically roll down after hour to prevent crime. The child was there with her mother, according to WPVI-TV, and bystanders rushed to her aid while others gave CPR. Witnesses told the TV station a sorority and fraternity fundraiser was happening at the time. 'The gentlemen from Omega Psi Phi were holding the awning up and the little girl was on the ground and they were trying to resuscitate her,' witness Kealy Dangerfield Enlow told the TV station.

'It was almost like slow motion,' she told the newspaper. 'The gate was falling and people were screaming and it hit the ground and the little girl was there.' Officials with the Department of Licenses and Inspections were investigating. The department told WCAU-TV that there were no open violations at the store and no reported problems with the gate. L&I said that they only inspect security gates if they receive a complaint.","Accident occurred 4.30pm Saturday at Rita's Water Ice Store in north Philadelphia .

State Emergency Service volunteers in both states responded to hundreds of calls from residents reporting fallen trees while one homeowner in Kurnell, in Sydney's south, had their roof blown off as winds reached 98km/h. And the dangerous conditions are not over yet, with officials in NSW warning people to stay inside as wind gusts are expected to peak at 110km/h on Sunday afternoon. A NSW SES spokeswoman says winds are started to pick up at about 11am. Scroll down for video . A NSW SES spokeswoman said they received about 500 calls for help on Saturday. Pictured is an uprooted tree on Hickson Road, Barangaroo in the inner-city of Sydney . A Sydney man watched this tree come down and catch the edge of his ute on Hickson Road, Barangaroo . Most calls for help in NSW involved fallen trees on Saturday . The SES received 500 calls for help on Saturday night into Sunday morning, mostly from the Sydney and Illawarra areas. In Victoria, they responded to 400 call outs. 'NSW SES teams have had another busy night,' a NSW SES spokeswoman said. 'About 300 of the jobs have been for trees down.' The blustery conditions are being caused by a cold front moving across NSW which also dumped snow on the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. In Liverpool, in Sydney's south-west, a tree fell on an ambulance station on Saturday afternoon, destroying five cars and an ambulance. In Victoria, the worst affected areas included Portland, west of Melbourne. NSW SES Manly Unit were called out to Shelly Beach in northern Sydney when a tree came down earlier on Sunday morning . Victoria's SES Portland Unit were hit with high water levels, 'king tide and southerly winds' on Saturday. Pictured is Dutton Way, Portland - west of Melbourne .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Next month marks the 25h anniversary the United Airlines Flight 232 crash in Iowa, which has become the subject of a new book that exposes in graphic detail what went on inside the doomed plane on its long, tortuous way down. On July 19, 1989, a DC-10 plane with 296 people on board, among them 50 children, was making its way from Denver to Chicago when disaster struck. As Laurence Gonzalez describes in his book Flight 232: A Story of Disaster and Survival, out in bookstores July 7, about a half hour into the flight travelers and crew heard a deafening explosion. Scroll down for video . Shocking sight: An engine and debris sit in a corn field after United Airlines Flight 232 crashed and broke into pieces July 19, 1989, while attempting to make an emergency landing at the Sioux City Gateway Airport . Post mortem: Commercial pilot and author Laurence Gonzales (left) has written a new book titled Flight 232 about the 1989 crash that killed 111 people of the 296 on board the DC-10 jet . A short time later, the jumbo job would lose one of its three engines along with its hydraulics systems damaged by flying debris, plummeting to earth northeast of Sioux City, Iowa, where it would burst into a massive fireball. Against all odds, 185 people made out of the flaming wreckage alive in large part thanks to the actions of the plane's experienced crew. In his quest to reconstruct the disaster, Gonzales, himself a commercial pilot, interviewed hundreds of survivors, airport personnel and rescuers in order to piece together the disturbing narrative of the ill-fated flight, the New York Post reported . As Gonzales explains in his book, when it became apparent that the jet was flying on two engines and with no hydraulics to steer it, no one aboard Flight 232 or in the air traffic control tower could imagine that the inevitable crash would be survivable. One of the passenger interviewed for the book told Gonzales: 'The first thing that strikes your mind is, “Dear God, I’m going to die this afternoon.” The only question that remains is: How long is it going to take Iowa to hit me?’ Flight 232 set out from Stapleton International Airport in Denver at 2.09pm. About 30 minutes later, an explosion rocked the plane when engine No. 2 failed, taking out the hydraulics with it. Perfect storm: A burnt area shows the contact point and crash path of United Airlines flight 232 after it exploded on impact after losing one of its engines and its hydraulics . Twisted wreckage: On July 19, 1989, the Douglas DC-10-10 plane suffered a full hydraulic failure requiring an attempted landing under throttle control alone. It crashed on the runway at Sioux City, Iowa killing 111 of 296 people on board . Iconic: Guardsman Dennis Nielsen carries 3-year-old passenger Spencer Bailey away from the wreckage of United Airlines Flight 232 . Flight attendant Jan Murray recalled that the sound was indescribable. Following her training, the stewardess and her colleagues headed to the cockpit, and what they saw inside made it clear to them that the plane was going down. After the initial shock, Murray returned to her duties, but was visibly upset. Passenger Dennis Fitch, who happened to be a DC-10 pilot instructor by trade, grabbed her by the hand and reassured her that the jet can fly on two engines. When Murray said she had been told by the captain that the plane no longer had hydraulics and that the backup system was down, Fitch was incredulous. Fitch suggested that he might be able to help, and the pilots quickly took him up on his offer, inviting him into the cockpit. Later, the instructor would be hailed as a hero for his role in saving nearly 200 lives. That day, the person responsible for the fate of all the passengers and crew was Captain Alfred Haynes, a 33-year-old veteran with an extensive experience flying DC-10s. Haynes decided to put Fitch's expertise to good use and placed him in charge of the throttles. Gruesome: Rescuers who rushed to the scene encountered people who suffered unimaginable injuries, with clothes melting into their skin and one woman without a scalp . Against all odds: Captain Alfred Haynes, a 33-year aviation veteran, was able to crash-land the disabled plane in such a way that the majority of the passengers and crew came out of the crash alive . Back in the cabin, flight attendants were doing all they could to keep panic at bay and guide the passengers through the 'roughest landing' of their lives, as Captain Haynes would later put it when addressing the 295 people before impact. Jan Brown, the most experienced of the stewardesses, was struck by the realization that there were 50 children aboard the plane who were sitting in their parents' laps rather than in their own seats. According to standard operating procedures, Brown was supposed to instruct passengers to place their kids on the floor of the plummeting aircraft and create buffers around them with seat cushions, but she was disgusted at having to utter those words out loud. High honor: President George H. W. Bush, right, meets with Capt. Haynes at the White House in Sept 7, 1989 . ‘As I’m saying this, I’m like, “Oh my God, this has got to be the most ludicrous, ludicrous thing I’ve ever said in my life,”’ she told Gonzales. As the 369,000-pound plane continued cartwheeling over the bluffs outside Sioux City at 250 mph, people began making final preparations: writing notes for loved ones, saying their goodbyes and hiding their driver’s licenses in their clothing to make it easier to identify their remains later. In the cockpit, the pilots were desperately trying to steer the out-of-control jet toward Runway No 22 at the nearby airport. The pilots could not afford to let themselves succumb to despair, so they did their best to lighten the mood in the face of an almost certain death. At one point, the cockpit’s voice record picked up Dennis Fitch tell the captain: ‘I'll tell you what, we'll have a beer when this is all done.’ Al Haynes said in reply: ‘Well I don't drink, but I'll sure as hell have one.’ The 57-year-old captain would later note: ‘We were too busy [to be scared]. You must maintain your composure in the airplane or you will die. You learn that from your first day flying.’ Just after 3.50pm, about an hour after the first fateful explosion, the hulking machine fell out of the sky, screaming toward earth at 240 knots - about 100 knots over normal landing speed. The plane's right wing was knocked off on impact, causing 10,000lbs of fuel to spew out of the metal stump. The cockpit and the tail came off the wreckage next. The plane finally came to rest on its back, leaving terrified passengers dangling upside down still bucked in their seats. First-hand account: Debi Belliveau of Michigan City, Ind., looks for her husband after talking to reporters about her experience aboard United Airlines Flight 232 . 'We just smashed into the earth,' recalled Brown, who had half of her hair singed off by the flames raging around the plane. Sitting in the cockpit with the crew, Dennis Fitch had a firs-row seat on the unfolding calamity. ‘I was upside down, I had mud in my eyes and my ears, I couldn’t hear, I couldn’t see, I couldn’t move... Tremendous pain,’ he was quoted in the book. ‘My ribs were broken and they punctured my right lung cavity and stuck in there. Just couldn’t get a breath of air.’ The air was filled with the anguished screams of the injured and the dying. When first responders, who have been waiting on the ground as the plane was making its agonizing descent, rushed to the wreckage, they discovered many people with injuries of the sort they have never seen before. Some people had their clothes dissolve into their skin, others looked like their bodied passed through a cheese grater. Passenger Brad Griffin was hurled into the air and landed in a cornfield with third-degree burns and broken feet, but such was his shock that he stood up and walked away. Many were less fortunate. Gonzales tells in the book about a female passenger who was hanging upside down in her seat and screaming for help. When first responders finally reached her and slashed the seat belt holding her in place, her body split into two. And then there was the woman who was scalped by debris from her eyes back. But amid the blood, mud, soot and raging flames there were also numerous acts of heroism. Firefighters and members of the Iowa National Guard converged on the plane, carrying people, alive, dead and somewhere in between, out to safety. Larry Niehus, a local firefighter, told Gonzales about the little girl whom he pulled out of the scorched plane, but it was too late for her. On of the most enduring images to have come out of the crash was that of Guardsman Dennis Nielsen cradling 3-year-old Spencer Bailey after rescuing him out of the plane. The iconic photo was later turned into a sculpture titled Spirit of Siouxland, which graces the Flight 232 Memorial in Sioux City.

Everyday heroes: Flight attendants who aided the victims of Flight 232 pose July 28,1989 at a news conference in Chicago, (L to R) Georgeanne Del Castillo, Janice Brown, Virginia Murray, Donna McGrady, Susan White, and Timothy Owens . And it was not just professional rescuers who risked their lives to save virtual strangers. Passenger Jerry Schemmel, then 29 years old, jumped back into the still-burning plane after promising a mother to find her baby - and through luck and sheer determination he was able to make good on his promise. ‘I know I couldn’t see anything, and I do remember honing in on the cries,’ he is quoted in the book as saying. ‘“Keep crying,” I remember saying to myself. ”Please, keep crying.”’ A National Transportation Safety Board investigation later determined that the crash was caused by a small fatigue crack, which United Airlines maintenance personnel had failed to detect. On July 18, retired Captain Haynes, Jan Brown and other surviving members of the Flight 232 crew will return to Sioux City for a panel discussion about the disaster that changed their lives forever, according to 9News. On the day of the 25th anniversary, ceremonies will be held to honor the victims of the crash, followed by a remembrance service. Several dozen survivors are expected to attend the events surrounding the sombre anniversary.","On July 19, 1989, a DC-10 plane with 296 people on board crashed near Sioux City, Iowa, en route from Denver to Chicago .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A fire in the boiler room of a cruise ship carrying nearly 3,000 people prompted the vessel to return to port in Seattle, officials said. Holland America said that there were no injuries among the passengers and crew of the Westerdam from Saturday's blaze. 'A small fire in one of the boiler rooms' that occurred after the vessel set sail was quickly extinguished, the company said. Public Relations Vice President Sally Andrews said that after the fire, the Coast Guard inspected the 82,348-ton ship and cleared it to sail again, which could occur before dawn. Cleared to sail: A small fire broke out in the boiler room of the MS Westerdam on Saturday night but no one was injured . 'We anticipate it will be before the morning,' she told The Associated Press. The Seattle Times reported that the flames broke out around 5pm as the vessel was in Puget Sound near Kingston, according to Coast Guard petty officer George Degener. The crew knocked the fire down, but a while later it restarted. A combination of high-pressure mist and crew members with hoses extinguished the fire, Kyle Moore, spokesman for the Seattle Fire Department, told the paper. The city dispatched a fireboat, and a few units to the Pier 91 cruise terminal, as a precaution. Holland America brought the ship back 'out of an abundance of caution and in cooperation with the U.S. Coast Guard,' a company statement said. No evacuations were needed, firefighters reported. The Westerdam was beginning a seven-day Alaska cruise with 2,086 passengers and 798 crew members onboard when the blaze occurred. Cruisefever.net reported passengers will receive $250 per stateroom in onboard credit and a 25 per cent certificate for a future cruise equal to the cruise fare that they paid. The news comes after a Holland America cruise ship worker was arrested in Florida in February after admitting that he raped and beat an American passenger during a nude cruise, before trying to throw her overboard. Ketut Pujayasa, a 28-year-old room service attendant on the Nieuw Amsterdam, claimed he attacked the 31-year-old because she insulted him when he tried to deliver her breakfast on Valentine's Day. The Indonesian told the FBI he used a master key to break into the passenger's room at night time, and attacked her in her bed. The woman, who was on a Bare Necessities nudist cruise, was saved after a fellow passenger pounded on her guestroom door, allegedly scaring off Pujayasa who claims to have jumped to a lower balcony to escape.","The small blaze broke out on MS Westerdam about 5pm Saturday .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . People whose blood sugar is on the high end of 'the normal range' may be at greater risk of brain shrinkage, according to new research. The Australian-based research suggests a higher blood sugar level could lead to the kind of mental health issues that occur with aging and diseases such as dementia. Researchers at the Australian . National University in Canberra say this could lead to a revolution in the understanding of how blood sugar levels affect the brain, and how diabetes is defined. A woman tests her blood sugar: Latest research at the Australian National University suggests too high a level could lead to brain shrinkage . The new research, published today in the . medical journal Neurology, involved 249 people age 60 to 64, who had . blood sugar in the . normal range as defined by the World Health Organization. The . participants had brain scans at the start of the study and again an . average of four years later. Those with higher fasting blood sugar levels within the normal range - below 6.1 mmol/l - were more likely to have a loss of . brain volume in the areas of the hippocampus and the amygdala, areas . that are involved in memory and cognitive skills, than those with lower . blood sugar levels. Overload: The study suggests, particularly for older people, that blood sugar levels should be reduced if reaching the high end of the scale . After controlling for age, high blood pressure, smoking, alcohol use and . other factors, the researchers found that blood sugar on the high end . of normal accounted for six to 10 percent of the brain shrinkage. Study author Nicolas Cherbuin said: 'Numerous studies have shown a . link between type 2 diabetes and brain shrinkage and dementia, but we . haven't known much about whether people with blood sugar on the high end . of normal experience these same effects.' A fasting blood sugar level of 10.0 mmol/l (180 . mg/dL) or higher is defined as diabetes and a level of 6.1 mmol/l (110 . mg/dL) is considered impaired, or prediabetes. 'These findings suggest that even for people who do not have diabetes, . blood sugar levels could have an impact on brain health,' Cherbuin said. 'More research is needed, but these findings may lead us to re-evaluate . the concept of normal blood sugar levels and the definition of . diabetes.'",High but 'safe' blood levels accounted for up to ten per cent of brain shrinkage in test group of 250 Australians .
"By . Eddie Wrenn . A space professor from Oxfordshire is battling 'to save Earth' from a solar storm that experts fear will wreak worldwide chaos next year. Professor Mike Hapgood, who chairs the Space Environment Impacts Experts Group (SEIEG) and advises the Government on space weather, says solar storms, generated by an outburst from the sun, are set to knock out national power grids and Global Positioning Systems. He believes magnetic rays from the storm will result in widespread blackouts which will plunge homes and businesses into darkness. Scroll down for video . Eye of the storm: A solar eruption, with a temperature of approximately 50,000C, could take out the National Grid, along with many electrical systems across the world . It could also lead to potentially deadly knock-on effects, for instance . if hydro-electric dams holding back millions of gallons of water are . knocked offline. Early next year, the sun will reach the peak of its 11-year activity cycle, which puts the planet at greater risk of such storms. And experts say with the planet now relying on the Internet and hi-tech gadgetry, the chaos caused by the 2013 solar storm will have a far greater impact than any in the past. Prof Hapgood, who studied at Oxford, warned: 'A big magnetic storm can permeate the Earth's crust, which can drive electric currents through aluminium or copper wires in the National grid, which could cause a national blackout. 'Interactions with Earth's atmosphere can also affect any radio signals. If you had a big storm, GPS might be unavailable for a couple of days. 'On July 21 this year there was a very large event on the far side of the sun, if it had intercepted Earth we would have had a very large magnetic storm.' All manner of transport relies on GPS including aircraft and if the systems suddenly collapse, there could be lethal consequences. He said 'My main interest is to study the likely extremes in these scenarios. These are enormous events that could have a very significant effect on GDP. 'The National Grid now relies on warnings from space craft carrying equipment built at Rutherford and they are developing plans on how to evolve.' Detecting: ACE - the Advanced Composition Explorer - observes particles of solar, interplanetary, interstellar, and galactic origins . Magnetic storms on Earth are caused by Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) on the sun, where large clouds of gas held in place by the sun's magnetic field are suddenly released. When magnetic storms permeate the Earth's crust, the direct current can meet with the alternating current in the National grid and over power transformers, causing them to malfunction. Prof Hapgood explained there is currently one possible defence. 'It sounds counter-intuitive, but actually the National Grid could switch on the whole grid, to block the effect of extra currents. Unlike many recent natural disasters, a huge solar flare would cause the greatest suffering in developed countries. Plasma . balls blasting out from the surface of the sun could wipe out our . modern electricity grids, which would draw the energy to them like . antennas and quickly overload. This . would have a knock on effect on many of the systems that support our . lives, including water and sewage treatment, medicine cooling, . supermarket delivery, power station controls and financial markets. To rebuild the grid, the melted transformer hubs would need to be replaced but new ones take up to a year to make to order. At . present NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) is the most . important indicator of incoming space weather. It can give 15 to 45 . minutes warning of geomagnetic storms and power companies need 15 . minutes to prepare systems for a critical event. However, ACE is 14 years old and already operating beyond its planned lifespan with no planned replacement. Prof Hapgood said 'We will largely lose the early warning capability.' 'At the moment we rely on one American aircraft called ACE which measures the speed of solar flares, plasma coming towards Earth, and its speed and density, but even that can only give a 20 minute warning.' Prof Hapgood warned that even though next year would bring a peak of solar activity, the Earth is always under threat. 'Next year is a peak in activity. However, we can't find a link between these peaks and the major events like CMEs. You shouldn't breath a sigh of relief and think you are safe, this is a constant risk.' Experts are warning that the Government must make contingency plans for the solar storm which could create severe water and food shortages. In 1859 the so-called 'Carrington event' was a magnetic storm that struck Earth - long before the Internet and GPS - and caused the failure of telegraph systems all over Europe and North America. The Northern Lights were reportedly seen as far south as Florida. In 2009 a report funded by NASA claimed similar storms today would lead to 'planetary disaster.' The study outlined the devastating impact it would have. For instance it could leave half of the US without power within 90 seconds, without coal after 30 days and would take the country a decade to recover. Such a scenario would also cost an estimated £1.5trillion - and that would just be in the first year. Prof Hapgood told the New Scientist magazine in 2009 that 'I don't think the report is scaremongering. This is a fair and balanced report.' The flare emitted during the Carrington event in 1859 travelled so fast it took less than 15 minutes to reach Earth anyway. The report's chief author Daniel Baker from the University of Colorado said he hoped it would push decision-makers into action. 'It takes a lot of effort to educate policy-makers, and that is especially true with these low-frequency events. But we are moving closer and closer to the edge of a possible disaster', he said.

"By . Mark Duell . Google will turn down requests from MPs, celebrities and public figures to get embarrassing material about themselves removed from search results, it was claimed today. Europe's top court ruled last month that people have the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about them wiped from the web, which led to the company being bombarded with requests. Google has already had 50,000 requests to remove data and started to take down search results last week. Technology giant: Google has already had 50,000 requests to remove data and started to take down search results last week. The company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, are pictured . But it does not believe the European Court of Justice ruling covers public figures who want to have potentially damaging material removed, reported Jon Ungoed-Thomas of The Sunday Times. Searches for people’s names now include a message at the bottom of the results page that says results ‘may have been removed under data protection law in Europe’. This warning appears on all results, regardless of the name that has been searched for, and is not an indicator that the specific person has requested links be deleted. Last month’s decision, which affects 500million people, requires search services to remove items deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' - and failure to do so can result in fines. Going online: Searches for people's names now include a message at the bottom of the results page that says results 'may have been removed under data protection law in Europe' A MailOnline investigation in May uncovered that a misbehaving politician seeking re-election was among a flood of people who contacted Google demanding their internet histories are deleted. Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’. Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.' This particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child, when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally. The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data’. The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, including technical measures' to remove it. If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined. In addition, it is believed that an actor has asked for details of an affair with a teenager to be removed. Both requests are expected to be refused, according to The Sunday Times. Complaints over Google’s interpretation of the court ruling could be taken to the Information Commissioner’s Office, but lawyers believe famous people may not want to fight a high-profile case that will draw more attention to what they are trying to get taken down. Larry Cohen, a London-cased partner at the legal firm Latham & Watkins, told The Sunday Times: ‘The ruling makes clear that public figures have a lower expectation of privacy. ‘This judgment will help certain people, but not when it concerns public figures or people in whom there is a genuine public interest.’ Legal experts have previously commented that the criteria for determining which take-down requests are legitimate is not completely clear from the EU court’s decision. Google has therefore had to painstakingly sort through the requests and earlier this month sent notifications to people who requested a removal, asking them to bear with the search engine. It began removing the first results under the European data law last week, and plans on ramping up the speed of the process when it is sure that the systems put in place are effective.","People now have right to have 'irrelevant' results about them removed .

"The universe as we know it may not be the only one in existence. In fact, it could be one of a number of parallel universes making up a ‘multiverse.’ In this scenario, there could be multiple versions of you in different universes – ones doing exactly the same thing, and others where your 'twin' has made completely different life choices. It may be stretching the imagination, but theory has gained traction following the major discovery of gravitational waves on Monday. Scroll down for video... The discovery of these gravitational waves could solidify the idea that our young universe went through inflation. That theory is linked to the idea that the universe is constantly giving birth to different, parallel universes . Earlier this week, astronomers detected what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. This very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything is when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation. According to Albert Einstein when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space-time known as 'gravitational waves'. Gravitational waves from cosmic inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the universe. Shown here is the pattern observed with the Bicep2 telescope, providing evidence for cosmic inflation after the Big Bang, although the results have been called into question . Enlarge . This graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the Big Bang to now. Nasa scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth . Astronomers announced on Monday that they  ripples in the fabric of space-time that are echoes of the massive expansion of the universe after the Big Bang. Predicted by Albert Einstein nearly a century ago, the discovery of the ripples, called gravitational waves, would be a crowning achievement the understanding of how the universe began and evolved. The ‘multiverse’ theory is based on the fact that these gravitational wave point to a particularly powerful type of inflation of the early universe. In some regions of physical reality inflation, continues and in others it stops. In the regions where it has stopped someone looking back on this time would see a 'bang' - the birth of their universe. The ‘multiverse’ theory is based on the fact that these primordial gravitational wave point to a particularly powerful type of inflation of the early universe. ‘In most models, if you have inflation, then you have a multiverse,’ said Stanford physicist Andrei Linde speaking at a conference on Monday. Theorists argue that every kind of universe is out there in the aftermath of the Big Bang, from our familiar universe to universes that have completely different physical properties. 'When it comes to inflation, universes beyond our own come wrapped up as part of the package – what we see as our universe is what remained after inflation ceased in this part of reality,' Colin Stuart, author of 'The Big Questions in Science', told MailOnline. 'What's just been found is “a smoking . gun” for inflation – the most concrete evidence we have to date that it . actually happened. So the multiverse is looking more likely than ever.' Scientists, from left, Clem Pryke, Jamie Bock, Chao-Lin Kuo and John Kovac smile during a news conference at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to announce their groundbreaking results on gravitational waves . The term ‘multiverse’ was invented in December 1960, by Andy Nimmo, then vice chairman of the British Interplanetary Society. It is based on the theory of eternal inflation, which suggests that shortly after the Big Bang that formed the universe, space-time expanded at different rates in different places. According to eternal inflation theory, this gave rise to bubble universes that may function with their own separate laws of physics. The idea of other universes out there may seem strange, but scientists say it can help solve some problems of fundamental physics. For instance, the long-standing mystery of why nature appears to be fine-tuned for the emergence of life can be explained by the picture of a multiverse. Some scientists argue that intelligent observers exist only in those rare areas in which the conditions happen to be just right for life to evolve.  The rest of the multiverse remains barren, but no one is there to notice it. Another multiverse theory suggests that if space-time goes on forever, it must start repeating at some point, because there are a . finite number of ways particles can be arranged. The multiverse theory could explain a number of processes that have stumped cosmologists for years. For example, there is the 1998 discovery that galaxies in our universe seem to be spreading apart at an accelerating rate. This goes against the rule that mutual gravitational attraction should be slowing them down. If there were multiverses, our universe may happen to be one in which the dark energy is relatively weak. It could also resolve the dilemma in ‘superstring’ theory. At its most basic level, describes all subatomic particles as vibrating filaments and membranes of energy. The string theory only works in ten or eleven dimensions. 'Such a multiverse might even explain the very reason we exist at all,' said Mr Stuart.'The natural forces at work in our universe, like gravity, for example, seem strangely fined tuned for life. Cosmologists studying a map of the universe from data gathered by the Planck spacecraft concluded that it shows anomalies that can only have been caused by the gravitational pull of other universes . 'Tinker with the settings of nature even slightly and that creates a universe devoid of stars, planets and people. How come all the settings are perfectly suited for living things? 'It seems an extremely unlikely coincidence. However, if there really are a multitude of other universes out there, each with their own settings, at least one of them will have the right settings for life. 'Our existence moves from being highly improbable to inevitable. In fact, if the number of other universes is infinite, there are an infinite number of copies of Earth out there, with an infinite number of copies of you, reading an infinite number of identical versions of this article.' Last year, scientists were able to create a map of light from when the universe was just 380,000 years old . Last year, scientists said that they had found the first 'hard evidence' that other universes exist. Cosmologists studying a map of the universe from data gathered by the Planck spacecraft concluded that it shows anomalies that can only have been caused by the gravitational pull of other universes. The map shows radiation from the Big Bang 13.8billion years ago that is still detectable in the universe - known as cosmic microwave radiation. Scientists had predicted that it should be evenly distributed, but the map shows a stronger concentration in the south half of the sky and a 'cold spot' that cannot be explained by current understanding of physics. Laura Mersini-Houghton, theoretical physicist at the University of North Carolina, said: ‘These anomalies were caused by other universes pulling on our universe as it formed during the Big Bang.’ A multiverse could resolve the dilemma in 'superstring' theory. At its most basic level, the theory describes all subatomic particles as vibrating filaments and membranes of energy.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From changing a light bulb to cooking dinner, there are numerous times where an extra pair of hands would come in useful. And now roboticists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created robotic arms that can lift heavy objects and reach things that your own cannot. The arms may resemble those of Spider Man villain Otto Octavius, or Dr Octopus, but unlike the comic book creations, they are not fused to a person’s body and cannot be controlled by the mind. Scroll down for video . Those look handy! Robotcists at MIT have created a robotic arms that can lift heavy objects and reach objects that your own cannot. Here, the arms mimic the wearer's actions . The arms can lift heavy objects and extend the reach of humans. They weigh 10lbs (9kg) so they can be strapped to a person's shoulders or hips. They can learn from the way a person's body moves and mimic their movements. One day they could have a mind of their own to anticipate the wearer's needs. The arms are designed to streamline tasks, give humans an extra pair of hands and become an extension of their own body. The extra limbs weigh around 10lbs (9kg) so they can be strapped onto the shoulders or hips, but can still lift heavy objects like a human’s. There were built at MIT's d'Arbeloff Laboratory. While they may not use mind control, they can learn from the way a person’s body moves, Gizmodo reported. They are shown to mimic a person’s movements in a video demonstration, but could one day have a mind of their own so they could come to a wearer’s aid if they needed an extra hand. Arms for evil! MIT's robotic arms may resemble those of Spider Man villain Otto Octavius, or Dr Octopus (pictured) but unlike the comic book creations, they are not fused to a person's body and cannot be controlled by the mind . Accessory of the future? The extra limbs (illustrated) weigh around 10lbs so they can be strapped onto the shoulders or hips, but can still lift heavy objects like a human's . Currently the prototype arms could be used to open a door, leaving a wearer’s hands free to carry shopping bags, for example, but in the future they could open the door for the struggling wearer in advance. It is thought that the arms could eventually learn routines, such as opening doors or helping handymen hold tools or panels while they compete a delicate task. 'The extra limbs will help them hold objects, support the human body, share a workload and streamline the execution of a task,' the experts said. 'If the movements of such supernumerary limbs are tightly coupled and coordinated with their arms, the human users may come to perceive the extra limbs as an extension of their own body. Helping hands: At the moment, the prototype arms could be used to open a door, leaving a human wearer's hands free to carry shopping bags, for example, but in the future they could open the door for the struggling wearer in advance (illustrated) The future? The arms could . eventually learn routines, such as opening doors for shoppers, acting as stabilisers (pictured left) or helping . handymen perform tasks (pictured right) such as opening and holding panels or tools so the dexterous human can do their job more effectively . 'The overarching goal of this project is to study a new type of co-robots that is perceived to be an extension of the human body, working closely with the wearer.' The arms are different to others developed, such as the University of Pennsylvania’s Titan arm, as they can move independently of a human’s. The Titan arm could help its wearer carry an additional 40 pounds (18 kg) which is around the weight of a four-year-old child and make it feel easy as lifting a cup of tea. But it cannot deviate from a human’s own arm to anticipate their actions. MIT’s arms stop short of being a full exoskeleton, which can give humans super-human strength, but they could probably be used in the nearer future and be cheaper than full body suits. Natural? 'The overarching goal of this project is to study a new type of co-robots that is perceived to be an extension of the human body, working closely with the wearer,' the arms' creators said. They are used as a stabilising device in this illustration .

The victims' identities have not been released. LAPD officer Drake Madison said the parties was related to the BET Awards, but not part of the official events. The BET Awards are taking place at the Nokia Theater in LA on Sunday evening with Chris Rock as host. Rock didn't mention the violence at the show that marks the best in black entertainment. He won over the audience with jokes about Donald Sterling, the hit series Scandal and rapper Rick Ross. He called the BET Awards the 'black World Cup.' On the red carpet, rapper Nelly said of the violence: 'You can't place (the blame) on BET.' R&B singer Ne-Yo had not heard about the incidents until arriving at the show, but he said he doesn't fear for his safety at industry parties and events. 'I feel like the energy I give off is the energy I get back, and I don't give off that kind of energy,' he said.

Drake, who was originally set to perform, will not attend, BET said Sunday. A representative for Beyonce also said the singer wouldn't attend, and her husband's rep wouldn't divulge if Jay Z would be there or not. Their attendance had nothing to do with the violence at the weekend parties. Drake didn't attend last year's show, where he won video of the year. This year, the 27-year-old rapper's Worst Behavior is nominated for the top prize, competing with Beyonce's Drunk in Love and Partition, as well as Pharrell's Happy and Chris Brown's Fine China. Beyonce and Jay Z launched a co-headlining stadium tour days ago. She is nominated for best female R&B/pop artist, with little competition aside from Rihanna, while her husband will battle Drake, Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole and Future for best male hip-hop artist.

Pharrell scored four nominations, including best male R&B/pop artist, best collaboration for Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines and the viewer's choice award. Beyonce, Drake, Alsina and Jhene Aiko are also up for the fan-voted award. Thicke, who is set to release his new album, Paula - an ode to his wife, Paula Patton, whom he is separated from - on Tuesday, will perform Sunday. Usher, Mary J.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The scientific consensus on climate change, to the tune of 97 per cent of experts, is that humans are changing Earth’s climate for the worse. But some people continue to insist that some of these scientists are wrong, incurring anger among those trying to teach people about the dangers of climate change. And one professor from Texas has had enough - he’s decided to offer £17,500 ($30,000) to anyone that can prove to him that climate change is not man-made. Dr Christopher Keating is offering £17,500 ($30,000) to anyone that can prove to him that man-made activities (stock image shown) are causing Earth's climate to drastically alter. He is not expecting to have to stump up any cash, though, as he is certain that the theory on which their is an overwhelming consensus is correct . Dr Christopher Keating, who previously taught at the University of South Dakota, says the climate change deniers of today are engaged in a campaign that is similar to the one waged by tobacco advocates to deny a link between smoking and lung cancer. 1. Dr Keating will award £17,500 ($30,000) of his own money to anyone that can prove, via the scientific method, that man-made global climate change is not occurring. 2. There is no entry fee. 3. You must be 18 years old or older to enter. 4. Entries do not have to be original, they only need to be first. 5. Dr Keating is the final judge of all entries but will provide his comments on why any entry fails to prove the point. Previously he had been offering £5,850 ($10,000) to the first person to prove climate changing wasn’t man-made but he has since upped the reward to £17,500 ($30,000). All someone needs to do is show him evidence that unequivocally proves he is wrong on his blog. The challenge is open to anyone over 18 and there is no entry fee. 'I will . judge all entries and show why they fail or succeed in the challenge,' Dr Keating, also the author of Undeniable: Dialogues on Global Warming, said. 'Entries don’t even have to be original. They just have to be first.' He has . been involved, at some level, with climate change for 30 years, having . been a professor of physics for over 20 years and teaching at the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. Dr Keating (left) has been involved with climate change for 30 years and previously was a professor of physics. 'Greenhouse gases are on the rise and the effects are evident: the earth is getting warmer, weather everywhere is changing, the oceans are warming at an alarming rate and ice caps are melting,' he says (right) Dr Keating . says he is more than willing to pay the money but doesn’t believe it . will happen. 'I’m a scientist and I have to go where the science leads . me. 'I . have been studying climate change for a long time and I am certain my . money is safe. They are in the business of denial and deception, not . science. 'But, if someone could give me a scientific proof global warming isn’t real, it would be worth the money.' And he says there are ulterior motives to the climate deniers, mainly that they are funded by organisations with a vested interest in fossil fuels. ‘A recent study done at Drexel University showed that denier organisations have received nearly $560 million [£330 million] over an eight-year period,’ he says. ‘They traced this money to about 140 different organisations, including many with ties to the fossil fuel industry. ‘These are the people that stand to lose money if we do something about climate change. ‘It simply shatters any credibility the deniers might have ever had.’ An analysis of global temperatures by Nasa scientists showed that 2013 was the seventh warmest year since 1880 (tied with 2006 and 2009). Nine of the 10 warmest years on record all have occurred since 2000, with 2010 and 2005 ranking as the warmest . Keating says the results of climate change science are so overwhelming that the only way to deny global warming is to deny science itself. ‘Greenhouse gases are on the rise and the effects are evident: the earth is getting warmer, weather everywhere is changing, the oceans are warming at an alarming rate and ice caps are melting. ‘Every where you look you see evidence of global warming. This isn’t something that is only going to occur in the future, it is happening right now.' If someone can prove him otherwise, though, he is willing to change his tune - but at the moment he doesn't see that as being very likely.","Texas-based professor has issued a challenge to climate change deniers .

Security researchers have uncovered a major flaw that affects Android's KeyStore - part of the system responsible for encrypted data and cryptographic keys - on older software releases. Keys are used to encrypt and hide information as people access certain apps, and the vulnerability means hackers could expose and steal banking data and passwords.

KeyStore is used to identify developers and users when they create, install and use apps. A team of experts at IBM spotted the flaw nine months ago, and flagged the vulnerability to Google. Google has since issued a fix for its Android 4.4 KitKat software - but that still leaves all older versions of the software at risk. This is believed to be 86 per cent of all Android handsets in current use. Google has designed Android so that any installed apps need to be 'digitally signed' with a certificate.

Dwain Chambers was ‘running for everything’ as he settled into his blocks for the start of the men’s 100 metres at Birmingham’s Alexander Stadium just before 4.20pm on Sunday . He was running for his fifth consecutive British title and the chance to represent his country at August’s European Championships in Zurich but, at 36, he was also running for his career. And, despite the country’s rich seam of young sprinting talent, it was the veteran performer who claimed victory — yet again. Chambers powered out of his blocks in lane four, surging past new sub-10-seconds man Chijindu Ujah to his right, and held off a late push from Harry Aikines-Aryeetey to become British champion for the eighth time, in 10.12sec. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Dwain Chambers reveals his squatting work out . Experience beats youth: Dwain Chambers won his fifth straight British Championships 100m title . Champion: Chambers (rght) beats Harry Aikines-Aryeetey (left) and Chijindu Ujah (centre) on the line . It was a display of pure guts and sheer determination from a sprinter who has long thrived on proving people wrong. There . are those — and plenty of them — who still point to Chambers’ chequered . past and the two-year ban he served for doping but, although you may . still wish to deride him, you must never discount him. He . drew barely a mention in the build-up to Sunday’s final and he used it . to his advantage, quietly ticking off the rounds with wins in 10.34 and . 10.12, then reproducing a season’s best when it mattered most. Surely . now, nearly 11 years after he gave the urine test that has defined his . career, it is finally time to celebrate an experienced, wily . championship performer who simply refuses to go away. Chambers climbed Mont Blanc for charity last year and continues to scale improbable peaks time and again. His . victory guarantees him a place at the European Championships, where he . first won a 100m silver in 1998, and now he wants to bow out with one . more individual medal after only being selected to represent England in . the 4 x 100m relay at the Commonwealth Games. It could prove to be quite . an emotional swansong of a summer. Training partners: Chambers and Ujah know each other well but as Ujah said, 'experience won' Chambers . said: ‘It did cross my mind (that this could be it). You could say I . was running for my career. I was running for everything. Doubts do cross . your mind but you have to learn to just remove them. When that gun went . “bang” everything disappeared. ‘I . thought: “Just get out of the blocks. If I get out, the pressure is on . them, then all I’ve got to do is run in a straight line”. That’s what I . did. I ran as fast and as hard as I could. ‘I’ve . climbed many mountains, haven’t I? And fallen down a few. But I still . keep standing. I’m the Benjamin Button of track and field.’ Chambers . has been training with Ujah, already the third quickest Briton in . history at 20 years old, but the veteran’s victory leaves the . youngster’s participation in the European Championships up in the air. Chambers’ and Aikines-Aryeetey’s places are assured after they finished first . and second on Sunday and ran inside the qualifying time of 10.20, but . Ujah must trust the selectors’ discretion when they meet on July 14. Over the top: Chambers kept his composure to clock 10.12 seconds as favourite Ujah finished third . The . 9.96 man has already missed out on a place at the Commonwealths and . must hope James Dasaolu cannot repeat his 9.91 form of last year in a . ‘B’ race in Lausanne on Thursday, then at the Diamond League meeting in . Glasgow on July 11. Dasaolu suffered a hamstring injury in February and is yet to open his outdoor season. Ujah . said: ‘I would have loved to win it but experience came through in the . end. I adapted to someone else’s rhythm. I didn’t feel the pressure at . all, but I got a bit of cramp in my hip flexor and I was kind of . panicking a bit. It happens. The Europeans are out of my hands now, so I . will just have to wait and see. I would love to be selected.’ Earlier . at the Sainsbury’s British Championships on Sunday, Asha Philip, 23, . ran 11.11 to win the women’s 100m, with Ashleigh Nelson and 200m . champion Jodie Williams recording the same time — 11.15 — in second and . third respectively. The 3.6 . metres per second illegal wind, however, meant their personal best times . will not count, but Philip and Nelson are guaranteed their places in . Zurich, with Williams assured of at least a 200m berth. Representing: Chambers now qualifies for the European Championships in Zurich in August . Katarina . Johnson-Thompson, 21, also has the option to contest the long jump, . high jump or both at the European Championships — which take place less . than two weeks after she goes for heptathlon gold at the Commonwealth . Games. Johnson-Thompson . finished second in the high jump on Saturday and then won the long jump . on Sunday, leaping an outdoor personal best of 6.81 metres to add the . British outdoor title to the European indoor silver she won in March. A . huge leap — potentially breaking Shara Proctor’s British record of . 6.95m — remains a distinct possibility this season if the  Liverpool . athlete can bring her right leg in line with her left after take-off. ‘It’s trailing a lot,’ she said. ‘It’s about 20cm, which I was trying to work on throughout. ‘I’m happy with the distance but there’s definitely more to come. I’ll make a  decision on the Europeans after Glasgow, I think. ‘I . am fortunate enough to be in the good position that I can pick and . choose what event to do, but I am leaning towards the long jump because I . feel a lot more confident in that.’ Versatile: Katarina Johnson-Thompson set an outdoor PB on her way to winning the British long jump title .

In the summer of 2012, 'young and amazed' British teenager Chijindu Ujah had his photograph taken with Usain Bolt when the Jamaican superstar stopped by Lee Valley Athletics Centre in north London for a training session. Two years on, Ujah has already joined the elite club of 100-metre sprinters who have broken the fabled 10-second barrier. The 20-year-old's astonishing 9.96-second run in Hengelo, Holland, on Sunday made him the third quickest British sprinter. Quick: Chijindu Ujah's 9.96-second run in Holland made him the third quickest British sprinter . After he finished sixth in the 2012 world junior 100m final in Barcelona, won by Britain's Adam Gemili, few could have predicted Ujah would be the first of this talented pair to dip below 10 seconds. His rise has come so quickly that Ujah does not have an agent and the €3,000 (£2,400) in prize-money from Sunday's race was his biggest payday. The invitations will come thick and fast and Ujah is keen to seize the chance to test himself against Bolt when the world-record holder eventually starts his 2014 season after recovering from a foot injury. 'Most definitely,' he said. 'It's every sprinter's dream to get on the line with the best people in the world and compete to the best of their ability. (Bolt) has raised the bar and everybody now feels they can go under the 10-second barrier. 'I don't put any barriers on going sub-10. The times will come, there's still a lot for me to improve on. It seems surreal. When people say to me that I'm among some great guys in history... it hasn't really sunk in.' It was not long ago that a  16-year-old known as 'CJ' or 'Chinji' stopped playing football in the local leagues to concentrate on athletics. Last year he told a national newspaper he would become a rapper if a career on the track did not work out. Ujah, whose parents are of Nigerian descent, studied applied sciences at college, spent a year at the University of Hertfordshire and is weighing up starting a degree in business management in September. The interim period promises to be a very exciting time not just for Ujah, but for British sprinting in general. Such is the strength in depth over 100m, Ujah will not  represent England at this summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. His 2014 target is therefore to represent Great Britain at the European Championships in Zurich in August. Ujah is part of coach Jonas Tawiah-Dodoo's promising group of sprinters including Sean Safo-Antwi, 23, and Deji Tobais, 22, as well as Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford, an 'inspirational and motivating' mentor for Ujah. Challenge: Ujah is keen test himself against Usain Bolt when he recovers from a foot injury . And with Loughborough-based athletes such as James Dasaolu, Richard Kilty, Dwain Chambers and Gemili also vying for selection this  summer, the men's 100m at the British trials later this month promises to be quite a spectacle. Ujah said: 'This is what British sprinting has needed for a long time now. Quite a few guys have gone sub-10.2 and are making the trials look very exciting. Things are really hotting up in British sprinting. It could be at the stage where the British trials become harder than getting to a European final. 'It's definitely exciting but I like those moments and hopefully it can bring out the best in me and the other athletes and we can drive each other to superb times and make the world alert.' Ujah is part of the National Lottery-funded British Athletics World Class Performance  Programme and is set to compete at the Sainsbury's British Championships from June 27 to 29.","Ujah's 9.96-second run on Sunday made him third quickest British sprinter .

"By . Clarence Seedorf . Saturday was the first time in a long time that I have seen an England team play attractive football. I really enjoyed their performance, despite the result. They played with real flair, particularly Raheem Sterling. But if England are to make a real mark on this tournament, either Wayne Rooney or Daniel Sturridge needs to start Thursday’s match against Uruguay on the bench. Yes, it is a tough decision for Roy Hodgson to leave one of them out but they both play the same position. There would also then be the advantage of bringing one of them off the bench to change the game. One or the other: Daniel Sturridge or Wayne Rooney must be dropped to the bench against Uruguay . You need to keep back one of your ‘firework’ players for when the opposition are tiring — Argentina did it well with Gonzalo Higuain against Bosnia. It’s a bigger sacrifice to put Rooney out on the left than on the bench. Unlike a lot of people, I thought Rooney played well against Italy so it is a tough choice between him and Sturridge, who is in such good form. I would also like to see England give Steven Gerrard more support. He was having to defend, create and attack on Saturday, which is too much for one person to do. If England support him more, he will have more energy, which is vital as when his energy dropped after an hour against Italy, England faded. Give him more support: Steven Gerrard was having to defend, create and attack against Italy . English fans can sometimes be a bit harsh on their team so I hope there is a real positive energy created around the team. It has been a long season and, although it sounds simple, loud support from the fans does give players extra power. Football is an entertainment business and the players would be nowhere without the fans. At tournaments like this, they need them more than ever. My country Holland made a cracking start and gave Spain a real wake-up call with the 5-1 thrashing on Friday night. Bizarrely, I think the tournament will become harder for Louis van Gaal’s team as their opponents will be taking them even more seriously. The alarm bells will be ringing. You don’t need me to tell you what a great coach Van Gaal is — his c.v does that. But what sets him apart is his ability to get his message across to his players and get them working really well as a team. The boss: Louis van Gaal (right) high fives Robin van Persie and his ability to get the best out of his players sets him apart from other coaches . He is an very explosive man but most great coaches are and he has the tactical and technical ability to get away with it. He is also highly motivated after failing to qualify for the World Cup during his first spell as head coach. I wouldn’t put Holland up there with Germany, Brazil and Argentina as the favourites for the tournament but they are not too behind after that performance. World champions Spain need to respond against Chile — it will be a huge test. Germany impressed me but they didn’t surprise me. Brazil and Argentina looked like they were feeling the pressure but two teams that really impressed me were Ivory Coast and USA. Ivory Coast are much more organised than the other African teams and they have such quality. Once they used that quality to turn the game around against Japan, they didn’t let their opponents have a single effort on goal and it was that that impressed me most. They were in control and are now a mature side who will do well. Passion: John Brooks could not quite believe it after scoring the USA's winner against Ghana . USA have the great combination of Jurgen Klinsmann’s discipline and their natural national passion. They were so organised against Ghana and are a real threat to Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. I wouldn’t be surprised to see them qualify. Finally, I want to congratulate Brazil on the tournament so far. Despite all the concerns before it started, everything is going great. They atmosphere is very special — Brazilians are picking a team to support for the game they’re watching and making lots of noise. Here in Rio, there is a lot of fun, a lot of music and a lot of joy — I haven’t seen even the slightest hint of danger. I’m having a lot of fun, especially in the BBC studio. Full of fun: Two Brazilians pose at the France-Honduras match and the World Cup atmosphere is special .","Rooney or Sturridge must be an 'firework' player coming off the bench .

"By . Rio Ferdinand . Rio Ferdinand selects his three young stars to shine and set the world alight in Brazil this summer. JAMES RODRIGUEZ  (Colombia and Monaco) I’m looking forward to seeing what this kid can do. He’s a 22-year-old attacking midfielder with great balance, a turn of pace and a nice left foot. He’s that rare talent — someone who gets you off your seat. The only downside is that clubmate and Colombia co-star Radamel Falcao is out injured. Falcao would have created the space for Rodriguez to thrive. But then the absence of Falcao is perhaps Rodriguez’s chance to take centre stage. Time to shine: With Falcao injured, James Rodriguez could step up and deliver for Colombia . PAUL POGBA(France and Juventus) I know from his time at Manchester United that Pogba is ridiculously talented and it is unfortunate that a complicated contract situation meant he left. I was sorry to see him go. Everyone at United knew he was going to be a super player when he arrived at 16 from Le Havre. He told me before he left he wants to be the best player in the world. He said it deadpan but meant it. He is like Patrick Vieira, only more skilful with a greater range of abilities. That’s how highly I rate him. Rising star: Juventus' Paul Pogba has earned a reputation as one of the brightest young players in Europe . In the middle: Pogba's energy and technique will be crucial for France this summer . JULIAN DRAXLER (Germany and Schalke) I hope he gets some time on the field among the many talents Germany have. He has fine feet and a great imagination. He is only 20, but he has been playing regularly in the Bundesliga for more than two years. He has an eye for goal, evident back in May 2011 when he scored an absolute peach for Schalke in a German cup final win with a long-range volley. He has a big future. Breakthrough: Julian Draxler is on the fringes of the Germany first XI but played regularly in the Bundesliga .

"By . Chris Waugh . Follow @@ChrisDHWaugh . Following England's earliest exit from a World Cup since 1958, former players and managers have been queuing up to add their opinion to the inquest that will inevitably begin when the Three Lions return from Brazil. Successive 2-1 losses to Italy and Uruguay leave England bottom of Group D and already eliminated from the tournament, despite having a match against Costa Rica still to play on Tuesday. Among some of the suggestions offered to ready the Three Lions for future tournaments are that English players need to learn to play alternative formations, the FA need to produce a greater number of coaches, and England must make sure their best XI players take to the field. Post-mortem: England's early exit from the World Cup has caused an inquest to begin as to why . All alone: Roy Hodgson's position has come under question following England's elimination in Brazil . Clinical: Luis Suarez's brace ensured England exited the World Cup at the earliest stage since 1958 . Tactics: England players' naivety when it comes to differing formations may have cost them in Brazil . Beaten: England captain Steven Gerrard crouches following their 2-1 loss to Uruguay . Tears: England fans look devastated at the Corinthians Arena after the 2-1 loss to Uruguay . Sven Goran Eriksson . ‘Roy Hodgson stays because he is an Englishman,' the former England manager told Swedish newspaper SportExpressn. 'Had he been a foreigner, there is not a chance he would have been left in the job. ‘When I was with England, expectations were that we would get to the semi-finals and finals.’ Foreigner: Ex-England manager Sven Goran Eriksson thinks Roy Hodgson will keep his job as he is English . Success? Eriksson led England to three successive major tournament quarter-final appearances . David James . ‘It isn’t a case of under-performing. We are simply not good enough,’ the ex-England goalkeeper told The Observer. ‘You look around the dining table on an England camp and you want to see winners and there are very few. 'Certainly Greg Dyke’s notion of winning the World Cup in 2022 seems more far-fetched than ever.’ Poor: Former England goalkeeper David James says they did not under-perform, they aren't good enough . Patrick Vieira . ‘The English need to accept the modern way of playing and that means developing tactically,' the former France captain told the Sunday Times. 'Other countries try different things, three at the back, other formations, but English players don’t get used to different systems and situations. Adapt: Ex-France captain Patrick Vieira says English players must learn to play alternative formations . Rio Ferdinand . ‘England’s embarrassing early exit from the World Cup needs to be a wake-up call that something is fundamentally wrong in our national game and it needs fixing or we’ll be also-rans for ever,’ said Ferdinand in his Mail on Sunday column. ‘We have too few coaches... Coaching is respected elsewhere, valued. In England it’s vocational, a hobby.’ Fundamental: Sportsmail columist Rio Ferdinand says there is a problem with the English national game . Terry Butcher . ‘There has to be a huge swing in mentality of our players at international level,’ said the former England defender in the Sunday Mirror. ‘It’s no good meeting up at St George’s Park and trying to create a club atmosphere because playing for England is more than that.’ Attitude: Terry Butcher believes a change in mentality is needed for England to improve . Tony Adams . ‘Roy Hodgson left his best defence at home,' the former England international said in the Sunday Telegraph. 'The most experienced and best centre half in the country, John Terry, was not picked while Ashley Cole should have travelled. ‘Hodgson’s philosophy was very naive.

"By . Charlie Scott . Follow @@charliefscott . With three former World Cup winners that had lifted the trophy seven times between them Group D was supposed to be the Group of Death. For England – and one of Italy or Uruguay – that has proved the case. But not for the fourth nation in the group, Costa Rica. Jorge Luis Pinto’s team are the first side to seal their place in the last 16 after brilliant wins against top-10 ranked sides Uruguay and Italy. Upset: Costa Rica's players defied the odds to reach the last 16 in Brazil . We've done it! Costa Rica players celebrate their win over Italy . Ecstacy: Costa Rican players celebrate on the pitch at full-time . Tears of joy: Costa Rica players embrace eachother at the final whistle . Surprise package: Costa Rica's players can't quite believe it after reaching the knock-out stages . Fancy footwork: the Costa Ricans show off their dance moves . Following the 1-0 win over Italy in Recife that catapulted them into the next round, Sportsmail has taken a look at this World Cup’s surprise team. The coachJorge Luis Pinto is coaching Costa Rica for the second time after an unsuccessful stint before the 2006 finals. The 52-year-old Colombian, who has won league titles in Costa Rica, Peru, Venezuela and Colombia, sets his side up in an attacking 5-4-1 formation, with full-backs Cristian Gamboa and Junior Diaz providing width and energy down the flanks. Genius: Jorge Luis Pinto has masterminded Costa Rica's success . His side got thumped by Chile, lost to South Korea and Japan, and drew with Republic of Ireland in the months leading up to the World Cup, though they did coast through their qualification campaign, finishing second behind United States, ahead of Mexico and Honduras. Ranked 28th in the world, Costa Rica’s record in World Cup matches before the Brazil tournament was not pretty. They had won just three of their 10 games, drawing one and losing the other six. Costa Rica legend Paulo Wanchope, known to English fans following spells at Manchester City, Derby and West Ham, is Pinto’s assistant manager. The stars . Joel Campbell – 35 caps, 10 goals . One of many Costa Rica players to come through the youth system of the country’s top club, Saprissa, Campbell moved to Arsenal in the summer of 2011, though work permit issues have seen him sent out on loan to Lorient, Betis and Olympiakos. Young Gunner: Joel Campbell is expected to be part of Arsene Wenger's first-team squad next season . The 21-year-old striker has recently burst on to the radar of Europe’s top clubs having followed up a fine season on loan at Olympiakos with two brilliant performances alone upfront against Uruguay and Italy. Arsene Wenger has already moved to ward off potential suitors by saying he expects the talented forward to return to Arsenal for pre-season training ahead of next season. Christian Bolanos – 57 caps, 2 goals . A regular in the Costa Rica midfield since making his debut in 2005 against Norway, Bolanos, now 30, plies his trade in Denmark with Copenhagen having moved to the club four years ago. One of the standout performers for his first club Saprissa at the 2005 Club World Cup, he was invited for a trial at Liverpool after being named third best player at the competition. Though he did not do enough to persuade the Merseyside club  to sign him on a permanent deal, Charlton offered the pacey winger a one-year loan deal, only for his work permit application to be turned down. Red Sea: Jubilant fans celebrate during the win against Italy . Pitch invasion: Costa rica's subs run onto the pitch at full time . Bryan Ruiz – 65 caps, 14 goals . The skilful 28-year-old was allowed to leave Fulham to join PSV on loan last season, after dipping in and out of the team during three seasons at Craven Cottage. A broken foot in 2012 stalled his progress at Fulham, though he has shown signs of his best form in the Eredivisie this season. His clever passing is vital to Costa Rica’s play, as they look to move the ball to Campbell as quickly as possible. Ruiz netted his 14th international goal in the 1-0 win over Italy, thumping a header past Gianluigi Buffon and in off the crossbar. Cottage industry: Fulham's Ruiz watches his header creep over the line . Hero: Costa Rica captain Bryan Ruiz celebrates his winner against Italy . Keylor Navas – 55 caps . Linked with Barcelona following an impressive season at Levante, Navas has pulled off some vital saves in Costa Rica’s first two group games, conceding just once during that time. Navas, 27, has 55 international caps to his name, having asserted himself as first-choice for his country after making his debut against Suriname in October 2008. In 2009 he was named the CONCACAF Gold Cup’s best goalkeeper, as Costa Rica reached the semi-finals before being beaten on penalties by Mexico. Top of the stops: Keeper Keylor Navas denies Italy's Mario Balotelli . Junior Diaz – 64 caps, 1 goal . Costa Rica were dealt a blow before the tournament when Everton defender Bryan Oviedo was ruled out through injury, but Diaz has filled in on the left brilliantly in his absence. The 30-year-old, who currently plays for Bundesliga side Mainz 05, offers Costa Rica searing pace down the wing, while his crossing ability was also on show against Italy as he provided the assist for Ruiz’s goal. History . Their previous best performance in a World Cup came on their debut back in 1990, when they advanced to the last 16 having beaten Sweden and Scotland, before they were knocked out by Czechoslovakia. Man hug: Costa Rica players hug it out after the game . They did not qualify for another tournament until 2002, where they were knocked out in the group stages. Their third appearance was one to forget too, as they lost all three of their group games, including a 4-2 thriller on the opening day against Germany. In 2010 they lost a World Cup qualification play-off against Uruguay but they got revenge in their first group game this time round, winning 3-1 and ending a four-match losing run at World Cups in the process.","Costa Rica clinch place in knock-out stages after beating Italy .

The Liverpool midfielder, 34, will mull over whether to announce his international retirement after Roy Hodgson's side crashed out of the 2014 World Cup at the group stage.

When that forlorn frontman is Robin van Persie, the stakes are raised. But that is the scenario which has faced both Louis van Gaal and David Moyes, Manchester United bosses present and past. One acted, one stalled. One won, one lost. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Robin van Persie deceives Michel Vorm in Holland training . Decisive: Louis van Gaal substituted a subdued Robin van Persie against Mexico and Holland went on to win . Not going to plan: Van Persie did not have a great game and was taken off in the second half . Off the pace: Van Persie had a bad game when United lost to Newcastle back in December . Backlash: David Moyes feared supporter reprisal when he chose not to substitute Van Persie during December's defeat to Newcastle . For it was back in December that Moyes – fearing reprisal for removing his talisman – left an out of sorts and unfit Van Persie to toil through 90 minutes during a 1-0 home defeat to Newcastle. Afterwards, a beleaguered Moyes offered: ‘I think if I'd brought him off some people would say 'What are you doing? You are 1-0 down and you're taking off your top goalscorer”.’ Instead, he had replaced a winger for a winger, a midfielder for a midfielder and a full-back for a full-back, all the while leaving Danny Welbeck to wonder what influence he might have had at the expense of his laboured team-mate. Van Gaal, in contrast, hooked Van Persie with 14 minutes remaining of Holland’s second-round tie with Mexico on Sunday. Sure, it raised eyebrows, but, significantly and to game-changing effect, it raised the energy, urgency and invention of his side. Come full-time they were leading 2-1, Van Persie’s replacement – Klaas-Jan Huntelaar – having assisted Wesley Sneijder’s equaliser and kept his nerve to score the winner from the penalty spot. Van Gaal, unlike Moyes, had not been afraid of the subsequent scrutiny which would have arrived in the wake of a defeat. The comeback kings: Louis van Gaal celebrates as Holland beat Mexico late on to progress to the last eight . He said: ‘The substitution was tactical. Let’s not forget before he joined the team he was recovering from an injury. It’s difficult for him to keep up 90 minutes, especially in these conditions.’ Huntelaar’s goal was the third consecutive match in which a Van Gaal introduction had made the difference. Memphis Depay fired the winner in the 3-2 victory against Australia and he was again on target from the bench in the 2-0 success over Chile, fellow substitute Leroy Fer having opened the scoring. On both occasions Van Gaal had made bold calls, forward Depay having replaced a defender against Australia and playmaker Sneijder the man to make way for Fer against Chile. Such conviction characterises Van Gaal, just like a lack of it ultimately undermined Moyes.

"By . Mark Prigg . Federal health regulators will consider this week whether to green light a provocative new fertilization technique that could eventually create babies from the DNA of three people, with the goal of preventing mothers from passing on debilitating genetic diseases to their children. The Food and Drug Administration has framed its two-day meeting as a 'scientific, technologic and clinical' discussion about how to test the approach in humans. But the technique itself raises a number of ethical questions, including whether the government should sanction the creation of genetically modified humans. Scientists could soon create embryos using DNA from three people - a man and two women - to prevent mothers from passing on genetic diseases. Stock image pictured. The Department of Health is starting a public consultation on the rules to gather as many views as possible before introducing its final regulations . The experimental technique, if approved for use, would allow a woman to give birth to a baby who inherits her normal nucleus DNA but not her defective mitochondrial DNA. To accomplish this, researchers would remove the nucleus DNA from a healthy female donor's eggs and replace it with the nucleus DNA of the prospective mother. After fertilization, the resulting child would inherit the mother's nucleus DNA - which contains most inherited traits like eye color and height - but the donor's healthy mitochondrial DNA. The FDA panel will hear from several prominent critics who oppose any human testing of the approach, arguing that it could be a slippery slope toward 'designer babies,' - in which parents customize traits like eye color, height and intelligence. But the field's leading U.S. researcher will be on hand to explain and defend his work, which he describes as 'gene correction,' rather than 'gene modification.' 'We want to replace these mutated genes, which by nature have become pathogenic to humans,' says Dr. Shoukhrat Mitalipov, who will present on Tuesday. 'We're reversing them back to normal, so I don't understand why you would be opposing that.' The FDA meeting was prompted by Mitalipov's research at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, where he and his staff have produced five healthy monkeys using the DNA-replacement technique. He is seeking FDA approval to begin testing in a handful of women who carry defective genes that can lead to devastating diseases in children, including blindness, organ failure and epilepsy. An estimated 1 in 5,000 U.S. children inherit such conditions because of defective DNA in their mitochondria, small energy-producing organs found in the cell. Unlike most DNA - located in the nucleus of the cell - mitochondrial DNA is passed along only by the mother, not the father. The experimental technique, if approved for use, would allow a woman to give birth to a baby who inherits her normal nucleus DNA but not her defective mitochondrial DNA. To accomplish this, researchers would remove the nucleus DNA from a healthy female donor's eggs and replace it with the nucleus DNA of the prospective mother. After fertilization, the resulting child would inherit the mother's nucleus DNA - which contains most inherited traits like eye color and height - but the donor's healthy mitochondrial DNA. This graphic explains the science behind the technique which has been slammed by critics for being a breach of medical ethics . The technique initially made headlines as a way to create babies with three parents, but scientists say that's an overstatement, since the child would have only trace bits of DNA from the donor. No matter how it's described, the technique faces opposition from a broad spectrum of critics who say it presents serious medical, ethical and societal dilemmas. Chief among these concerns is that the genetic changes created using the technique would be passed down to future generations, potentially spreading unintended health consequences throughout the population. In a letter to the FDA, the Center for Genetics and Society points out that more than 40 countries - including Germany and France - have laws banning human gene modification that is passed on to future offspring. The group's director says mitochondrial replacement would help only a tiny fraction of patients affected by such disorders, and they have other options like egg donation to create healthy children. 'It does initially look like something you would want to support,' said Marcy Darnovsky. 'But the safety concerns and the social and ethical concerns are really overriding.' Still, many experts expect the FDA to eventually sign off on testing the technique. They note that regulators in the U.K. found broad public support for the research there, with no evidence that it would endanger mothers or their children. Scanning electron micrograph of a human embryo at the 8 10 cell stage day 3. The techniques under discussion involve removing the nucleus DNA from a healthy female donor's eggs and replacing it with the nucleus DNA of the prospective mother, either before or after fertilisation . The U.K. has significantly more regulations surrounding in vitro fertilization than the U.S., where fertilization clinics are essentially a self-regulated industry. And before the FDA considers the philosophical implications of genetically modified children, its first concern is the safety of any patients enrolled in experiments. In documents posted ahead of this week's meeting, the agency said it will seek public input on how to monitor the safety of women who undergo the fertilization process. The agency also wants to hear proposals for long-term follow-up of any children produced via the process. Stanford University Professor Hank Greely says the FDA is taking the right approach by focusing on the immediate safety concerns, rather than speculating on whether this could lead to a 'Brave New World' scenario of biologically engineered humans. 'We constantly live on slippery slopes and it's our job as moral humans to hold a good position on the slope,' said Greely, a law professor who studies medical ethics. 'If you're worried about genetically engineered monsters or superheroes then you try to stop that, you don't try to stop medically useful interventions because you're worried that 17 steps down the line it will turn into something we don't like.'","Technique designed to prevent mothers passing on debilitating genetic diseases to their children .

"By . Adam Shergold . Follow @@adamjshergold . She's best known for solving complex mathematical problems on Channel Four's cult show Countdown. And now Rachel Riley has turned her brilliant mind to figuring out something we all want to know - who will win this summer's World Cup. The Manchester United fanatic and Oxford graduate has been poring over all the data from World Cups down the years to try and pinpoint the patterns that will tell us which team will lift the famous trophy in the Maracana on July 13. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Behind the scenes with Rachel Riley on World Cup shoot . World Cup tips: Countdown presenter Rachel Riley has crunched the data ahead of the big kick-off in Brazil and tipped Chile as the winner . Heading for glory? Chile are the fancied team after Rachel's calculations, which took into account dozens of different factors . And, in an outcome that may raise a few eyebrows, all the statistics point to outsiders Chile. Commissioned by bookmaker Ladbrokes, Rachel took into account a diverse range of factors including goal average, goal scorers, win rates, climate and geography in a mathematical formula to try and find a winner. She found that since the Mexico World Cup in 1986, performances in the qualifying competition have had a significant influence on the outcome of the tournament. The key is not to peak too soon and to do just enough to qualify with a win rate of between 50 and 66 per cent. Close control: Rachel shows off her ball skills but, despite the top, doesn't believe England will advance too far in the competition . It all adds up: A combination of Chile's win ratio, qualifying campaign and FIFA ranking suggests they will be dark horses in the finals . This is bad news for the likes of Germany and Holland, who raced through their qualifying groups and won 90 per cent of their games, and also Belgium (80 per cent) and defending champions Spain (75). Chile's qualifying win rate of 56 per cent is just about perfect. The second biggest influence according to Rachel are the goal scoring averages. The previous seven world champions only averaged 2.1 goals per game through the qualifying rounds. Unfortunately, this rules out England, who averaged over 3 goals a game in their 10 qualifying matches. Relying on one star player is not the key to success either. Top scorers in previous World Cup winning teams scored an average of 4.85 goals during qualification. Place your bets: Rachel recommends you put your money on outsiders Chile to lift the trophy in the Maracana on July 13 . Show your working: Rachel looked in detail at every tournament since 1986 in order to draw her conclusions . This time round, Luis Suarez scored 11 and Lionel Messi 10, knocking both Uruguay and Argentina out of the equation, but their South American neighbours Chile had Arturo Vidal and Eduardo Vargas on five goals each. The fact no nation from outside Europe and South American has ever won the World Cup rules out a swath of teams. And no team with odds of 100-1 has ever prevailed either. No European team has ever won on South American soil, removing France, Portugal and Italy from the mix, leaving Brazil, Colombia and Chile. The next factor was that no pre-tournament favourites have lived up to their billing since 1986 and so Brazil - priced at 3-1 - aren't going to do it. It now boils down to omens and human reasoning - Colombia have the easier group but are without star man Radamel Falcao. Big fan: Rachel received a signed Manchester United shirt from Ryan Giggs to mark her 1,000th appearance on Countdown . Glamorous: Rachel competing in BBC show Strictly Come Dancing last year . Chile have the stronger squad and won 2-0 at Wembley against England back in November - 66 per cent of teams to do so at the new Wembley have been World Cup finalists. Explaining her decision, Rachel said: 'Having crunched all the numbers and stats my maths suggests Chile are a good bet to upset the odds at 40/1. 'They might be amongst the outsiders, but the statistics and form imply they will be this year’s dark horses. They’ve got a decent team, and although it’s a tough group, they tick all the boxes and I’m convinced Chile can go all the way. 'Everyone thinks the winner will come from one of the top 10 teams, but the key stats on qualifying performance, goals scored, goalscorers, host nation and current outright odds suggest the likes of pre-tournament favourites Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Germany, Italy and France will be going home empty handed. 'As for England, I’ll be cheering on Roy’s Boys, but I’m not sure it’s going to be their year.'","Countdown presenter crunched all the facts and figures from every tournament since Mexico 1986 .

"By . Mario Ledwith . A radical Islamist group based in Nigeria today claimed it has killed seven hostages, believed to include one Briton. Ansaru seized the men on February 16 from the site of a construction company operating in the northern part of the country. In a statement, the terrorists cited reports from local media organisations that British planes had been spotted at a Nigerian airport, suggesting that a rescue operation was imminent. But the Ministry of Defence categorically said its planes were only present at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja to assist the French-led operation in Mali, categorically denying any involvement in a rescue bid. Scroll down for video - Warning: Graphic content . Online: A video was posted online by Islamist terror group Ansaru, claiming that they had killed seven hostages captured in February. Nigeria's President claimed today that some of the hostages might actually still be alive . Operation: Reports appeared on a local Nigerian website two weeks ago saying that five British planes were spotted at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja and linking them to a rescue operation for the hostages . The group, also known as the Vanguard . for the Protection of Muslims in Black Africa, released a statement saying that they had killed the hostages because of a planned rescue by . British and Nigerian forces. The message, issued in both Arabic and English, was accompanied by screen shots of a video purporting to show gunmen standing above the dead hostages. The message claimed that British forces had sent 'five jet bombers and soldiers' to the area, also claiming that Nigerians had been arrested and killed by the troops. A report appeared in a local newspaper two weeks ago reporting that five British 'bomber jets' had been spotted at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja. The . report suggested that the planes, allegedly marked 'Royal Army', may . have been planning to launch a rescue operation for the hostages. Pictured: An image taken from a video previously issued by Nigeria Islamist group Ansaru, standing behind a banner reading 'Ansar al--Muslimeen in the Land of Black Africans' Statement: The message, attributed to Ansaru, posted online claiming that the seven hostages had been killed . Published in Leadership Weekend, . the report quoted a military official linking the presence of the . British jets with an operation, but the British high commissioner in . Nigeria, Rob Fitzpatrick, told the publication: 'This is routine . military-to-military engagement.' The . message posted online by Ansaru, dated February 5, contained links to . two online reports stating that the planes had been spotted. The group said a message from Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan saying the government would do anything in its power to free the hostages also sparked the decision to kill the hostages. A . Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed there has been a military . presence in the Abuja airport but it said this was unconnected to the . hostages. The spokesman . denied that there had been five British bomber jet, but said that . British forces were assisting the French-led operation in Mali, helping . to move Nigerian troops into the country. Local media: A report, published by Leadership Weekend, claimed that five British 'jet bombers' were spotted at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja . A British hostage was killed by his captors in Nigeria in March 2010 when a UK Special Forces rescue operation ended in tragedy. Chris McManus was executed by gunmen as members of the Special Boat Service and Nigerian soldiers moved in on the Al Qaeda-inspired terrorists’ hideaway. Fellow hostage, Italian Franco Lamolinara, was also killed. The pair had been held for ten months. Footage of the 28-year-old engineer blindfolded alongside three armed men was broadcast, showing the terrified hostage pleading for his life. The botched rescue was triggered when – after months of searching – the SBS found the heavily protected location where the men were being held. Mr Cameron said authorities had decided to go ahead with the rescue after receiving 'credible information about [the men's] location'. Authorities categorically deny that there the British have been involved in the operation. The video message, claimed to be from Ansaru, has not be immediately verified. The group of hostages are thought to include citizens from Lebanon, Britain, Greece, Italy and the Philippines. They were all employees of Setraco, a Lebanese . construction company with an operation in Bauchi state. A FCO spokesperson said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Nigeria and are urgently investigating.' British authorities have previously linked Ansaru to the . May 2011 kidnapping of Christopher McManus, who was abducted with . Italian Franco Lamolinara from a home in Kebbi state. The men were held . for months before being murdered by their captors in March 2012 during a . failed Nigerian military raid backed by British special forces in . Sokoto, the main city in Nigeria's northwest. The message, posted to an Islamic . extremist website today, said Ansaru members killed the hostages . after British warplanes were seen in Bauchi, in the country's northern region, by . Nigerian journalists. The statement read: 'As a result of this operation, the . seven hostages were killed.' Following the initial attack and capture of the hostages in February, Ansaru issued a short statement claiming responsibility. Thee workers were captured from a . company camp at Jama'are, a town about 125 miles north of Bauchi, the . capital of Bauchi state. The . attack saw gunmen first assault a local prison and burn police trucks, . before the  attackers blew up a fence at the compound, killing a . guard as they took over the area. The . gunmen were organised, leaving the Nigerian household staff members at . the residence unharmed, while the foreigners were quickly abducted, . according to witnesses. In January, Ansaru described . itself as a splinter group independent from Boko Haram, widely regarded . as the north's main terrorist group. Ansaru cited two local media reports claiming that British planes had arrived in Nigeria to assist a rescue operation for the terrorists but the MoD categorically denied that British troops were involved in a rescue . Workers: The group were all employees of Setraco, a Lebanese construction company with an operation in Bauchi state . Boko Haram, whose name means . 'Western education is sacrilege' has launched a guerrilla campaign of . bombings and shootings across Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north. The group has been blamed for at least 792 killings last year alone, according to reports.

"By . Sam Webb . A person who has undergone a sex change is fighting a legal battle for the right to have her previous identity as a man officially 'forgotten'. The case of C, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, is being seen as a landmark case concerning the rights of transgender persons across the UK. The 44-year-old, from the Greater London area, is challenging the legality of the Government’s retention and use of personal information which reveals she was once male. Her case centres on the data held on her by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) as a long-term unemployed person in receipt of jobseeker’s allowance. Controversial: A 44-year-old transgender person is fighting for the right to have their previous gender forgotten in landmark case at London's High Court . She says, because details of her transgender status have become known to DWP personnel, she has experienced 'intrusive and humiliating interactions' on visits to her local Jobcentre Plus on a fortnightly basis. Claire McCann, representing C, told a judge at London’s High Court: 'She says her previous gender identity as male should be forgotten, except where it is strictly necessary. 'The right to be treated as a woman and not as transgender is important and deserving respect.' Ms McCann referred to a ruling won by a Spanish man in the European Union Court of Justice against Google that he had a 'right to be forgotten' and 'irrelevant' and outdated data about him held by the search engine should be erased at his request. Ms McCann said of C’s case: 'This case far more acutely concerns the right to be forgotten.' C considered her gender reassignment 'an intensely private matter' and 'wholly irrelevant' to her attempts to find work. 'C' says she has experienced 'intrusive and humiliating interactions' on visits to her local Jobcentre Plus and wants her male history deleted. File picture . Ms McCann said C had obtained a full gender recognition certificate (GRC) under the 2004 Gender Recognition Act after many years of struggle involving 'numerous procedures and at great physical and emotional cost'. Now that transgender persons, in the UK at least, had full recognition in law it was 'fundamental that this recognition should be fully realised, practically and effectively'. But the DWP was retaining her gender change data on its Customer Information System (CIS) and Jobseekers’ Allowance Payment System, including her previous male name. The DWP automatically processed the records of transgender customers as 'special customer records' and applied a 'sensitive account' marker to keep details confidential, but this failed to give sufficient protection, argued Ms McCann. C’s details had become known to DWP staff who lived within her locality. At the same time the extra layers of security were leading to her receiving a poor service, including late payments of benefits. Ms McCann argued the intrusive, unnecessary and indefinite retention of C’s details by the DWP was in breach of her human rights, as well as data protection and anti-discrimination legislation. Lawyers for the DWP argue its policies are not discriminatory or intrusive but carefully balance the need to give effect to C’s legal rights while the department carries out its functions. They also argue Parliament expressly contemplated the data would be held by social security and pension systems, and there was no requirement to 'rewrite history' and delete information that recorded a person’s previously held gender.","The 44-year-old Londoner says previous gender should be wiped records .

The ex-girlfriend of Justin Lee Collins has revealed how the abusive TV presenter turned her from a 'confident, . fun-loving person' into an 'exhausted beaten-down husk of a woman'. Anna Larke has given details of the abuse she suffered at his hands in a bid to encourage other women who are suffering domestic abuse to seek help. The Friday Night Project presenter, 38, was convicted of harassment after a 10-day trial earlier this month. In an interview with Now magazine, Miss Larke, also 38, spoke candidly about her experiences with the controlling Collins. Anna Larke, 38, ex-girlfriend of TV comic Justin Lee Collins. She met him at an awards ceremony when she worked as a computer game PR . The pair met at an awards ceremony in . 2006 and instantly hit it off. They began trading flirty e-mails and . texts and the TV presenter told her his marriage was in trouble. She said . they would text all day and all night, and the first signs of his . controlling personality would manifest in these messages. Anna said Collins shut her beloved cat Jak in a suitcase and sent it spinning across the room while laughing maniacally. After that Jak was so terrified of Collins that he'd soil himself, angering the TV presenter further. He'd grab the cat and throw him in the litter tray. He would force her to reply within five minutes, no matter where she was or what she was doing, and demand intimate pictures.' Other bizarre behaviour began to emerge: He'd demand to know which men she found attractive on TV and was angry if he didn't like the answer, he forced her to cancel a holiday to Ibiza and made her change her phone number twice to make it hard for friends to stay in touch. Miss Larke said he lavished her with gifts and fancy hotels and was charming but his texts were becoming more and more aggressive. He called her a 'fat dog' and 'ugly' and claims he repeatedly pushed her on a night out with co-presenter Alan Carr, sparking a huge row. Later he flirted and danced with another woman in front of her. But still she loved him, and was . heartbroken at newspaper reports exposing him for cheating on his wife . with another girl. Their contact stopped around that time but two years later, . in late 2010, he e-mailed her suggesting they meet for a drink. She . warily agreed and he told her his marriage was in severe trouble. Anna Larke speaking about her experiences on ITV's Daybreak. At the same time as he hurt her, Justin Lee Collins would be charming and lavish her with gifts and trips away . Verdict: Justin Lee Collins leaves St Albans Crown Court on October 9 after being found guilty of harassing her . She said: 'He told me his wife had suggested he have anger management courses, which made me wonder if he'd been abusive towards her too. He kept telling me, ""You look gorgeous, I want to kiss you"". 'We didn't kiss, but I realised I was still in love with him. Sadly, things were about to turn violent.' In December they went to Miami and the physical abuse started. He painfully pinched the backs of her arms when she told him she wanted to leave a club to sleep off her jet lag. Miss Larke is urging fellow abuse victims to seek help and recognise that no one has a right to control them . Despite this they moved in together and the abuse escalated. First he made her delete her Facebook and Twitter accounts and share an e-mail account with him. He badgered her for details of all her past sexual relationships and wrote it all down. 'Sometimes he'd get it out and ask random questions to see if my answer matched what was in the book,' she said. She told the court she had to sleep facing him and he'd jab her in the back if she turned away while sleeping. In the coming months he began to slap her in intimate places, spit in her face and hit her with a magazine. She left but he begged her to reconsider and she took him back. Soon after he threw a satnav at her and pulled her hair so hard it yanked her neck. Miss Larke described this as her 'lightbulb moment' and slipped away when he was on a photoshoot. Her family arranged for her to speak to a policewoman and the legal proceedings began. His sentence was 140 hours' community service, which Miss Larke feels was not enough. Immediately after the trial Justin Lee Collins was pictured laughing. She added: 'It was like he was laughing in my face, saying, ""I got away with it"". 'If you're in a similar situation to mine, there are two things you should know: you're not alone, even if it feels like it; and it's only going to get worse. Please don't spend your life in fear. No one has a right to control you.'","Anna Larke speaks of the torment she suffered at the hands of the comic .

"By . Alex Greig . A Montreal high school student has unwittingly started a revolution by refusing to change out of a pair of shorts that high school authorities deemed too short. Lindsey Stocker, a grade 11 student at Beaconsfield High School, donned a pair of denim shorts on May 21, one of the first hot days of the season but was ordered to change by her school's vice principals. She refused, and instead printed a poster that she plastered over the school, questioning why girls' bodies were the focus of the rules instead of boys' behavior. Get shorty: Lindsey Stocker says she was humiliated in front of her class for wearing a pair of shorts on a hot day . During third period on that day, two vice principals entered her classroom and told everyone to stand up so their outfits could be inspected. 'And when they came to me after about two rows of looking they stopped and told me my shorts were too short and I had to change,' Stocker told the National Post. 'They continued to tell me would be suspended if I didn't start following the rules. When I told them I didn't understand why I had to change they told me that it doesn't matter - I don't have to understand the rules, I just have to comply by them.' Stocker felt singled out and humiliated in front of her class, but what concerned her more was a set of rules that focused on girls' bodies rather than boys' behavior. So instead of complying with the rules, she went and printed up about 20 posters and stuck them up all over the school. The posters read, 'Don't humiliate her because she's wearing shorts. It's hot outside. Instead of shaming girls for their bodies, teach boys that girls are not sexual objects.' Statement: Although Stocker's poster only remained up for about 10 minutes before teachers took it down, it had the desired effect . Support: Stocker has had strong support on social media and other girls at her high school are wearing shorts to school in solidarity . The posters were taken down by teachers after about 10 minutes, but they live on in social media. Stocker also has won the support and admiration of other girls at school. 'Most people are agreeing with her, women shouldn’t have to cover themselves up completely because we shouldn’t be viewed as sexual objects,' student Sierra Drolet told CJAD News. Lauren Paquay, 15, showed up wearing shorts in support of Stocker. She said the dress code verification - making girls stand up with their arms by their sides to ensure their outfits are fingertip length - is 'humiliating.' School rules: The school district spokesperson says there are dress rules for both girls and boys . 'People are being judged for the way they dress, they have to change because boys look at them. The boys should be the ones who have to learn to treat women better and look at them in a different light,' she told CBC. The chairperson of the Lester B Pearson School Board told CJAD News that Stocker has been suspended for not following the rules. 'The rules are there to help the children learn and prepare them for their future work places, high school is a job for them, they are there to learn to function in society, so it’s important that the rules be followed,' Susanne Stein Day says. 'Girls and boys have rules on dress codes; it is not a girl, boy thing, that’s not the point.' Stocker disagrees. 'I was in violation for showing my legs,' she says. 'And that, point blank, is a problem for me.'","Lindsey Stocker, a grade 11 student at a Montreal high school, was singled out for wearing shorts on May 21 .

The money has been used to fund controversial Scottish projects such as ‘gay propaganda’ DVDs for schools, camcorders for asylum seekers and a ‘groovy’ diversity parade. Thousands have also been spent on dressmaking lessons exclusively for Scots from ethnic minorities, and on ‘educating’ Scottish householders about renewable energy. The Big Lottery Fund – the quango that allocates lottery money – dedicated £134million last year to projects in Scotland and £501million to English ones despite England’s population being ten times larger. Critics said the disparity was just another example of the way those south of the border get far less money showered on them by public bodies than those to the north. Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said the ‘outdated’ Barnett formula – the mechanism by which the Treasury divides spending between the home nations – already meant that ‘significantly more taxpayers’ money’ goes to Scotland. ‘This Big Lottery Fund money is simply adding to the distortion,’ he said. ‘People will wonder how that distribution can possibly be fair, as most would have thought that all parts of the United Kingdom were benefiting equally.’ Wales and Northern Ireland also did far better than England in terms of Big Lottery Fund spending – with the Welsh getting £13.49 per head and the Northen Irish £31.33. The fund said the disparity between England and Scotland was an exception, but analysis of previous years shows England consistently receives less money per head than the other home nations. Spending plans also show that Scotland is due to get a larger proportion of cash than England until at least 2015. Lucky help: The Big Lottery Fund is responsible for distributing around 40 per cent of awards raised for good causes from the National Lottery . The Big Lottery Fund makes grants to projects working in health, education and the environment; and most of its money goes to charities. It is responsible for distributing around 40 per cent of awards raised for good causes from the National Lottery, and says it distributes its cash based on both population size and indices of deprivation. The organisation’s annual report reveals that this means that projects from the three smaller nations of the United Kingdom are far more likely to benefit. In Scotland, for example, £10million was set aside to address ‘hardship which has sent people to food banks and community clothing centres’, £6.5million to tackle domestic abuse and £8million to provide safe housing to victims of such abuse. In 2012/13, England received 7,600 awards totalling £501million, Scotland received 3,122 awards totalling £134million, Wales got 950 totalling £41million and Northern Ireland 833 totalling £57million. As well as having separate pots for the four nations, the annual report reveals that  there is a £44.7million fund for 323 UK-wide projects. It is not known how this is distributed. Previous reports show that the disparity in per capita spending has persisted. Annanhill Walled Garden Allotments Association: £10,000July 2013 – Organisation in East Ayrshire received money for a composting toilet. New Ethnic Media & Arts Trust: £10,000 July 2013 – Glasgow organisation that was helped to set up a radio station aimed solely at Black, Minority and Ethnic (BME) groups. Energy Advisory Service: £129,322July 2013 – Cash used to send environmental  ‘outreach workers’ to homes to provide ‘educ-ation’ about renewable energy and reducing energy consumption. Stonewall Equality Ltd: £10,000 June 2013 – Homosexual rights group given cash to flood 2,200 primary schools with a DVD ‘celebrating’ same-sex parents. Funding also went towards showing its ‘Different Families’ DVD at two cinemas. Camcorder Guerrillas: £10,000 June 2013 – Camcorders provided for asylum seekers and refugees to make ‘awareness- raising’ films. Renfrewshire Effort to Empower Minorities: £10,000 June 2013 – Funding for a ‘diversity parade’ in Renfrewshire. The ‘Notting Hill-style’ carnival featured a ‘street procession, filled with colourful and groovy dance and music’. Screen Education Edinburgh: £9,949 October 2012 – To fund film production classes at a young offenders’ institution near Falkirk. Clydebank LGBT Social Group: £9,020September 2012 – Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender group given cash to ‘provide  activities, information and talks to build [the] confidence of gay people and transvestites’ and to fund events marking its first anniversary. The Cambuslang and Rutherglen Ethnic Group: £6,790 May 2012 – To fund dressmaking and swimming lessons for ethnic minorities to boost their ‘self- esteem’. OK Skate: £9,000 January 2012 – To buy a ‘yurt’ as a base for a youth group that runs ‘eco workshops’ and encourages youngsters to forage for ‘bush tucker’. Association of English Speaking Cameroonians in Scotland: £8,114December 2010 – Group that supports Cameroonian immigrants given grant for ‘equipment and training’, and to build the ‘capacity’. The Scotland Russia Forum: £7,750 September 2008 – Group that seeks to improve understanding of Russian people given cash to buy furniture and office equipment. Greenock Prison: £10,000 July 2008 – Grant to teach prisoners, including killers and rapists, how to become DJs and set up their own recording studio. Inmates at the time included Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi. It is not known if he joined in. In 2011/12, England received £9.25 per head, compared to £14.51 in Scotland, £16.05 in Wales and £12.54 in Northern Ireland. In 2010/11, England received £3.74 per head, Scotland £4.59, Wales £11.54 and Northern Ireland £3.78. And in 2009/10, England got £4.90 per head compared to £11.67 in Scotland, £10.45 in Wales and £18.77 in Northern Ireland. A spokesman for the Big Lottery Fund said: ‘The focus of our grants is on people and communities  most in need. As a result the allocation of grant budget by each country is based on both population size and indices of deprivation. ‘Grant budgets, including a  separate UK-wide budget, are allocated over a six-year period and vary greatly from year to year depending on programmes open  for applications. No single year should be considered in isolation  as this will not provide a true comparison. ‘For example, the Scotland  allocation this year includes a one-off, £49million award to the Life Changes Trust.’","The Big Lottery Fund dedicated £134m to projects in Scotland .

"By . Daniel Miller . A performing Killer Whale suffered a horrific injury which left its jawbone exposed at a SeaWorld theme park, prompting fury from animal rights groups. Pictures showing Nakai, an 11-year-old whale who performs at the San Diego SeaWorld park, with a large gash to its chin were leaked online by a unnamed whistleblower. In a statement, SeaWorld said Nakai's injury was caused when it 'came into contact with a portion of the pool environment'. Jawbone: Pictures released by a SeaWorld whistleblower show the horrific injuries suffered by killer whale Nikai which insiders claim were result of a fight between three whales . Animal welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has submitted a complaint to the US Department of Agriculture accusing the park of housing incompatible killer whales together . However online reports suggest the . incident happened on September 20 when Nakai got into a fight with two . other Killer Whales Ike and Keet. They believe Nakai was either bitten by one of the other whales or smashed into the concrete pool wall. Journalist . Tim Zimmermann reported: 'It happened last week during a night show, . seemingly during a major altercation involving Nakai, Keet, and Ike. 'It’s not clear if there was an aggressor or instigator, or if they all suddenly went after each other. 'In . response to the altercation, Nakai split to the back pool. The onstage . trainers, not realizing how badly injured he was, continued the show . with the other whales. 'It was only when they called Nakai over later that night that they realised he was seriously hurt.' Animal . welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has . submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They have accused SeaWorld of housing Killer Whales together incompatibly -  a direct violation of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). Injury: Killer whale Nikai is kept at SeaWorld San Diego. A spokesman for the park said he was injured after hitting the side of the tank . Injury: Nikai is seen leaping clear of the water during a performance at San Diego SeaWorld . A . spokesman for the group said: 'The AWA makes it clear that marine . mammals that are not compatible must not be housed in the same . enclosure. 'Yet SeaWorld . parks have a long history of housing incompatible orcas from widely . divergent groups together in enclosures - and the result has been . stress, agitation, aggressive and bloody raking, serious injury, and . death.' In a . statement, a spokesman for the park said: 'There is no organisation in . the world more committed to the physical, social and mental welfare  of . its animals than SeaWorld.' Should killer whales be banned from SeaWorld following claims of poor treatment at the park? They said Nikai is being treated with antibiotics and had been 'swimming comfortably and interacting with other killer whales'. In February 2010 trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed by six-ton killer whale Tilikum, who is Nikai's father, at SeaWorld's Orlando park. The six ton whale dragged the 40-year-old into the pool by her pony tail and then thrashed her while she was in the water, as horrified spectators looked on. Killed: Nikai's father Tilikum is seen with trainer Dawn Brancheau.

Banned: No trainer is allowed in the water with Tilikum because of his size and dangerous history . It was the third death Tilikum had been involved in. In 1991 trainer Keltie Byrne died after slipping and falling into the tank with Tilikum and two other whales. In 1999, a man sneaked past security at SeaWorld Orlando and was later found dead, his body draped over Tilikum. Earlier this year Peta diled a lawsuit against San Diego SeaWorld claiming that the five killer whales at the are treated like slaves because they're forced to live in tanks and perform daily. The five whales were named as the plaintiffs in the case. However a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit saying the 13th amendment - which outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude - applies only to humans.","Nakai, an 11-year-old performing whale suffered gash to the chin which left its jawbone exposed .

"By . Nick Craven . When widow Lynda Hill drew up her will, she left £100,000 to her favourite animal charity and expressed a hope that its staff would find a new home for her faithful dog, Henry. But just hours after Mrs Hill’s body was discovered in her home, a vet from the charity recommended that the golden retriever be put down, and he was destroyed the following day. Friends of Mrs Hill say she would have been ‘devastated’ by the actions. Devoted: Lynda Hill, seen posing with one of her previous golden retrievers in her younger days, would have been 'devastated' by the shelter's actions, friend say . Police broke into Mrs Hill’s home in . Peterborough after being contacted by worried neighbours who had not . seen the 85-year-old walking Henry for several days. Inside, they found . the loyal retriever lying beside his owner’s body. The police also discovered Mrs Hill’s will, which left nearly all her estate to the Wood Green  Animal Shelter in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire. She also left Henry to the charity, adding: ‘I express the hope that they will look after him.’ After giving Henry food and water, a police officer played with the dog in the garden while waiting for staff from Wood Green to collect him. But after examining Henry, a Wood Green vet said the dog – which had been without food, water and medication to treat his mild arthritis for up to five days – should be put down. The vet described Henry as bloated, distressed and in pain. Mrs Hill’s friends say that was not surprising, given the circumstances in which eight-year-old Henry was found last February, and claim he was not given a ‘proper chance’. Neighbour Janet Anker, 74, said: ‘Lynda was devoted to her dog. She took him regularly to the vet, and only the month before she died she told me Henry’s anti-inflammatory drug for his arthritis had been reduced, which was a good sign. That particular visit involved a four-mile round-trip for Henry and he looked fine. 'Loyal': Henry, a golden retriever, was 'bloated, distressed and in pain', a vet said (FILE PHOTO) ‘We were terribly upset when we heard that he’d been put  down the day after he arrived at Wood Green. Lynda would have been devastated.’ Mrs Anker’s daughter Claire Mee, 45, added: ‘I phoned the shelter a few days later to ask how Henry was getting on, only to discover they’d put him to sleep. I couldn’t believe it was done so quickly. ‘No one wanted Henry to be in pain, but they didn’t know the  circumstances. A couple of phone calls would have ascertained that. No dog is going to look healthy found in the situation Henry was. ‘I don’t think Wood Green should accept the bequest and should instead distribute it to other local animal charities. ‘The last time Henry was seen by his vet, there was mild arthritis and hip problems, but nothing life-threatening at all. ‘People who saw Henry with Lynda all confirm his mobility.’ A Wood Green spokesman said Henry was brought in because Mrs Hill had signed up to its Pet Promise Scheme, in which staff  try to rehome a pet should the owner no longer be able to care for it. The spokesman added that the charity was unaware of any bequest at the time. Sharon Evans, Wood Green’s director of fundraising, added: ‘The decision to put Henry to sleep was taken by a very experienced vet, in whom we have absolute faith. It was clear from the dog’s condition that his physical wellbeing and his quality of life were severely compromised. ‘We had Henry’s notes from his vet and were aware of his previous condition. Nevertheless, he had deteriorated to such an extent our vets considered the responsible decision was to alleviate his suffering and end his life peacefully and with dignity.’ A legal expert said Mrs Hill’s will placed no legal burden on Wood Green because she was only ‘expressing a hope’ the dog would be looked after.","Lynda Hill made the bequest to the Wood Green Animal Shelter in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, in her will .

"By . Tom Worden . A neighbour heard model Cheryl Maddison screaming as she was stabbed and raped in her Majorca flat but failed to call police. Young mother Laura Pamela told a court she heard Cheryl's 'anguished' cries but was convinced it was 'just another fight' involving a British couple. Miss Maddison, 25, was knifed repeatedly in the neck, throat and back after being attacked as she returned home from work in a bar in Magaluf. Injuries: Cheryl Maddison, 25, was left for dead by her attacker in Magaluf. Neighbour Laura Pamela said she heard the cries but assumed they were from an arguing couple . Brave: Miss Maddison came face-to-face with her attacker Mohamed Fadel El Anssari as he admitted the crime in court in the Majorcan capital Palma . Moroccan waiter Mohamed Fadel el . Anssari, 31, is alleged to have raped her and stabbed her with a . seven-inch kitchen knife before leaving her for dead in May 2008. Miss Pamela told the court that she was woken up at about 4am and could hear 'fighting and shouting in English'. She added: 'I heard a woman screaming. It sounded like a couple having a fight. I might have heard a glass smash. 'My husband said 'It sounds as if something really bad is happening'. Miss Pamela said that the female . voice she could hear 'sounded anguished' but after contemplating calling . the police she decided 'it was just another fight'. 'The flat is always rented by British holidaymakers and they always have lots of parties, get drunk and have fights,' she said. Confessed: In stark contrast to Miss Maddison's confident arrival, Mohamed Fadel El Anssari, a 31 year-old waiter from Morocco, sat in the dock with his head buried in his hands throughout . Taken away: El Anssari covers his face as he leaves the court in Palma . Miss Maddison, who had moved to the island just six days earlier aged 21, pretended to be dead until her attacker fled. She then managed to crawl out into the street before collapsing in a pool of blood. The victim, from Houghton Le Spring, . County Durham, sat in the public gallery to watch the second day of the . trial with her boyfriend Kaine MacDonald, 21. She sat just yards behind her alleged attacker, who was handcuffed in court guarded by two uniformed police officers. Miss Maddison, who has waived her right . to anonymity, spent two years having therapy and suffered regular panic . attacks following the horrific ordeal. She gave evidence for 70 minutes from behind a screen on Tuesday. Cheryl Maddison leaves the court in Palma hand in hand with boyfriend Kain MacDonald after giving evidence . Bandaged wound: Cheryl Maddison, pictured aged 21 in 2008, said she only realised he had stabbed her in the chest when she came round and stood up to find she had been lying in a large pool of blood . Forensic doctor Julio Lopez, who examined her during her two-week stay in hospital, told the Provincial Court in Palmacourt she was lucky to survive the attack. He said: 'Her wounds could have been fatal if she had not received urgent medical attention.' Police found the attacker's bloodstained top dumped in a rubbish bin near Cheryl's flat. They launched a huge manhunt but shelved the investigation the following summer after failing to make a breakthrough. Investigations were reopened when a second British woman suffered a similar attack in Magaluf in 2010. Fadel, a cocaine addict, was arrested in July 2011 following a lengthy undercover police operation. DNA found on a cigarette he threw away in the street matched that found on the bedsheets at Cheryl's apartment. It also matched traces of genetic material found on the bloodied shirt discarded near the scene of the crime, the court heard. Hiding: El Anssari avoids showing his face to photographers outside court . Holiday isle: Magaluf is the number one destination for British package tour holidaymakers . Tests proved beyond any doubt the DNA . on the shirt and bedsheets belonged to Fadel, a Civil Guard detective . told the panel of three judges. Fadel's former boss, Jason Brown, . told the court the Moroccan had suddenly asked for some time off to . travel to Tenerife around the time of the attack. Mr Brown, who employed Fadel as a . waiter at Tom Brown's bar in Magaluf, said: 'We couldn't believe it when . he was arrested. He was known as just a normal person, a worker.' The court heard Fadel had been . diagnosed as suffering from psychotic and manic episodes by a Moroccan . doctor two months before the attack and was prescribed mood-stabilising . drugs. But Spanish doctors who examined him in jail after his arrest said he did not show signs of suffering from mental illness. Dr Julio Lopez told the court: 'He did not require any treatment in prison. There were no signs of a disorder.' Prosectors want Fadel jailed for 23 . year - 12 for attempted murder and 11 for rape. The court has heard he . confessed to police after his arrest, telling detectives: 'I am an evil . man'. He refused to answer questions about the attack in court and his defence lawyer is calling for his acquittal. The trial is expected to end on Thursday and the judges will return their verdict in a written ruling at a later date.

A victim of the tragic Long Island pharmacy massacre who was due to get married in only four months will be buried in her wedding dress. The mother of brutally slaughtered bride-to-be Jaime Taccetta, 33, was keeping the white gown at her house until the wedding in October and has vowed that her daughter’s murderer will be found. Pat Taccetta, 52, sobbed as she declared ‘justice will be done’ following the horrific cold-blood killing of her ‘happy’ daughter and three others in Medford on Long Island, New York, on Sunday morning. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Jaime Taccetta, left, was shot in the head and discovered by her fiancé James Manzella after he dropped her off at the pharmacy in Medford on Long Island, New York . Her emotional comments came as police . said they are still searching for the suspect caught on CCTV tape and . consider him an ‘armed and dangerous’ drug user. ‘He was so senseless,’ Mrs Taccetta . told the New York Daily News. ‘He could have stolen the drugs and left . everybody alone. There was no reason to shoot them. He took away four . lives. Motherless: Little Kaitlyn, 5, is now without her mother after she was gunned down on Sunday . 'We’re going to get you. Justice will be done.' Mrs Taccetta’s daughter will be . buried this Saturday at Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Coram. Her family broke news of the death to her when she arrived home from a . holiday in Jamaica. Meanwhile, Miss Taccetta's fiancé has spoken of how he discovered his . girlfriend's corpse. James Manzella went to check on 'the love of his life' Miss Taccetta, after dropping her off at Haven Drugs in Long Island. Incredibly, . Mr Manzella only went to check on Jamie after seeing the bearded killer . leave the pharmacy and calmly walk away from the scene. Speaking to the New York Post, Mr . Manzella said: 'I saw the guy walk out, and I thought something was weird. 'So I turned the car off to check on her [Jamie]. I walked to the front.' He then stumbled upon the horrific scenes inside the store, finding Jamie as well as a second victim Bryon Sheffield, 71, dead. 'Can you imagine sitting there in air conditioning, . listening to music, and then the next minute she's gone,' he said. 'It was horrible, man. It was something I'll never forget. I'll never forget what I saw. It's stuck in me.' Mr Manzella, an electrician, planned to marry physical therapist Miss Taccetta in October. She had two daughters - Miranda, 16, and Kaitlyn, 5. A distraught Mr Manzella said he was haunted by the fact he saw the killer moments after the shooting took place. Junkie: These images, taken from the security camera at the Haven Pharmacy, appear to show the gunman perusing the shelves for drugs . He added: 'I could see the guy clearly, and now I think back if I could have done something. 'That's what messes with you. We were two average people trying to do the right thing, and this is what happens. It's not fair.' It has also emerged that the ruthless . gunman was . hunting for prescription painkillers. In what is thought be the latest in a string of drug fuelled robberies, the killer stormed the family-owned Haven Drugs pharmacy looking for the painkillers, according to police. A massive manhunt for the killer is continuing after Suffolk County homicide . detectives found the bodies at about . 60 miles east of New York City. Shot dead: Jennifer Mejia, who worked at the pharmacy in Medford, Long Island . Shock: The owner of a Pharmacy in Medford, NY collapses when he arrives at the store, following a shooting that killed four people. A pharmacist, a teenage worker, and two customers were killed when the gunman opened fire inside the store at roughly 10am. CCTV footage shows the gunman shooting at close range, before filling his backpack with prescription painkillers. The killing comes as DEA agents have been calling on Long Island pharmacists to boost security after recording a 125 per cent increase in pharmacy hold-ups in 2009 and 2010. Addicts and dealers are so desperate to get their hands on the painkillers they often leave money behind during the raids as they hunt for more drugs. A teenage girl, just days from graduating high school, has been identified as 17-year-old Jennifer Mejia, a senior at Bellport High School in . Brookhaven. Her father, Rene Mejia - an immigrant from El Salvador - described her as a 'wonderful daughter'. She had worked . at the pharmacy for about two years and wished him a happy Father's Day . early Sunday morning as she left for work. Speaking to the New York Post Rene said: 'This morning she told me, 'Happy Father's Day.' 'She was in a hurry to go to work. 'I held her and said, 'It's okay,' because in my country, Father's Day is Friday. I feel better because I held her.' Other victims were reported to be Raymond Ferguson, 45 - who also worked at the store - . as well as customers Bryon Sheffield, 71, a grandfather. Rene, . speaking outside their home, said his daughter was looking forward to . her prom on Wednesday. 'Now I just see the dress inside,' he said. 'You have to remember all of the good things.' His other daughter Leslie, was also supposed to work at the store that day. 'They were supposed to work today, her and my younger daughter. Leslie didn't go to work today,' he said. The 30-year-old drugstore had been robbed before, according to Mr Mejia. He added that despite this, his daughter was not afraid. Speaking to the Post, he added: 'She said people would come in and demand prescription medicine sometimes. People wanted the strong stuff. 'This was a heavy-duty pharmacy, not like Duane Reade.' Innocent beauty: Jennifer Mejia was among the four slaughtered in the suspected robbery on Sunday . Hunted: Surveillance video of the man that police suspect of shooting and killing four people at a pharmacy . Emotional: This picture, taken from her Facebook tribute page, shows a happy Miss Mejia (Centre) with friends . Kimberly Jimenez, 18, a friend and classmate, said Miss Mejia's 'ambition was to help people.' 'She was never a troubled person. For this to happen, it's so random. Crazy - crazy.' Shaken . residents converged on the crime scene and described the pharmacy as a . mom-and-pop shop where employees knew people by name. 'They know you, they know who you are,' said Nicole Kaiser, 27. 'This isn't that type of town. I can't believe it.' A special Facebook page set up to remember the slain high school student was flooded with tributes. Jalissa Ware posted: 'R.I.P Jenn ♥ we love youu and miss youu. I swear it feels like yesterdayy you were yellin my name in class, or we wud both compare our failing grades in math :/' Another, Marz Idgaf, wrote: 'My little cousin is now in a better place and thats what keeps me going i love you so much jenn all we have is memories and i deff. had some good ones with you.'

A 911 . emergency call was placed from the store's parking lot and when police arrived they found bodies inside. The drug store's owner Vinoda Kudchadkar arrived after the shooting but fainted when he discovered the scene of carnage inside . He was taken to the hospital. Speaking to the Post, neighbour Dr. Edgar Barrero said: 'He's had heart problems before. He must be devastated.' Popular: Miss Mejia poses with another friend . Hunt: Police are looking for the gunman, who is still at large . Gunned down: Police received a 911 call from the parking lot behind the pharmacy . Police said they were looking for a lone shooter wearing a baseball cap and backpack who was seen leaving the scene. Suffolk County Chief of Detectives Dominick Varrone said: 'This is a vicious, horrible crime. We are dedicating a great number of resources. Right now, our primary interest is apprehending the individual or individuals involved.' Investigators took a laptop from the drugstore and are searching for surveillance footage that may have captured the suspect.

"By . Martin Robinson . One million more soldiers may have died in the First World War than first believed while survivors left with crippling shell-shock were also severely underestimated, leading academics said today. Antoine Prost, Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Paris, says that in the chaos after the Great War governments, including Britain's, produced conservative death figures. Professor Prost also says errors in casualty lists and the vast number of missing soldiers means ten million probably perished in trench warfare between 1914 and 1918, not nine million as first thought. War dead: New research has revealed that up to one million more soldiers died in the First World War than first thought . His claims are made in a three essays called The Complete Cambridge History of the First World War. 'The calculation of losses isn't easy and . most studies present lists of figures without explaining what they . cover or how they have been established,' he told The Times. 'So there is . confusion concerning places whose borders had shifted; there is . inconsistency in recording the deaths of soldiers from sickness and . prisoners of war who died in captivity; and there is uncertainty . surrounding the number of soldiers reported missing it seems that in . several cases, including Britain, the generally accepted calculations . are underestimates.' Confusion: Academics have said that discrepancies about how many men died in captivity or went missing means the death figures between 1914 and 1918 are skewed . The book's editor, Jay Winter from Yale University, also says that the scale of shell-shock was also massively below the real figure. He says one in five injured British soldiers suffered with mental health problems, much higher than recorded. 'Medical and administrative practices and prejudice led to radical underestimates of shell shock,' he said. 'Studies show stress in the Great War was probably more intense than in later conflicts and yet physicians were reluctant to diagnose many injuries as psychological. 'To do so probably would have made it less likely (he) would receive a pension.' Professor Winter's research found that in the Second World War the stress of conflict was far more recognised, with many more diagnosed with psychological injuries between 1939 and 1945. Other academics have reacted to the essays, and said that while many governments were conservative in their death figures, Russia had increased numbers in a propaganda war with Tsarists. Others said that the conclusions on shell shock were 'almost certainly correct'. Allied troops, like these French grenadiers, lived, fought and died in huge trench systems dug during WWI . The First World War changed warfare forever. After the Battle of the Marne in September, 1914, the German army was forced to retreat to the River Aisne. The commander decided that his troops must at all costs hold onto those parts of France and Belgium that they still occupied. The men were ordered to dig trenches that would provide them with protection from the advancing French and British troops. The Allies soon realised that they could not break through this line and they also began to dig. After . a few months these trenches had spread from the North Sea to the Swiss . Frontier. As the Germans were the first to build, they had been able to . choose the best places. The . possession of the higher ground not only gave the Germans a tactical . advantage, but it forced the British and French to live in the worst . conditions. Most . of this area was rarely a few feet above sea level. As soon as soldiers . began to dig down they would invariably find water two or three feet . below the surface. Water-logged . trenches were a constant problem for soldiers on the Western Front . leading to the spread of lice and so-called 'trench foot', where . constantly soaking boots lead to soldiers feet literally rotting off the . bone. It would take . the loss of millions of lives and the invention of the tank by the . British army before the formidable system was finally broken four years . after it was built.","New history of Great War also reveals shell shock severely underestimated .

"By . Associated Press . A Southern California man pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of lying on a passport application so he could allegedly travel to Syria to hook up with a terrorist group. Adam Dandach, 20, of Orange, entered the plea in federal court in Santa Ana on two charges, each carrying a maximum five-year prison sentence, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office.

"By . Joshua Gardner . Shocking tornado footage shows how a Nebraska home was lifted completely off its foundations, spun in the air and then placed right back where it came from. Only the Pilger home was facing the wrong direction as a terrified father and his two young children survived the ordeal just inches below in the basement. It may be the most bizarre and fascinating tale to emerge from the horrific afternoon on June 16 when twin twisters all but destroyed the prairie town of 350 people and took the lives of two. Scroll down for video . Nature's fury: Many experts believe this shocking footage shows a home being picked up and spun in the air be one of the twin twisters that ravaged the town of Pilger, Nebraska on June 16 . Unbelievable: The home landed back on its original foundations, but it was turned 180 degrees. A father and his two young children managed to survive in its basement . Relief: Corey Savage (pictured kissing his wife Julia) thought all was lost in the moments after the twister blew through his home. The father was with his 4-year-old daughter and toddler son at the time . Experts agree, the structure seen being sucked into the sky in footage taken by storm chaser Dick McGowan and first published on TVNWeather.com could well be a home. 'There’s so many surprising things that have been documented in tornadoes,' Accuweather meteorologist Jack Boston told Omaha.com. 'Driving straw into a wall, sucking all the water out of a swimming pool. So who can say?' The occupants of the Pilger home may be able to attest that the house was indeed turned 180 degrees during the twister, but they were busy taking cover in the basement and praying for their lives to say for sure how it got that way. Corey Savage thought all was lost in the moments after the twister blew through his home. The father was with his 4-year-old daughter and toddler son when he ran for safety with just a blanket to protect them. But the powerful storm sucked away the blanket and when it passed, Savage didn't know if his kids had survived. He found . his son nearby with a concrete block in his lap. Savage lifted the the . debris away and the boy was miraculously uninjured. He dug his daughter's limp form out from beneath a water heater and door that weren't even from his home. Not a total loss: The home was a total loss, as was about 80 percent of the town of 350, but all the young Savage family managed to survive . Overcome: Juliana Savage was overcome with emotion as she discussed her family's brush with death . Miraculous: Pictures of the Pilger home before it was bulldozed show just how close to death the Savages came. Note the precarious positioning of the home atop the basement where Corey Savage and children hid . Corey Savage (left) said he and his wife Julia (right) have been too busy picking up the pieces to watch the startling video of their home being lifted . 'Then she stood up,' 25-year-old Savage told Omaha.com. 'She cried, and I cried. I was so happy. I thought she was going to be paralyzed.' They fled the basement as sewage and gas poured in. 'The entire house collapsed down on top of them,' Juliana Savage, who was not with her husband and children during the storm, told Samaritan's Purse. 'I don't know how they made it out alive.' While the Savages' world has been turned upside down, their house appears to only have been turned 180 degrees, though it has--along with about 80 percent of the town of Pilger--now been totally raised. Dual destruction: Twisters approach Pilger on June 16, 2014.  The National Weather Service said at least two twisters touched down within roughly a mile of each other in northeaster Nebraska before barreling toward the town of 350 . Corey Savage told Omaha.com he's been too busy picking up the pieces to watch the startling video that many say depicts the very moment his home became a UFO. Photographer Krista Giese, who took pictures of the Savages' home following the tornado, neatly sums up what will likely forever remain a mystery in Pilger. 'It’s one of those things I don’t think we’ll ever know the answer to, no matter how much video we watch,' she said. 'It’s an amazing possibility.'

"By . Sean Poulter . British families are paying hundreds of pounds more for the latest technology as global electronics giants see the UK as a ‘Treasure Island’. The biggest difference was found a top of the range Samsung TV, which was £755 more expensive including sales tax here versus the US, according to research by Which? Its research comparing prices in this country to the US found the huge mark-ups stretch to big brand tablets, laptops and even software and music streaming services. The biggest difference was a top of the range Samsung TV, which was £755 more expensive . For example, an Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch laptop was £355 more expensive here, while the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 games consoles were £95 more. Successive governments have complained how global firms, from fashion and beauty brands to car manufacturers, consistently charge British consumers more on the basis they can get away with it. The Business Secretary, Vince Cable, campaigned on the issue when the Lib-Dems were in Opposition, but he has done nothing to overcome the rip-offs since joining the Government. An Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch laptop was £355 more expensive here while the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 games consoles were £95 more . The Which? survey found Amazon is also taking advantage of UK consumers with the price of its Kindle Fire HDX 8.9in 16GB tablet and eReader some £88 more expensive than the US. The Google Nexus 7 tablet works out at £54 more. The Garmin 2497LMT satnav is £66 more expensive here and the Beats Wireless headphones are £72 more at £250, including tax. Consumers in Britain are effectively blocked from buying these goods more cheaply over the web and getting them posted to the UK because of various hurdles erected by the Government and the firms. Postal costs can be high, while there are also import duties on electronics products bought through websites based in the USA, which will reduce the value of any saving. The current threshold before import duty is imposed on goods bought online is £135, which is much lower than £390 figure if the same consumer buys the goods themselves while abroad. The Which? survey found Amazon is also taking advantage of UK consumers . Global companies will make product specifications slightly different in the USA versus the UK, which creates doubt and confusion as to whether a product will connect to the web or mobile network here. They will also sometimes refuse to honour warranties on items bought overseas. Which? also found enormous mark-ups on software and digital services offered by global brands. For example, the Adobe Creative Cloud imaging software is £208 more for a 12 month subscription at £563 in this country. A 12 month subscription to Amazon Prime, which covers delivery and online streaming of films, music and TV programmes, works out at £80 in the UK, which is £21 more. When in opposition, the Lib-Dem Business Secretary, Vince Cable, lambasted the last government for failing to put an end to rip-off Britain . Similarly, the music streaming service Spotify charges British customers £120 a year, which compares to £71 in California. Microsoft and Norton also punish consumers here with higher bills. Part of the price difference can be explained by the fact the UK has a very high VAT rate of 20per cent. By comparison, the figure in California is 8.41per cent on physical goods and zero on digital services or products. Even when tax is excluded from the equation the Samsung UE65H8000 TV, which is a Smart 65inch TV with internet access and a curved LED screen, was £402 more expensive to British families when the survey was conducted. Which? wants manufacturers to play fair and explain why tech products in the UK are more expensive in comparison to the US. It is also calling on the Government to raise the current threshold for import duty on goods bought online to the same threshold as that placed on goods brought back from abroad, so shoppers can take advantage of cheaper goods on sale in the US. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘UK consumers are getting a raw deal by paying up to hundreds of pounds more for the same tech products on sale in the US. Manufacturers should play fair and explain why consumers are paying more for buying in the UK.’ Companies like Amazon claim the higher prices in this country are the results of the higher costs of doing business here, in terms of staff and business taxes and rates. However, the US company has come under fire for the fact that it has gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying its fair share of taxes, despite sales of more than £4.5billion a year in Britain. The firm has also faced protests over its failure to pay a living wage to employees here. The firm has defended its higher prices, saying ‘Operating costs differ by country, but as with all products on Amazon, we work hard to offer customers the lowest possible prices. ‘There are different, and higher, taxes in Europe, as well as higher transport and other operating costs but we are always working to try and lower them.’ When in opposition, the Lib-Dem Business Secretary, Vince Cable, lambasted the last government for failing to put an end to rip-off Britain. He pointed out: ‘The value of the web is that we can now find out what is going on. It is easier than in the past to know that we are being ripped off. ‘The only rational explanation for price differentials is discrimination.’ He said the last government and Office of Fair Trading had not been active enough in protecting consumers. He has since scrapped the OFT, removing a key protection for consumers against unfair prices.","The biggest difference was found a top of the range Samsung TV .

"By . Ulla Kloster . Mother-of-two Denise Salter (pictured) robbed family and friends. Her offending came to light when a life long friend discovered her investment account had been closed and all the money withdrawn . A building society manager has been jailed for four years after robbing her own husband and family’s accounts of more than £300,000 to pay off debts. Mother-of-two Denise Salter worked her way up from part-time clerk to become manager of the Sheffield branch of the Yorkshire Building Society. She used her financial know-how to withdraw funds over 17 years and when arrested by police frankly confessed: 'I’m a thief and a liar.' Her family’s cottage home has been put up for sale and her husband Charles, himself a victim, is now faced with paying off a mortgage he didn’t know he had. Sheffield Crown Court heard 57-year-old Salter had stolen the money to pay off debts run up by her two sons and cover household expenditure and bills. She admitted six offences of theft, two of fraud, one each of false accounting and making a false instrument and asked for three further theft matters to be considered from December, 1995 to July, 2012. Laura Marshall, prosecuting, said her offending came to light when lifelong friend Joan Shepherd discovered her investment account had been closed and all the money withdrawn. Each staff member has a unique access number and it was traced to Salter. Other accounts were checked higher up and further anomalies were found. 'Each of the accounts affected related to close family or friends of the defendant,' said Miss Marshall. 'The prosecution say there was a deliberate targeting of these accounts. She felt she was able to control the accounts because of the relationship she had with the complainants.' In total Salter stole £325,411 and the overall losses to the building society were £366,682. The society has compensated all of the victims but is now taking civil action to claim Salter’s pension to recoup its losses. Salter initially stole £8,000 in 1993 from a joint account between her husband, a maintenance fitter, and their elder son David who is now in his thirties. She took £55,000 in 1996 from the estate of dementia sufferer Gwendoline Chappell who was in her 80s and died a year later. Her daughter Lynn said two of her three sons had received little out of the £20,000 they each expected to receive in savings bonds. Salter raided a joint account between her husband and their younger son Michael for £6,800 in 1998. Over a seven-year period from 2001 she robbed Stephen and Lisa Moxon of £43,740. Salter is the godmother of their daughter Chloe. The Moxons thought their investment by 2008 should have been worth about £73,000 but Salter had withdrawn the cash. Salter also stole £35,625 the Moxons took out in a savings bond in 2006. Salter then falsified a mortgage application in the sum of £58,000 for her husband in 2003 by forging his signature. 'He left all financial matters to his wife and believed his mortgage had been paid off in full,' said Miss Marshall. Sentensing Denise Salter to four years at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured, Judge Paul Watson said: 'You will not be able to look members of your family in the eye again' It has left Charles Salter with a £150,000 mortgage still to pay off on the family home at Pilley, near Barnsley. Salter fraudulently made a mortgage application for her parents-in-law Tom and Margaret Salter for £12,500 in 2007. The next year she stole £2,000 from her husband’s ISA savings account and later made another false mortgage application for £4,500 in her parents-in-laws’ name. Salter took a further £35,000 from the account of Linda Hall, daughter of Joan Shepherd, and £30,000 from Mrs Shepherd by setting up a false account in her name. A further £2,200 was stolen from the Moxon family’s account in 2012. They had given Salter a host of £1 coins to deposit but the money was never put in. The court heard that Michael Salter had been given about £50,000 by his mother and Daniel about £60,000 when they ran into financial trouble. When arrested, Salter told police she had been helping her sons with their cash problems. 'She spoke of taking her own life to allow the victims to be repaid from insurance,' said Miss Marshall. Rick Holland, for Salter, said she recognised the 'enormous hurt' she had been responsible for and the victims were disappointed and upset at her thieving. 'Her family and friends sit in the public gallery and they have lost a considerable amount of money,' he said. 'She has caused a great deal of distress to those who trusted her. It is hard for her to accept she has caused so much misery in her family.' He said she was doing her best to help her sons and they too along with her husband had become victims. Judge Paul Watson said Salter betrayed the trust of her family and friends. He was satisfied the remorse she felt was genuine although it could not repair the trust they had put in her. 'You will not be able to look members of your family in the eye again,' he said. Afterwards Det Sgt Karl Saxton who led the police inquiry said: 'She just accumulated lots of debts including credit card debts and the money was used to pay off those debts. The family didn’t live an extravagant lifestyle. 'She used part of the money to help her sons and pay off their debts but it is still a mystery where the rest of the money went. There were home improvements and a caravan but she took out loans to pay for that. 'She just didn’t have enough legitimate income to pay off the debts that were accumulated and needed the extra money to maintain her lifestyle. There are a lot of people who have been betrayed. 'The victims feel she has taken advantage of them. Some were too upset to come to court. Her husband is devastated. He’s a victim like everyone else and has been saddled with a substantial debt.'","She worked her way up to become manager of the Sheffield branch of the Yorkshire Building Society .
