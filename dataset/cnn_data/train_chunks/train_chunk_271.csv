"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Most of a 1,300-year-old Tibetan town popular with tourists was destroyed by a fire over the weekend, renewing concerns over commercial development at Chinese heritage sites. The blaze, which raged for 10 hours on Saturday, destroyed at least 240 houses or two thirds of the ancient settlement of Dukezong in Yunnan province, southwest China, according to Xinhua state news agency. The town was known for its well-preserved Tibetan dwellings and the fire spread easily from one wooden house to the other after starting in a small hotel. Some 2,600 residents were evacuated from the scene, but no casualties were reported, Xinhua added. The possibility of arson has been ruled out, and the cause of fire is still under investigation, local authorities said. More than 1,000 firefighters and volunteers battled the flames, officials said, but the narrow streets made it difficult for fire trucks to maneuver. Fire fighters also found that hydrants were empty due to a shutdown in water supply during sub-zero winter conditions, according to Chen Tianchang, head of the fire service for the Deqen Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the region where the town is located. The town forms part of a county now called Shangri-La, which with its dramatic scenery claims to have inspired the fictional paradise described in the 1933 novel by British author James Hilton. The fire also renewed concerns over commercial development in China's ancient towns, which have witnessed growing numbers of tourists in recent years. There have been a string of fires at heritage sites in recent months, Xinhua reported. In October, a blaze tore down an ancient building complex in Hongjiang, central China and a covered bridge in the Western city of Chongqing was destroyed by fire in November. Another fire also raged in the old town of Lijiang, Yunnan in March. Li Gang, director of the region's cultural relics protection department, told Xinhua that the traditional gaps between the wood buildings in Dukezong to prevent fires had been filled in by restaurants, shops and guesthouses as ""tourism booms."" ""We have to reconsider the traditional principle of architecture while enhancing fire extinguishing facilities,"" Li said.","Ancient town popular with tourists ravaged by fire .

"(CNN) -- Germany's Martin Kaymer ripped through his final nine holes in a record breaking 29 shots to take the first round lead with a course record tying 63 in the Players Championship at Sawgrass Thursday. Kaymer, who started on the 10th, was two-under-par through the turn but then carded an incredible seven birdies on the front nine. He finished with four in a row, including a tap-in birdie four on the ninth to become the first man to shoot lower than 30 on either the front of back nine of the famous course in Florida. The 29-year-old Kaymer, who took the PGA Championship in 2010 and went to world number one the following year, has not won since November 2011 and struggled for form in 2013, his first full year of campaigning on the PGA Tour. But he will hold a two-shot lead over Honda Classic winner Russell Henley heading into the second round, with Sang Moon-Bae of Korea on 66 and a clutch on big names on five-under 67. They include last year's runner-up in the 'fifth major' -- Spain's Sergio Garcia -- and 20-year-old Masters hero Jordan Spieth, who pushed Bubba Watson all the way at Augusta. ""I felt comfortable all day,"" Spieth said. ""Felt comfortable from really the first hole."" Justin Rose, the reigning U.S. Open champion was also on that mark along with fellow Englishman Lee Westwood, who was in the first group out. Watson, Australian Adam Scott, Matt Kuchar and Swede Henrik Stenson, who can all claim the world number one spot from the absent reigning Players champion Tiger Woods, were not challenging the first day leader on a day of low-scoring. There was also frustration for Phil Mickelson, who carded a three-over 75 and is in danger of missing the cut. ""It's soft, there's just a lot of birdies out there,"" Mickelson said. ""Yeah, it's a little disappointing and frustrating."" Kaymer took full advantage to become the fourth player in the tournament's history to shoot a 63, the others Greg Norman, Fred Couples and Roberto Castro. ""I didn't make many mistakes,"" Kaymer said. ""Today was a very special round,"" he told the official PGA Tour website. If he can turn his fine start into a victory, he will become only the fourth European winner in 41 attempts at the prestigious event. Woods is missing his defense as he recovers from back surgery with no time frame given for his return.","Martin Kaymer leads TPC at Sawgrass .

"Editor's note: Megan Wood is the first writer-in-residence to participate in the Road Warrior program, a partnership between MatadorU and the Belize Tourism Board. Megan is spending the spring in Belize, documenting traditions of the country's diverse cultural groups. Each week, she reports on her experiences for Matador, her personal blog, and for other outlets. (Matador) -- I'm walking the trails of Cockscomb National Park, dense rainforest to the right, a river with crocodiles to the left. My guide, Sam, tells me the trail we're on is often used by jaguars as an easy path through the forest. He points to a paw print in the mud to confirm the presence of the big cats. ""Don't worry,"" he says, ""it's very unlikely you'll be killed by a jaguar today."" ""Sure,"" I reply, ""just a little mauling."" Belize's Cockscomb is the only jaguar preserve in the world, 150 square miles of protected rainforest that shelters 200 of the endangered animals. Other species benefit from the preserve as well, including tapir, peccary, toucans and howler monkeys. ""How about a hike to Victoria Peak?"" Sam asks, clearly teasing. Victoria is the highest point in Belize and requires a permit and a four-day trek under the best conditions. ""Let's just look for jaguars,"" I say. ""What's the best way to spot one?"" Here are Sam's tips. Next time I'll follow them, and hopefully spot a jaguar from a safe distance. Matador: 8 trips for getting close to the world's deadliest animals . 1. Go at night . Since jaguars hunt nocturnally, they obviously sleep during the day. Some visitors have been lucky enough to see one in the early morning, but the safest bet is to stay up and wait. Cockscomb has camping facilities and cabins for rent specifically for visitors to watch for cats at night. Matador: Top spots for penguin peeping . 2. Bring an umbrella and a guide . The rainy season in June and July is when the cats are most active. Go with a licensed guide who can track the cats' prints and droppings. Park rangers have set up cameras throughout the rainforest to record and observe the jaguars' behavior. They know what to look for. Guides are available both in Belmopan and Placencia. I arranged my visit with Sam through Splash Dive Center in Placencia. Another option is Ian Anderson's Caves Branch outside of Belmopan, with guides that are also trained as medics. 3. Be quiet . This one is hard. Sitting still, in the dark, in the rain, at night looking for jaguars, I would want to talk to my guide just to stay awake. But jaguars are known for their stealth and any foreign noise or scent will scare them away. Matador: By air, land and sea: 10 great animal migrations to witness . 4. Pray . Maybe a little prayer to the ancient Mayan Jaguar God of the underworld, Xbalanque, will send some cats your way. Other activities . Though I didn't see any jaguars (secretly, I was relieved; I've had plenty of run-ins with Belize's wildlife: barracudas, a viper, scorpions), I did enjoy an entire day at the park walking the trails, which are clearly marked, mapped out, and posted. My favorite was the waterfall trail, a rugged hike up a hill that ended under a waterfall with a swimming hole. Birders can try spotting some of the 290 species that live in the park. During the wet season, tubing in the river is also a popular option. On my way back to Placencia, I had time to check out the Mayan Women's Center for Crafts at the entrance of the park, with absolutely no fear of being mauled.

"(CNN) -- Paul Stamets was shy as a child; he couldn't look people in the eyes, so he stared at the ground. And that, he says, is where he found mushrooms. Today, that shyness has faded, but mushrooms are even more of a focal point. Stamets is one of the most prominent proponents of using mushrooms for medicinal purposes. Besides traveling the world to look for exotic mushrooms, he also lectures about them and runs a mushroom supplement company with his wife called Fungi Perfecti. When he spoke at TEDMED in October, he even wore a mushroom -- his hat is made from birch polypore, which is also thought to have medicinal uses. Why aren't mushrooms being used more often for medicinal purposes? Despite documented use of mushrooms in other cultures (for instance, ancient Greece) thousands of years ago, Stamets says some people have a fear of mushrooms -- mycophobia -- because the fungi are ephemeral and powerful. They have the power to feed you, make you high or even harm you, but they don't last very long. ""People's paranoia is a reflex of their not understanding something that's so mysterious,"" he said. ""I was always attracted to that which was forbidden, and these were forbidden fruits."" Stamets isn't the only one who's excited about mushrooms. George Hudler, a professor in Cornell University's Department of Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology, doesn't like the taste of them, but thinks there's a lot of potential for mushrooms' healing properties. ""In the next 10 years, we'll just see an incredible expansion of our awareness of chemicals in mushrooms, hopefully even their use in conventional medicine,"" says Hudler, who teaches a course on mushrooms at Cornell and once had dinner with Stamets. You might know of only a handful of mushroom types, but there are more than 150,000 species of mushrooms, Stamets says. Still, only 14,000 have been identified, and Stamets and colleagues are still looking. In Hudler's view, shiitake mushrooms have the longest track record of research in health benefits. Chemicals in them may stimulate the immune system and lower cholesterol. White button mushrooms found in salad are also high in vitamin B complex, and the antioxidant properties of mushrooms could protect against heart disease and cancer. And even hallucinogenic mushrooms are proving to have clinical uses. Psilocybin, one of the psychedelic compounds in ""magic"" mushrooms, may have uses for depression, a study recently suggested. There has also been research showing that healthy people given this drug in an experimental setting report having life-changes experiences and positive effects from them that last up to 25 years. The research on all these mushrooms is still preliminary, so there's no way to say for sure that mushrooms are going to add years to your life. But Stamets points to his mother as a living example of how useful mushrooms may be. Patty Stamets, 86, had stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in 2009, and doctors gave her three months to live. But after a year of turkey tail mushroom supplement in addition to the standard drugs Taxol (paclitaxel) and Herceptin (trastuzumab), she had no detectable cancer. Still, it's not clear that the mushrooms were the whole story. Turkey tail mushrooms may have some ability to boost the immune system, but there's so much unpredictability about cancer that it's hard to say how much they did on top of the standard medications, Hudler said. He thinks that trying experimental mushroom supplements to potentially help treat cancer is worth considering, but not without a physician's consultation. Stamets himself eats mushrooms three to four times a week, and he recommends that everyone else do the same. Always cook mushrooms to get their immune-boosting benefits, he says. Cooking also destroys any toxins that may be present in edible mushrooms such as shiitake and morels (but not poisonous mushrooms such as death caps), Hudler notes. Stamets likes his mushrooms crispy brown. ""These are functional foods,"" he says. ""It's a misconception to think of them as drugs.""","Paul Stamets says he believes people are afraid of mushrooms because they are powerful .

"(CNN) -- More than 300 relatives and friends of missing Flight MH370 passengers marched to the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing Tuesday to express their anger and frustration with Malaysian authorities. Hundreds of uniformed police blocked media from joining the protesters as they approached the gates of the embassy. Relatives despair as weather delays Flight 370 search . Many protesters wore white t-shirts that read, ""Please pray for the passengers of MH370. We pray for their safe return."" Some carried signs with messages of frustration and grief. ""Malaysian government, tell the truth. We've been waiting too long,"" read one. ""Husband, please come home,"" said another. Overcome by stress and raw emotion, one woman was carried out from the cordoned area on a stretcher by paramedics. Petition letter . Earlier, the protesters had walked on foot from the Lido Hotel, near Beijing's International Airport, after police prevented them from boarding buses to the embassy. Many relatives have been staying at the hotel since the airliner vanished more than two weeks ago. The protesters left the embassy on buses on Tuesday afternoon after a Malaysian official accepted a petition letter from the families. The previous evening, Malaysia's prime minister announced that Flight MH370's last position was in a remote part of the Indian Ocean. Soon after, Malaysian Airlines informed relatives that the lives of all on board the plane had been lost. Relatives at the Lido Hotel screamed and sobbed after hearing the news. The airline has already given family members $5,000 in compensation for each passenger aboard the ill-fated flight, and is preparing to make additional payments as the search continues. ""No amount of compensation or consolation will make up for any loss of life,"" Malaysia Airlines Chairman Mohamad Nor Yusof said Tuesday. The company is working on an arrangement to fly families to Australia once wreckage is found. Visa fees will be waived for the families of MH370 passengers and crew flying in to Australia, the country's defense minister David Johnston said Tuesday. Texts criticism . Malaysia Airlines has defended its decision to inform the families by text message -- along with phone calls and face-to-face meetings -- that the flight ended in the Indian Ocean. The airline's CEO, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said Tuesday that text messages were used to ensure the nearly 1,000 family members ""heard the tragic news before the world did."" China has asked Malaysia to share any evidence that led it to conclude the airliner crashed in the Indian Ocean with no survivors.

"(CNN) -- A 1-year-old girl who became seriously ill on a sailboat hundreds of miles off Mexico was on a U.S. Navy frigate Sunday and in stable condition, the U.S. Coast Guard said. Her parents thanked those who played a part in their rescue. ""We are very thankful to be safe and well. We also appreciate all the concern, thoughts and prayers of everyone back home for the health of our daughter Lyra. She is doing well now, and her medical condition continues to improve,"" Eric and Charlotte Kaufman said in a statement. They defended themselves against critics who question their decision to sail with their family. ""Please know that this is how our family has lived for seven years, and when we departed on this journey more than a year ago, we were then and remain today confident that we prepared as well as any sailing crew could,"" they wrote. ""The ocean is one of the greatest forces of nature, and it always has the potential to overcome those who live on or near it. ""We are proud of our choices and our preparation, and while we are disappointed that we lost our sailboat and our home, we remain grateful for those who came to our aid and those family and friends who continue to encourage and support us."" On Thursday morning, the Coast Guard received a distress call about the girl, who was on the Rebel Heart -- a Hans Christian 36 boat -- with her parents and sister about 900 miles from Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The sailboat did not have steering or communication abilities. Members of an Air National Guard unit operating out of Moffett Federal Airfield in the San Francisco Bay Area were dispatched, according to a spokesman. Four members of the 129th Rescue Wing parachuted into the ocean, inflated a motorized boat and reached the 36-foot sailboat, said 2nd Lt. Roderick B. Bersamina. The crew of the USS Vandegrift picked up the family and the four rescuers. ""Flight doctor says baby is stable after transfer; aircraft & air crews in Cabo are prepared,alert & evaluating all options,"" the 129th Rescue Wing wrote on its Twitter page Sunday. Officials said they can't give details about the illness, but said ""the family is in good spirits."" The family will stay aboard the Vandegrift as it sails back to San Diego. They are expected to arrive either Wednesday or Thursday, according to 129th Rescue Wing Group Commander Col. Hernando Polo. Maj. Mark Bomann said the baby is stable. ""We've been quite pleased with her status. The family is exhausted, as one can imagine, but they're out of any imminent danger or harm, which is what you'd worry about in a boat that may have problems,"" he told reporters. According to their blogs, Eric Kaufman and his wife, Charlotte, had plans to cross the Pacific and left Mexico some two weeks ago with their daughters Cora, 3, and 1-year-old Lyra. The family lives in San Diego. They left there in 2012 and were slowly making their way around the world. In one of her earlier blog posts, dated October 2012, Charlotte said that she and her husband had done a ton of research and would never purposefully put their family in harm's way. She wrote that they traveled with a satellite phone. ""Also remember that it is far, far more dangerous to drive every day on the freeway than it is to sail from San Diego to Mexico, or even around the world,"" Charlotte wrote.

"(EW.com ) -- This year, some real-life drama surrounds the soap-focused Daytime Emmy Awards. A few weeks before the ceremony, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences issued a casting call for social media mavens to host the event's live-streamed red carpet preshow. Specifically, as reported by Soap Opera Network, organizers wanted ""millennials between the ages of 18-35, all ethnicities, who have a strong entertainment news background and/or very strong social media following (300,000 followers minimum)."" Last Wednesday, the NATAS revealed that it had selected a foursome with a mighty social reach: Vine star Brittany Furlan, style vlogger Lauren Elizabeth, beauty vlogger Jessica Harlow, and Meghan Rosette, who vlogs about style and beauty. The chosen four certainly have large followings on sites like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Vine, and Facebookâ€”but their collective entertainment-news backgrounds aren't quite as strong. After a red carpet show criticized as amateurish and occasionally downright offensive, some irate viewers are demanding that NATAS issue an apology for Furlan, Elizabeth, Harlow, and Rosette's antics. Among the offenses the women committed, as outlined by TVLine's Matt Mitovich: Furlan ""literally came onto, and hard, every male in attendance, to a degree that makes E!'s Giuliana Rancic look positively demure"" (see, for example, this interaction with Mario Lopez); Harlow called The Bold and the Beautiful's Lawrence Saint-Victor ""a beautiful chocolate man"" before asking, apropos of nothing, ""What's it like to be a black man on a soap opera these days?"" Most egregiously, Furlan bid goodbye to General Hospital actor Ryan Paevey by saying, ""We're going to get you away from us before we rape you."" Viewers were swift to criticize the hosts, especially for Furlan's casual evocation of rape. The four hostsâ€”and the NATASâ€”have yet to respond directly to the criticism. Furlan did, however, tweet this not-so-subtle message in the wee hours of Monday morning: . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- After celebrating his 75th anniversary last year and getting rebooted for the big screen, what would DC Comics do for an encore for the Man of Steel (at least until his next movie, ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"")? Bring in fan favorite writer and DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns and fan favorite artist John Romita Jr. (""Amazing Spider-Man,"" ""Kick-Ass"") for starters. Johns made his mark by reinventing Green Lantern and has since done the same for Aquaman, to much acclaim. Romita, meanwhile, is comic book royalty. Not only did he work on Spider-Man, his father did in the early days of the character as well. This new supercreative team has built up anticipation among fans for ""Superman"" #32, which hits stores on June 25. The issue introduces Ulysses, who is something of an equal, and a reflection of Superman. But perhaps not is all as it seems. Meanwhile, Perry White tries to get Clark Kent to return to the Daily Planet. CNN spoke to Romita about diving into the world of the Last Son of Krypton. (DC Comics is owned by Time Warner, which also owns CNN.) CNN: What was it like when you first started work on Superman? Romita: There was a self-imposed nervousness, and I felt intimidated. No one gave me the impression that it was daunting, I just do that myself. I get nervous anticipation when I get ready to play softball, so this was the same thing. Honestly, everybody was very encouraging. My father signed off on it, saying ""Yeah, try something different."" But my mind started to collapse on itself. Once I started, I felt much more comfortable in it. Once I got the pencil to paper, and read the amazing script, I felt so much more comfortable. CNN: Have you tried to put your own take on Superman? Romita: Not necessarily. One drawback to drawing Superman is it's been done so many times that you can't really differentiate the style. I just wanted him to look 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds of solid muscle. You can't go light on that. You have to give him that powerful presence. You tweak the body language and the weight on the floor. There's a strict way the face should look, the hair is drawn a certain way. The only thing I like to do is convey the weight and the power of the figure, especially with a character like this. I was told to draw Spider-Man in a very awkward sort of way because he's not a very graceful character. And here we have this very graceful, elegant, powerful character. When he flies there's the cape behind him and all that. This is the whole ball of wax. CNN: Do you have plans to change Superman in some way down the road? Romita: That will possibly happen later on. Right now, we're following through on the costume designed by Jim Lee. While there are limitations to redesigning Superman's costume, his costume will be destroyed eventually, because he's doing cosmic stuff. But remember, we're dealing with the big S on the front, the big S on the back and the cape, so we'll be careful not to get too far from that iconic figure. However, it doesn't mean I can't throw in some influence the way Jim Lee did on his. CNN: Now that you've had the chance to work on him, do you have new insight into why Superman has lasted 76 years? Romita: I couldn't tell you why anything lasts that long, other than that it's a great representation of a hero. The way the character has been done all these years had its ups and downs like any series. Recently, the past 20 years, it's been done how it should be done: he does fail, he does get the snot beat out of him. I think that's the key to the character because none of us are infallible. His weak point over the past 76 years is when he was infallible. The realization that this is a superhero to the nth degree that has to struggle with real life is what comics are all about. CNN: Do you have a favorite supporting character? Romita: Out of the normal, down-to-earth characters, I'd like to see what happens with Lois, because she's a bit different now. I like the female characters because I feel like it's more difficult for male artists and writers to handle the female characters. Jimmy Olsen is a real kid, Lois is a real hustler at work. There's a new character I'd never seen before named Jackee, and I'd like to see how we explore her.","Geoff Johns and John Romita Jr. begin their run on ""Superman"" starting with issue #32 .

"(CNN) -- A 99-year-old woman was finally awarded her college diploma at a special graduation ceremony after a $5 diploma fee prevented her from receiving it 75 years ago. Jessie Rose White of Belfast, Maine, received a degree in stenography and bookkeeping after completing courses at Beal College in Bangor in 1939. ""I'm delighted!"" White said Monday, ""I didn't have the money to pay for the diploma, so I didn't get it."" White says she put herself through bookkeeping courses with $500 her uncle had given her years before she enrolled at Beal. ""It stayed in the bank, and he specified it couldn't be used for anything but education,"" White said. White says she used all her money to complete the required courses and could not afford the $5 diploma fee. Dona Gilbert, a friend of White's who recently learned about her education plight, contacted the college to share White's story. ""She deserved a diploma. I just thought it needed to be done,"" Gilbert said. Beal College President Allen Stehle presented White with her diploma. ""He gave me a receipt showing that it was paid for,"" White said. ""He has a great sense of humor."" Diagnosed with polio at 18 months old, White used crutches to make her way around the Beal campus when she was a student. She struggled to get a job after because of her disability, working as a bookkeeper and later a seamstress. Today, after a number of foot surgeries, White uses a wheelchair. A regular on the computer and the Internet, White intends to keep pursuing an education. ""I've always had a great thirst for learning, and I try to learn something new every day. I'd love to go back to college now if I had the strength."" Gilbert says she is constantly impressed by White's attitude. ""When I visit her, we just never stop talking,"" Gilbert said. ""She's curious and always asking questions. She has taught me and enriched my life in tremendous ways."" White was joined at her graduation by her son, daughter-in-law and three grandchildren. ""We're very appreciative of the care and attention to detail that was put into the graduation ceremony,"" said her son, William White. The diploma gives her maiden name, Jessie Rose Jones. ""I'm glad I had to wait 75 years, because it was more fun than it would have been in the first place,"" White said.","A $5 diploma fee prevented Jessie Rose White from receiving her degree in 1939 .

"(CNN) -- South African police arrested 59 people in Johannesburg overnight following postelection protests, authorities said Saturday. Police used rubber bullets to disperse the protesters, who burned tires in the township of Alexandria. ""Peace and calm has been restored in the community of Alexandra,"" said Police Brig. Neville Malila. All those arrested will appear in court Monday, he said. The African National Congress won the general election, holding on to power despite economic woes and corruption allegations. Provisional results show the ruling party got 62.2% of the vote. The Democratic Alliance placed a distant second with 22.2% of the vote, while four other parties split the rest.

"(CNN) -- The arrest of 19 protesters at a rancorous school board meeting Tuesday brings the issue of busing and diversity in education into the national spotlight. The North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP and local African Methodist Episcopal Zion Churches held a mass mobilization march Tuesday in Raleigh, North Carolina, to protest the recent decision by the Wake County Board of Education to end a 10-year-old socioeconomic diversity plan for public schools. The school board voted 5-4 on March 23 to end ""forced busing,"" a method initiated in the 1970s to promote diversity in public schools. Nearly 1000 people, including members of local church, community and advocacy groups, gathered at the Raleigh Convention Center and marched to the state capitol, according to local police and other officials. The Rev. William Barber II, president of the North Carolina state conference of the NAACP, said the groups rallied to raise awareness about the importance of diversity in public schools. ""It's time that the Wake County school board officials wake up and realize how a model for resegregation will damage not only our state, but the basic principles of our nation,"" Barber said. ""It's time to say no to resegregation and say yes to diversity and school excellence."" 19 arrested at school board meeting . The Wake County Public School System, which includes Raleigh, is the 18th largest school district in the nation. In the 1950s, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that separate and unequal school systems were unconstitutional. North Carolina schools have been a national model for education since the Swann vs. Charlotte-Mecklenburg School Board case in 1971. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district became the first district ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court to implement busing as a way to desegregate classrooms. In 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled the Charlotte-Mecklenburg district had achieved a healthy level of racial integration, and race-based busing was no longer required. ""The federal courts eliminated their oversight of the Charlotte busing system because the schools had achieved"" an equal balance in terms of race, said Mark Dorosin, senior managing attorney for the University of North Carolina's Center for Civil Rights. ""Since that time, the state has gone backwards and now several counties are as segregated as they were before [busing]."" As other counties ended busing and returned to neighborhood schools, the Wake County Public School System transformed the legislation in 1999, moving away from the traditional race-based integration policy and replacing it with a socioeconomic diversity program. This plan attempted to balance the proportion of wealthy and poor students at county schools by moving students around, with a busing system based on the percentage of children that received subsidized lunches. To foster this diversity, some students traveled an hour from their homes to school, and some suburban students were bused to inner-city schools. Parents frustrated by long drives and bus routes elected a school board that opposed the 1999 policy and imposed a new plan for neighborhood-based schools. The new plan requires students to go to schools in their communities, often leaving black students in underachieving schools and white students in higher quality schools, Dorosin said. Now some fear that the county that was once a desegregation model for the nation will bring back segregation that will spread throughout the state. ""This is not just a local issue, but a national one,"" said Benita Jones, UNC education fellow and attorney. ""Other school districts are on the edge of their seats, waiting to see what Wake County plans, before they make decisions on whether socioeconomic diversity should be reconsidered."" The rally on Tuesday was a call for attention to an issue that could spread like cancer, Barber said. ""We want a real community -- one community, where every child is cared for,"" he said. ""We know what resegregation looks like. And the last place we want it is in the South again."" Some concerned citizens of Wake County fully support the plan for community-based schools. Donna Williams, president of the Northern Wake Republican Club, which helped elect the majority members on the school board, believes that the outrage over community schools is unfounded. ""This has absolutely nothing to do with race, nothing to do with resegregation. It has to do with fixing what is not working,"" Williams said. She says minority students are graduating at a rate much lower than average in the current busing system. Only 51 percent of Hispanics and 63 percent of African-Americans graduated from schools in Wake County, compared to an overall graduation rate of 78 percent, according to the Wake County Public School System. ""When people get emotional, they get scared and afraid and believe whatever people are filling in their heads. What we need to do is come together to figure out what is best for our kids,"" Williams said. According to Wake County school board officials, the decision to stop busing is based purely on population dynamics and educational improvement -- not race. ""The extensive growth over the past two decades"" has resulted in the need for ""numerous adjustments"" and created ""challenges to meet demand and efficiency,"" the board said in a statement. Community-based assignments, they said, would not only ensure equity in each school zone, but would also provide ""all students at all schools with an equal opportunity to a sound, basic education,"" a fundamental right under North Carolina state law. Barber said the school board's decision is not constitutional and is a practice that will lead to educational failure. ""Neighborhood-schools [policy] not only separates bodies, it separates the budget, the buildings, the teachers -- basically, all the building blocks of education,"" he said. ""What you end up with is a district that's high in poverty, high in turnover, and high in underachievement."" Wake County school board officials will develop school assignments based on community zones within the next 9 to 15 months.","Activists arrested protesting new education policy in North Carolina .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Hollywood will produce at least two versions of the controversial story of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Fox Searchlight Pictures confirmed Wednesday that it will make a movie based on the 2012 Rolling Stone article ""America's Last Prisoner of War."" The announcement came a day after the Oscar-winning team of director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal revealed they would make a film about Bergdahl, the American soldier who recently returned to the United States after five years as a prisoner of the Taliban in Afghanistan. 'Hurt Locker' team to take on Bergdahl story . The Fox Searchlight film will be written and directed by Todd Field, best known for his Oscar-nominated movies ""In the Bedroom"" and ""Little Children,"" studio spokesman Russell Nelson said. Bergdahl and his family have not given up any of their life rights for the screenplay, Nelson said. But journalist Michael Hastings, who was killed in a Los Angeles car crash a year ago, had close access to Bergdahl's parents when he wrote the Rolling Stone article. Bigelow and Boal teamed up on the Iraq war film ""The Hurt Locker,"" which won six Oscars, and the Osama bin Laden search movie ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" which earned one Oscar.

He was released to U.S. forces on May 31 in a controversial trade for five Taliban figures who had been held at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after Bergdahl's disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official has told CNN.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy fighter jet crashed into the water off Southern California while approaching an aircraft carrier Wednesday night, the Navy said. The pilot of the F/A-18E Super Hornet ejected, was recovered and is in stable condition aboard the USS Carl Vinson, the Navy said Thursday. The aviator is expected to make a full recovery. The crash happened hours after a separate military plane went down in California: the nonfatal crash of one of the Marines' AV-8B Harriers into a neighborhood in Imperial. In Wednesday night's crash in the Pacific, the Super Hornet was on approach to the Carl Vinson when it hit the water about 10 p.m. PT, the Navy said. The jet hasn't been recovered. The cause of the crash will be investigated, the Navy said. All air operations aboard the Carl Vinson were suspended after the crash, but they resumed midday Thursday and diverted aircraft returned. The carrier had been taking part in an exercise in preparation for a deployment, the Navy said. CNN's Jason Hanna and John Branch contributed to this report.","F/A-18E Super Hornet crashes on approach to USS Carl Vinson off California .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has begun a review of the status of the manatee to determine whether the lovable sea cow should be moved from the endangered to the threatened list, officials said. The agency said Tuesday its review of the West Indian manatee, which includes the Florida manatee, will include a 60-day comment period. The review follows a 2012 petition and a lawsuit this year from Save Crystal River Inc., an organization that wants to ""improve and preserve the unique beauty of the waters of Crystal River and the community,"" according to its Facebook page. A lawyer for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative/libertarian organization that represents Save Crystal River, said that changing the listing won't necessarily change the federal protections for the animal. ""But not changing that status -- when the science says it should be changed -- will undermine the credibility of environmental oversight, and that's bad news for all species and all environmental concerns,"" attorney Christina M. Martin said in a post on the Save Crystal River website. An endangered species is one that is in danger of extinction now, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Threatened species are ones that likely will be on the verge of extinction in the future. Manatees are slow-moving, large marine mammals and many die in collisions with boats. Boaters are required to move at idle-speed in manatee protection zones. In 2013, federal wildlife officials broadened protections for manatees in Kings Bay, the headwaters for the Crystal River. Patrick Rose, executive diretor of the Save the Manatee Club, told Florida Today there are still problems, including losses in the main item in a manatees' diet -- sea grass. He said habitat loss and disease are other primary threats. Rose said his group will fight to keep manatees an endangered species. Wildlife officials say it is unclear how many manatees are in Florida waters. A statewide survey in 2011 suggested there were about 4,800, but counting manatees, who surface every four minutes to breathe, is difficult. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said the numbers appear to be increasing in some parts of the state or are stable in others, but researchers need updated numbers. There were 830 documented manatee deaths in 2013 and 218 for the first six months of 2014, according to information published on the commission's website. Many have died in algae blooms. Manatees have been on the federal endangered species list since it was first published in 1967. Photos: Strange and endangered species . Opinion: Jamaica selling out its paradise .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Transgender students in California would be able to choose which school bathrooms and locker rooms to use and which sport teams to join based on their gender identity under a measure approved this week by the California Legislature. The proposal now awaits the signature of Gov. Jerry Brown, whose office has declined to comment on whether he will sign it. The proposal would be the first state law in the nation that specifically requires equal access to public school facilities and activities based on gender identity, though some states have general policies to the same effect, said Shannon Price Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, one of several groups backing the legislation. Colorado: Transgender first-grader wins the right to use girls' restroom . But enactment of the measure would ""simply mean that California will be catching up with other states that already have enacted regulations based on a general prohibition of gender identity discrimination in schools,"" Minter told CNN. ""Our view is that California's existing law should already require schools to provide transgender students with equal access to facilities and activities, but in practice, many schools are not complying with that requirement and will not do so unless the Legislature provides specific guidance on this issue,"" Minter said. Though California prohibits discrimination in education, transgender students ""are often still unfairly excluded from physical education, athletic teams, and other school activities and facilities because of who they are,"" according to a statement by the center and other groups supporting the measure. The California Senate approved the proposal on Wednesday, 21-9. It had been earlier approved by the Assembly in early May. State Senate Republicans largely opposed the measure during debate, as broadcast by CNN affiliate KCRA. ""There are youthful sex offenders,"" said state Sen. Jim Nielsen. ""I guarantee there would be those who would use this opportunity."" ""It's going to be problem with implementation,"" said Sen. Jean Fuller. The proposed law would require that a pupil ""be permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, and use facilities consistent with his or her gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil's records,"" the legislation says. Opinion: Gender identity not just body parts . Ashton Lee, a 16-year-old transgender boy from of Manteca, California, testified before the Senate Education Committee last month. Lee wants to play high school football. ""I just want to be treated the same as all the other boys, but my school forces me to take P.E. in a class of all girls and live as someone I'm not,"" Lee said in a statement. ""I can't learn and succeed when every day in that class leaves me feeling isolated and alone."" The Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second largest, implemented a policy in 2005 that's ""nearly identical"" to the legislative proposal now awaiting the governor's signature, advocacy groups said. ""We've worked closely with students and families to ensure that our policies related to gender identity are successful, welcomed by students, and supported by parents,"" Judy Chiasson, the district's program coordinator for human relations, diversity and equity, said in a statement.","Transgender students would choose which bathroom to use and team to join .

"(CNN) -- A two-star U.S. Army general will begin investigating this week how and why Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl left his base in Afghanistan, resulting in his capture, a senior defense official said. Bergdahl spent five years in captivity until his release May 31, in exchange for five Taliban figures being held at a U.S. military detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Bergdahl, 28, returned to the United States -- specifically to an Army medical facility in San Antonio, Texas -- early Friday. Though the investigation begins this week, it's not known when the sergeant will undergo formal questioning. The senior defense official declined to name the general who will investigate until there is a formal announcement. Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official recently told CNN. Bergdahl arrived in San Antonio from a military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, where he'd been recuperating since his release May 31 in exchange for five Taliban figures held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Officials have described Bergdahl's condition as stable. With Qatar as the broker, the United States struck a deal with the Taliban to free Bergdahl. The Obama administration didn't tell Congress of the releases. Under law, the White House has to give a 30-day notice to Capitol Hill before any terrorists are transferred from Guantanamo. Believing that his health was deteriorating, the administration said it acted quickly to save his life. U.S. special operations forces recovered Bergdahl without incident on May 31 at a helicopter pickup point in eastern Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan.","Source: A two-star general has been appointed to investigate Bowe Bergdahl's disappearance .

"(CNN) -- It was silver in Sochi -- but Austria's Marcel Hirscher was back on top after winning the World Cup slalom crystal globe. Hirscher defeated Germany's Felix Neureuther after recording a time of 2 minutes 07.74 seconds to win the overall World Cup title for the third year in succession. Hirscher showed little sign of nerves in Lenzerheide, Switzerland, as he kept his cool throughout to overturn a five point deficit. ""I knew it would be all or nothing,"" Hirscher told reporters. ""Only the result counted. ""I laid down a marker on the first leg and on the second we saw that the course-setting made little difference. ""It didn't really suit me, but I was still quick."" Hirscher added: ""With this slalom crystal globe, I've fulfilled another wish and goal, my season's perfect.""

"(CNN) -- On mobile devices, social media may be hot, but news still captures people's attention. And the news business, troubled though it has been, is all about attention. But can mobile news apps help save news about your community? In just a couple of years, mobile devices are likely to be the most common way that people in the United States access the Internet. Meanwhile, more and more newspapers and other traditional news outlets, especially those that provide local or regional news, are likely to keep getting smaller or even fold. New research from Localytics shows that mobile users spend roughly the same amount of time with news apps as they do with Twitter's mobile app, about 115 minutes per month. Many of my news media colleagues get excited when they hear statistics like that. They're hoping news apps might help save the ad-supported news business, perhaps even help keep traditional print newspapers and broadcast news operations afloat. That's because advertisers want eyeballs. When people spend more time in apps, those apps become more attractive vehicles for advertising. Localytics' data implies that smartphone and tablet apps for news could indeed offer an advantage to mobile advertisers. People spend just two-thirds as much time using mobile apps for entertainment, health and fitness, sports and music. While game apps are popular, on average, mobile users spend less than half as much time using game apps as news apps. But not so fast: News organizations wouldn't necessarily be getting all, or even most, of the ad dollars from news apps. That's because some of the most popular news apps don't come directly from print or broadcast news brands. For example, Flipboard is a very popular news aggregator app. Similarly, OnSwipe repackages a publisher's content to make it beautiful and easy to use on mobile Web browsers (not apps). The companies that provide these tools determine which ads get displayed there. Publishers who distribute their content through such third-party mobile news tools earn a cut of the resulting ad revenue, but it's less money than they've been accustomed to making by selling their own ads. Pulse and Google Currents (two other popular news aggregator apps) don't yet run ads but are likely to start selling ads soon, according to TechCrunch and Forbes. Most major news brands do offer their own smartphone or tablet apps, but these often are costly to develop and maintain, which can make them a dicey business proposition. Furthermore most news brands that offer their own mobile apps don't sell their own in-app ads; they serve ads from revenue-sharing mobile ad networks. These network ads tend to be fairly generic and lacking in geographic relevance. That has been a missed opportunity, because location is especially important to mobile users, and because the vast majority of news outlets are local. Last year, CNN took a different approach by purchasing Zite, a popular news aggregator tablet app. So far Zite doesn't display ads, but it is experimenting with revenue models and eventually it may help directly support the news organization. That strategy might eventually pay off for a big global news organization like CNN, but probably not so much for a struggling no-longer-daily newspaper in a city like New Orleans. GigaOm expects huge growth in the mobile advertising market, spurred by great improvements in meeting the needs of local advertisers. That's a development that could indeed help save local news outlets, at least the ones that decide to get serious about mobile. But if a boom in mobile advertising ends up mainly benefiting national and global advertisers, ad networks and news outlets, then more people will keep getting less and less access to local news -- with potentially profound effects on communities. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","New research shows news apps are competitive with Twitter's mobile app .
Many hope that revenue from these apps might offset losses from print and broadcast news .
News apps are costly to make and maintain .
Larger news organizations might profit from apps, but it's doubtful that smaller newspapers will ."
"(CNN) -- President Obama is not shy about showing off his jump shot on the basketball court, but on Tuesday night, it was his baseball skills that were put to the test. President Obama throws out the first pitch at the 2009 All-Star Game onTuesday in St Louis, Missouri. Obama, clad in a Chicago White Sox jacket and blue jeans, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in St. Louis, Missouri. His low pitch barely reached home plate and the mitt of St. Louis Cardinals star Albert Pujols. Obama became the fifth president to throw out the first pitch at an All-Star Game, but the first in 33 years. He is following in the footsteps of Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford. Asked about plans to practice before the game, Obama said Tuesday, ""I want to loosen up my arm a little bit."" ""The last time I threw a pitch was at the American League championship series, and I just wanted to keep it high,"" the president said of his opening pitch at the 2005 Chicago White Sox-Anaheim Angels game. Aiming high is a good strategy, says St. Louis Cardinals scout Matt Blood, but it takes more than on-point aim to make the perfect pitch. ""Throw it with some force, don't lob it in there. Try to get a good downhill plane. Try to keep it in the strike zone,"" said Blood, who will be at the game Tuesday. HLN sports anchor Larry Smith, who has thrown out a few first pitches, says Obama has to be careful to ""not try to overpower it."" ""There's no speed gun on this. Just make it a nice solid throw to the catcher,"" Smith said. ""The one thing he doesn't want to do is bounce it home. Mr. Obama is pretty athletic, so I think he'll ace this."" Overpowering it shouldn't be an issue for the president, who joked Tuesday that he'd be surprised if his 2005 pitch exceeded 30 miles per hour. The president also needs to make sure he uses his whole arm, Blood said. ""You'll see a lot of people throw kind of out front. Their elbow will start out front and they'll never get their arm back behind their body, and won't get a full arm swing. It will be real short, and not very rhythmic,"" he said. Former Major League Baseball pitcher Jim Bouton said Obama's at the top of his game, and he can ""afford to take a few chances."" ""He should toss it a little further to the left. The righties are down by 15 runs in the ninth, they've got no team leadership. They're fighting with each other in the opposing dugout,"" he joked. All kidding aside, Obama should ""just go with his instincts, like any good athlete,"" Bouton said. ""You don't want to throw the ball into the ground or behind you, that's for sure."" Obama also doesn't want to do what Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory did in his opening pitch for the Reds 2007 season. He missed home plate by 30 feet. Video of the Democratic mayor's embarrassing throw has been viewed nearly 2 million times on YouTube. But the opening pitch isn't always a light-hearted moment. President Bush described his opening pitch at Yankees stadium during the 2001 World Series as ""the most nervous moment"" of his presidency so far. The game came less than two months after the September 11 terrorists attacks. Bush wore an FDNY jacket to pay tribute to the New York City Fire Department. He stepped onto the pitchers mound, and before a cheering crowd of nearly 60,000, he threw a strike. The crowded erupted in chants of ""U-S-A, U-S-A."" Before the game Tuesday night, Obama and all of the living former presidents will appear in a community service video. After the video is shown, Obama will take the field at Busch Stadium and greet the six St. Louis Cardinal Hall of Fame players. He then will throw his pitch to Cardinals' all-star first baseman Albert Pujols. Major League Baseball said the president will wear a specially made glove for his appearance, with a script Obama 44 and an American flag on it. The glove will then be sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. If Obama has butterflies about his pitch, Blood says the president should use the nervous energy to his advantage. ""For Obama, I'm sure he's dealt with much more pressure than throwing out the first pitch at a baseball game, but I would -- instead of seeing it as pressure -- I would think of it as an exciting opportunity and turn the nervousness into positive adrenaline,"" he said. CNN's Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","President Obama throws opening pitch at All-Stars game Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Michael Schumacher's manager has revealed that a journalist tried to sneak into the French hospital room where the Formula One superstar is being treated Tuesday. The record-breaking German racer suffered severe head injuries after falling and hitting his head on a rock while skiing Sunday in the French Alpine resort of Meribel. His manager Sabine Kehm confirmed to CNN that a member of the media had attempted to gain access to the room at the University Hospital Center of Grenoble disguised as a priest. Doctors said Tuesday there was a ""slight improvement in the German star's condition. On Monday night, doctors carried out a surgical intervention on Schumacher that allowed for some pressure to be relieved on his brain. Schumacher accident 'rare event' There has been a global outpouring of support from the motorsport community and Schumacher's ardent global fanbase since news of his accident broke. Outside the hospital, fans, some dressed in the scarlet colors of the Ferrari racing team, have placed flags bearing Ferrari's Prancing Horse emblem. Schumacher won five successive world titles with the famous Italian marque between 2000 and 2005, to add to the back-to-back titles he won for Benetton in 1994 and 1995. Michael Schumacher: Life in the fast lane . His family issued a statement Tuesday, saying: ""Following Michael's skiing accident, we would like to thank the people from all around the world who have expressed their sympathy and sent their best wishes for his recovery. They are giving us great support. We all know he is a fighter and will not give up."" His wife Corinna and his two children are among the family at his bedside. In a stellar first career, the 44-year-old won an overall record seven world titles and 91 grands prix. He retired from the sport for a second time in 2012 after making a largely uncompetitive return to the F1 grid with Mercedes in 2010. Since his retirement, Schumacher had been working as an ambassador for the German car giant but said earlier this month that he had been enjoying spending time with his family and mentoring the next generation of go-kart racers.","Seven time Formula One champion Michael Schumacher remains in French hospital after a skiing accident .

"(CNN) -- When researchers at Harvard Business School set out to study top-level leadership within a major organization, it would have been easy to focus on a high-flying CEO from the commercial or financial worlds. Instead, the academics cast convention aside and approached a football manager with an avowed commitment to socialism -- Sir Alex Ferguson. The former Manchester United manager is one of the most successful coaches of all time, winning a veritable treasure trove of trophies and championships in a managerial career that stretched across five decades. All very impressive, but what could Ferguson possibly know about business leadership that would be of use to an in-depth study on the subject? See also: There's no escape from Robo-boss . Quite a lot according to management consultant and author, Mike Carson, who has spent the past year interviewing top-level soccer managers, including Ferguson, for his book, ""The Manager: Inside The Minds of Football's Leaders"". ""People think football is about buying and selling players and picking the team, but actually that is just a relatively small part of it,"" Carson explained. ""It's also about how do I lead myself? How do I lead my team? And how do I lead others?"" ""Whether you're leading a football club and all the infrastructure behind that ... or whether you're leading an executive company, the human skills are quite similar,"" he added. Tactical game . Like the researchers who studied Ferguson at close quarters and invited him to speak at Harvard last year, Carson draws parallels between the best CEOs and football managers in how they strive to introduce long term structures and values to foster a culture of success. He also points out the similarities in managing top talent, developing an effective one-to-one leadership style as well as taking into account the needs of different interests groups within an organization. This final quality is something the best soccer managers do particularly well, Carson noted. See also: The 10 worst bosses from TV and film . ""Football management is not unlike being a senior executive where you have to balance the needs of multiple parties: investors, shareholders, committees, customers, clients, consumers and stakeholders in general."" ""No-one gets it right all the time; and for the managers of the big clubs and national teams, the stakes are very high indeed. The likes of JosÃ© Mourinho, ArsÃ¨ne Wenger and recently Sir Alex Ferguson are under constant press and media scrutiny, and have frequent high-profile and high-impact dealings with press, club owners, agents and top talent, high-priced players,"" he added. Contrasting styles . Yet despite these broad similarities, the day-to-day methods used to nurture relationships in sport and business will in most cases be vastly different. Jose Mourinho's often barbed public attitude towards officialdom and competitors, for example, would unlikely meet the level of decorum expected of a public facing CEO or executive. Sir Alex Ferguson's infamous hairdryer treatment (where he stands inches away from a players face and screams at the top of his voice) or the temperamental touchline persona of Borussia Dortmund head-coach, Jurgen Klopp, meanwhile hardly seem suited to the more refined sensibilities of the business world. According to Professor Ian Clarke, dean of Edinburgh University's business school, however, these emotional techniques still display leadership attributes that businesspeople can adapt for their own purposes. See also: Neurotics shine over time in team settings . ""[One of the main] things those in business can learn from leaders in sport is passion,"" Clarke explained. ""Many top sports coaches have this, but so few business leaders display it openly in their organizations or externally."" In this regard, Clarke says there is ""a huge amount that businesspeople can take from those in sport. I don't think enough of that goes on as it is."" Transferring skills . Perhaps one of the main reasons for this lack of learning across football and business is the fact that so few have operated at the sharp end of both disciplines. One man who has is former Tottenham, Celtic and Cagliari defender, Ramon Vega. The former Swiss international founded his own asset management firm, Vega Swiss Asset Management, in 2009 after hanging up boots several years previously. His organization now looks after $1 billion of clients' funds under advisory management, according to a 2012 profile in the Times of London. Although never a football manager himself, Vega spent more than 15 years studying at the feet of inspirational coaches such as Martin O'Neil, Christian Gross and Roy Hodgson which he said prepared him for the rigors of leading a successful company. ""There are similarities between the two (football and business) as you always have pressure to perform,"" he said. ""On the football side this is something that you can really bring over into the business world as you are trained from a very young age to cope with major pressure."" See also: Is investing in a college degree worth it? Like Carson and Clarke before him, however, Vega highlights the ability to deal with people on an individual level as the major similarity between leadership roles in the two fields. He believes those in business can glean much from football if they were to analyze the methods and behavior of leading coaches. ""People skills in any form of management are about 80% to 90% the most important part of the job,"" Vega said. ""Of course you also have to have knowledge and know-how of a specific industry as well, but if you have these skills and effective communication then people will do the job for you very well. ""If managers take the time to think about it and see the positions of people then they can only learn a lot from the sports world,"" he added.","Football managers can offer valuable insight into leadership, says author Mike Carson .

"(CNN) -- An October three-vehicle collision that left eight people dead in eastern Tennessee was caused by a blown front tire on a church bus, investigators said Monday. The bus was traveling east on Interstate 40 in Jefferson County, Tennessee, when the tire blew, causing the driver to lose control. The bus veered into the median and ran through a cable barrier before crashing into a Chevy Tahoe and tractor-trailer in the westbound lanes. ""This tragedy was the result of blunt-force impact to the front tire that weakened its internal structure and caused the tire's failure. There was no evidence of any pre-existing condition to the tire,"" Col. Tracy Trott of the Tennessee Highway Patrol said. He added that there is no evidence any of the drivers in the crash were impaired or distracted. There was also nothing to indicate the bus wasn't well-maintained, he said. The bus, which was owned by Front Street Baptist Church in Statesville, North Carolina, was carrying 18 passengers, five of whom were ejected and killed. Another died inside the bus, while one of the three occupants of the Tahoe died, as did the tractor-trailer's driver. The bus was carrying a group of seniors on their way back home from a religious conference. The group was called ""Young at Heart,"" pastor Rick Cruz said at the time. They were returning home from the 17th annual Fall Jubilee conference in Gatlinburg after three days of preaching and singing. ""We do know that there were several that went on to be with the Lord,"" Cruz told his congregants during a sermon after the crash.","October 3-vehicle crash in eastern Tennessee left eight people dead, police say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Think of pop-tops, and a soda can might come to mind. But Sister Rosemary Nyirumbe sees pop-tops as a way to help hundreds of women in Gulu, Uganda, start a new life. Nyirumbe sells women's purses made out of the aluminum tabs, and so far she has sold more than 500 purses for about $3,000. All of the proceeds go to the people who made them -- her students at the St. Monica's Girls' Tailoring Center. Eight years ago, Nyirumbe started the school in Gulu to help poor young girls and women caught in the middle of the decades-long Ugandan civil war. Many of the women had become mothers after they were abducted and raped by rebels in the Lord's Resistance Army. Nyirumbe's school feeds and rehabilitates more than 300 mothers and their babies each year. It also provides free medical care and teaches the mothers valuable life skills, such as sewing, cooking and cleaning. The purses are a relatively new endeavor and just one of the many ways her school is helping students who have been deeply traumatized and need money to support themselves. ""I got this idea, and it took me about two weeks to teach myself and my students,"" Nyirumbe said during a recent trip to the U.S. ""It's really changing their lives, because they are paid for what they produce."" In 2007, Nyirumbe was recognized as a CNN Hero for her efforts with the school. ""It raised a lot of awareness about what we're doing, because after that, it exposed me to many people in the world,"" she said. ""It has really made a lot of people come to understand the importance of supporting us."" However, the needs are still many. For example, there is no electricity at the school. ""We have a generator which we can use for about two hours, but the cost of fuel is so high that we cannot maintain it,"" she said. ""Uganda is a country which is developing, and technology is available. But in my case, I live in a place where there's no electricity."" The school is also next to a prison, but Nyirumbe said she saw that as an opportunity, not an obstacle. She said that as she drove by one day, she knew that inside there were people she could help. ""I went to the prison authority and asked them if they would let the women come out, and they told me to put it in writing. I did, and now the children are coming to our center from the prison,"" she said. Nyirumbe, who joined the sisterhood when she was just 15, says that since being named a CNN Hero, she has seen a marked increase in publicity, awareness and trust. Doctors, lawyers and professional athletes from the U.S. now routinely travel to her school. But she gets her most satisfaction from seeing ""these girls working with their heads up. They have their dignity restored, and they can support themselves and they can take care of their children. And they love their children."" At 54, Nyirumbe is not planning to slow down anytime soon. A second school north of Gulu and close to the border with Sudan is now being built. ""I think I see everything as a kind of plan of God for me, and it gives me the energy, it gives me the joy to be where I am and to work in a difficult situation,"" she said. ""And I think if I was someone always unhappy or ... I was not giving joy to the people, I would not accept to take care of these girls who have suffered a lot."" She then paused before adding determinedly, ""Yes, I will continue."" Donations for Nyirumbe's school can be made through the Rural Hospital Relief Fund.","Sister Rosemary Nyriumbe, a 2007 CNN Hero, is still making a difference in Uganda .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 200 arrests for sex trafficking and related crimes have been made in New York in operations leading up to Sunday's Super Bowl, law enforcement officials say. New York Police Department vice units trained in dealing with sex trafficking and prostitution have converged on certain parts of the city in the last two weeks, conducting both street busts and high-end, undercover call girl stings to try and curtail some of the sex trafficking business in anticipation of the Super Bowl. The 200 arrests are in line with the number of arrests made in previous sweeps in New York, according to police Det. James Duffy. For years, federal and local authorities have been concerned about increased prostitution around major sporting events such as the Super Bowl. The NYPD and the Federal Bureau of Investigation say they're dedicating more resources to the issue and have been working cases to target traffickers who victimize young women and men in the sex trade. Most of the operation has focused on johns and sex traffickers. The police department has stressed that in most cases, they treat sex workers as victims.

"(CNN) -- A 30-year-old Uzbek national who has been arrested on federal terrorism charges pleaded not guilty in an initial appearance in a Boise, Idaho, court Friday. A hearing on bail for Fazliddin Kurbanov, 30, is scheduled for Tuesday, and the trial is set for July 2. A grand jury in Boise returned a three-court indictment charging Kurbanov, with one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and one count of possessing an unregistered destructive device. A grand jury in Salt Lake City, Utah, returned a separate indictment charging him with one count of distribution of information relating to explosives, destructive devices and weapons of mass destruction.

"(CNN) -- Michael Schumacher's family has asked for privacy as the Formula One star remains in a critical condition in a French hospital following a skiing accident. The 45-year-old is stable but remains in a coma at the Grenoble hospital as he fights the effects of a serious head injury. Schumacher is a formidable figure in F1, winning a record seven world titles, and his plight has attracted global interest and an outpouring of support from the sport's fans. However his family wants the media to keep their distance. ""Please support us in our common fight with Michael,"" Corinna Schumacher, wife of the F1 racer, said in a statement. ""It is important to me that you [media] relieve the doctors and the hospital so that they can work in peace. ""I kindly ask you to trust their statements and leave the clinic. Please also let our family in peace."" Schumacher suffered severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on 29 December. The German hit a rock hidden under deep snow and was catapulted head first onto another rock. He was not moving fast at the time. He is in a medically induced coma and has undergone two operations. His condition has attracted intense media scrutiny and last week a journalist disguised as a priest tried to sneak into the French hospital room where the Formula One superstar is being treated. The doctors at the hospital have also called for the media to provide more respect. ""The privacy of the patient demands that we are not going into details of his treatment, and this is why we do not plan any press conferences, nor give out written press releases, anymore for the time being,"" they said in a statement on Monday . ""We again insistently ask you to respect the medical secrets and to stick to the information given by the medical team in charge of the patient or his management, as this is the only valid information. ""The clinical state of Michael Schumacher is considered as stable and is constantly monitored by the medical treatments that are administered to him. ""However, the medical team responsible underlines that they will not stop to consider Michael's condition as critical."" Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm added: ""I can confirm Michael's condition can be considered as stable, as written in the official statement. I cannot confirm to have stated that his life is out of danger."" French prosecutors will reportedly brief journalists on their investigation into Schumacher's accident on Wednesday in the Alpine town of Albertville. Schumacher is the most successful driver in Formula One history, driving for the Benetton and Ferrari teams and winning a record seven world titles and 91 grand prix wins.","Michael Schumacher's wife asks for privacy as the Formula One racer remains in a critical condition .

"(CNN) -- Thomas Corless has been to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, 101 times. ""The Disney Parks are unlike anything else on the planet,"" he said. Corless, who runs the Disney fan site WDWNT.com, will be in Orlando this weekend to celebrate the theme park resort's 40th birthday. Since its opening on October 1, 1971, Walt Disney World -- or WDW, as it's often referred to online -- has become the world's most visited recreational resort. It's also more than twice the size of New York's Manhattan island. People get married there, they go there on their honeymoons (more than anywhere else in the continental United States), and of course it's a major destination for families. For those who go over and over again, like Corless, there is a big nostalgia factor. He counts attractions that no longer exist at the park among his favorites. ""I think the fascination is partly nostalgia for characters & childhood memories and partly the promise of fun,"" the iReporter said. ""You know when you go to Walt Disney World, you are going to have fun. There aren't many places you can take the family and have that guarantee."" For other repeat visitors, like Pete Werner, a visit to the resort can mark an important point in their lives. ""I was newly sober and only had one day to spend at Disney World while in Orlando for business [in 1993],"" he said. ""My first park was Epcot, and as a result of that visit, I became enamored with everything Disney. I promised myself for each year I stayed sober, I would reward myself with a visit to WDW."" Werner eventually moved to Orlando and started the websites WDWinfo.com and DISboards.com. Werner doesn't think one thing in particular makes the parks so special. Like him, many who visit the parks have one special memory they take with them. ""Everyone has a story -- a memory -- that they relive every time they return,"" he said. ""Disney is really its own world -- and a place where you can escape from reality without any of the negative consequences that usually come with other forms of escapism."" Check out more iReports of Disney memories . Ryan Wilson, another hard-core fan, iReporter and creator of Main Street Gazette, said he remembers specific moments instead of rides or attractions: ""Sharing a great meal with a great collection of friends, watching my wife's face light up as she watches fireworks burst overhead, or wandering old stomping grounds with my mom and dad. Walt Disney World is, for me, the magical place that means so much to my friends and family, and they are the heart of my experiences there."" Just before packing for his 102nd trip to the parks, Corless said that he believes Walt Disney World is ""unlike anything else on the planet. Sure, there are other theme parks, but they aren't even close to Walt Disney World in popularity, quality, and most certainly in meaning to American culture."" Watch an iReporter's home movie of Sea World and WDW in 1974 . For hard-core fans like Corless, Walt Disney World history is something that is discussed on the many websites devoted to the parks. Here are some important dates in WDW history: . October 1, 1971: Nearly five years after the death of Walt Disney, the resort bearing his name officially opens in an area that used to be swampland, with Magic Kingdom theme park attractions like ""It's a Small World,"" the Haunted Mansion, the Country Bear Jamboree and the Mad Tea Party. The resort surrounding the park would bring in tourists from all over the globe over the next 40 years. December 15, 1973: Pirates of the Caribbean, one of the most popular rides of all time, opens in the Magic Kingdom's Adventureland. January 15, 1975: Two centerpieces of Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland -- the Space Mountain roller coaster and the Carousel of Progress show -- open to the public. June 11, 1977: The first Main Street Electrical Parade takes place in the Magic Kingdom, state of the art for its time. October 1, 1982: Walt Disney's vision of the future, EPCOT Center (consisting of Future World and World Showcase), opens with attractions such as Spaceship Earth, The Land's Kitchen Kabaret and World of Motion. Fan favorites Journey into Imagination (introducing the original characters Dreamfinder and Figment) and Horizons would open within the year. September 12, 1986: Michael Jackson stars in ""Captain EO,"" which makes its world premiere at EPCOT Center. (It would return to the park in 2010, in memory of the pop star, after a 16-year absence.) Michael Jackson at the Magic Kingdom in 1983 . May 1, 1989: A third park, Disney-MGM Studios (which would herald a new spate of filmmaking in Orlando -- at least for a short time) opens. ""Star Tours,"" the ""Star Wars"" thrill ride, would follow in December. October 2, 1992: Thrill ride Splash Mountain makes its debut at the Magic Kingdom's Frontierland. July 22, 1994: The ""Twilight Zone"" Tower of Terror makes its worldwide debut at Disney-MGM Studios. Thrill-seekers line up to take the plunge. April 22, 1998: A fourth park, Disney's Animal Kingdom, focused on nature and conservation, opens to the public. A roller coaster, Expedition Everest, would be added in 2006. September 7, 1998: Mr. Toad's Wild Ride closes. Fans protest with a ""Save the Toad"" campaign that doesn't pan out. (The ride is still going strong after 56 years at Disneyland in Anaheim, California.) The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride takes its place in the Magic Kingdom's Fantasyland on June 4, 1999. October 10, 1998: Journey Into Imagination closes, to be reopened as a completely new ride, Journey Into YOUR Imagination, on October 1, 1999. The ride, which contains very little of the character Figment, and no Dreamfinder, is poorly received, and closes on October 8, 2001, only to return with major changes as Journey Into Imagination with Figment in 2002. However, some hard-core fans have campaigned to bring back the original ride, or at least Dreamfinder. December 19, 1998: Epcot (no more ""Center"" in the name) opens its first thrill ride, Test Track, replacing World of Motion. August 15, 2003: Mission: SPACE, a thrill ride simulating space travel, takes the place of Horizons at Epcot. July 7, 2006: Audio-Animatronic figures of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" stars Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are added to the original ride of the same name. July 4, 2009: A new version of the Hall of Presidents show opens at the Magic Kingdom's Liberty Square with the addition of President Barack Obama. 2013: New Fantasyland, an expansion of the area in Magic Kingdom, is set to open, replacing Snow White's Scary Adventures with a Seven Dwarfs-themed mine ride, and adding a new version of Dumbo the Flying Elephant, as well as the Beast's castle from ""Beauty and the Beast.""

"(CNN) -- A professional baseball player landed in a hospital after a game this week with a bite wound to the ear, police said. Alex Guerrero, second-baseman for the Albuquerque Isotopes, could be seen quarreling on the field with his teammate, catcher Miguel Olivo, during a game against the Salt Lake Bees on Tuesday. Video posted to MiLB.com showed teammates stepping between the two, as they taunted each other. The site, which bears the title ""the official site of minor league baseball,"" reported that not much later, in the eighth inning, the two fought in the team's dugout. A photo on MiLB.com showed Guerrero holding a towel to his ear. The Triple-A game was temporarily suspended and both players were replaced by substitutes. The injured player was transported to a hospital in Murray, Utah, said Salt Lake Police detective Greg Wilking. Authorities there told Wilking that ""an ear had been bitten off."" Guerrero declined to file a report with law officers. ""He wanted to talk to a lawyer and the league before he decides what he wants to do,"" Wilking said. The Isotopes, who lost to the Bees 7-4, got behind early in the game, allowing Salt Lake 4 runs in the first inning. Both teams have losing records. Olivo became angry and confronted Guerrero on the field in the seventh inning, after the second-basemen did not tag a player out when Olivo threw the ball to him, MiLB.com reported. The Isotopes are a farm team of the Los Angeles Dodgers, which issued a statement on the incident. ""The baseball operations department is aware of the altercation and is conducting an investigation into the matter. The organization does not condone this type of behavior,"" it said. Both men also play in games for the Dodgers in the majors. Guerrero, who defected from Cuba in 2013 signed a four-year $28 million contract with the club.

"(CNN) -- This was not how it was supposed to end. The past week had been a procession -- the next few days were supposed to end in a coronation. With the future King of England in the Royal Box, the man who wore the Wimbledon crown so proudly allowed it to slip on Centre Court. Andy Murray, the first British man to win the tournament in 77 years, was not just thrown out of his court, he was brushed aside by a man threatening mutiny at the top of the men's game. Grigor Dimitrov has hinted at performances like this before -- but this was the announcement his potential had always promised to deliver. The Bulgarian, 23, for so long hailed as the heir apparent to 17-time grand slam winner Roger Federer, is ready to finally erase the tag which has haunted him since he first came to prominence -- that of ""Baby Fed"". Ranked 13 in the world, Dimitrov gave a performance which left nobody in doubt that he is a serious challenger for the title following a 6-1 7-6 6-2 win over the defending champion. Never before has Dimitrov gone further than the second round at the All England Club -- now he is just one victory away from a grand slam final. But the signs had been there. Dimitrov, who won the Queens Club title - a warm-up tournament before Wimbledon - has been improving with each and every match. He will now play his first ever grand slam semifinal against Novak Djokovic -- the 2011 champion and the tournament's top seed. Djokovic, a six-time grand slam champion was given a real scare by Croatia's Marin Cilic before eventually prevailing in five sets -- 6-1 3-6 6-7 6-3 6-2. Also safely into the final four is the man who many have likened Dimitrov to -- Roger Federer. The veteran of the All England Club booked a ninth semifinal appearance after beating fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka 3-6 7-6 6-4 6-4. The Australian Open champion was seen by the doctor during the match and faded after a strong start as Federer's supreme ground strokes began to find their range. Federer, a seven-time Wimbledon champion, said he was pleased to be in the mix after a disappointing 2013 tournament when he was beaten in the second round by Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky. ""I'm just really pleased I'm back strong here at Wimbledon,"" he told reporters. ""Last year I didn't even come close so I was very deflated."" He will face Milos Raonic in the other semifinal, after the No. 8 seed from Canada disposed of Rafa Nadal's conqueror, Nick Kyrgios, 6-7 6-2 6-4 7-6. Djokovic's game will be firmly tested against Dimitrov -- a man playing with confidence, style and a whole lot of swagger. Born in Haskovo, Bulgaria, Dimitrov trained at the same tennis academy in Spain as Murray, albeit not at the same time. The two are known to be friends off the court -- not that there was any sentimentality on show as Dimitrov wielded his racquet like a magician holds his wand. He began at a rapid pace and never allowed Murray to find a foothold from which he could launch a fightback. ""I'm very disappointed with the way I started. I felt that gave him confidence at the beginning. It's a lot easier to settle down when you're two sets up,"" Murray, the world No. 5, told the BBC. ""It wasn't a great day. I felt fine in the warm-up but got off to a bad start, which was the disappointing part. ""It wasn't good enough. There is time to come back, but I didn't take my opportunity in the second set. ""He played a very solid match, making few mistakes and a lot of returns. All the percentages were in his favor. I just wish I'd made it tougher for him."" A year ago, it was all so different. Murray, the man who had cried his way into the nation's hearts after his 2012 final defeat by Federer, dispatched Novak Djokovic in straight sets on to become the first British man to the win the singles title since Fred Perry in 1936. If the first week of his defense was anything to go by, the expectation was that Murray would reach the semifinal stage at the very least. He had cruised through his opening four rounds without dropping a set -- a complete contrast to his opponent Dimitrov, who had been forced to scrape and fight through a five-set contest in the third round with Ukraine's Alexander Dolgopolov. As those with British flags painted on their faces and draped in the Union Jack took their places on Centre Court, a Murray defeat was perhaps the last thing on their minds -- somewhere between a shortage of strawberries and a drought of Pimms. But after sharing the two opening games, their hero failed -- spectacularly. Dimitrov won five games in a row to take the first set in 25 minutes and leave those fervent fans in a state of shock. Those who have followed Murray at Wimbledon over the past few years are used to the rollercoaster nature of his campaigns. But that famous fighting spirit, that belligerence which makes his such a competitor, appeared to have deserted him. Even in the second set where he immediately broke back to level at 4-4 after losing his serve, the belief that Murray would then go on and level the match never materialized. Instead, it was Dimitrov who held his nerve in the tiebreak, winning it 7-4 to take a stranglehold on the tie -- one which he never looked like relinquishing. And so it proved. Showing little or no sign of being nervous or overawed by the occasion, Dimitrov broke not just Murray's serve -- he broke his spirit. There was an inevitability about the result and Dimitrov could celebrate when Murray placed his final shot into the net. ""I'm excited. It's never easy coming to play against Andy, especially with the home crowd,"" Dimitrov told the BBC. ""As soon as we were warming up, I said his game wasn't at the highest level, while at the same time I felt confident. The second-set tie-break was a key moment for me. ""This was one of those days where I was pretty steady throughout the whole match. It's a tough feeling when you know someone outside the court but then you come to play them in the match."" Dimitrov will now go onto face either last year's finalist Djokovic or Croatia's Marin Cilic in the next round. For those who celebrated Murray's victory last year -- well, they'll just be hoping they won't have to wait another 77 years for their next Wimbledon party.","Defending champion Andy Murray beaten by Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov .

"(CNN) -- Save the panda! Sure: how could the world do without such cute, endangered creatures? And tigers. Never mind that the adult of the species will happily rip your head off and lick its lips afterward, can you think of a better mascot for a creature threatened with extinction than those adorable, fluffy feline cubs? (Miaow!) Trouble is, goofy humans that we are, we tend to equate (what we consider) beauty with importance in the ecological scheme of things. In fact, nature's many repugnant, repulsive -- or just very small -- denizens can be just as important for the environment's health. The monkey with the hideous schnoz .

To the end of saving ugly endangered creatures, reports Wanderlust travel magazine, the Society is in search of a mascot -- something nice and slimy, like the jumping slug, or just malformed-looking and squat, like the New Zealand kakapo parrot. Introducing the hagfish . The group has garnered public nominations for those neglected organisms -- also including the hagfish, the purple pig-nosed frog and the giant Palouse earthworm -- that make us shudder, but that no doubt consider each other ethereally beautiful after a pint of slime or two.

"(CNN) -- Many wealthy, successful Americans regale us with stories of how they worked their rears off to get to where they are. Living proof, they say, that hard work can propel you to heights you cannot imagine. I don't doubt their stories; I worked hard too. But along with that hard work came something no one seems to acknowledge -- luck. Understandable, for luck says nothing about your smarts or talent or beauty. Luck is a happy accident. Seize it and make it work for you and nine times out of 10, you're golden. I'm not saying only luck brings success. Hard work is necessary too, but it is not sufficient. Did I work harder or think better than hundreds of thousands of others? I would love to say yes, but although I tried to outsmart my competitors, I know I would not be sitting at CNN without Lady Luck on my side. I know. I hear you. ""You make your own luck!"" Yes, you can, but it was a lot easier for me to ""make my own luck"" than it was -- is -- for many others . Bear with me. I grew up decidedly middle-class. My father was a steelworker, my mother an office manager and occasional bookkeeper. Neither parent attended college, but they managed to carve out a comfortable life for me, my brothers and sister. There was no money to set aside for college, but I knew my parents expected me to be a college graduate. Lucky me? Yes. Because my father, a high school graduate, was able to find a well-paying job. Back in the day, manufacturing jobs were plentiful, and they paid well, as did many traditional middle-class jobs. Today, not so much. An article in The New York Times on September 18, 1987, reported the average wage for an automaker was $13.50 an hour. In today's dollars, that's $28.47. (Annual inflation over this period averaged 2.8%.) More than two decades later, thanks to the 2008 recession and the erosion of union power, entry-level unionized autoworkers were paid between $14 and $17 an hour, while veteran workers earned between $28 and $38 an hour. So, I was lucky to be born to parents who could afford to feed me, clothe me, house me and, as an added bonus, expect me to make something of myself. Also, my mother was not an alcoholic, and my father was not an ex-con. We lived in a variety of middle-class neighborhoods -- some middle, some lower -- but there were no drug dealers on the corner, no gunshots in the street. There were no metal detectors at the doors or armed security guards patrolling the halls of any of the schools I attended. I did work hard to get through college, though. I worked two jobs for minimum wage -- one in a cafeteria and another at SeaWorld -- to pay my way through school. In addition to those jobs, I interned at WAKR in Akron, Ohio, for free and attended night classes to finish my degree. Ah, you say -- finally -- proof that if you work hard enough you will escape that minimum-wage job and achieve your goals. Except luck played a part here too. According to the College Board, there was little to no growth in college prices in the 1970s. College costs actually just started to rise in 1980, the year I entered Kent State University. I just missed the massive sticker shock students face today. Since I went to school, college costs have risen at twice and sometimes three times the Consumer Price Index. Still, I was happy to apply and accept government grants and loans to help pay the bills. That internship in Akron paid off too. WAKR-TV hired me. I made minimum wage in my first professional job, but I was not a single mother and did not have to care for aging or sick relatives. I just had to worry about myself. Luckily, a news director in Cleveland named Ron Bilek offered to mentor me and eventually hired me in Columbus, Ohio. Four jobs later, I was off and running for CNN. So yes, I worked hard. I put in long hours. But millions of others have as well. Luck, by definition, means a chance happening of fortunate events. And I would argue that far too few middle-class Americans are now experiencing the same ""happening of fortunate events"" that I did. The majority of middle-class people are struggling not because they don't work as hard as the most successful Americans, but because it takes more than sweat to succeed and the odds are tougher in 2014. It's time for our leaders to help people turn their luck around. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carol Costello.","Carol Costello: Those who succeed often emphasize the power of their hard work .

"London (CNN) -- UK police arrested four people Tuesday on suspicion of traveling to Syria or supporting the fighting there. Two men, ages 29 and 18, and a 21-year-old woman were arrested in Manchester, northwest England, on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, Greater Manchester Police said. A fourth person, a 29-year-old man, was arrested in Oxford on the same charge, a police statement said. All four are now being questioned by counterterror officers in Manchester. Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole, head of the counterterror unit, said there was no imminent threat to anyone in Manchester or Britain. ""The operation has been running since autumn 2013, since we first became aware of a number of individuals traveling from the northwest to the battlefields of Syria,"" he said. Mole said even those who travel to the region with the intention of providing humanitarian aid are putting themselves in danger. ""We know that some have already lost their lives or been detained by the regime and badly treated,"" he said. ""There are serious concerns that anyone traveling to Syria, whether for humanitarian reasons or because of a desire to support the Syrian opposition, may be targeted by extremist groups who want to recruit them. This could have serious repercussions for the safety of the individual concerned."" Syria's civil war will this month have dragged on for three painful years. More than 100,000 people have died and more than 680,000 others have been wounded, the United Nations has said. At least 6.5 million have been internally displaced and nearly 2.5 million people have fled to other countries.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tokyo has overtaken Luanda, Angola, as the world's most expensive city for overseas staff after the cost of imported goods rose in the wake of last year's earthquake. An annual cost of living report, released Tuesday by U.S. consulting firm Mercer, showed several Japanese cities had moved up in the rankings after the yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Two other Japanese cities rank in the top ten: Osaka comes in third with Nagoya in 10th place. Elsewhere, Luanda drops to second, Moscow is forth, with Geneva in fifth place. Researchers looked at 214 cities around the world, analyzing data from March 2011 to March 2012. ""We compare the cost of over 200 items in each location, including housing, transport, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment,"" senior researcher Nathalie Constantin-MÃ©tral said in a video on the company's website. The survey uses New York City, which dropped one spot to 33rd on the list, as their base city when evaluating foreign cities. As a result of the on-going European financial crisis, many cities across Europe fell in the rankings. London dropped seven spots to 25th this year, while Paris moved down 10 spots to No. 37. ""Countries badly hit by the Eurozone crisis, including Greece, Italy and Spain, have also experienced drops in rental accommodation prices,"" Constantin-MÃ©tral said in the report. In Italy, Milan dropped 13 spots, while Rome fell eight spots to No. 42. By contrast, cities in Asia and the Americas moved up as their currencies strengthened. The cost of housing remained the strongest indicator for the cost of living in all cities.","Tokyo moved up from No. 2 last year to become world's most expensive city .

"(CNN) -- Last week in McAlester, Oklahoma, the blinds were raised in a small, white, antiseptic room, and two small groups of people watched as Clayton Lockett was strapped to a gurney. A doctor examined Lockett's body for usable veins and then oversaw the administration of an untested drug cocktail that was supposed to dispatch the convicted murderer quickly and quietly. Instead, the blinds were lowered as the execution turned into more than 40 minutes of grimacing, writhing, teeth grinding and frantic phone calls. Then Lockett's heart finally seized, stopped beating, and his breath left his body. This is how we kill our most serious criminals in the 21st century. Or at least try to. So if this is justice, let's make it real. Let's make it open to the highest form of public transparency and scrutiny: Live TV. Here's why. Oklahoma's botched lethal injection marks new front in battle over executions . In the Middle Ages, the preferred method of executing prisoners was to draw and quarter, burn, boil alive and separate body parts of the condemned, exacting a measure of slow and painful torture before death. At some point in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, society decided that executing prisoners more quickly would be more ""humane."" The French invented the guillotine, the Shah of Persia introduced throat cutting, or would tie a prisoner to a cannon and blow him apart, and the British developed the ""long drop"" method of hanging to snap the neck and sever the spine of the executed. In 1936, the last public execution in the United States was held in Owensboro, Kentucky. It was witnessed by more than 20,000 people, including hundreds of reporters. From that point forward, states decided that executions needed to be private affairs, held in small rooms and witnessed only by agents of the state, lawyers, family members of the victim and a handful of journalists. In the years since Owensboro, the states -- with the approval of the U.S. Supreme Court -- have refined their definition of humane executions by utilizing firing squads, electric chairs and gas chambers. The states further sanitized the execution process by developing the lethal injection method, turning it into a medical procedure complete with operating table, intravenous injections and considerable ethical questions for doctors and pharmaceutical companies who have sworn to ""do no harm."" None of these refinements in execution technology has anything to do with ""humane"" methods. There is no real measurement for how painful a death prisoners suffer when they are being hanged, shot, gassed or electrocuted, no matter how quickly they die. Lethal injection simply gives us greater psychological distance from killing another human being, making it feel more like a doctor-prescribed procedure than an execution. Michael Wilson, another death row inmate in Oklahoma, was killed in January in the same chamber, uttering his final words, ""I feel my whole body burning."" And while many have used the word ""botched"" to describe Lockett's execution, it wasn't botched at all. That's just how messy, complicated and disturbing it is to kill another human being. What is missing from the death penalty debate is that there is no humane way to kill another person. We consider taking a victim's life during a crime to be cruel and unusual, yet we neatly sidestep this same Eighth Amendment standard with prisoners by attempting to conduct a quick and ""painless"" execution. President Barack Obama has called for a Department of Justice investigation into the death penalty following Lockett's execution. ""In the application of the death penalty in this country, we have seen significant problems -- racial bias, uneven application of the death penalty, you know, situations in which there were individuals on death row who later on were discovered to have been innocent because of exculpatory evidence,"" Obama said. ""And all these, I think, do raise significant questions about how the death penalty is being applied."" But while I applaud the President's actions, the question is not how the death penalty is applied, but whether it should be applied at all. It is natural to be both horrified and angered at the senseless and brutal killings committed by a convicted murderer. It is natural to want revenge -- to visit the pain we imagine the victim suffered onto his or her perpetrator. But there is a difference between punishment and revenge, no matter how we dress it up with legislation and legal procedures. We have built a system of laws to raise us above those we judge. In this system we have built, we must be honest and ask ourselves, ""Is vengeance justice?"" If we want truly to codify revenge, let's not pretend. Let's admit that we are willing to live with the byproducts of our retribution. Let's admit that we are willing to kill a number of innocent people. Let's admit that it is fine to execute a disproportionate number of minorities. And let's admit that we want condemned murderers to suffer like they made their victims suffer. Let's not dress the execution up as a medical procedure. And by all means, let's televise it. Let's watch them pump the drugs into a condemned man or woman, strapped to a gurney. Let's hear their last words. Let's watch them writhe and twitch, or listen as they groan and their last breath quietly leaves their body. Let's watch them die. Let us see what we are really choosing when we vote to implement the death penalty in our state. Many Americans support the death penalty in principle. But, as a juror in a capital case, it is different when you look across that courtroom and stare into the eyes of the accused. At that point it is real, and not just a principle. You will decide whether that person dies. Let's make the death penalty real. Let's open the blinds and stare into the eyes of those we condemn to death. Let's be honest about what the death penalty really is. And then we can choose what kind of society we really want to be.

"(CNN) -- A Supreme Court justice Thursday night suggested the legality of National Security Agency activities could be decided by the court. Three days after Pulitzers were awarded to newspapers that revealed the NSA's surveillance activities, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg deflected a question about Edward Snowden, who leaked NSA data. When asked, ""Do you believe that Snowden is a whistleblower or a traitor?"" Ginsburg, who was joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, told an audience at the National Press Club in Washington that she could not say. ""It's also possible, is it not,"" she said, ""that the question you raise could come before the court. And we are not at liberty to preview."" If Snowden is extradited to the United States and charged with federal crimes for his leaks, his case could come before the court. In June of 2013, The Guardian and The Washington Post published reports that revealed the NSA's bulk collection of U.S. citizens' phone records and other clandestine surveillance activities. That sparked a firestorm concerning Fourth Amendment protections for U.S. citizens from ""unreasonable searches and seizures"" and the issue of where that protection weighs in the balance between national security and personal privacy. On Thursday, the two justices were asked whether The Post deserved the highest accolade in journalism, a gold medal for public service administered by Columbia University in New York City for nearly 100 years. Obama, Congress working on changes to NSA . Scalia said he had ""no idea"" why The Post was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. In a Washingtonian's slight at a newspaper that's sometimes seen as liberal, Scalia said, ""I don't read The Post."" ""So I have no idea what they got the prize for,"" he said, prompting knowing laughter from the press club. Ginsburg said that it's ""a question that the journalists in this audience are much better equipped to answer than I am."" Also on Thursday, Snowden, who is in Russia, asked Russian President Vladimir Putin about surveillance activities in his country. In an annual question-and-answer program broadcast on state television, Putin held court for nearly four hours. ""Does Russia intercept, store, analyze in any way the communications of individuals?"" Snowden asked him in a phone call. ""We do not allow ourselves to do this. And, we will never allow this. We do not have the money or the means to do that,"" answered Putin. ""The most important thing is we have a special service that's thankfully under strict state control."" In March of last year, U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, asked a similar question of the director of national intelligence. ""Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?"" he asked James R. Clapper. Clapper responded, ""No, sir ... not wittingly."" He later clarified his remarks. On Russian TV, Snowden asks Putin about Moscow surveillance . Stories about NSA surveillance, Snowden leaks win Pulitzers for two news groups .

"(CNN) -- Replacing the internal organs of Kendrick Johnson -- the south Georgia teen found dead in his high school gym a year ago -- with newspaper is not a ""best practice"" for any mortician, but it's not illegal either, a state board wrote Thursday. ""Legislation or regulation does not address the practice or prohibit funeral professionals from filling a cavity with newspaper,"" the Georgia Board of Funeral Service said in a letter addressed to Johnson's mother. ""Therefore, the practice ... is not a violation of the law."" This finding yielded few answers for Johnson's family, including where his organs actually ended up. On that matter, the board said only that it couldn't determine if ""the organs were transferred to the funeral (home) with the body."" Neither the funeral home nor Johnson's family immediately responded Thursday to CNN's request for comment on the state finding. The family didn't even know the late teen's brain, heart, lungs, liver and other viscera were missing until the middle of last year, when an autopsy they'd requested was conducted June 15 by Dr. William R. Anderson with Forensic Dimensions in Heathrow, Florida. This was actually a second autopsy on the three-sport athlete after he was found dead January 11, 2013, in a rolled-up gym mat inside Lowndes County High School in Valdosta, Georgia. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation handled the first one, then ruled the death accidental. And the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office, while not commenting on every twist and turn in the case, has repeatedly stood by its original determination that Johnson died by accident after getting caught up reaching for his shoe. CNN examined the 522-page police file and found that investigators spoke to 111 people, including 18 on the day Johnson's body was found. ""It was not a rash decision that was leapt to,"" Lt. Stryde Jones told CNN in May, the day after his investigators closed their case. ""We've drawn this out, done a thorough investigation, and we think we've covered all bases."" But the disbelieving Johnson family pushed in court, leading to a judge's decision May 1 to grant their request to exhume their son's body for an independent autopsy at their expense. Anderson determined in that second autopsy that Johnson suffered blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues, ""consistent with inflicted injury,"" seemingly defying the authorities ruling it was accidental. It's what he didn't find -- the late teen's internal organs -- that prompted his family to formally ask the state to investigate the handling of their son's body. CNN was the first to report the development in October. That complaint alleged that Harrington Funeral Home mishandled the body and specifically accuses director Antonio Harrington of helping obscure the teen's cause of death. Specifically, it alleged that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said it replaced all of the organs after its autopsy. Harrington initially said ""one or two organs might be missing,"" according to the complaint. But in an October 4 letter to the family's attorney, C.B. King Jr., the funeral home director said the organs had been ""destroyed"" and ""discarded ... before the body was sent back to Valdosta,"" where the funeral home took custody of the body. However, the funeral home's attorney, Roy Copeland, told CNN in October that coroner Bill Watson has already called the ""accusations and innuendo regarding Mr. Harrington's involvement in the disposition of young Mr. Johnson's internal organs ... baseless."" According to ""The Principles and Practices of Embalming"" -- a sentence of which was included in Copeland's October letter to CNN -- when organs are removed in an autopsy, the person handling the body should dry the cavity, ""dusting it with hardening compound or embalming powder and then filling it with dry, clean sawdust or cotton mixed with a small quantity of hardening compound or embalming powder."" Copeland conceded at a November interview that newspaper is not listed as an option in this process, but he added, ""nor is it precluded as one type of foreign substance that may be introduced into a body for purposes of building it up for public display."" In fact, the Georgia Board of Funeral Service said in its letter Thursday that ""filling a body cavity is a necessary preparation to present a deceased body for public viewing."" The state agency also added there are products available to do this ""that are more acceptable than newspaper,"" which it notes was relatively common in the past. ""The Board may consider appropriate regulations concerning this issue in the near future,"" it wrote about the practice of filling a body cavity with newspaper. So what can the Johnson family do now? For starters, they can take solace in the fact that federal authorities are investigating their son's death. To this point, the FBI seized the original hard drives from the Lowndes High surveillance system last month, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. And the FBI has been in South Georgia conducting interviews, including an almost three-hour sitdown with the Johnsons in the city of Thomasville. And the state funeral board's finding that funeral home staff didn't commit a crime, and its decision to close its case, doesn't mean the family can't go after them in court. The state funeral board told them in its letter Thursday: ""You may wish to consult with your personal attorney or a court of appropriate jurisdiction to determine what civil remedies may be available to you.""","NEW: The state board says family ""may wish to consult"" a lawyer or court .

"(CNN) -- As Iraqi police and troops cast ballots early in the country's first parliamentary elections since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. forces, 32 people were killed in attacks across the country on Monday. The shootings and explosions targeting elections centers wounded 92 people, police and health officials in Baghdad and several provinces told CNN. In several instances, suicide bombers detonated explosives at polling centers as security forces waited in line to vote. Iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months, often pitting Sunnis -- a minority in Iraq -- against Shiite Muslims, who came to dominate the government after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. Violence has escalated over the past year. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with more than 8,800 people killed, most of them civilians. Police and military have two days to cast votes before the rest of the country's registered voters cast their ballots in parliamentary elections Wednesday. Some 277 political entities across Iraq will compete for 328 seats of the Iraqi Council of Representatives, the country's parliament. There are 9,032 candidates. ""These elections mark an important milestone in Iraq's democratic transition and can contribute to greater peace and stability in the country,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's office said in a statement. Ban condemned the wave of violence and terrorist attacks and urged leaders to try to ensure all Iraqi men and women can take part in the elections.","Attacks targeting polling centers kill 32 people and wound 92 others, officials say .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan said Thursday it plans to lift some sanctions on North Korea after the two countries held talks about Japanese citizens abducted by the North Korean regime decades ago. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that after the negotiations between diplomats from the two sides this week, North Korea has agreed to set up an investigation into the abduction cases. ""Based on the principle to reward an action with an action, I would like to lift a part of sanctions that Japan has taken,"" he told reporters. Abe added that such a move would be ""only a start,"" and that he would aim for a ""complete resolution"" of the issue. According to the Japanese government, North Korean operatives kidnapped at least 17 Japanese citizens in the late 1970s and early 1980s, possibly dozens more. In 2002, North Korea admitted to the kidnappings for the first time but allowed only five abduction victims to return home to Japan. Information on the remaining 12 was sketchy at best. Some were kidnapped alone, while walking to and from school. Others were taken in pairs while out on dates, including a couple snatched from the beach after walking to see the sunset. Japan is expected to lift some of its unilateral sanctions on North Korea, but to keep to multilateral ones in line with U.N. resolutions. Japan's unilateral sanctions include entry restrictions on North Korean citizens, limits on North Korean ships in Japanese ports and a requirement that money sent to North Korea be reported. The easing of the sanctions will coincide with North Korea's establishment of an investigation committee into the abductions, which is likely to happen Friday, said Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga. Abe is expected to meet with his National Security Council on Thursday to decide which sanctions to lift. The families of the kidnapped Japanese citizens, meanwhile, are waiting to see whether the diplomatic maneuvers will bring them any answers about what happened to their missing relatives. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

"(CNN) -- Check your ground beef before you grill this Memorial Day weekend. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service says stores in at least 15 states may have received beef contaminated with E. coli O157:H7. The service announced this week that 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled because they could be contaminated. The federal agency has since named businesses that may have received the tainted products. Stores that may be affected include: . • Gordon Food Service Marketplace stores in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin . • Giorgio's Italian Delicatessen in Stuart, Florida . • Surf N Turf Market in Sebring, Florida . • Blairsville Seafood Market in Blairsville, Georgia . • Butcher Block Plus in Decatur, Illinois . • M Sixty Six General Store in Orleans, Michigan . • Harvest Moon Co-op in Long Lake, Minnesota . • Foscoe Country Corner in Boone, North Carolina . • Bronson's Super Valu in Beulah, North Dakota . • Jason's Super Foods in New Town, North Dakota . • Buchtel Food Mart in Buchtel, Ohio . • Chunky Foods in Girard, Ohio . • Ian's Market in Englewood, Tennessee . • Quick Stop in Erwin, Tennessee . • Virginia Market in Maynardville, Tennessee . • Barger Foods in Nashville, Tennessee . • Stanley Valley Market in Surgoinsville, Tennessee . • Parkway Tobacco Express in Appomattox, Virginia . • Kelley's Market in Eagle Rock, Virginia . • Virginia Heights Travel Store in Wytheville, Virginia . What government tests found in your meat . A representative for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the meat is being removed from store shelves. But consumers should return or throw out meat that has the code EST.2574B and a production date between March 31 and April 18, 2014. The ground beef is sold under a variety of labels, according to the USDA, but comes from Wolverine Packing Co. in Detroit. ""While none of the Wolverine Packing product has tested positive for the pathogen implicated in this outbreak, the company felt it was prudent to take this voluntary recall action in response to the illnesses and initial outbreak investigation findings,"" said Chuck Sanger, a spokesman for Wolverine Packing. Eleven people across four states are suspected to have been sickened by the product, according to the USDA, which learned about the first such illnesses on May 8. Ten of those people were sickened after eating at restaurants that received contaminated meat. But federal officials say regulations prohibit them from naming those restaurants. ""People who were exposed were already exposed, so it doesn't help the public to tell them now that a certain restaurant was associated with these illnesses,"" said David Goldman, assistant administrator for the Office of Public Health Science at the USDA. ""Our job really is to identify product that may still be available."" According to information officials received from the packing company, he said, the meat went to many states. ""The number changes. Yesterday, it was on the order of nearly 40 states, but we don't -- that number changes. That's part of the process, too, is to identify where the food -- the meat in this case -- was actually distributed,"" Goldman said. The recall was categorized by the Food Safety and Inspection Service as Class I: a health hazard situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death. E. coli is a large group of bacteria that live in the intestines of people and animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Certain strains cause gastrointestinal illness in humans, with symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. An estimated 265,000 infections occur in the United States each year, the CDC says. People usually get sick three to four days after ingesting the bacteria and recover on their own. Young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people who have weakened immune systems (like cancer or HIV patients) are at greater risk for severe illness and death. The best way to avoid getting sick is by washing hands frequently when preparing food and avoiding cross-contamination by washing cutting boards, counters and utensils with hot, soapy water. Properly washing hands after using the bathroom and after coming into contact with animals or being in their environments -- anywhere there may be traces of feces -- also helps. Cooking meats thoroughly to at least 160°F or 70˚C kills the bacteria and prevents infection as well. Using a meat thermometer will most accurately help you determine that the food is thoroughly cooked. Eatocracy: Don't get sick from your picnic .

"(CNN) -- I saw Brad Pitt in ""Se7en"" and saw Fellini's ""8Â½."" I saw Daniel Day-Lewis do ""Nine"" and why Bo Derek was a ""10."" I saw the 1919 White Sox sell out baseball in ""Eight Men Out"" and the 1961 Yankees belt out baseballs in ""61*. The one movie I wrote in my mind a hundred times and on paper nine or 10 times, though, was ""42."" Of course, it wasn't called that 20-odd years ago when I was under contract to be the Jackie Robinson biopic's screenwriter. And I have zero to do with the ""42"" -- named for Robinson's uniform number -- that will slide into a theater somewhere near you on Friday. It nonetheless will leave me a little choked up. Dorothy Parker once described Hollywood as the one place where you can ""die from encouragement."" Well, once upon a time, I was encouraged to bring Robinson's life story to the screen, only to be discouraged by the way reel life turns out. The buzz on ""42"" is strong. Jackie's widow, Rachel Robinson, 90, was guest of honor at a recent White House showing where Michelle Robinson Obama said, ""We think everybody in this country needs to watch this movie."" A long overdue film, ""42"" features an up-and-comer, Chadwick Boseman, as the infielder who changed the face of baseball, and Harrison Ford, of all people, as the insider who held open the door to the big leagues. Indiana Jones found a few fake treasures in his day, but Branch Rickey's unveiling of Jackie Robinson was a true discovery for the ages. I spent many hours with Rachel Robinson cramming to learn details of the life they shared. I went to her family's foundation in New York to pore over documents and correspondence. I tapped away on the West Coast on a clunky early '90s computer, not knowing that this cinematic masterpiece I was eager to deliver was doomed. Who was I to do Jackie's story (and hers) justice? Oh, no one. I so wanted to hit it out of the park for her. When I failed, well, don't we all? It began in the late '80s. It had occurred to me that a mighty figure of American sport and African-American culture had been insufficiently immortalized on film. The man I mean is, naturally -- well, not Jackie Robinson, but an equally monumental gent. Joe Louis. Apart from being a heavyweight champ, Louis was a model citizen, a military vet and a true difference-maker when too many men and women were still struggling to become color-blind. A script called ""Brown Bomber"" was born. It was co-written by myself and a Detroit journalist friend, Jon Pepper, as a specific look at a 1930s span when Louis lost to the popular Max Schmeling to whites' delight, only to transform into a red-white-and-blue hero in their eyes, triumphing in the rematch against a German example of so-called white supremacy. We fought to get it made. Producers and options came and went. Notes given. Rewrites written. During which time we discover what quite a few of Hollywood's movers and shakers want more and more of, beyond all else. They want more Max. To them, it isn't the story of a man. It is the story of two men. A black man and, hey, guess what, a white man. Think of who we could cast! ""Wouldn't it be great,"" a producer babbled at one point, ""if we could get Arnold Schwarzenegger for this?"" ""For what?"" I ask. ""For Max."" ""I have a couple of questions,"" I reply. ""Why would a movie star play a guy who ends the movie by getting his ass kicked? And how do we explain why Max is built like Mr. Universe?"" With logic that makes me laugh to this day, he says: ""Hey, if you can get Schwarzenegger, you get Schwarzenegger. The other stuff will work itself out."" A good thing does happen, though. Someone familiar with our script slips a copy to Rachel Robinson, in the hope she will give her blessings to Pepper and me taking a crack at Mr. and Mrs. Robinson's remarkable tale. We are told who the producer will be -- he has a few noteworthy credits -- and a deal is cut. Lorimar is backing the movie, ostensibly to air on HBO. A meeting is held in a packed HBO conference room. Rachel expresses reservations -- it does not escape her eye that there is no non-Caucasian in the room -- but life is short and she is willing to give it a shot. ""The Jackie Robinson Story"" is under way. At first, we keep the title of the 1950 film, in which the title role was played by the man himself. In 1990, TNT airs one called ""The Court-Martial of Jackie Robinson,"" based on an experience in the U.S. Army. I remember Rachel being pleased by Andre Braugher's portrayal of Jack. (Note: I have never heard Rachel call her husband by any name but ""Jack."") It is 1991. I have a full-time job -- L.A. sportswriter -- which I have made clear must come first. I spend all morning and afternoon in New York at the Jackie Robinson Foundation, conferring with Rachel and doing research. I catch a 5 p.m. flight to Pittsburgh for a baseball playoff game, cover it, catch a dawn plane to New York, repeat the previous day. I nearly collapse at 5 as I run to grab a cab. I hear my producer tell my partner: ""He's not putting in enough time on this!"" Nothing is ever enough. The writers are never right. No draft is acceptable. The producer wants it one way. Rachel wants it a different way. He wants the baseball years. She wants the life beyond baseball. We write it both ways. Both hate it both ways. We are fired. My co-writer tells me. No one else -- not the producer, not Rachel, not anyone from the studio, not our agent -- ever speaks to me again. Worse, the film is killed. Cut to 1994. I read in Bill Rhoden's column in The New York Times that director Spike Lee is teaming up with Rachel Robinson to do a Jackie movie. Hey, who better? I had long thought Lee to be the right man to do the right thing by 42. Rhoden writes that documentarian Ken Burns was to do a film, but neglected to consult Rachel first. She is quoted: ""I really felt, and I still feel, that a black man can understand another black man and all the nuances of his life better than anyone else can."" I do not disagree. Cut to 1997. I read a story on how Spike Lee's option has expired. A quote from Rachel: ""He couldn't put all the pieces together -- the studios, the funds, the star, the script. It's not the first time the project has been aborted. I've been trying to get a movie done for the past 15 years and haven't succeeded. But I won't give up."" Cut to 2013. That's right, that's how long it took. Rachel, you made it. I know writer-director Brian Helgeland made it and Chadwick Boseman made it and Harrison Ford made it, but you made it. You persevered. You endured. You have your whole life. So did Jack. I give it thumbs-up and, hey, I haven't even seen it.","""42"" is a new movie about Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in baseball .

"(CNN) -- A roadside bomb killed 11 people in Afghanistan, including three election workers, authorities said Sunday. The blast occurred in Samangan province late Saturday night after polls closed. A mini bus carrying a group from a polling center to their homes hit a roadside bomb, said Sediqullah Aizizi , a spokesman for the provincial governor. The victims had just finished the counting and other work at the polling center when the blast occurred, he said. Before the roadside bomb, violence marred Saturday's runoff between former Foreign Affairs Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani. The Afghan Interior Ministry said 46 people were killed on election day, including civilian and security forces.

"New York City (CNN) -- New York Fashion Week concluded yesterday, and the trendy, well-heeled set can finally rest their aching feet -- at least for the flight across the pond to London, Paris and Milan to wash, rinse and repeat it all over again. With the debut of more than 100 spring 2014 collections over the course of seven days, it's ambitious to declare a definitive motif, but there were certainly a number of recurring looks that achieved majority rule. Comfortable, wispy, feminine and monochromatic are just a few ways to describe the spring 2014 collections that were showcased at events in Lincoln Center and throughout the city. CNN was on the ground to document the looks that will put a spring in your step come next year. Interactive: What's trending at Fashion Week . Participating designers ran the gamut, from the powerhouses that showed on the final day like Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs to up-and-comers Creatures of the Wind and Alon Livne. Also making a splash were street-style favorites like Sachin + Babi, Sass & Bide, Proenza Schouler and The Row, started by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Prior to the shows, we caught up with fashion forecaster WGSN and Elle Magazine's fashion news director Anne Slowey to place their bets on what consumers will see in stores in six months -- and their predictions were, collectively, on the button. Casting the outcast at Fashion Week . ""I suspect we will see a continuation of resort (wear) -- big florals, art-inspired prints, offbeat pastel combinations and architecturally minded separates and sportswear-inspired ideas,"" Slowey said, prior to the whirlwind week. Sheila Aimette of fashion forecaster WGSN agreed that we should keep an eye out for bold prints and patterns -- florals, plaids, etc. -- meanwhile the silhouettes would remain sleek and architectural. Designers also favored the bare midriffs -- crop top until you drop, if you will -- as well as cut-outs and sheer fabrics to reveal some skin amid more ladylike pieces, like below-the-knee hemlines. The fine line between lingerie and outwear . Slowey's resort-wear prediction proved prescient: Tommy Hilfiger took attendees to Southern California; he even experimented with neoprene and constructed waistbands in some of his skirts and shirts, which looked like peeled down wetsuits. The getaway theme also resonated in the Capri-inspired, lemon grove patterns of Kate Spade and tropical flower-print dresses and straw fedoras of Tracy Reese's Havana nights-themed collection. Also well-represented: Short suits; slip dresses and culottes. Think classic Daisy Buchanan with a little boudoir flare. Making an unlikely and comfortable comeback is the Birkenstock sandal, offering a bit of 1990s nostalgia for the collections of Trina Turk and Rachel Zoe, as well as a new collaboration between the shoemaker and J. Crew. Yet, among all this, a mod black-and-white palette reigned supreme. Ralph Lauren opened up with a monochromatic color scheme before transitioning into bright Kelly green, blue, orange and yellow gowns; Rag & Bone, Victoria Beckham, Cushnie et Ochs and Altuzarra also stayed minimalist in hue for most of their collections. As for the hair, it was matted down and sleek in most shows, while the makeup was understated and shimmering -- orange lipstick added a common pop of color at many shows. What wasn't understated was the showmanship: From the rose-scented room of Prabal Gurung to the models at Opening Ceremony who showed off clothes amid luxury cars. At Desigual, models cheekily walked and danced down the runway with smiles and peace sign gestures; and at Jen Kao, several models were even joined down the runway by similarly-coiffed Afghan hounds. Meanwhile, Thom Browne went full-on ""Bride of Frankenstein"" with corseted couture pieces paired with smeared red lipstick and teased out gray wigs.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama invited Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear to this year's State of the Union address where he praised the Democrat for aggressively carrying out the Affordable Care Act. ""He is like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth's families,"" Obama said about Beshear, who boasts that more than 420,000 people have signed up for his state's version of the controversial federal health law championed by Obama. Although he's with the President on Obamacare, Beshear has turned from Democrats on same-sex marriage, saying he would appeal a federal court ruling overturning the Kentucky ban. Beshear argues that traditional marriage leads to procreation and a stable economy, and he's challenging the decision ""so that the matter is fully before"" the federal appeals court. His position swims against same-sex marriage tide. States continue to legalize it and courts continue to strike down bans where it isn't. It's growing more likely that it will wind up before the Supreme Court, as early as the next term. Even Republican governors, including Pennsylvania's Tom Corbett and New Jersey's Chris Christie, decided to not appeal court decisions striking down similar laws. Beshear's short statement is a continuation of one he issued in March after his attorney general, fellow Democrat Jack Conway, decided not to push the issue. At the time he said he wanted to challenge same-sex proponents to ultimately settle the issue and prevent ""legal chaos."" In Beshear's effort through the courts to bring ""certainty and finality"" to the issue, he appears to oppose same-sex marriage by challenging the ruling as governor without having to take a personal stance. It's a politically skillful move for a popular Democratic governor in an increasingly Republican state. While Kentucky has a Democratic governor, its two senators are Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul. The state's opinion of national Democrats is low, as Obama received a paltry percentage of the vote - only 38% - in 2012. Stephen Voss, a University of Kentucky political science professor, said Beshear's decision is in accordance with the politics of the state. ""He's acting like a large chunk of the voters,"" Voss said. The state is one of the last bastions of the dying breed of southern Democrats who are socially conservative and fiscally more liberal. The most recent polling in Kentucky on the issue found that 55% of people oppose same-sex marriage, a stark difference compared to the 38% against it nationally. Phillip Bailey, political editor at Kentucky Public Radio's WFPL in Louisville, said the national Democratic Party is far more liberal than the Kentucky Democratic Party. ""The kryptonite for a moderate Democrat with an increasingly liberal party in a conservative state is social issues,"" Bailey said. In an address to the state's General Assembly during his re-election campaign in 2011, Beshear stood before the lawmakers, rose his voice, pointed his finger and told Obama to ""Get off our backs!"" when it comes to coal plant regulations. Bailey said Beshear's politics are masterful. ""I don't think there's anyone else who has been able to yell at the President on TV and then go to Washington and be in the front row of the State of the Union and get praise from the President,"" he said. ""That shows the mastery of Beshear to walk that line."" Beshear is term-limited and will be out in less than two years. But political roots run deep and his legacy continues after 2015 as his son, Andy Beshear, has announced a run for statewide office. Andy Beshear hopes to succeed Conway, who is running for governor, as attorney general. The younger Beshear is likely to be up against a a conservative Democrat in the primary and even more conservative Republican in the general election. ""He's got to worry about the political viability of the Beshear brand,"" Voss said. Same-sex marriage put on hold in Indiana by federal appeals court .

"(CNN) -- A British navy ship abandoned and lost in Canadian Arctic waters since the mid-19th century has been found in relatively good shape at the bottom of a bay, the Canadian government says. Parks Canada has released images of the HMS Investigator, found late last month at the bottom of Mercy Bay. The bay is located in the Northwest Territories' Aulavik National Park. The discovery is part of two Canadian archaeological missions to locate the Investigator and two other ships. ""This is definitely of the utmost importance,"" said Marc-Andre Bernier, Parks Canada's head of underwater archaeology. ""The ship is standing upright in very good condition,"" he told CNN. ""This is the first ship to sail the last leg of the Northwest Passage,"" the Arctic sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. A first analysis of images ""indicate that the structure of the ship lies on the bottom in relatively shallow water and is in good condition, particularly considering the depth,"" said the agency, which manages the country's parks and protects the country's ""natural and cultural heritage."" ""The bottom of the vessel appears buried in sediment, and the structure rises to the upper deck, but the rigging and the bulwarks (side walls above the upper deck) have collapsed, likely damaged by the ice."" Archaeologists from Parks Canada are working to ""understand the extent of the site and the debris field"" and ""will try to evaluate what is left on the wreck, how well it is preserved, and what are the environmental conditions impacting the wreck,"" the agency said. The ship had been found by the Parks Canada crew ""in the first moments of the search,"" it said. The sea floor lies 33 feet below the surface at the site. ""Fortunately, part of the bay where the ship had been abandoned became free of ice and the search began,"" Parks Canada said. ""We planned to conduct the project at the end of July,"" Bernier said, ""because it was the best opportunity to have good weather and open water in Mercy Bay, according to our observations based on many years of experience in this national park."" Royal Navy Capt. Robert McClure led the 66-man HMS Investigator on an 1850 expedition through Arctic waters to rescue two other ships -- the HMS Erebus and the HMS Terror. Those vessels, led by explorer Sir John Franklin, were lost in the Arctic during an 1845 voyage to discover a northwest passage. The HMS Investigator became ""locked in ice"" and eventually had to be abandoned in 1853. It left equipment and provisions on the shore, a previously known cache, Bernier said. As part of its mission to find the Investigator, archaeologists wanted to document the land sites tied to the ship's mission. The crew found the grave sites of three crew members who died of scurvy. Bernier said the abandonment reverberated historically. The event ""had an impact on the Inuit community."" ""After the ship was abandoned, they came and harvested some of the ship's materials, such as iron and copper"" -- items that were previously unavailable to them, he said. Canada and Britain are ""working collaboratively"" on ""what to do with the site and its artifacts,"" Bernier said, noting that the find represents part of a common heritage. Bernier said McClure, an important figure in Canadian history, has been credited with the discovery of the Northwest Passage and was knighted for that. ""For the moment, we're still looking at options but there's no intention at present of raising the ship,"" he said of the complex and delicate site. A project to raise the ship would be very expensive, he said. ""We're going to find the best way to protect the site,"" he said. ""We want to tell this story to the biggest audience. It's part of world history."" In another project, a Parks Canada and the Canadian Hydrographic Service team will also be searching for the Erebus and the Terror beginning on August 10. The search would be located southeast of Mercy Bay in Nunavut territory.","A sunken British navy ship is recovered in Canada .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The legal troubles threatening to send Chris Brown to prison for several years began with the singer's arrest five years ago in the brutal attack on then-girlfriend Rihanna. Brown has spent almost all of the past six months either in rehab or jail. He's been locked up since he was booted from a court-ordered substance abuse and anger management program on March 14. Brown has two pending criminal cases, both stemming from his alleged inability to control his anger. Brown's D.C. assault case . Brown, 24, and his bodyguard, Christopher Hollosy, allegedly punched Parker Adams after a quick exchange of words on a sidewalk blocks from the White House last October. Brown was arrested on a felony assault charge, but it was reduced to a misdemeanor and he was released on bond the next day. The trial is set to begin Wednesday in D.C. Superior Court. The judge who presided over the separate trial of Brown's bodyguard was taken off of Brown's case Monday. D.C. Superior Judge Patricia Wynn said as she announced her guilty verdict for Hollosy that she believed the testimony of a limousine driver who said he saw Brown hit Adams and that Adams did not fight back. Replacing Wynn with Judge A. Franklin Burgess, a retired judge, gives Brown a fresh start with a judge who has not already given an opinion on the evidence against him. Brown's defense has been complicated by Hollosy's conviction, because the bodyguard's testimony could hurt his own appeal. Prosecutors are considering whether they will grant immunity to Hollosy for anything he says in Brown's trial. Brown's lawyer, Mark Geragos, says the bodyguard's testimony is crucial to Brown's defense. Hollosy did not take the stand in his own trial, but his lawyer indicated Hollosy would say that he hit Adams because Adams was trying to get on Brown's bus, and it was his job to protect his client. California probation revoked . A conviction in the Washington case would be trouble for Brown because of his probation for the felony assault conviction in Los Angeles. The judge overseeing that case has already ruled that the singer violated his probation by being arrested last October, but he is waiting until after the D.C. trial to decide whether the revocation will become final. The revocation decision will be made at a hearing after Brown returns to Los Angeles from Washington. Planes, chains and automobiles: Chris Brown's miserable trip to trial . If convicted in Washington, Brown faces another grueling ""Con Air"" trip. The U.S. Marshal's Service is committed to returning him to the Los Angeles jail through the U.S. Justice Department's notoriously slow and uncomfortable prisoner transport system. If Brown is acquitted in the Washington case, his lawyer will argue that he should be immediately released from jail and allowed to resume his probation. Even then, Brown must work at least three days a week on a road clean-up crew to complete more than 700 hours of community labor remaining on his sentence in the Rihanna assault.","NEW: Brown gets a new judge after bodyguard is found guilty .

"(CNN) -- Facebook privacy just got a little more private. Starting Thursday, new users of the site will have their privacy settings default to ""Friends,"" instead of ""Public,"" which had been the case for adults for the past several years. And in the coming weeks, returning users will be prompted to take a close look at their privacy settings and other account information when they log in. ""We want to do all we can to put power and control in people's hands,"" Facebook said in a post Thursday. ""This new tool is designed to help people make sure they are sharing with just the audience they want."" The shift addresses one of the major complaints privacy advocates have had with the social platform. While Facebook has long maintained that its privacy controls are robust, critics have argued they're hard for some users to understand. Unsavvy users may not realize they're broadcasting their thoughts to the world by default, some say. Thursday's news was greeted warmly by some. ""Facebook's new privacy policy is a laudable change,"" U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia said in a post on the site. ""As I said in the past, it should be up to the user to decide how much information they want to share with the public. Today's announcement is a step in the right direction for strengthening online privacy protections, and I urge other online companies to follow suit."" Under the change, first-time users will be asked specifically what they want their audience to be when they make their first post. If they don't respond, it defaults to friends only. The Privacy Checkup feature for existing users -- which comes with its own cuddly dinosaur mascot -- was announced last month but is being implemented now. It marks the latest in a series of privacy tweaks Facebook has made in recent months as it works to make users more comfortable about sharing their information on the site. Last month, Facebook rolled out the ability to log in ""anonymously,"" preventing other websites and third-party apps from collecting data about you.","New Facebook users will have privacy settings default to ""Friends""

"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- He's smashed world records and revolutionized running during his illustrious career. And yet the name of Filbert Bayi has almost been forgotten. The date was February 2, 1974 and the stage was the men's 1500-meter final at the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand. Leading from the start, Tanzanian Bayi continued at a blistering pace throughout the race to cross the finish line first in a race that's often described as the greatest middle distance event of all time. His record-breaking time? Three minutes and 32.2 seconds. It would take five more years for Great Britain's Sebastian Coe to break that achievement. Today, 40 years on, Bayi's phenomenal performance remains a Commonwealth record. ""I changed the system of running,"" Bayi tells CNN. ""In those years before I broke the record, most of the athletes were running in the group, waiting for the last 200 meters and sprint. ""I changed the whole system [and] ran from beginning to the end. Very few people appreciate that. Just because I didn't win a gold medal in the Olympic Games but still my [Commonwealth Games] record stays for 40 years."" Tanzania's most decorated athlete was born in the Rift Valley -- a region renowned for producing some of the world's best runners. He says the area's high altitude and farming lifestyle cultivate the skills required for long distance running. From cow herder to track superstar . ""My parents were farmers, cow herders. When I was a kid, I used to take care of the goats or cows,"" he explains. ""And up there in the bush, you do hunting, running with the dog, running with the animals and running with the cows and all that, I think, made me built me some stamina."" In 1961, at the age of six, Bayi started school. Its location was two miles away from where his family lived. ""So every morning I had to run to school, then I had to go back for lunch. Then I had to go for afternoon classes. So you can imagine I ran about eight miles a day. That made a lot of stamina in my body."" Through his years at primary school, Bayi continued to excel as an athlete immersing himself in competitions and working his way up to regional and then national competitions in the hopes of being like his idol, Kenya's two-time Olympic gold medalist Kip Keino. Bayi continued his training in the 1970s but he found training in a group a grueling endeavor, especially when he would get inadvertently caught on the spikes of other athletes' shoes. ""Your life is in danger when somebody spikes you. I thought the only way to avoid spiking was to run from the beginning in front of everybody,"" Bayi recalls. ""I think I caught some of the athletes with that because they thought I would get tired. ""They made a bad judgment. They said they'll get me next time but next time the same thing and I always say 'Follow me, catch me if you can.'"" Coaching Tanzania's future talent . These days Bayi tends to keep off the track and instead focuses his attention on a lifelong dream -- to run his own schools and nurture young sporting talent from his homeland. With the help of his wife, the former middle distance runner opened the first iteration of the ""Filbert Bayi School"" in a garage with just seven children in attendance. The school continued to grow and by 2004, it had developed into a large campus catering to 1,300 students from nursery-level up through primary school and into secondary education. Bayi says: ""You know sometimes I sit together with my wife and we can't believe this. It's a miracle."" Not content with the education opportunities he has provided to the surrounding communities, Bayi has now set his sights on the next goal -- to open a university. ""One day I will have a university maybe, college where I can teach doctors or engineers in that school,"" he says. ""Or maybe we'll be expanding the institution to be a big sports academy where we can receive even foreigners."" Meanwhile, Bayi continues to use his strong track record as a means of inspiring his students. ""Most of the students, they want to be professionals,"" he says. ""They want to be IT people, they want to be pilots, doctors, be everything. We always tell them, if you want to be anything you have to work hard because those things won't come like a dream,"" he adds. ""You have to work hard, you have to commit yourself. ""Most teenagers don't think about the future, they think about now. So we always teach them, now will pass and then the future will come. And if you aren't prepared for the future you'll end up nowhere.""","Filbert Bayi is a middle distance athlete from Tanzania .

"(CNN) -- A Chicago-area evangelical college won a temporary victory at the Supreme Court on Thursday over an Obamacare requirement that religious non-profits provide contraception insurance to their workers. Wheaton College objected to potential fines if it refused to provide coverage or sign a release form, saying that doing so would be morally wrong. The court said it didn't have to do either for now. The requirement in the health law championed by President Barack Obama has been challenged broadly by groups that oppose abortion. Earlier this week, the justices ruled 5-4 the government cannot force certain for-profit companies to offer contraception coverage under Obamacare. The court decision staying enforcement in the Wheaton case only gives the school a pass until the matter is decided by lower courts. Still, it represents an important victory for those objecting to the socially-charged requirement and follows a similar high court ruling last year for a religious charity, the Little Sisters of the Poor. The mandate stemmed from a compromise between the Obama administration and religous-based non-profits like hospitals and faith-based universities that oppose birth control. It would make contraceptives available under the Affordable Care Act with no co-pay but give those entities a work-around through health plans written by third parties. Three justices sharply dissented from Thursday's decision, including Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. ""It is not the business of this court to ensnare itself in the government's ministerial handling of its affairs in the manner it does here,"" Sotomayor said. The contraception issue has been a major sticking point of Obamacare, which has been the subject of enormous legal and political controversy. The Supreme Court majority in the Wheaton case made clear it has not decided the larger legal and constitutional issues, but merely acted on the enforcement question. The issue could be presented to the justices in coming months for final review.

"Beijing (CNN) -- As the global travel industry rolls out the welcome mat for China's surge of outbound tourists, it should consider tipping the scales in their customers' favor. Consider Emirates Airline, which has won over retail-crazy Chinese travelers by simply boosting their baggage allowance. ""They increased their luggage allowance because they recognized when Chinese travelers go abroad, they come home with more than when they left,"" says Martin Rinck, Asia-Pacific president of Hilton Worldwide. ""And just by making that change, they won tremendous market share of the Chinese consumer."" For the latest CNN ""On China"" program, I talked to a panel of industry insiders about how to cater to China's rush of outbound tourists. Fittingly, we filmed our discussion inside Beijing Capital International Airport -- a rare opportunity for an international TV network. The airport is on track to become the world's busiest passenger hub. That's not a surprise, given the boom in Chinese business and leisure travel. By 2020, it's estimated more than 200 million Chinese will go overseas -- double the number that did so last year. ""It has been one of the biggest dreams for Chinese travelers to go outside and travel overseas,"" says Chen Xu, a Beijing-based researcher at the Chinese Tourism Academy, a government think-tank that studies tourism trends. ""And now the government has lifted restrictions on outbound travel, so for more Chinese, it's much easier to travel abroad."" Fueled by more visas and more money, rising numbers of Chinese tourists are now able to fly further and spend more, many booking their own adventures online on travel sites like China's CTrip.com. ""We just recently sold a very top-end package tour which is $200,000 per person for 88 days around the world,"" says CTrip.com Chief Operating Officer Jane Sun. She asks me to guess how long it took to sell the package. I play along: ""Eight minutes?"" ""17 seconds,"" she says with a smile. Without a doubt, the interest and buying power of China's ultra-luxury travelers is immense. Across the board, China's outbound tourists are the world's biggest spenders. In 2012, they spent a record $102 billion on international tourism. And major booking volume is moving across mobile devices. ""More than 50% of our hotel bookings are on mobile,"" says CTrip.com's Sun. Hilton's Martin Rinck adds: ""China skipped the whole desktop/MacBook/computer thing and went straight to mobile."" ""Some companies are really proud to have a new website, but if it doesn't have the functionality to be read on a small device and have full integration on a mobile device, it's really of no use."" It's also of no use if you don't welcome your Chinese guests in Mandarin Chinese. ""We do this outbound Chinese travelers survey every quarter,"" says CTA's Chen Xu. ""And we noticed that last year, for four consecutive seasons, lacking Chinese service and lacking Chinese-language TV programs or menus were the most unsatisfying factors."" ""As a business, you probably have to provide more Chinese-language services,"" he adds. CTrip.com company data is in line with CTA's quarterly surveys. ""On our website, we rank the hotels and the sites,"" says Sun. ""The hotels with Chinese services are ranked higher than the other hotels."" And does that influence consumer choice? ""Absolutely."" In 2011, Hilton Hotels & Resorts launched ""Hilton Huanying,"" a welcome program tailored for Chinese travelers. In a number of Hilton properties outside China, it rolled out China UnionPay terminals, front desk staff fluent in Chinese, and a range of tailored in-room amenities like Chinese-language TV and tea kettles. ""We started the program in August 2011 with 15 participating hotels outside of China,"" Rinck tells me. ""We now have 82, and those hotels doubled their percentage of Chinese travelers in a period of just two years."" It's a clear message for the global travel industry: Tune those screens to Chinese TV and boost that baggage allowance. It pays to understand the needs of the 200 million tourists coming your way.","Hotels, airlines advised to tailor services to Chinese tourists .

Thus the then-19-year-old put off college, left his Chicago home and headed west last year to work out of AOL's Palo Alto, California, office. There, he continued working on his product and made the most of his new work digs -- heading to the office's gym each morning to work out and shower, then snacking over the course of the day on ramen noodles, trail mix and leftovers from meetings. He used his limited venture capital funds to pay his rent and assorted other bills. Until, that is, that money ran out. ""I tried to sleep on my friends' couches, but they were full for the next month or so,"" Simons told CNN on Monday, explaining what he did after losing his apartment. ""So I just ended up sleeping on their couches."" By ""their couches,"" he meant the furniture he could find in the Northern California offices of AOL, which was once but is no longer a sister company of CNN. Simons evaded security for two months -- not to mention having to pay for an apartment, gym membership and more. He said that he spent a total of $30 over those weeks, splurging at Boston Market for his Thanksgiving feast but otherwise subsisting largely by ""eating scraps."" ""I wasn't paying for rent, I wasn't paying for water, (and) most of my food was provided by other companies leaving leftovers,"" Simons recalled. He knew that squatting in a corporate office ""is certainly frowned upon."" But Simons insisted it was the course he had to take if he really wanted to get his venture, ClassConnect, off the ground. ""If I didn't do that, we wouldn't have been able to build this product, (and) we wouldn't have been able to launch it and get the large amount of traction that we did,"" he said. Today, ClassConnect is up and running and close to securing $500,000 more in funding, on top of an earlier $50,000, according to Simons. AOL hasn't talked to him directly about the couch-surfing that helped make the dream a reality. But AOL senior vice president, David Temkin, released a statement about Simon's situation, saying, ""It was always our intention to facilitate entrepreneurialism in the Palo Alto office -- we just didn't expect it to work so well."" Simons, now 20, admits that mooching and living round-the-clock at AOL's offices was ""certainly a gray area"" legally. But he now casts this experience as a positive when pitching ClassConnect to potential investors. ""If you were to invest in a company, would you invest in someone that closed up shop and went home?"" he said. ""Or would you invest in a person that, kind of against all odds, ... figured out a way to pull everything together when everything was stacked against him?""","Eric Simons was chosen to be part of an AOL program to foster entrepreneurship .

"(CNN) -- He revolutionized football once before by transforming its transfer system -- now Belgian lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont is gunning to change the face of the game for a second time. In his sights is UEFA's shiny new regulatory regime: Financial Fair Play (FFP), which has become the scourge of Europe's richest football clubs, notably English champion Manchester City and top French side Paris Saint-Germain, which were both heavily sanctioned by Europe's governing body Friday. FFP is designed to prevent clubs spending beyond their means and posting unsustainable yearly losses, but Dupont believes the sanctions are ""completely illegal"" because they restrict competition -- a key principle of European Union law. ""The break-even requirement,' that's in itself a pure violation of EU competition law. any sanction that aims at enforcing an illegal rule is automatically illegal, "" Dupont told CNN. In a statement sent to CNN, UEFA said it ""completely rejects"" the suggestion that the break-even requirement may lead to any restriction of competition in the market for matches played in UEFA club tournaments. ""FFP rules emerged from a wide-reaching consultative process involving all relevant stakeholders in European football,"" read a statement from UEFA. "" As such, there is no doubt that the rules have democratic legitimacy since they were the product of an inclusive and democratic process. ""The substantive content of the rules -- especially the break-even principle, based on the idea that you 'don't spend more than you earn' -- is just economic common sense and a sensible prudential rule."" But Dupont disagrees. ""FFP sounds good,"" added Dupont. ""Who wouldn't support good governance and fairness of the game? ""But when you scratch the surface, the break-even rule is no more than a prohibition to invest."" Dupont believes FFP raises further competition concerns by entrenching the status quo, by not allowing clubs like City and PSG to challenge the established football order in future. ""UEFA prohibits the owner of a club to spend his own money in the club, at least to buy players, in order to make it grow and to challenge the established top dogs. ""Today, with this rule, Roman Abramovich could not build his Chelsea project and turn it into one of Europe's top clubs. ""In other words, the rule ossifies the market structure. The few top European clubs will remain the same forever -- there will be no new kid in town."" To back up his argument, Dupont cites an academic article by professor Nicolas Petit on EU competition law and FFP. ""Petit says FFP creates what he calls a 'Oligopoleague: the break-even rule destroys competitive balance -- the big clubs will be bigger; the small clubs, smaller ; and no small club will ever again become a big one,"" said Dupont. Again UEFA rejects the accusations. It says ""FFP enhances competition through improving managerial incentives in football"". It adds that ""clubs are encouraged to invest in training and infrastructure rather than 'payroll-gambling'"". Threat of expulsion . Last week, City was hit with an $82 million fine and squad restrictions for next season's Champions League, while PSG also received a heavy financial punishment. Dupont argues clubs won't risk taking UEFA on in the courts because it might lead to their expulsion from the Champions League or the Europa League and disrupt their transfer activities. Additionally, they have the feeling that the political cost would be high, said the Belgian lawyer. It's a threat that has ensured UEFA has faced little opposition over FFP. ""Pay me â‚¬60 million or I will expel you from competitions, which will cause you an even bigger damage,"" said Dupont. ""This is clearly a threat of expulsion. Again, a major crime under European competition law. And even more so since this threat aims at enforcing a rule that, itself, violates competition law."" Dupont also argues part of the punishment handed out to City -- where its squad for next season's Champions League has been reduced from 25 players to 21 with at least eight of those having to be home grown -- is also ""illegal."" UEFA's homegrown players rule requires at least eight players in a European squad to have been trained domestically for three years between the ages of 15 and 21 -- a rule which Dupont says is open to challenge. ""The whole UEFA home grown player system violates EU Law,"" said the Belgian lawyer who is based in Barcelona. ""This rule violates free movement of workers and harms free competition without any solid justification. ""In other words, if any club or player challenges this rule tomorrow in court, the judge -- based on EU law -- will have no choice but to declare this UEFA rule null and void."" Intriguingly, Dupont urged the supporters of the nine clubs sanctioned by UEFA to become involved in the battle against FFP. ""Million and millions of people could challenge FFP tomorrow,"" said Dupont, who is already contesting the FFP regulations through the courts in a case he is fighting on behalf of football agent Daniel Striani. ""The fans can do this through their associations. They are the consumers of the football product and the ultimate aim of competition law is to protect the consumers. ""They are free to join the complaint lodged by my client, player agent Daniel Striani, with the European Commission and the civil action he has launched in the Brussels court. ""They could even ask the Brussels judge to stay the execution of the Uefa FFP regulation -- and of the sanctions based on it - until he renders his judgment on the merits. ""Since the break-even rule will stop for ever the vast majority of clubs from challenging the existing top European clubs, the fans of these 'underdog' clubs have a legitimate interest and can ask the judge to declare the break-even rule null and void. ""And the same goes for (for instance) the sponsors of all these clubs."" It was nearly 20 years ago that Dupont, who helped Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman change European law in 1995 to allow players to move for free at the end of their contract. Whether it change European law for a second time remains to be seen.","Lawyer brands UEFA's Financial Fair Play sanctions ""illegal""

"(CNN) -- A tense, weeklong showdown appeared to end Saturday between the federal government and supporters of a Nevada cattle rancher battling the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) over grazing rights on federal land. The BLM stopped rounding up rancher Cliven Bundy's cattle and returned about 300 head of cattle to the open range to avoid the potential for violence, according to the BLM and CNN affiliate KSNV. The Old West-style controversy -- centering on a family that has been ranching in Nevada since the 1800s -- drew armed militia groups from across the country to the cattleman's side this week, especially after a YouTube video captured a tussle teetering on violence between rangers and protesters. The BLM said Bundy owed about $1 million in back fees because his cattle grazed on federal land. On Saturday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the BLM's cattle gate, according to CNN affiliate KLAS. Some of them were armed. ""Due to escalating tensions, the cattle have been released from the enclosures in order to avoid violence and help restore order,"" the BLM said in a prepared statement. Also Saturday, supporters of Bundy, some of them armed, forced a temporary shutdown of northbound lanes of Interstate 15 near his ranch, the Nevada Highway Patrol said. ""Based on information about conditions on the ground, and in consultation with law enforcement, we have made a decision to conclude the cattle gather because of our serious concern about the safety of employees and members of the public,"" said BLM director Neil Kornze. The highway was reopened early Saturday afternoon after protesters moved to the side of the road and stopping blocking it. But traffic was backed up for three miles in both directions, Trooper Loy Hixson told CNN. He said nobody in the crowd threatened violence. It was unclear whether Bundy and the BLM had come to an agreement on how to end the long-running conflict. U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, appealed for calm Saturday and told out-of-state supporters to return home. ""The dispute is over, the BLM is leaving, but emotions and tensions are still near the boiling point, and we desperately need a peaceful conclusion to this conflict,"" Heller said in a statement. ""I urge all the people involved to please return to your homes and allow the BLM officers to collect their equipment and depart without interference. ""We are very close to a calm, peaceful resolution but it only takes the action of one individual to stir things up again and bring us back to the brink of violence and no one wants to see that happen,"" Heller said. The growing protest came amid the BLM's decision to put an early end to a roundup of Bundy's cattle, which the feds claim have been illegally grazing on federal land for 20 years. Earlier Saturday, Kornze said that contracted wranglers and U.S. rangers apparently made enough progress in rounding up cattle that belonged to Bundy, who is challenging federal authority in a valley that his family settled in the Wild West era. The roundup occurred near the scenic Virgin River at Bunkerville, where Bundy's ranch is located. ""After one week, we have made progress in enforcing two recent court orders to remove the trespass cattle from public lands that belong to all Americans,"" Kornze said in a statement. He was referring to how two different federal judges ordered the removal of Bundy's cattle. Bundy's dispute with the government began around 1993 when the bureau changed grazing rules for the 600,000-acre Gold Butte area to protect an endangered desert tortoise, CNN affiliate KLAS reported. Bundy, who's in his 60s, cites the Constitution in asserting that the state of Nevada holds sovereignty over the charging of grazing fees and, if he owes such a fee, he would pay it only to the local government -- not to the feds. Bundy also contends his family has been ranching in the Virgin Valley on the Nevada range since 1877 -- long before the BLM even existed and before the tortoise was declared endangered. Bundy has said he owns 500 of the more than 900 cattle that federal officials had been planning to confiscate for illegal grazing, according to local media accounts, with each head worth about $1,000. The rancher couldn't be immediately reached for comment Saturday after the feds shut down the roundup. On Wednesday, a scuffle between protesters and federal rangers was videotaped. Bundy family members and their supporters confronted the rangers and angrily told them to leave Nevada. Fearing that the cattle were being killed in the roundup, they also demanded to know why a backhoe and dump truck was being used, but federal officials later said the equipment was used to restore the range. For their part, federal rangers held Tasers and barking dogs on leashes during the faceoff. Federal officials say a police dog was kicked and officers were assaulted. Bundy family members say they were thrown to the ground or jolted with a Taser. In the end, the rangers got into their white SUVs and drove away, a YouTube video of the incident showed. The incident is under federal investigation. Gov. Brian Sandoval said Saturday of the BLM decision: ""The safety of all individuals involved in this matter has been my highest priority. Given the circumstances, today's outcome is the best we could have hoped for. I appreciate that the Department of the Interior and the BLM were willing to listen to the concerns of the people of Nevada."" Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Douglas C. Gillespie issued a press release late Saturday night saying he mediated the agreement between the Bundy familiy and BLM. ""I want to stress to all of you that as the sheriff of Clark County I cannot interfere with the Federal government when it is operating on Federal land,"" Gillespie said. ""And because this is BLM property, it is in their jurisdiction. But when a group of protesters threaten civil unrest or violence in this county -- it is my job to step in and ensure the safety of citizens."" CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Janet DiGiacomo and Dan Simon contributed to this report.","Authorities end cattle roundup, return livestock for safety reasons .

"New York (CNN) -- A couple who jumped to their deaths from the George Washington Bridge are believed to have committed a homicide before the leap, authorities said Wednesday. The alleged homicide was still unknown to authorities until about 11:20 a.m. Monday, when workers on the lower level of the bridge -- which connects New York to New Jersey -- saw something go by them over the side of the iconic structure, said Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman Joe Pentangelo. When workers looked down, the spokesman said, they saw a man and the woman in the water. The couple floated about 1,000 feet down the Hudson River before New York fire and police responders were able to pull them out at 12:09 p.m., Pentangelo said. After rescue workers administered CPR, the pair was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, where they died one minute apart from each other a short time later. About 1:15 p.m. Monday, police in the village of Suffern, New York -- about 35 miles northwest of the bridge -- received a call from a man who said he had just found his uncle dead, Suffern police said in a statement. The medical examiner's office later ruled the death a homicide by asphyxiation. The victim was identified as William Valenti, 70, who was living at the residence with his niece, Nicki Hunt, 40, who also went by Nikki Circelli, and her boyfriend, Gary Crockett, 41, according to police. Investigators learned of an ongoing family dispute between Hunt, Crockett and Valenti, police said. Hunt and Crockett had allegedly taken money from Valenti's bank account without his authorization, according to police. At the homicide scene, officers found a note which they interpreted to mean that the couple may have left the house intent on harming themselves, police said. Valenti's vehicle was missing. On Monday evening, Suffern police dispatcher Jeremy Kaufer spotted a media story about New York authorities trying to identify the couple who jumped to their deaths from the George Washington Bridge, according to the police statement. On Tuesday, Suffern detectives traveled to the New York City morgue with members of the New York and Port Authority police departments. A positive identification of Hunt and Crockett was made, police said. Valenti's vehicle key was located on Hunt, police said. According to Suffern police, both Hunt and Crockett had prior criminal cases, but the disposition of charges was not known. Hunt had faced grand larceny and forgery accusations, while Crockett had been charged with possession of narcotics, police said. ""The investigation is continuing but at this time we believe that Hunt and Crockett are responsible for the death of William Valenti,"" the Suffern police statement said. The George Washington Bridge is a double-decked suspension bridge spanning the Hudson River and connecting Manhattan in New York City to Fort Lee, New Jersey. According to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 15 people jumped to their deaths from the bridge in 2013. The bridge is about 212 feet above the river at mid-span. There were were 49 successful interventions, where potential jumpers were stopped by police or passers-by.","Police say Nicki Hunt, 40, and boyfriend Gary Crockett, 41, jumped to their deaths .

"(CNN) -- Cameras in the cockpit. Real-time streaming of communications and flight information. Increased capacity flight data and voice recorders. Transponders that detach on impact and float. Once the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is solved, there are changes in air safety that might result from the lessons of the disappearance of a jumbo jetliner in the age of instant communications. The technologies -- each of which has its supporters and its detractors -- come into question as the search for Flight 370 enters its third week. Here's a look at some possible technological changes: . Camera images beamed from cockpit to ground . Investigators would be able to see and hear all that transpires in the cockpit. Former American Airlines pilot Mark Weiss and other experts agree that images could prove highly important during investigations. The National Transportation Safety Board has for years campaigned for cockpit video, arguing that images would have helped it solve what happened in crashes like that of EgyptAir 990 in 1999, which the agency concluded was a deliberate act by the co-pilot. A camera would have clarified who was in the cockpit and what was happening. Opponents, however, are not ready to welcome Big Brother in the sky. Many pilots -- and unions that represents them -- worry about an invasion of privacy. ""Years ago there was an American Airlines flight that took off out of Chicago and an engine came off the wing, and that airplane went right into the ground,"" Weiss told CNN. ""They had a camera on that airplane, and people were able to see inside the airplane exactly what was happening to them."" Union officials have said that having a camera monitor what pilots do would affect their ability to perform. Longer life for batteries powering locator beacons . The hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is two weeks old. That means it's near the halfway mark in the minimum battery life for the pinging beacon device on flight recorders. When the expected battery life runs out, possibly around April 6, the job of finding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- to which the beacons are attached -- will get significantly harder . And, thereby, so will the job of solving the mystery of Flight 370. Every commercial airplane is required to have pingers -- technically called underwater locator beacons -- to help locate lost aircraft. One is attached to the flight data recorder; another to the cockpit voice recorder. The depletion of a device's battery will not wipe out data, however. Data has been known to survive years on modern recorders in harsh sea water conditions. The battery life on the beacons has been a hot subject since the crash of Air France Flight 447 in 2009. The flight was carrying 228 people when it disappeared from radar between South America and Africa en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. It took two years to find the aircraft's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder in oceanic mountainous terrain under 13,000 feet of water. The battery died before searchers could locate the wreckage. Since then, regulators and the airline industry have undertaken efforts to increase the beacon battery life from 30 to 90 days. There are also efforts to require pingers to be attached to aircraft airframes, making it easier to locate wreckage. The next-generation pingers emit pings that can be heard 6 to 10 miles away, said Anish Patel, president of beacon manufacturer Dukane Seacom Inc. Uplinking information from plane to satellite before a crash . The Air France crash spurred U.S. aviation safety officials to look into uplinking critical flight data to orbiting satellites from airplanes flying across oceans. Today, flight data recorders use computer chips to record information about how the plane is working in flight. The cockpit voice recorder captures audio from crew members including pilots. But all that data could be uncollected if the plane crashes in a large body of water. Then, the devices can't be retrieved without help from special recovery teams. The National Transportation Safety Board had been researching a new system that would uplink airplane data about a plane's location, direction, equipment functions and about 30 other parameters to orbiting satellites, which would then beam the data back to the ground for storage. In the event of a crash, that data could be easily accessed and analyzed for clues. Such a system would be pricey but advocates contend that it could save millions of dollars in operations to recover onboard flight data devices when a crash occurs. Searching for the Air France devices and aircraft wreckage cost $40 million, according to a report by France's aviation investigation agency, the Bureau d'Enquetes et Analyses. But critics cite potential reasons why in-flight data uplinks might not work, including high costs, limited bandwidth, security concerns, privacy issues, and cumbersome aviation bureaucracies. In fact, two powerful government bureaucracies with oversight of the U.S. aviation industry -- the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration -- disagree about the promise of in-flight uplinks. Real-time streaming of flight information . In the age of Netflix streaming and trans-Atlantic Wi-Fi on flights, why can't aircraft-in-flight data come in real time? Canadian company Flyht Aerospace Solutions says it can. The company makes the Automated Flight Information System, or AFIRS, which automatically monitors data such as location, altitude, and performance. The data can be live-streamed when something goes wrong. The technology would have answered many questions about Flight 370, according to Flyht director Richard Hayden. ""We would know where the aircraft has gone, where it is, and we would have information on what had happened in the meantime,"" he said. On a normal flight, the system would send updates every five to 10 minutes. And it could be programmed to recognize when something is wrong, such as a deviation in flight path, to automatically begin streaming second-by-second data. The main objection has been cost, but Hayden said AFIRS is designed to save carriers money. ""A typical installation would be under $100,000 including the box and the installation parts and the labor,"" said Hayden. ""Normally our customers recover that expense in a matter of months to, at most, a couple of years by virtue of the savings it creates."" Those savings come from troubleshooting mechanical problems while the plane is in the air, he said, as well as collecting data that can help cut fuels costs. Former Inspector General of the Department of Transportation Mary Schiavo doesn't believe carriers will get on board. ""(Airlines are) very cost sensitive,"" she said. ""They simply will not add additional safety measures unless mandated by the federal government."" Increased capacity for data and voice recorders . Today's recorders are better than recorders of the past, when data was recorded on magnetic tape. But they fall short of current technical potential. Voice recorders, for instance, have only two hours of recording capacity. Since Flight 370 flew almost seven hours beyond the point where something went terribly wrong, it's almost guaranteed that crucial cockpit sounds have been erased. Cockpit voice recorders memorialize pilot's words -- from the inconsequential to the tragic. In 1999, a voice recorder captured the last words of the startled captain of EgyptAir 990 as he fought to maintain control of his plane. The cockpit voice recorder helped establish that the pilot was trying to pull the plane out if a dive while his co-pilot, investigators determined, flew it into the ocean. Voice recorders also record clicks and hums -- sounds that can reveal pilot's actions. Flight data recorders capture a wide array of data, including altitudes, air speeds, headings, engine temperatures, flap and rudder positions. And the types of data recording is growing as technology advances, a National Transportation Safety Board official said. ""We see recorders that come in for the newer aircraft of at least a few hundred (types of data) if not more than 1,000,"" the official said. They must record the previous 36 hours of operations. Pilots, however, don't like being recorded -- via audio or video. ""It's their work environment,"" said Peter Goelz, a CNN aviation analyst and former NTSB managing director. ""They believe that the voice recorders intrude on their work environment."" Two hours of voice recording capacity is not adequate, he said. ""It should be the last 24 hours,"" Goelz said told CNN. ""There is no reason in the world now not to have data recorders digitally recording in 24-hour time."" Some have suggested designing flight data and voice recorders that detach from the plane on impact or shortly before impact. The transponders would then float.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Orange is the new Brown wardrobe. Chris Brown's lawyer was unable to persuade a Los Angeles judge to let the singer out of jail on Monday. Brown, 24, wore an orange jail jumpsuit at court, with his mother sitting behind him, while attorney Mark Geragos argued the singer should be allowed to enter another rehab program instead of spending the next month in jail. The singer was locked up on a probation violation warrant Friday after he was booted from a court-ordered drug rehab program. Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray said Brown has already been ejected from two rehab programs in the last five months and another program should not be considered. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin said he was concerned about a ""provocative"" statement counselors said Brown wrote on a card at the Malibu rehab center. ""I am good at using guns and knives,"" according to a document read in court. The rehab program told Brown to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations, the document said. Brown refused a drug test -- which his lawyer denied -- and he touched elbows with a female patient, according to the document. Brown's next chance to get out of jail comes on April 23 when Brandlin considers if his arrest on a misdemeanor assault charge in Washington justifies keeping him locked up. There is a possibility the judge will speed up that decision so Brown can travel to D.C. for a trial on that charge. Brown's legal troubles began five years ago, when he beat Rihanna as the two sat in a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community labor. The judge has revoked Brown's probation twice in the past year, most recently because of his arrest on a sidewalk near the White House after he allegedly punched a man. Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for ""throwing a rock through his mother's car window"" after a family session at the center, a probation report said. Brown was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment, the report said. ""Mr. Brown proceeded to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it shattered,"" according to a letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. His probation was revoked in November, but the judge allowed him to stay out of jail by entering a 90-day anger management and drug rehab program. Although he completed that program last month, the judge had ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu treatment facility until a hearing on April 23. Brown's probation officer reported at a hearing last month that the singer ""continues to make great improvement"" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for the assault charge in Washington on April 17. If he is convicted in that case, the judge would decide April 23 whether Brown should complete his probation in jail. Brown has been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in Los Angeles three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements, his probation report said. At that rate, Brown could complete the labor in mid-October and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year. However, the clock is stopped while Brown is locked up.

"(CNN) -- Three people have been sentenced to death on Monday for their roles in a deadly attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last October, state television CCTV reported on its microblog. Another defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment, while four others received prison terms between five and 20 years. The trial that began on June 13 took place at a court in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in western China. Recently Xinjiang has been at the center of a spate of attacks, labeled terrorism by the authorities. A number of Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group who largely populate the province, have been implicated in an increasingly violent separatism movement. It is unclear what exact role the sentenced people -- with names that sound Uyghur -- played in the Tiananmen incident that occurred October 28, 2013. A vehicle drove through security barriers into a crowd in the square when it crashed into a pedestrian bridge in front of the Forbidden City and burst into flames. The attack killed six people, including three in the vehicle, and wounded 39 others. Police caught all suspects some ten hours after the attack. Not along after the incident, one Islamic militant group called the strike a ""jihadi operation"" and warned of more violence to come. In a speech posted online, Abdullah Mansour, the leader of the Turkestan Islamic Party, said those who carried out the attack were ""mujahideen,"" the SITE Intelligence group said in a report. East Turkestan is the name used by many Uyghur groups to refer to Xinjiang. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward China's Han majority in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang. Uyghurs are said to have faced widespread discrimination, including in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization.","Eight people stood trial for a deadly 2013 attack at in Tiananmen Square that left six dead .

"(CNN) -- A line of widely scattered strong storms brought tornadoes to Colorado and Minnesota on Thursday and damaging high winds as far south as Texas. Three tornadoes stuck Minnesota. One hit near rural St. James. Kholby Martin, a storm chaser with KDR Media, said it was a couple of hundred yards wide but it wasn't fully condensed. Officials said no one was hurt, nor was there any structural damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Colorado. There was still a possibility of tornadoes in south central Minnesota and central Iowa on Thursday night. Dallas County in Texas saw an hourlong tornado warning Thursday afternoon as the system moved through, bringing winds of up to 70 mph, the National Weather Service said. Students at Southern Methodist University were told to shelter in place. That was followed by a flash flood warning for several counties in the area through the early evening hours. CNN affiliate WFAA reported that five boys were rescued from a creek after fast-moving waters moved in. Emergency responders found the boys clinging to whatever they could find along the shore, the station said. There was wind damage around the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. In one neighborhood in west Dallas, residents told WFAA that when the storm hit they saw debris flying through the air and heard transformers popping. Deborah Drake came home to find the glass in an entrance door to her home shattered by some of that debris. ""You just heard this noise (like a train whistle) then it just shook the house,"" said a neighbor who was helping her clean up broken glass. ""I ran in the bathroom and got in the bathtub."" Some areas of South Dakota near Harrisburg were pelted by quarter-size hail, according to the National Weather Service in Sioux Falls. Winds were blowing as fast as 50 mph. On Friday, strong storms will probably strike from Arkansas to Indiana, with rain in the Midwest, South and Northeast as the system moves east. That blustery, wet weather could affect as many as 14 million people, CNN meteorologist Sherri Pugh said. Saturday should bring more rain for those areas, too. Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, will also get wet as 1 to 3 inches of rain is forecast. The area has been dealing with recent heavy rains, so the risk is high in those areas for flash flooding, and there's been a flash flood watch issued. Tired of reading about rain? Sorry, there's more. Rain will begin drenching the Pacific Northwest on Thursday, with the system moving to the Northern Rockies on Friday and Saturday.","NEW: Five tornadoes touch down in Colorado and Minnesota .

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez returned to the Liverpool team for the first time since serving his ban for biting an opponent -- but not even his presence could detract from his team's toothless display. The Uruguay striker, who was suspended by the English Football Association after biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic last April, played the full 90 minutes during Wednesday's 1-0 League Cup defeat by fierce rival Manchester United. Suarez, 26, was heavily fined by the club following the incident and had been linked with a move away from Anfield before stating his desire to stay on Merseyside. Return . In his first competitive outing for Liverpool since last season, he looked short of match practice and wasted several opportunities during an uninspiring contest. Javier Hernandez's second-half strike gave United manager David Moyes a much-needed victory following his side's 4-1 Premier League defeat by neighbor Manchester City last Sunday. Liverpool had chances of its own and Suarez did hit the crossbar with a sweetly struck free kick. The return of the English Premier League's ""enfant terrible"" had been greeted with much anticipation -- but there was little in the way of controversy on this occasion. Hate figure . Suarez is a hate figure at Old Trafford after he was found guilty by the FA of racially abusing United's Patrice Evra in 2011. He was hit with an eight-match ban and fined $63,000. Suarez also courted controversy in Holland while at Ajax where he was banned for seven games after biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal's shoulder during a match in November 2010. He is set to make his first Premier League start this season at bottom club Sunderland on Sunday. Meanwhile, League Cup holder Swansea suffered a 3-1 defeat at 2011 winner Birmingham City while there were also wins for Arsenal, Newcastle and Stoke. Serie A . Elsewhere in Europe, Roma is the only side left in the Italian top flight with a 100% record after securing a 2-0 away win over Sampdoria -- its best start to a Serie A season. Second-half goals from Mehdi Benatia -- his first in Serie A -- and another from Gervinho ensured Rudi Garcia's side moved two points clear at the top of the table thanks to a fifth successive league win of the season. Rafa Benitez's Napoli was surprisingly held 1-1 at home by bottom-of-the-table Sassuolo, which had suffered a shock 7-0 home defeat to Inter Milan at the weekend and prior to Wednesday had failed to win a single point. The draw left Napoli two points behind Roma and level with champion Juventus, which won 2-1 at Chievo. AC Milan scored twice in the dying minutes to draw 3-3 at Bologna, while Lazio bounced back from its derby defeat to Roma by beating 10-man Catania 3-1. Inter Milan could join Napoli and Juve on 13 points if it wins at home to Fiorentina on Thursday. Ligue 1 . In France, Ligue 1 leader Monaco remained two points clear of champion Paris Saint-Germain with a 3-0 victory at home to Bastia. Emmanuel Riviere opened the scoring for Monaco before Ligue 1's top scorer Radamel Falcao's brace helped maintain Monaco's unbeaten start to the season. PSG's record signing Edinson Cavani netted the only goal in first-half stoppage time as Laurent Blanc's side won 1-0 away to lowly Valenciennes. ""We burned a lot of energy in the Monaco match and only had three days to recover. It was a difficult match in all senses,"" PSG coach Blanc told reporters, referring to Sunday's 1-1 draw with the promoted principality club. ""But the important thing is to have taken the three points because we'll have plenty of matches like that over the course of the season."" It was Valenciennes' sixth successive defeat, which left the club second from bottom on just three points. La Liga . Cristiano Ronaldo netted a dramatic penalty to give Real Madrid a fortuitous 2-1 win over newly promoted Elche. Ronaldo had given Real a 51st minute lead before Elche hit back through Richmond Boakye in the first minute of added time. But Real snatched victory at the death when Ronaldo slotted home from the spot to break Elche hearts.","Luis Suarez made a return to action following his 10-match ban for biting an opponent .

"New York (CNN) -- The oldest female contestant in the 2013 ING New York City Marathon died just hours after completing her 25th consecutive appearance at the race, her daughter says. Eighty-six-year-old California resident Joy Johnson completed Sunday's race in just under eight hours. The following afternoon she was resting in her New York City hotel room and never woke up, her daughter Donna Graffis told CNN. Around mile 20 of the 26.2-mile marathon, at close to 5 p.m., Johnson fell and hit her head, Graffis said. She was brought to the first aid tent, where responders suggested that she go to the hospital. Graffis said that her mother -- who was able to speak coherently and with a clear head -- continued on, more determined than ever to finish the run. Johnson finished with a time of 07:57:41, according to Chris Weiller, a spokesman for the New York Road Runners, the organization that puts on the marathon. The following morning she ventured to NBC's ""Today Show"" with her sister, Faith Anderson, to talk to Al Roker, whom she called ""her buddy"" after more than a decade of yearly appearances on the show. After her visit to the Rockefeller Center, Johnson headed back to the Roosevelt Hotel to rest. Around 3 p.m., her sister was not able to wake her up. It is unclear what the exact cause of death was. Though 2013 was not her best time, and nearly three hours more than the first time she ran the race in 1988 with a time of 4:22:59, she was very happy to have finished, Graffis says. She was one of 18 octogenarians in this year's race, and one of only four women in that age group, according to Weiller. Johnson was also the oldest female in the 2011 marathon, and won her age group a total of six times over the past quarter century. ""We are going to miss her and she was an inspiration,"" Weiller said. ""For 25 years she has been lining up and finishing, and in 2014 it won't be the same without her."" Johnson, who was born in Minnesota, moved in her 20s to California, where she became a physical education teacher and track and volleyball coach, Graffis said. It was not until after retiring in her mid-50s that she picked up distance running. Graffis called her mother ""an inspiration to everyone that you can start something at that point in your life."" At home, Johnson ran with what she called the ""Willow Glen Track Pack,"" her daughter said. The group is named after the neighborhood she lived in in San Jose, California. She liked to jokingly call the other octogenarians in her age group ""whipper-snappers."" Graffis said that Johnson loved running, her family and her faith. ""We're all stunned and sad but in a way, when you talk to a lot of people who knew her, this is the way she wanted to go,"" Graffis said. ""A little bit of us is smiling, because we know she is very happy. The only thing is, she would have liked to keep running, pass her running shoes on.""","""This is the way she wanted to go,"" says the daughter of 86-year-old Joy Johnson .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta says there is no question that the United States is safer with Osama bin Laden, the architect of al Qaeda, dead, but contends there is no ""silver bullet"" to destroy the terror network. Panetta's assessment came just days before the one-year anniversary of the U.S. commando raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that ended a manhunt for the al Qaeda founder that began following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. ""Having been involved in operations even before bin Laden, it was clear that there is no kind of silver bullet here to suddenly be able to destroy al Qaeda and that includes going after bin Laden,"" Panetta told reporters Friday after a meeting with defense counterparts in South America. ""The way this works is that the more successful we are in taking down those that represent their spiritual and ideological leadership, the greater our ability to weaken their threat to this country."" The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security last week warned of the possibility of terrorist attacks leading up to and after the anniversary of the May 2, 2011, killing of bin Laden. There is no specific, credible terror threat, the agencies said. The warning, released by the FBI and DHS, says individuals have posted messages on ""violent extremist Web forums"" vowing attacks on the United States around the anniversary, but adds that ""such threats are almost certainly aspirational."" ""I don't think there's any question that America is safer as a result of the bin Laden operation,"" Panetta said.""... It doesn't mean that they don't remain a threat. It doesn't mean that we somehow don't have the responsibility to keep going after them wherever they are."" He described the raid that he oversaw as the then-CIA director as ""tense,"" with several ""nerve-wracking moments."" Panetta recalled the moment during the raid when one of two helicopters used by Navy SEALs crashed at bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. ""Just the fact that having those helicopters going 150 miles into Pakistan and the concern about whether or not they would be detected. And then actually going in to the compound when one of the helicopters went down because of the heat coming off the ground. It was just hotter than anybody had anticipated. And obviously that was pretty nerve-wracking,"" he said. ""... Fortunately, we had a back-up helicopter that came in and was able to pick up the people that were there."" The biggest question during the operation, Panetta said, was ""whether or not bin Laden was really there."" ""We had no specific information that he was actually located there. All we had was, you know, just a lot of circumstantial intelligence and information. But all of us were, were kind of holding our breath to find out whether or not he was actually there."" The answer came about 20 minutes after the SEALs entered the bin Laden compound, with the utterance of the code word ""Geronimo."" ""There was a huge sigh of relief by everybody involved in that,"" he said. While many details of the raid are known, questions remain about how bin Laden could have been in living for years in a compound that was only a mile from the Pakistan Military Academy in Abbottabad, a largely military community outside the capital, Islamabad. The U.S. raid, which was conducted without the knowledge of Pakistan, enraged the Pakistani public and deploy embarrassed its military. Panetta has said he remains convinced that someone with authority in Pakistan knew bin Laden was hiding at the compound. That claim has been denied by Pakistani officials. U.S.-Pakistani relations remain tense, in part because of U.S. drone strikes inside the country. Pakistan has in essence halted much of its cooperation with the United States while its parliament reassess future terms of engagement with Washington following a U.S. airstrike in November that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers along the border with Afghanistan.","Leon Panetta: There is no doubt the operation to get Osama bin Laden made the U.S. safer .

"Washington (CNN) -- Materials taken from Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan confirm that the al Qaeda leader communicated with the Yemen-based group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to a U.S. official familiar with the ongoing U.S. analysis of the documents. It is not clear whether that group ever received the communications or if it acted upon them, said the official, who could not be named due to the sensitivity of the intelligence information. The United States is still trying to determine if the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, American-born Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, was in direct communication with bin Laden. Washington considers the Yemen-based group a very active wing of al Qaeda. Several attempted bombing plots targeting the United States -- including the unsuccessful Times Square bombing of 2010 and the attempt to blow up courier planes with explosives hidden in printer cartridges -- were hatched in Yemen. The search through bin Laden's materials, which were recovered after the al Qaeda leader was killed in a May 2 raid on his compound by U.S. Navy SEALs, has also found direct evidence that while in hiding in Pakistan, bin Laden was involved in planning attacks. The materials confirmed that bin Laden was encouraging direct plots to attack Americans and U.S. interests in Europe late last year, according to the U.S. official. The source emphasized there were several threats at the time that led the United States to issue an October 2010 alert for Americans traveling in Europe. Bin Laden was ""aware, supportive and trying to motivate his operatives in Europe. He was pushing them,"" the source said. What's next after bin Laden's death? The U.S. intelligence community had classified information at the time suggesting that bin Laden was involved, the U.S. official said, but the documents taken from the compound have provided confirmation. Officials have previously said bin Laden always placed a top priority on trying to attack Americans. While officials are still trying to assess overall how effective bin Laden was in communicating with his operatives in Pakistan and abroad, the threats that emerged late last year came from ""al Qaeda Central,"" the source said, using the phrase that refers to bin Laden and his direct associates. ""Absolutely, he knew"" about the plotting to attack in Europe, the official said. ""Osama bin Laden was in the loop.""","The materials were taken in the May 2 raid on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan .

The reports, which are produced solely by Vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Abbottabad, Pakistan (VBS.TV) -- Since 2006, Vice has closely followed and chronicled the growing political turmoil in Pakistan, when founder Suroosh Alvi visited the infamous gun market of Darra Adamkhel. This Webby award-winning short film precipitated another visit in 2010, during which Vice documented a dramatic increase in regional violence and a campaign by militants to win hearts and minds after the worst flooding in the country's history. A year later, as the country was reeling from a marked increase in terrorist violence, Alvi revisited Pakistan in the wake of its latest geopolitical shock: the killing of Osama bin Laden. Visiting the al Qaeda leader's compound in Abbottabad, Alvi speaks to a neighbor -- a young boy who played with the children living at the bin Laden house. Alvi also travels to a university to see what undergraduates think about having lived next to America's most wanted man for the past five years. Unsurprisingly, their concern lies less with the proximity of bin Laden than the chaos that his death has provoked. Although the controversy over whether Pakistani intelligence colluded with bin Laden has consumed American media coverage of the killing, journalists in Pakistan are busy covering the onslaught of violence that has broken out since the raid. Anti-American sentiment is running higher than ever, and this turbulent nation has larger issues than bin Laden's death. Indeed, according to a recent YouGov poll, more than half of Pakistanis believe that the person killed in Abbottabad wasn't even bin Laden. See the rest of the story at VBS.TV . Post-Osama bin Laden Pakistan has seen a dramatic spike in violent attacks from the Pakistani Taliban. In an exclusive telephone interview with a Taliban spokesman, Alvi hears first-hand about their ongoing retaliation campaign for bin Laden's assassination, their goal to create a fundamentalist Islamic state and how they view the war in Afghanistan. Finally, Alvi revisits the Darra Adamkhei gun market, to find that an eerily quiet ghost town has replaced the teeming bazaar thanks to the Taliban's bomb attacks, kidnappings and killings. The disintegration of the largest gun market in the world is only a microcosm of Pakistan's instability and uncertainty.

"(CNN) -- Fourteen members of Osama bin Laden's family were deported to Saudi Arabia from Pakistan Friday, less than a week ahead of the first anniversary of his death at the hands of U.S. commandos. Among those aboard the private plane that left at 2 a.m. local time were bin Laden's three widows and two daughters, said Aamir Khalil, a family attorney. Earlier this month, the five women were sentenced to 45 days of house arrest for living in Pakistan illegally. Their detention ended last week. Khalil said the time served began March 3, when the five were formally taken into custody. ""The family was kept safe and sound in a guest (safe) house,"" according to a Pakistan Interior Ministry statement. ""They have been deported to the country of their choice, Saudi Arabia, today."" Two of the widows are Saudi, while one is Yemeni. The daughters are ages 17 and 21, Khalil said. The widows have been identified by U.S. and Pakistani officials as Amal Ahmed Abdul Fateh, Khairiah Sabar and Siham Sabar. Judge blocks release of bin Laden death photos . Because all five defendants confessed to impersonation, illegal entry into Pakistan and staying illegally in Pakistan, there was no need for a trial, Khalil said recently. He represents four of the five relatives. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs at his Abbottabad compound May 2, 2011. The al Qaeda leader spent years on the run in Pakistan after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, moving from one safe house to another and fathering four children with Fateh, at least one of whom was born in a government hospital, she told Pakistani investigators. No credible threat of attack on anniversary of bin Laden's death . A deposition taken from Fateh gives the clearest picture yet of bin Laden's life while international forces hunted him. He and his family moved from city to city with the help of Pakistanis who arranged ""everything"" for them, Fateh said, according to the deposition. Widow tells how bin Laden lived on the run . She told police she never applied for a visa during her stay in Pakistan. Authorities in Saudi Arabia have repeatedly declined to comment on the matter.

"(CNN) -- Jes Baker is cutting retailer Abercrombie & Fitch down to size. Baker, who blogs under the name ""The Militant Baker"" and wears a size 22, changed the brand's A&F logo to ""Attractive & Fat"" in a mock, black-and-white Abercrombie ad to challenge the line's branding efforts. The photos come as a provocative response to contentious comments Abercrombie CEO Mike Jeffries made in a 2006 Salon article about the multibillion-dollar brand's target audience. ""In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids,"" Jeffries said. ""Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely."" The divisive remarks resurfaced earlier this month after a series of protests went viral, from Greg Karber's video of himself giving homeless people Abercrombie clothing to a Change.org petition for larger sizes by a teenage eating disorder survivor. The plus-size community particularly took umbrage to the CEO's business model because the retailer currently does not offer clothes above size 10 or large for women. ""I challenge the separation of attractive and fat, and I assert that they are compatible regardless of what you believe,"" Baker, 26, wrote in a public letter addressed to the CEO. Jeffries has since apologized in a statement: ""While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense."" Baker spoke to CNN about Jeffries' comments and her motivations to address them. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. CNN: You start your letter with a preface that Jeffries' opinion ""isn't shocking; millions share the same sentiment."" The comments are from 2006 -- what motivated you to act on them? Jes Baker: It really wasn't upset or outrage at all. I've been an art major for the majority of my academic life, and so I am always trying to find opportunities to do something artistic. I just thought we don't see the juxtaposition of typical and atypical bodies in advertising specifically. Since I am a woman and I am fat and that's what I have to work with, I wanted to show that contrast by finding a male model. Really, it just came because I wanted to not be angry about it. I wanted to not say, ""This is an outrage, I've never heard of this before,"" but say, ""OK, well, look at this. Look at how awesome this is."" And, I think when you're talking about really serious subjects, and this is kind of serious, it's important to be a little bit cheeky and pull in a little bit of humor so that it's approachable -- and it worked. CNN: In your letter, you credit Jeffries with creating ""an incredible opportunity for social change."" What did you mean by that? Baker: In the body-positive world, which is still a subculture, fashion for fat people -- what they call ""fatshion"" -- is a really big political statement. So is the concept of, for example, a fat person walking around wearing cut-off shorts and not apologizing for their body being so observable. Being positive and having confidence is a huge deal. Through a very, very large company that deals with fashion and also deals with unrealistic body images, it's a perfect opportunity. You're bringing in fashion, you're bringing in body consciousness in general, you're bringing in kids who shop at the mall -- it's all these wonderful things combined in one opportunity. CNN: Have you always been comfortable in your own body? Baker: No, no, no. I think of all of us, to some certain extent, feel the same things. I was crippled from shame my entire life. Only in this last year have I been so dedicated to this journey of learning how to survive bad days and find wanted days. If anyone tells you they have 100% good days, they're probably lying. I have 26 years to undo and rewire and I'm still working on it, but it's definitely a very conscious decision. And writing has really helped, as well. CNN: The response has obviously been huge. Baker: It's wonderful. I'm sure there are negatives, but for every negative, there are 20 positives. The most powerful part is saying there is a reality that you can exist in where you're OK, and it doesn't make you gullible or delusional, it makes you strong. For a lot of people, it's just a light bulb. I know I had one where I said ""What? I don't have to live in self-loathing for the rest of my life?"" People are entertaining the idea that maybe there is a piece of self-worth for them out there somewhere. And once it starts, it grows. CNN: Let's talk about the actual photo shoot. Were you nervous? Baker: I had never met the model until that day. I credit the majority of this to the photographer, Liora, because she really made it come to life. He was the most genuine, down-to-earth person. It was so much fun. In the beginning, I was nervous, but mostly because I had never modeled with other people. I have done solo fashion modeling, but never with another person and never in a sexual manner -- so it was a really interesting experiment. CNN: Have you heard from Jeffries or Abercrombie & Fitch? Baker: No, I didn't write this letter technically for them. I like to not invest a lot of my time in people who are dedicated to misunderstanding me. What I wanted to do is reach women who look and feel like me. We never see this pairing; we never see a fat woman in a positive light. I want to empower the individual woman. When Mike Jeffries is gone, there's going to be another company. It's not about the extra-large shirts at Abercrombie; it's about teaching the world that everybody is equal in value.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A member of a Pakistani-based militant group is denying a New York Times report that a cellphone found during the raid of Osama bin Laden's compound contains information that links his group to bin Laden. The member of Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen said he was not aware of support his group gave bin Laden during the years the al Qaeda boss hid at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The statement by the man, who did not want his name used because no one in his group is authorized to speak to the media, differs from a recent New York Times report. The New York Times reported on Thursday that a cellphone belonging to a bin Laden courier contained contact information for members of Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen. (What is Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen?) The Times report says that Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen also has ties to Pakistani intelligence services. That information on the cellphone could raise questions about who supported bin Laden when he was in Pakistan, the report said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Islamabad declined comment on the situation Friday, saying, ""We don't discuss intelligence issues."" In recent weeks diplomats from the United States and Pakistan have been meeting to help repair the relationship between the two countries, which has been strained since the May 2 raid on the compound that left of bin Laden dead. The relationship between the two countries has been in a downward spiral over disputes about how to pursue counterterrorism efforts. The United States believes Pakistan is not doing enough to go after al Qaeda and other extremists, while the Pakistanis are upset with what they consider to be unilateral steps taken by the United States within their borders.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A spokesman for the trustees who control Michael Jackson's estate said designer belts produced under a contract with the pop icon's parents were not authorized. Asked if there would be legal action to stop the marketing of the belts, estate spokesman Jim Bates said it was undecided. Another company, Bravado, has a contract with the estate to market Michael Jackson merchandise, Bates said. A representative of the company marketing the belt said Katherine Jackson, the late pop star's mother, cleared the deal with the trustees. The sale has been put on hold while lawyers discuss a solution, he said. The crystal-encrusted belts, which went on sale through the designer's website Wednesday, are intended to raise money for the Jackson family museum planned for Gary, Indiana, according to a family friend involved in the deal. The first belt produced -- known as the ""artist's proof"" -- was autographed by Michael Jackson's three children and his parents for a special auction set to start Thursday. Katherine Jackson and her grandchildren Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson are the chief beneficiaries of the Michael Jackson estate. Charities yet to be chosen will also get 20 percent of the estate's profits, according to the will signed by Jackson. Katherine Jackson dropped her challenge for control of her son's estate in October, but her husband still has a legal objection pending in probate court. ""This is a truly one-of-a-kind opportunity,"" said Jerry Olivarez, the Jackson family friend who helped bring the deal together. ""I know of no other item that has ever been made available to the public that has been signed by both the parents and children of Michael Jackson."" Blanket, whose real name is Prince Michael II, Paris and Prince Jackson each signed the artist proof belt at the Encino, California, home where they live with their grandmother. The youngest, who was born in 2002, signed his name in true ""John Hancock"" style, taking up the most room with large block letters spelling ""BLANKET."" Prince, 13, helped his younger brother by adding ""Jackson"" below his first name. Paris, 12, showed flair with her signature, using a heart to dot her ""i"" and giving her ""r"" a long, flowing branch. The leather belt was designed by Simon Tavassoli and a limited run of 7,000 are being handmade at his Newport Beach, California, studio. Each unsigned belt will retail for $1,500, he said.","Estate spokesman says belt deal was not approved .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- A Sudanese appeals court has started deliberating the case of a woman sentenced to death for refusing to renounce her Christian faith, her husband said. Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, was condemned to die by hanging last month after she declined to profess she is a Muslim, the religion of her father. Sharia law considers her a Muslim and does not recognize her marriage to a Christian. She said she was raised as a Christian by her mother after her father walked out on them. ""Formal notification was given to myself and my lawyer that the appeals court has begun deliberation of Mariam's case,"" said Daniel Wani, her husband. He said he got the notice Thursday. Seeking asylum in the U.S. As the case goes through the courts, Wani, who is an American citizen, said he is asking U.S. officials to expedite the asylum process for his wife. If she's released, their lives could be in grave danger in Sudan, he said. ""I am scared for all our lives -- me, my wife and my two children -- if we have to remain inside Sudan, even a day after her release."" Wani said he is appealing his home state lawmakers, New Hamphire's U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte. Committed to her religion . The court convicted Ibrahim of apostasy on May 15. At the time, she was eight months pregnant. She gave birth to a baby girl late last month at a Khartoum prison, where she's detained with Martin, her 20-month-old son. Despite languishing in prison with two infants, she's holding firm to her beliefs, according to her husband. ""There is pressure on her from Muslim religious leaders that she should return to the faith,"" Wani told CNN in a TV exclusive. ""She said, 'How can I return when I never was a Muslim?

She's committed,"" he said. ""They brought in sheikhs (to the prison) and she told them, 'I'm pretty sure I'm not going to change my mind.' "" Wani said he is thrilled about his new daughter but hopes her birth doesn't hasten his wife's death sentence. In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, Sudan waited until the mother had weaned her child before executing any sentence. Sharia law as practiced in Sudan prohibits carrying out the death sentence on a pregnant woman until two years after she gives birth. CNN sought comment from the Sudanese government and was directed to the justice ministry. A CNN request for an interview was denied, and the justice minister said they don't comment on matters that are going through the courts. An attempt to contact Sudan's foreign affairs minister was unsuccessful. Muslim relatives turned her in . Ibrahim was arrested after Muslim relatives accused her of renouncing her religion. Their complaint alleged that she went missing for years, and her family was shocked to find out she married a Christian. Wani said he'd never met the relatives who made the accusations. His wife, he said, was raised a Christian by her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox, after her Muslim father deserted the family when she was 6. ""These people filed charges claiming that she was their sister and filed a police report saying that she had disappeared,"" he said. Brother: Repent or die . However, one of Ibrahim's brothers, Al-Samani al-Hadi, tells a different story. He claims Wani --- whom he called ""the priest"" -- fed his sister ""potions"" to convert her to Christianity. He wants her to repent. ""But if she refuses she should be executed,"" he told CNN last week. At first, Ibrahim was charged with adultery for marrying a Christian. The apostasy accusation was added after she maintained she was a Christian, according to her husband. She's been detained since January 17. In addition to the death sentence, the court sentenced her to 100 lashes for the adultery conviction. CNN's Nima Elbagir reported from Khartoum, and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta.","Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, was condemned to die by hanging last month .

"Abbottabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Osama bin Laden's hideout is being demolished, bringing an end to a symbol of American resolve and Pakistani frustration over how the operation was conducted. Navy SEAL Team Six raided the Abbottabad compound in May 2011 and killed the al Qaeda leader. The United States did not tell Pakistan about the raid until it was over. Pakistani authorities cordoned off the compound Saturday evening and brought in heavy machinery and flood lights to the site. ""The action was taken to keep the compound from ever becoming a shrine for bin Laden's followers,"" a Pakistani military official told CNN. ""It's a message that Pakistan doesn't want to keep anything connected with this terrorist."" CNN affiliate GEO-TV showed video of dust flying into the air from the compound as troops stood and watched from outside. Destroying the compound would ""demoralize senior militant leaders,"" said the military official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media about the demolition. The killing of bin Laden enraged the Pakistani public and deeply embarrassed its military. For U.S. President Barack Obama, the raid marked a high point. The president achieved something his predecessor failed to do: bring the terror mastermind to justice. Bin Laden and members of his family and security detail lived only about one mile from the Pakistan Military Academy in Abbottabad. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta this year told CBS's ""60 Minutes"" that he remains convinced that someone in authority in Pakistan knew that bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad, a largely military community outside the capital, Islamabad. That claim has been denied by Pakistani officials. Panetta said there were intelligence reports of Pakistani helicopters passing over the bin Laden compound. He also questioned why the Pakistanis would not notice the vast complex with 18-foot walls. Panetta told CBS the United States chose not to inform Pakistan of the raid due to security concerns. ""We had seen some military helicopters actually going over this compound. And for that reason, it concerned us that, if we, in fact, brought (Pakistan) into it, that they might ... give bin Laden a heads up."" But after the interview aired, Pentagon press secretary George Little said Panetta ""has seen no evidence that bin Laden was supported by the Pakistani government or that senior Pakistani officials knew he was hiding in the Abbotabad compound."" U.S.-Pakistani relations remain tense, in part because of U.S. drone strikes inside the country. Pakistan has in essence halted much of its cooperation with the United States while its parliament reassess future terms of engagement with Washington following the U.S. airstrike in November that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers along the border with Afghanistan. Ramifications of the bin Laden raid are still reverberating. Pakistan has not yet decided whether to try a Pakistani doctor for high treason for assisting the United States in gathering intelligence ahead of the raid, a senior Pakistani government official said late last month. Dr. Shakeel Afridi allegedly helped the CIA use a vaccination campaign in an attempt to collect DNA samples from residents of bin Laden's compound in an effort to verify the terror leader's presence there ahead of the 2011 raid. The role of the doctor was first reported by the British newspaper, The Guardian, last July. It cited unnamed Pakistani and U.S. officials. The Guardian said it isn't known whether the CIA ""managed to obtain any bin Laden DNA, although one source suggested the operation did not succeed."" CNN's Reza Sayah and journalists Nasir Habib, Zubair Ayoub and Tahir Shah contributed to this report.","Official says demolition will demoralize bin Laden sympathizers .

"(CNN) -- The publisher of a firsthand account of the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden said Tuesday it was moving up its release date by one week to September 4. Dutton, a subsidiary of Penguin Group USA, said the book will come out early because of ""overwhelming excitement in the marketplace."" The first printing of the book, already an Amazon best seller, is now 575,000 copies, according to Dutton. It was written by a Navy SEAL under a pen name, Mark Owen. The book's publisher said the special operations forces team member did not want to reveal his real name in order to protect himself and his family. Owen said in a statement Tuesday that he had a ""strict desire not to disclose confidential or sensitive information that would compromise national security in any way."" Questions raised after SEAL's identity revealed . At the request of Pentagon officials, CNN is not naming the SEAL who wrote the book, out of concern for his former colleagues who could still be active. The book is entitled ""No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama bin Laden."" The serviceman was on the Bin Laden raid, according to Pentagon officials. The 36-year-old chief petty officer left the Navy as a highly decorated commando in April, but he could be subject to criminal prosecution, they said. The book account includes the stealth helicopter crash that could have killed the author and his teammates, his publisher said. Officials only recently became aware the former SEAL was writing a book, but were told it encompasses more than just the raid and includes vignettes from training and other missions. They wanted to see a copy, a Defense Department official said, to make sure no classified information is released and to see if the book contains any information that might out one of the team members.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan was aware of increased U.S. intelligence activity in the country weeks before the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May, an Arab diplomat with direct knowledge of the events and a senior Pakistani official told CNN Saturday. The two sources offered slightly different versions of who knew what, when. The diplomat, who wished to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak publicly, said Pakistan knew about the heightened intelligence activity, specifically in the city of Abbottabad, but ""never, never had any idea the operation was about bin Laden."" The diplomat was approached privately by a Pakistani to inquire about heightened U.S. intelligence-gathering activities. He said it was assumed Pakistan was asking all Arab allies. Meanwhile, the senior Pakistani official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters, said Pakistan was indeed aware of ""heightened CIA activity in Pakistan"" in the weeks prior to the raid, but that the information officials had was not ""Abbottabad specific."" ""If folks in Islamabad had been able to pinpoint Abbottabad, they would have done something about it,"" the official said. Relations between Pakistan and the United States have been increasingly strained since bin Laden was killed in a Navy SEAL raid in early May. U.S. officials believe Pakistan is not doing enough to go after al Qaeda and other extremists, while the Pakistanis are upset with what they consider to be unilateral steps taken by the United States within their borders. Washington did not give advance notice to Pakistani officials about the raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad. Senior U.S. officials also suspect that some in Pakistan helped bin Laden live there. CIA Director Leon Panetta reportedly has told legislators that Pakistan was either involved in helping the world's most wanted fugitive avoid detection or was incompetent for not knowing he was living on Pakistani soil. The Arab diplomat said he is sure officials in Pakistan ""had no idea where bin Laden was."" He also said ""it was always clear Zawahiri was going to replace bin Laden,"" referring to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the longtime deputy to bin Laden who is thought to have taken over leadership of al Qaeda. ""It's not in their culture to go with someone else. They (al Qaeda) value loyalty,"" the diplomat said. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: A second source says Pakistanis were aware of heightened activity, but did not pinpoint it to Abbottabad .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton had a good week. She seemed to be energized on a surprise appearance on Barbara Walters' final episode of ""The View."" ""Why don't you take my place on the show?"" Walters joked. She gave a spirited speech at the annual conference of the New America Foundation, insisting on the need to diminish economic inequality and to revive the American dream that hard work should produce economic mobility. ""It's at the heart of what I believe is the basic bargain of America: No matter who you are or where you come from if you work hard and play by the rules, you will have the opportunity to build a good life for yourself and your family."" Although the former secretary of state has not yet thrown her name into the 2016 presidential campaign, a series of seemingly negative stories that unfolded recently have the potential to actually strengthen her case for running to become president of the United States. On the surface, the good news was not obvious. Many observers logically saw the news in a different light. ""As she takes clear steps toward her political future,"" wrote Maggie Haberman of Politico, ""the echoes of the old days are making the most noise right now."" The hearings on Benghazi have excited Republicans who are seeking to investigate what mistakes or wrongdoing she might have committed while serving as secretary. Her critics have also been asking why the State Department didn't designate Boko Haram, the group responsible for the kidnapping of nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls, as a terrorist organization. Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the top Republican prospects, put on his teacher's cap and said Clinton deserved an ""F"" for her leadership at the State Department. The hearings and the questions about foreign policy will serve as a reminder to Americans of the kind of tough political attacks Clinton should expect if she runs. The piece in Vanity Fair written by Monica Lewinsky has also brought up memories of the nastier side of the late 1990s, when the scandal involving her relationship to the President almost brought down the Clinton administration. The ongoing release of documents from President Clinton's archive is also triggering more stories about Clinton in the 1990s. 6 major takeaways from Lewinsky's Vanity Fair essay . Just to make matters more difficult, Karl Rove's statements suggesting that Clinton had suffered brain damage from a fall will trigger more discussions about whether she is physically up for the job. Rove stood by his statements this Sunday on the talk shows. And Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who some think could be a possible candidate in 2016, said on CNN that he was worried so many people speak of Clinton as inevitable. ""I think it's off-putting to the average . .. voter,"" he said. Castellanos: Rove's attack on Clinton was clumsy but shrewd . But all of this news, while certainly problematic, can work to her advantage. One of Hillary Clinton's greatest assets is her resilience and ability to take on the toughest of political fights. By bringing back memories of the 1990s, many of these stories will also bring back discussions of how much Hillary Clinton was able to endure . At a time when many Democrats are frustrated with how congressional Republicans have been able to stymie this administration, the personal and professional record of Hillary Clinton -- both as first lady and in her subsequent roles as senator and secretary of state -- could look extremely good and offer an attractive model as Democrats select a leader to guide their party through the partisan wars that are surely going to continue in the coming years. The stories about Monica Lewinsky and Clinton's health will also help to humanize her in a way that few other events can do. After all, one of Hillary Clinton's ongoing obstacles, including when she ran in 2008, was her difficulty in conveying some of her personality and character to a public that often saw her almost as cold machine. The ways in which she endured the trials of her marriage and assaults on her personal character in the 1990s are sure to bring some sympathy from many Americans and, at a minimum, to give voters a better sense of who she is as a person. Given how long Americans have been forced to suffer through the fierce partisan attacks of recent years they might have greater sympathy for what she endured several decades ago. As Chelsea looks forward to giving birth to her first child, Hillary Clinton has talked more about the joys of parenthood and excitement of becoming a grandparent, also experiences that will make her more human to American voters. The turbulence over her record that takes place in the weeks ahead can help shake some of the sense of inevitability that surrounds her candidacy, which would not necessarily be a bad thing. After all the media, and to a large extent voters, tend to like someone who has to struggle to achieve victory. In 2008, Barack Obama's supporters seized on the fact that Clinton was said to be the inevitable nominee and used that against her. Obama's supporters presented her as the candidacy of the status quo, while depicting him as the fighter and as the person struggling toward victory in an exciting contest. Bill Clinton responds to Rove, says Hillary 'strong' The attack on Clinton and the questions that emerge about her candidacy in the coming weeks can remind voters that her journey is anything but an easy path to success and show her to be very much a fighter and survivor in this campaign. The Benghazi hearings in particular, when combined with others like those on the IRS, will further the perception that the Republicans are an investigative party, obsessed with scandal and constantly seeking to find evidence against our leaders. The hearings can further tarnish the already badly damaged image of the GOP. And there is nobody better able to play up this angle and take advantage of these party weaknesses than Hillary Clinton, who was part of the White House team that turned this image against the GOP in the late 1990s. Clintons' relationship with media still testy after all these years . Finally, it is good to get all of this out of the way so early, before she has even announced her candidacy. If there is one truism in American politics, it is that everything bad will get out eventually. It is always good to get bad news out of the way long before the game really gets going. It's still the preseason in the presidential campaign of 2016. Given the short attention span of many Americans, it is much better for all this to circulate now when most voters are not really paying attention and before any serious contest has even begun. Taken together, this is why the bad news can actually be good for Hillary Clinton if she is preparing to run. The onslaught of attacks and challenges might just be the reminder that Democrats need -- that Hillary Clinton is the person best qualified to handle this job.","Hillary Clinton continues to attract big attention even though she hasn't become a candidate .

"(CNN) -- Radical Islamic websites Wednesday posted an Arab Spring audio message purportedly recorded by Osama bin Laden shortly before he was killed. The recording, which is more than 12 minutes long and was released by al Qaeda's media arm, As-Sahab, lists the speaker as bin Laden and calls him ""the martyr of Islam."" The audio begins with a prayer and remarks reportedly made by bin Laden about anti-government protests and uprisings earlier this year in several African and Middle East countries. CNN, which translated the audio, could not confirm its authenticity. The Islamic date with the audio indicates it was recorded between April 4 and May 3. Its posting came one day before U.S. President Barack Obama was to deliver a speech highlighting his administration's revised policies toward the Arab region in the wake of the Arab Spring protests. Read more about Obama's highly anticipated address . Just last week, a U.S. official told CNN a message with similar topics was seized at bin Laden's Pakistan compound during the May 2 raid by U.S. commandos. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the information, has not yet compared the recordings. The audio on the websites calls for solidarity among Muslims. ""My Muslim Umma (nation), we are monitoring with you this great historic event, and we join you with your joy and delight, so congratulations on your victories, and may God have mercy on your martyrs. May He cure your injured and grant the release of your prisoners."" After poetry, the speaker comments on North Africa's Maghreb, a region that includes Tunisia, Libya and Algeria. ""The (Muslim) nation was always getting ready for the victory that is rising from the eastern horizon, but the surprise was that the sun of the revolution rose from the Maghreb, the west. The light of the revolution sparked in Tunisia, and the nation felt the relief, the faces of the people got brightened, and the throats of the rulers got coarser, and the Jews got terrified because the coming of the promised day. ""With the overthrow of the tyrant, the definitions of fear, humiliation and surrender have fallen as well. The new meanings of freedom, pride, audacity and courage were risen. The winds of change came, in a will of liberation."" The speaker also said Egyptian protesters were inspired by Tunisians. ""This revolution was not a revolution for the food or the clothing but a revolution for pride and glory, a revolution of sacrifice and kindness, a revolution that enlightened the upper and lower Nile and all of its surroundings."" He encouraged Muslims to fight corrupt rulers and ""Western hegemony."" ""I believe that the winds of change will overtake the whole Muslim world, with God's permission,"" bin Laden allegedly says. The U.S. official who spoke about the tape confiscated in the raid said it was ""puzzling"" that bin Laden would ""suddenly join the bandwagon on the uprisings,"" months after they started and not mention all the Arab nations in turmoil. For instance, the official said it was a ""head-scratcher"" why bin Laden would not indicate his support for the uprising against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, a man bin Laden detested.

"(CNN) -- Lisa Rinna has a new book out -- and it's not what you'd expect. ""The Big Fun Sexy Sex Book"" is a fun and innovative guide to rejuvenating your sex life and libido, co-written with renowned sex therapist Ian Kerner (who writes about sex on CNN's medical news blog, The Chart). The vivacious 48-year-old actress is married to ""L.A. Law"" actor Harry Hamlin and mother of Delilah, 13, and Amelia, 10. She spoke, very honestly, to CNN about her own sexual problems and how she got her groove back. CNN: How did this book come about? Lisa Rinna: I wrote a book back in 2008 called ""Rinnavation."" I spoke very candidly and openly about losing my sex drive and mojo and how I figured out a way to get it back. It seemed to really touch people. They came up to me and wanted my help. It started a conversation. So cut to, I met Ian Kerner, who is a sex therapist, and we got to talking. He said, ""Maybe we should write a book together -- he said, she said."" I thought it was a great idea because I feel like not enough people talk about sex, we feel shame about it. There's so much taboo in this country around sex, yet it's something that is really the glue that holds a marriage together. With 50% of all marriages ending in divorce, I said, ""Gosh, it needs to get out. Let's empower."" CNN: How did you get your mojo back? Rinna: Firstly I set my mind to do it. I opened up to my husband. I was very afraid to do it. I was terrified, and I held it in for so long, until one day I burst into tears, and I told him. And he was so very supportive. He said, ""Well, what can we do? We'll do whatever we have to do."" The next day in the L.A. Times there was a piece about pole dancing classes given by an actress named Sheila Kelley. She created this class to help women get back in touch with their sexuality. She taught us how to move in ways that I had never allowed myself to move in. What those kinds of things do is they give you permission. That led me to a woman who threw sex toy parties. She brings out dildos and everyone's giggling and she teaches you how to give great (fellatio and masturbation) -- everything I think a woman needs for confidence, because nobody really teaches you this stuff. Growing up you're not really supposed to be doing it, because you're a bad girl if you do. So this was all part of my own sexual awakening. Even though I lost my sex drive, I didn't have the sexual confidence to begin with, so it happened for a reason. So I could really delve into my own sexual exploration. CNN: What did you discover? Rinna: I just know how important it is in keeping a marriage going. Without it, you're roommates, you don't value each other, and boom -- someone's going to have an affair and get divorced. It's not easy being married; it's hard after 20 years! If you don't have sex you just want to walk away half the time, so you really need to make the effort. CNN: Who would have thunk, you're like Dr. Ruth! Rinna: I certainly never set out to do any of this. I never thought I'd write a book about sex. I'm not an expert. But I have lived through something, and I have been in a marriage for 20 years that has lasted, so I think I have valuable things to say. Because of Ian's expertise it's an encyclopedia on how to get out of a sex rut, how to take risks in your sex life, how to start a conversation with your partner that you've been terrified to bring up. It's really about communication. I really believe anything two people do behind closed doors, as long as it's consensual, is OK. But you've got to talk about it and be open. I hope this book opens people up to try new things. I don't understand why it's not OK to do something that makes us feel so good and so connected to another human being. It's a gift, a beautiful gift that our bodies were made to do, and not just for procreation but for enjoyment. CNN: You and Harry seem to have a Lucy/Ricky thing going on. Rinna: We do. It's exactly our relationship, 150%. But he lets me do my thing and supports me. He shakes his head and walks out of the room. We're complete opposites but it just works. CNN: You have two daughters. They must have been horrified that you've written this book. Rinna: Up until a few days ago they just knew I'd written a book about relationships. They didn't really know I'd written a book about sex. The other day the book was sitting on the table and my daughter Delilah comes in, looks down at it and says, ""Oh, that's awkward,"" and walks out of the room. (Laughs). I'm hoping when they're adults they can have this book and have a healthy sex life as opposed to waiting until their mid-30s to try and figure it out. We don't want to have to think about our kids having sex, but they will.","Lisa Rinna has written a book with sex therapist Ian Kerner .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's prime minister has appointed 14 new ministers and kept 13 in their current positions in a much anticipated government reshuffle that attempted to satisfy opposition protesters that accused the country's military rulers and the prime minister of not being serious about political and economic reforms. The names of the new appointees were leaked to the state-owned al-Ahram newspapaer Monday hours before they are expected to take the oath of office in front of Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of the military council that took control of the country after President Hosni Mubarak was ousted on February 11. The newspaper said the names were final and no more new names will be announced. Prime Minister Esam Sharaf's new cabinet includes reformers such as Hazem Beblawi, who was appointed finance minister and deputy to the Prime Minister. ""The coming period is a delicate one,"" Beblawi said at a press conference Sunday evening. ""Especially on the economic side and that's really what matters to the man on the street and the country's future."" Sharaf's new cabinet also includes Mohamed Kamel Omar in place of Mohamed Orabi as foreign minister; Amre Helmi as health minister; and Abdelfattah al-Banna, as minister of antiquities. Zahi Hawass, one of the most well known Egyptians internationally known for his flamboyance, was removed as minister of antiquities after reports surfaced accusing him of questionable business deals and giving national treasures as gifts to the Mubaraks. Two key ministries did not change leadership, interior and justice ministries. Experts say this may spark further protests in the coming days despite the interior minister firing more than 600 top police officials last week. Sharaf has been under enormous pressure as activists and political groups have accused him of being weak in tackling the countries' political and economic challenges as well as demanding that the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to carry out the goals of the January 25th revolution. The numbers of protesters, who camped out at Cairo's Tahrir square since July 8, dwindled from thousands to hundreds Monday, indicating some satisfaction of the cabinet reshuffle. State-run Nile TV showed hundreds of protesters still camping out on Monday. The cabinet appointments come as news of Mubarak's deteriorating health emerged. The 83-year-old ex-ruler fell into a coma around noon Sunday, Mubarak lawyer Farid El Deeb told CNN. By Sunday evening, he had regained consciousness, said Mohamed Fathalla, the head of the Sharm el-Sheikh facility where Mubarak is recuperating. ""He is now stable after suffering a coma that did not last long,"" Fathalla told CNN. Mubarak is due to appear in court on August 3 to face charges of abuse of power and killing protesters.","The new cabinet includes reformers .

"(CNN) -- At least six people were killed Monday night after an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.5 struck southeastern Iran, state-run Press TV reports. Felt as far away as the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, the temblor was particularly strong between the cities of Zahedan and Bam. It struck late at night and hardest in mostly rural, relatively sparsely populated areas of Kerman province, officials said. While six are confirmed dead so far, according to Press TV, provincial officials said that they expect the death toll to rise. Citing eyewitnesses, another state-run news agency IRNA reported that scores of people are trapped in debris of buildings that have been destroyed. Many such sites are in hard-to-reach locations, making any rescue operations even more difficult. Additionally, at least seven aftershocks struck in the four hours since the 6.5-magnitude quake hit at 10:12 p.m. Monday night, according to the Iranian Seismological Center, based at the University of Tehran, and the U.S. Geological Survey. Javad Kamali, a deputy governor for Kerman province, told the IRNA that the tremor knocked down phone lines throughout the region. Military and law enforcement workers could communicate only using wireless technology, he added. Relief and recovery teams, some from outside the area, have converged around the village of Hosseinabad, between the towns of Fahraj and Rigan, Kamali said. In addition, IRNA reported that Kerman province's disaster council convened an emergency meeting to assess possible damage and coordinate potential aid and assistance efforts. The tremor was centered in Kerman province about 16 kilometers (9 miles) southwest of Hosein Abab, 213 kilometers (132 miles) southwest of Zahedan and about 1,075 kilometers (668 miles) south of Tehran. Residents of Zahedan, Khash and Iranshahr in Sistan-Baluchestan province, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan, all felt the quake, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported. Kerman Gov. Esmail Najjar told IRNA that although the earthquake's reach was significant, it hit several small villages hardest. The high-impact zone's population -- which Najjar estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 people -- was widely dispersed. Iran lies on a series of seismic fault lines and experiences earthquakes almost daily. At times, they have had devastating consequences. Among the most notable was in December 2003, when a 6.6-magnitude quake devastated the ancient city of Bam -- also in southeast Iran -- and killed at least 30,000 people. Last year, an earthquake struck Hormozgan province in southern Iran, injuring about 700 people in the port city of Bandar Abbas, state media reported. And there's been plenty of activity in recent months as well. In early November, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake in the northwestern Lorestan province injured at least 80 people, according to IRNA. One person died two months earlier when a quake measuring magnitude-5.5 struck southern Iran, and in August three were killed after a 5.7-magnitude tremor in northern Iran, several state news agencies reported.","NEW: 6 are confirmed dead, and the death toll is expected to rise, state-run media says .

"(CNN) -- The iPhone 4 may be an attractive gadget, but keeping it looking good can be a high-maintenance task. Owners of Apple's newest smartphone are 82 percent more likely than those with older models to have their digital companions damaged in the first four months they own them, according to a report by SquareTrade. The company, which sells warranties for electronics products, examined about 22,000 reports from its customers who had iPhone 4s and about 20,000 for iPhone 3G devices, which debuted in 2008. ""The iPhone 4 is a more fragile device than its predecessors,"" said SquareTrade Marketing Vice President Vince Tseng. ""The surface area ... which you can scratch or break has basically doubled."" Is your iPhone 4 giving you trouble? Whereas the iPhone 3G and the aesthetically identical 3GS were encased in plastic, the iPhone 4's backside uses the same glass that covers its screen. The original iPhone had an aluminum back. At least a quarter of the reported damage for the iPhone 4 involved the glass pane on the back, the SquareTrade survey said. But Apple has expressed delight with the so-called aluminosilicate glass it uses -- though the Cupertino, California, company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. ""We developed a glass that's 30 times harder than plastic,"" Apple Chief Steve Jobs said onstage during the unveiling of the iPhone 4. The company has also said it's ""20 times stiffer than plastic."" The glass is ""comparable in strength to sapphire crystal,"" Jonathan Ive, Apple's senior vice president of industrial design, said in an online marketing video. Some reports have indicated that Apple's use of glass on the iPhone 4's back has posed a problem for customers using protective cases. When Apple announced it would give away free cases to help customers with cellular signal issues, Jobs said fewer third-party manufacturers offered cases at the product's launch. If fewer iPhone 4 owners are protecting their devices, then that could explain the increase in damage, said Tseng of SquareTrade. ""Some customers didn't want to use a protective case,"" Tseng observed, based on reports, ""because they wanted to admire the beautiful backside of the iPhone 4.""","The iPhone 4 is 82 percent more likely than older models to be damaged, a report says .

"(CNN) -- A man accused of killing his wife while she frantically spoke to a 911 operator bought marijuana candy just hours before the deadly shooting, police said Thursday. Now Richard Kirk, 47, faces a first-degree murder charge. And authorities are facing questions about why it took them so long to reach the family's Denver home. For nearly 13 minutes, Kristine Kirk told 911 she feared for herself and their three scared children. She screamed when her husband went to the family safe and grabbed a gun. The 911 operator heard what sounded like a gunshot. Then ""the screaming stopped,"" Denver Police Detective Mark Crider wrote in a search warrant affidavit. And Kristine Kirk, the detective wrote, was ""never heard from again."" When they arrived at her house, investigators found her dead on the floor with an apparent gunshot wound to the head. Receipts and security camera footage showed Richard Kirk had purchased a candy called ""Karma Kandy Orange Ginger"" at a marijuana store in southeast Denver at 6:40 p.m. that night, the affidavit says. Investigators said they'll examine a blood sample to determine whether Kirk was under the influence of any substances at the time of the shooting. During her 911 call made just after 9:30 p.m., according to the affidavit, Kristine Kirk said her husband ""had taken some marijuana and possibly some prescription medication for back pain."" ""Please hurry,"" she told the dispatcher, adding that her husband was ""totally hallucinating"" and scaring their kids, the affidavit says. The affidavit says Kristine Kirk sounded ""panicked"" but does not specify at what point in the 911 call her tone changed. After authorities arrested Richard Kirk, the affidavit says, he started ""rambling to himself"" and told an officer ""that he was the strongest in the Church of Latter Day Saints and he had killed his wife."" At the time, police believed he was under the influence of a controlled substance or prescription medication ""based upon his speech patterns, his inability to focus and his pupils,"" the affidavit says. Colorado became the first state in the nation to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana, allowing pot stores to open for business on January 1. At a court hearing Wednesday, Richard Kirk was ordered held without bail on an accusation of first-degree murder. In response to questions about the incident, Denver Police Chief Robert White told reporters Thursday he had opened an internal review of why it took officers more than 12 minutes to respond, CNN affiliate KUSA reported. ""We want to know how long it took our officers from the time they were dispatched to get to that particular call,"" he said. Investigators will look at the time it took operators, dispatchers and police officers to handle the call, he said. ""We are going to look at all nuances in this situation. What, if anything, went wrong from our perspective? What we can do to mitigate instances like that in the future?"" White said, according to KUSA. A dispatcher has been placed on leave pending the investigation into the incident, the CNN affiliate reported, citing police officials. The city of Denver auditor's office this year began studying police response times, which have grown longer in recent years, the Denver Post reported. The report is expected in June, and police have cited fewer officers and limited budgets for hiring more officers since 2008 as causes for longer response times, the newspaper reported. Kirk admitted that he killed his wife -- ""without questioning,"" another police document says -- when an officer put him in the backseat of a patrol car, the probable cause document says. Lance Kirk, brother of Richard Kirk, told CNN affiliate KWGN that he was stunned to hear of the incident. ""I know that wasn't Richard -- let's just say that,"" Lance Kirk told the news outlet. ""I hope there are some answers that come out about this."" Police: Motorist called 911 several times before he died in road-rage shooting . CNN's Michael Martinez, Mariano Castillo, Stefan Simons, Kara Devlin and Dottie Evans contributed to this report.","Police affidavit: Richard Kirk bought marijuana candy hours before his wife was killed .

"(CNN) -- The United States clinched the first gold medal of Sochi's Winter Olympics Saturday, but the Dutch dominated on ice and a joint record was claimed by Norway. An upset opened the day's events in Russia when Team U.S.A's Sage Kotsenburg, 20, scooped the first gold in men's snowboard slopestyle. Kotsenburg tweeted his surprise at the win. Kotsenburg's winning score of 93.5 edged out silver medal winner Staale Sandbech, 20, while Canadian Mark McMorris, also 20, took bronze. American Shaun White, the biggest name in snowboarding, withdrew from the competition before it began to focus on the men's halfpipe next week. The double Olympic champion, who had been nursing a wrist injury, withdrew Wednesday just a day after admitting the course presented an ""intimidating"" challenge. Saturday's second gold was taken by Norway's Marit Bjoergen in the women's skiathlon. The 15km course is split between a classic style for the first 7.5 km, then a final leg in freestyle.

"Washington (CNN) -- A former Credit Suisse banker pleaded guilty on Tuesday to fraud charges, setting the stage for prosecutors to challenge claims by the Swiss bank that helping wealthy Americans evade taxes was the work of a few rogue bankers. Andreas Bachmann, one of the eight former Credit Suisse bankers under indictment, entered his plea in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. He will be sentenced in August and could face up to 46 months behind bars. As part of his plea deal, Bachmann is expected to cooperate with an ongoing Justice Department investigation of Credit Suisse. His cooperation is expected to increase the scrutiny of assertions made by Credit Suisse CEO Brady Dougan, who two weeks ago expressed regret at a Senate hearing that the bank helped rich U.S. clients hide billions of dollars in assets from the IRS. He claimed that the wrongdoing was limited to a few bankers who are indicted and was not activity encouraged by Credit Suisse. Bachmann was arrested on Tuesday on a 2011 warrant, one of a handful of Swiss bankers to ever face U.S. charges because Switzerland doesn't consider tax evasion a crime and won't turn over its citizens to face such charges. He was released on $200,000 bond. An attorney for Bachmann didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Credit Suisse didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A recent investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that Credit Suisse held as much as $12 billion in assets for 22,000 U.S. clients, up to 95% of which was hidden from the IRS. Prosecutors have spent years pursuing the Credit Suisse inquiry. Lawmakers recently chastised the Justice Department for not moving more aggressively against the financial institution and 13 other banks under criminal investigation for aiding tax evasion. The indictment against Bachmann and the other former Credit Suisse bankers alleges they helped customers move funds to offshore tax havens using specially created shell companies and other entities to hide assets from the IRS. According to the indictment, Bachmann met with his Credit Suisse clients to help advise them on how to move their assets when the United States began putting pressure on Swiss banks to stop aiding tax evasion. The Senate report described methods worthy of a spy novel that Credit Suisse bankers used to help their wealthy American clients stash money away. The bank opened a special Zurich airport branch so customers could fly in, meet their private bankers and quickly hit the slopes, Senate investigators said. VIPs would use a secret elevator operated by remote control to be whisked to private banking suites. And bankers used sparse meeting rooms and avoided sending account statements and leaving paper trails, the Senate report said. One banker slipped a client's bank statement between the pages of a Sports Illustrated magazine during a meeting. Dougan said he was ""extremely dismayed by the conduct"" of the few bankers he blamed. He and other executives testified that they're cooperating as much as possible with the U.S. investigation, given the limitations of Swiss law that require client confidentiality. His testimony contrasted with that of executives from rival Swiss bank UBS five years ago. That bank apologized and accepted blame for the wrongdoing of its bankers. In recent months, Credit Suisse has discussed settling charges with the Justice Department by paying about $800 million. Sens. Carl Levin and John McCain, who oversaw the Senate hearing two weeks ago, called that sum too small given the allegations.","A former Credit Suisse banker is accused of helping U.S. clients evade taxes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who led the response to the 2010 BP oil spill and administered a moratorium on offshore drilling, announced Wednesday that he is stepping down. The former Colorado lawmaker plans to return home in March after eight turbulent and busy years in Washington, four years in the U.S. Senate and four years as head of the Interior Department. President Obama nominated him for the Cabinet post four years ago and he was unanimously confirmed. He was most prominent when he spearheaded the administration reaction to the BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Salazar issued a six-month drilling moratorium after the April 20, 2010, explosion. Critics, including Republican leaders, Gulf state officials and Gulf Coast residents, slammed the ban. They said it would hurt oil and gas workers in the already hard-hit coastal communities, where hundreds of jobs were lost because of the disaster. But Salazar said the moratorium provided time to make sure that similar accidents wouldn't occur and that rig operators were prepared to deal with worst-case scenarios if they did happen again. Eleven people died in the explosion, which spawned one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. An estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil gushed into the Gulf before the broken well some 4,000 feet below the surface was capped. ""We have undertaken the most aggressive oil and gas safety and reform agenda in U.S. history, raising the bar on offshore drilling safety, practices and technology and ensuring that energy development is done in the right way and in the right places,"" Salazar said in an Interior Department news release announcing his departure. The department has offered millions of acres of offshore acreage in the Gulf for exploration and ""is proceeding with cautious exploration of Arctic resources,"" the release said. It added that the department has leased millions of acres onshore for oil and gas development and has protected ""special landscapes for hunting and fishing."" ""Today, drilling activity in the Gulf is surpassing levels seen before the spill, and our nation is on a promising path to energy independence,"" said Salazar, who also overhauled Interior's management of oil and gas resources and installed new ethics standards for employees. Obama's Cabinet: Who's in, who's out? Salazar also has pursued renewable energy, with his department authorizing 34 solar, wind and geothermal projects on public lands since 2009, the news release said. Those projects total enough energy to power more than 3 million homes. ""Today, the largest solar energy projects in the world are under construction on America's public lands in the West, and we've issued the first leases for offshore wind in the Atlantic,"" Salazar said in the release. ""I am proud of the renewable energy revolution that we have launched. The release also noted progress made during Salazar's term regarding Native American lands. A settlement was reached and passed that addressed ""long-standing injustices"" involving the government's trust management. In addition, Obama signed into law water rights settlements that ""help deliver clean drinking water"" to tribes, the release said, and spearheaded a reform of surface leasing regulations for Native American lands. ""President Obama has made it a priority to empower our nation's first Americans by helping to build stronger, safer and more prosperous tribal communities,"" Salazar said. Obama, in a separate release, said Salazar ""helped usher in a new era of conservation for our nation's land, water, and wildlife"" and promoted renewable energy along with oil and gas production. He ""played an integral role in my administration's successful efforts to expand responsible development of our nation's domestic energy resources"" and made strides in ties with Native Americans. ""I have valued Ken's friendship since we both entered the Senate in 2005, and I look forward to receiving his counsel even after he returns to his home state of Colorado,"" the president said. Salazar's move comes amid criticism over Obama's second-term Cabinet nominees. He has taken flak because major nominations have gone to white males. White males have been tapped for three prominent Cabinet positions with second-term openings: secretary of state, secretary of defense and secretary of the treasury. One of those posts has been held by a woman, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while the others have been held by white men. Salazar focused on energizing Hispanics . While Obama's record of appointing women to top posts doesn't differ significantly from that of former President George W. Bush, many take the issue with Obama's appointments since he ran as a champion of women's issues during both of his presidential election campaigns, unlike his predecessor. CNN's Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger reported from Washington. CNN's Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta.","Salazar is a former U.S. senator from Colorado .

"Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- Visualize an Irish pub: there's likely fiddles, pints, and smoke -- and lots of it. While that may be a reality in some Irish pubs abroad, that hasn't been entirely the case in Ireland for the last decade. March 29 marked the 10-year anniversary of a workplace smoking ban in Ireland, extending to pubs and restaurants. Ireland was the first country worldwide to enact such a sweeping ban. The initiative made smoking in enclosed workplaces illegal, punishable by a fine of up to 3,000 euros, or about $4,200. The ban has spawned copycat laws across the globe. Norway and New Zealand followed that same year, as did Uganda. Now, dozens of countries from Brazil to Bhutan have joined Ireland in creating a nationwide workplace smoking ban -- the United States not among them. Russia will join the list in June. Irish Minister for Health Dr. James Reilly has hailed the ban as a success, stating the proof is in the numbers. ""Recent research found 3,726 fewer smoking related deaths than would have been expected if the smoking ban had not been brought in,"" said Reilly, who lost his father and brother to smoking-related illnesses, in a statement. ""This is indisputable evidence that the ban is saving lives and improving our overall health as a nation."" Indeed, Ireland's National Tobacco Control Office says the smoking prevalence rate has decreased more than 7% since the launch of the ban, dropping from 28.86% in March 2004 to 21.48% in December 2013. WHO: Imminent global cancer 'disaster' reflects aging, lifestyle factors . But while statistics demonstrate a national decline in post-ban smoking, you might not see evidence of that everywhere. Asked if the ban has helped her smoke less, social smoker Mary Byrne of Dublin counters: ""More."" ""I wouldn't have smoked before the law,"" Byrne says. ""You'd be inside and everyone was there. But when you went out to meet people, you'd be more inclined to take a cigarette because there was more pressure. Everyone was smoking outside, so you'd take one ... So, I think it's actually had the opposite effect."" Even nonsmokers, a group with which Byrne identifies, are taking up casual smoking, ""in hopes you might meet the perfect partner, I think,"" she adds. And statistically, Byrne's hypothesis is correct. Since the ban, the number of occasional (five or fewer cigarettes a day) and light smokers (between six and 10 cigarettes a day) actually has increased, according to Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE). Meanwhile, the HSE shows 18-24 year olds now make up the largest group of smokers, edging out 25-34 year olds who dominated nationwide prior to the launch of the ban. Furthermore, when you examine the 3,726 lives estimated spared since the ban's initiation, they are primarily attributed to a decline in ""passive smoking"" or secondhand smoke, according to a 2013 report ""Reductions in Cardiovascular, Cerebrovascular, and Respiratory Mortality following the National Irish Smoking Ban,"" published in the journal PLOS One. It seems smokers at pubs haven't stopped; they've just moved into the open air. Standing outside a Dublin pub with a cigarette, Jonathan Curran talks about the patron reaction to the ban. ""(Dubliners) basically just do what they're told, so when (the ban) came in, they went outside straightaway,"" he says. Not everyone adjusted so quickly, however. One politician staged a very public protest. After lighting a cigarette at a bar inside the Parliament building just days after the ban's launch, John Deasy, the justice spokesman for Ireland's largest political party, was relieved of his position. One year later, Irish news site Politico.ie quoted him as saying he stood by his choice to light up, and always would. But 10 years later, Deasy is back in political office and has gone mum, declining comment on the ban's anniversary. In the tiny town of Milltown in southwest Ireland, bartender Trish Morierty says smokers at pubs will still smoke. ""I'm still a smoker, unfortunately. Smoking less,"" says Morierty. ""I know a few people that because they have to stand outside said it wasn't them, that they didn't want to be standing out in the cold, and have people seeing them standing out having a cigarette. It just wasn't right. Some of them tried to give it up, but they didn't succeed. They are still smoking."" Largest-ever tobacco study finds 'urgent need' for policy change . It's that shaming, according to John Mallon, spokesman for smokers' rights group Forest Eireann, that makes the ban ineffectual. He says the workplace ban infringes on Irish freedoms and impedes business, especially in rural areas. ""In small villages, the pub was really the social center in the town. That all came to a halt after the ban,"" says Mallon. ""Slowly, but surely, the country areas were the ones most badly hit -- but everywhere was hit."" Indeed, Ireland has seen a rash of drinking institutions close since the ban, according to the Vintners Federation of Ireland. In 2013, 1,300 fewer licensed premises were documented than in 2005, with rural communities showing the largest loss percentage -- a decline surely due in part to a recession in Ireland from 2008 to 2013. Despite this, Mallon says pub business is actually picking up these days, a shift he attributes to the introduction of the e-cigarette. ""There's a bit of a drift back now, a social drift back to the bars, but it's got more to do with electronic cigarettes than anything else. And having discovered how bad the smoking ban could be for business, pubs now positively encourage you to 'vape' away in the corner if you want to, or at the bar. They don't mind. We still have no legislation on that, and don't need any either, incidentally."" E-cigarettes and ""vaping"" have become common fare in Irish pubs, and offer a new loophole to the workplace law. The Irish government is examining where e-cigarettes will fit into the goal of a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025 (that's a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%). Meanwhile, Ireland's Department of Health says two-thirds of the total population, and rising, are in favor of the smoking ban, including 40% of smokers. ""I fully agree with the smoking ban in pubs,"" says Morierty. ""Places are much cleaner. The stain smell of smoke, you don't have that anymore."" Beyond fresher upholstery, pub patrons and staff are hailing cleaner lungs. In 2005, one year after the ban began, the Research Institute for a Tobacco Free Society examined secondhand smoke exposure in 42 Dublin bars and among 73 bar workers, finding an 83% reduction in air pollution in bars, an 80% decrease in airborne carcinogens, and an improvement in the respiratory health of bar workers. But businesses are still growing accustomed to managing a tradition employed by nearly a quarter of the total population, a percentage that surely escalates when specifically examining the habits of pub patrons. Is obesity the next smoking? Though few and far between, violators of the ban have received penance. In March, Ireland's Mercroft Taverns Ltd. received a 750-euro fine (about $1,040) after patrons were found smoking inside its popular Dublin pub, Market Bar. It's a lingering punishment that keeps patrons who puff tucked in a blue haze just beyond pub doors, for worse or, sometimes, for better. ""I met my last two girlfriends from smoking outside with them, and they were both smokers. If you can't dance, I would say start smoking. That's where you're going to meet women,"" says Curran.","Ireland was the world's first nation to ban smoking in public places .
Health officials hail the ban as a success .
However, some in Ireland say they're actually smoking more .
E-cigarettes have become a popular alternative ."
"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fierce fighting swept across the Libyan capital of Tripoli on Sunday, a short time after armed men stormed the country's interim parliament. The violence appeared to be some of the worst since the 2011 revolution that ousted longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. At least two people were killed and 66 were injured, according to the Health Ministry. Residents of Tripoli rushed home Sunday evening. One Libyan who spoke to CNN reported seeing shop owners quickly closing up. State media LANA reported that lawmakers had already left for the General National Congress when that attack happened as the session was over for the day. Armed men blocked the road that led to the parliament, LANA said, blocking members' access to their offices. Some lawmakers went on Libyan TV stations to talk about the attack, saying that fighting erupted in the area around the GNC. The attack involved members of powerful militias from the western mountain city of Zintan. But the al-Qaaqaa brigade, a Zintan militia based in Tripoli, issued a statement that it had ""heeded the call of the homeland to save it from the abusing politicians ..."" Two other militias from Zintan reportedly took part: al-Madani and al-Sawaeq. 'The brink of civil war' Libya is on ""the brink of civil war,"" Col. Mukhtar Farnana, a prominent commander from Zintan, said in a televised statement, which he said was from the command of the self-declared Libyan National Army. Farnana said Libya has arrived at this point because the GNC betrayed the people by aligning itself with what he described as ""ideological gangs."" The work of the GNC will be frozen, and a committee elected to draft a constitution will take over some of its duties, he announced. It's unclear whether his orders will be enforced as other militias support the GNC. ""We announce to the world that Libya will not become a cradle or incubator for terrorism,"" Farnana said. At a late night news conference, Justice Minister Salah al-Marghani described what happened Sunday as ""dangerous and unfortunate."" ""The government condemns the use of armed force as a means of political expression by all parties and calls for an immediate stop in the use of the military arsenal the Libyan people own, to stop using it to express political views and calls on everyone to come under the umbrella of legitimacy,"" he said, adding that there are ""no real signs"" linking what happened in Tripoli to the violence in Benghazi last week. A CNN correspondent in Tripoli could hear intense blasts and gunfire coming from the road to the city's airport. Roads were being blocked off, according to witnesses. One of those people told the correspondent that he and his family are leaving their Abu Salim neighborhood, which is in the southern suburbs of the capital where fighting has increased and militias are engaged in battle on the street. The man said he saw a shell hit a neighborhood building along the airport road and that a fire had started. A Tripoli doctor told CNN that hospitals have called medical staff, telling them to come to work and to expect casualties. Simmering tensions . Libya's main political forces have been slowly reaching an intense divide along Islamist and liberal lines. The more liberal parties, backed by the heavily armed Zintan militias, have accused the Islamists of hijacking power and controlling the government and parliament. These militias have previously threatened to attack the GNC. Negotiations spearheaded by the U.N. Mission in Tripoli prevented an attack in February. The violence in the capital came as the death toll rose over the weekend from intense fighting Friday to the east in and around Benghazi. Retired Gen. Khalifa Haftar, a renegade general whose fighters caused much of the carnage in Benghazi, vowed to continue his assault on Islamist militants and other militias in the eastern Libyan city. One of those groups include Ansar al Sharia, which was blamed in the attack on the U.S. Consulate on September 11, 2012, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. Fighting initiated by Haftar has left many dead. Seventy-five people lost their lives after attacks by his self-declared Libyan National Army on Friday. An additional 141 people were wounded, the Libyan Ministry of Health said late Saturday, citing tallies from six hospitals. The government has vehemently rejected the actions of the former officer who fought in the 2011 rebellion. Although Farnana and Haftar both identified as belonging to the self-declared Libyan National Army, it was unclear whether they were talking about -- and part of -- the same group. A country awash in weapons and frustrations . Libya's revolution left the country awash in weapons in the hands of various militias divided along regional, tribal and political lines that have competing agendas and affiliations. Many of the militias fought the Gadhafi regime in 2011 and have refused to disarm and disband. Thousands more Libyans have taken up arms since Gadhafi fell. The government's attempts to build state security forces have failed so far, and those in authority have relied on militias for protection. Many Libyans are frustrated by how the national elections were handled, the declining security situation and the country's general lack of progress since the revolution. Militants have attacked foreign diplomats and Westerners as well as Libyan journalists, activists and judges, but they have aimed most of their violence at government security forces with nearly daily bombings, kidnappings and assassinations. Residents and officials have blamed the violence particularly on Islamist militant groups, including Ansar al Sharia. The United States designated Ansar al Sharia a terrorist organization this year. Doggedly determined in Benghazi . Haftar vowed late Saturday that he will purge the city of extremist groups. There is ""no turning back"" from ""saving Libya"" from ""terrorism"" that is killing innocent Libyans and targeting military officers, he said in a televised address.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A fifth man has filed a lawsuit alleging sex abuse by Kevin Clash, the puppeteer who gave Sesame Street's Elmo his voice. The allegations that Kevin Kiadii, 25, made against Clash, 52, are similar to those made by four other men who said they were courted and seduced by Clash when they were underage teenagers. The lawyer defending Clash called the other suits ""meritless and barred by the statute of limitations,"" but he did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on the newest filing. ""Mr. Clash continues to deny any wrongdoing, and we intend to defend this case forcefully,"" attorney Michael Berger said when the fourth suit was filed. Clash was suspended from Sesame Street and eventually resigned after the first allegations surfaced in November. Kiadii's suit, filed in a federal court in New York, said he was 16 when Clash contacted him on a gay chat telephone line and invited him to his Manhattan apartment in 2004. Voice of Elmo quits after underage sex lawsuit filed . The suit said Clash sent a luxury car service to pick the teen up in Brooklyn and drive him to Clash's apartment. Clash ""gave Kiadii alcohol and groomed him with attention and affection,"" it said. Clash and Kiadii engaged in sexual contact, which was ""Kiadii's first sexual experience with an adult male,"" the suit said. The lawsuit, which was written by the same lawyer handling the other four complaints, said Kiaddi ""did not become aware that he had suffered adverse psychological and emotional effects from Kevin Clash's sexual acts and conduct until 2012."" Sheldon Stephens, now 24, filed a lawsuit in March alleging Clash threw a crystal meth sex party for him in 2004, when he was 16. Stephens was the fourth man to sue Clash, but he was the first to publicly claim he had a sexual relationship with him as a teen. Stephens called it an ""adult consensual relationship"" in November, . Clash, who had provided the high-pitched voice of the iconic furry red Elmo since 1984, acknowledged a relationship between ""two consenting adults"" when Stephens' story emerged, but he said it otherwise was a ""false and defamatory allegation."" Second suit claims sexual contact . ""I am a gay man,"" Clash, 52, said in a statement in November. ""I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter."" Three other men soon emerged with federal lawsuits, filed in November and December, accusing Clash of befriending them as teenagers then engaging in sex with them. They are all represented by Florida lawyer Jeff Herman, who also filed Kiadii's lawsuit on Monday. Clash's lawyer has asked a judge to dismiss the three other suits based on his argument that the men waited too long to sue. The federal statute of limitations on such civil cases is six years, while their allegations involve relationships that ended more than 10 years ago, Berger said in a court filing last month. Each lawsuit contends that the men only realized in the last year or so that they suffered psychological and emotional damage from their encounters with Clash. ""Clash was an adult male living a prominent public life centered around the entertainment of toddlers, while at the same time he was, in secret, preying on teenage boys to satisfy his depraved sexual interests,"" the Stephens and Kiadii suits alleged. While the allegations in each suit mirror what the other men contend, Stephens' complaint is the only one to allege drug use by Clash. Suit accuses Elmo puppeteer of crystal meth sex party . ""Clash smoked crystal meth while engaging in sexual activity with Sheldon,"" the lawsuit said. ""Clash also gave Sheldon 'poppers' as a sexual aide. While Clash had sexual contact with Sheldon, the chauffeur watched and masturbated."" ""Poppers"" generally refers to alkyl nitrites in capsule form that produce a physical rush when broken and inhaled: crystal meth refers to crystal methamphetamine. Stephens was 16 when he met Clash in New York ""at a social networking event for models and actors,"" the suit said. ""Clash told Sheldon he would help Sheldon with his acting career,"" it said. In November, Clash said in a written statement: ""I am resigning from Sesame Workshop with a very heavy heart. I have loved every day of my 28 years working for this exceptional organization. Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's intelligence agency has detained several people who gave information to the United States before the U.S. killed Osama bin Laden, officials in Pakistan said Wednesday. The agency detained several people who cooperated with the CIA, a Pakistani official said; the official did not know the precise number. One rented a safe house to the CIA in Abbottabad, the Pakistani city where U.S. special forces killed bin Laden early May 2, a Pakistani source familiar with the arrests said Wednesday. Some of the CIA sources in Pakistani custody were low-level and not considered crucial, a senior administration official told CNN. The official said the sources were not spying on Pakistan, and therefore should be dealt with leniently. News of the arrests, first reported by The New York Times, is likely to further strain an already rocky relationship between the two countries. The United States has complained that Pakistan has not done enough to fight al Qaeda and other militants. Senior U.S. officials also suspect that some in Pakistan helped bin Laden live there. CIA Director Leon Panetta reportedly has told legislators that Pakistan was either involved in helping the world's most wanted fugitive avoid detection or was incompetent for not knowing he was living on Pakistani soil. Pakistan, meanwhile, has protested unilateral action by the United States in Pakistan, such as the raid that killed bin Laden: The United States did not tell Pakistan about it until the raid was over. It also has complained about civilian casualties caused by suspected U.S. drone strikes that have targeted Islamic militants in northwestern Pakistan. Now comes news that Pakistan has detained some of the very people who helped the United States find and kill bin Laden. Panetta discussed the arrests Friday with Pakistan army chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani and Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, Pakistan's head of military intelligence, the official said. A U.S. official confirmed that the discussion had taken place but would not give details about the arrests. The first Pakistani official did not say whether the owner of the safe house was suspected of being a CIA informant. He asked not to be identified because he was discussing sensitive internal matters. The second Pakistani official asked to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak to the news media. A Pakistani military spokesman confirmed that there were ""a number of people arrested in Abbottabad after the raid on the Osama bin Laden compound"" but said he could not say what relationship, if any, they may have had with the CIA. Some were seized at ""a house in Abbottabad that was used to monitor the bin Laden compound activities,"" said Syed Azmat Ali, the military spokesman. ""They could have been Pakistanis who were informants to the CIA."" Ali said those arrests were made by Pakistan's powerful military intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, ""immediately after the raid, so this is not a new piece of information."" He and the intelligence official who asked not to be named were responding to a report in The New York Times that Pakistan had arrested five CIA informants who gave information to the United States before the raid on bin Laden's hideout. The newspaper attributed the report to ""American officials"" without naming them. It said one of those arrested was a Pakistani army major who had kept records of license plate numbers on cars that stopped at the bin Laden compound. Ali, the Pakistani military spokesman, said that assertion was ""categorically"" not true. The newspaper also cited a top CIA official's damning assessment of Pakistan's cooperation with American counterterrorism efforts. Asked last week at a private briefing of the Senate Intelligence Committee to rate Pakistan's cooperation with the United States on counterterrorism operations, using a scale of one to 10, Deputy CIA Director Michael J. Morell gave it a three, the Times said, quoting ""officials familiar with the exchange."" Asked Wednesday by CNN to rate the Pakistani spy agency's relationship with the CIA on a scale of one to 10, military spokesman Ali gave it a four. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that maintaining the U.S. relationship with Pakistan is ""complicated,"" but ""helps our national security interest."" He called the cooperation ""vital,"" and said Pakistan is ""an important partner in fighting terrorism."" ""They have been reliable in providing information that's led to successful missions against terrorists,"" he said. At the State Department, spokesman Mark Toner said that, despite the challenges, ""more terrorists have been identified and killed on Pakistani soil than anywhere else in the world. And that's, in part, due to this counter-terrorism cooperation that we have. So it's in our interest to work through these challenges as they arise and to move forward."" Panetta, who has been nominated to be secretary of defense, defended the relationship to Congress in confirmation hearings last week. ""They maintain relationships with certain terrorist groups,"" he said, adding: ""They continue to not take aggressive action with regard to these safe havens, and ... they're concerned about the sovereignty results and criticisms of the United States when, in fact, my view is that the terrorists in their country are probably the greatest threat to their sovereignty."" During a visit last week to Pakistan, Panetta raised the issue of two raids that appear to have failed because of intelligence leaks in recent weeks, a U.S. official said. The United States had shown the Pakistanis evidence of two bomb-making sites near the Afghan border, the official said, asking not to be named discussing intelligence and diplomatic issues. The Americans believed the sites were being used to stage attacks against U.S. forces in Afghanistan. When the Pakistanis raided the sites, both were empty. ""The targets appear to have been tipped off,"" the U.S. official said. The relationship between the two countries has been in a downward spiral over disputes about how to pursue counterterrorism efforts. One reason Pakistanis have supported militants in the tribal region is that the fighters are seen as a bulwark for Pakistani interests. That includes a focus against the influence of longtime rival India in Afghanistan. Despite fears that elements sympathetic to militants are working for the ISI, American officials have argued that maintaining an alliance with Pakistan is crucial to the success of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts. The United States is suspected of carrying out routine strikes by unmanned aircraft targeting suspected terrorists in Pakistan: two suspected strikes Wednesday killed 15 suspected militants, two Pakistani officials said. Pakistani officials have said there were more than 100 such strikes in their country last year, a record, according to CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. They think most of the casualties were foot soldiers or civilians, not high-value terrorism targets, he said. The New America Foundation in Washington, which maintains an independent count of reported drone strikes, says there were 118 of them in 2010, killing 600 to 1,000 people. Polls show that nine of 10 Pakistanis view the strikes unfavorably. Many Pakistanis were angered by the case of Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor who was charged with killing two Pakistani men but then released after compensation was paid to their families. Davis described the two men as attackers and said he shot them in self-defense. Lahore Police Chief Aslam Tareen, however, said the case was ""clear-cut murder."" According to Davis, the shooting occurred January 27 after two men attacked him as he drove through a busy Lahore neighborhood, the U.S. Embassy has said. U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat and tried to claim diplomatic immunity but then revealed that he was a CIA contractor. CIA chief Panetta's unannounced visit last week was the latest in a series by U.S. officials -- including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen and Sen. John Kerry -- efforts to smooth things over after bin Laden was killed in the Navy SEAL raid. The Pakistani military said in April that drone strikes ""not only undermine our national effort against terrorism but turn public support against our efforts, which remains the key to success."" The United States has regarded Pakistan as a top ally in its fight against the Taliban, al Qaeda, the Haqqani Network and other Pakistan-based militants who have launched attacks against international and Afghan troops in Afghanistan. Washington has argued that Pakistan has not done enough to go after al Qaeda and other extremists. U.S. officials have expressed impatience with the Pakistanis and suspicions that elements of the ISI directorate are sympathetic to militants.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Georgia officials have agreed to exhume the body of the ex-fiancé of a ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" cast member to get a second look at what may have caused his death. A.J. Jewell died after a fight with another man in the parking lot of an Atlanta strip club in October, police said. Fredrick Richardson was arrested on a charge of voluntary manslaughter. Police originally said Jewell died from blunt force trauma, but a medical examiner reported that sickle cell disease also contributed to his death. Relatives pushed for the exhumation and a second autopsy, saying Jewell did not have sickle cell and they believe there were other circumstances leading to his death. ""Whenever a family has to exhume the body of a loved one, it's a difficult, difficult decision to make,"" family spokesman Markel Hutchins said. ""But I think it displays a great deal of courage and commitment on the part of this family toward truth and justice."" Jewell's father, the Rev. A.B. Jewell Sr., said family members cannot have closure until they know what happened. ""I want the public to know my son did not have sickle cell disease, and I hope this next autopsy will prove that my son was murdered,"" he said. A.J. Jewell was the fiancé of Kandi Burruss, the newest cast member of the Bravo hit reality show ""The Real Housewives of Atlanta."" In a statement after Jewell's death, Burruss said she was devastated and had spoken to him two hours before he was rushed to the hospital. Hutchins said family members believe Jewell's role on the show put up roadblocks for them early in the investigation. ""It's almost as if A.J. and his family were being penalized because of his high-profile nature and because of his celebrity lifestyle,"" he said. He said they hope the second autopsy will show sickle cell was not a factor and recent witness statements will shed light on the night Jewell died. ""There were other things that led up to A.J.'s death, and there are other things that we believe were criminal, that happened after A.J.'s death,"" Hutchins said but declined to elaborate. The man's six children are also looking for answers. ""They miss their father,"" Jewell said. ""We as a family are taking on the responsibility and trying to do what we can do to assure our support in helping them to be able to move forward with their lives."" It should take about two weeks to get results from the second autopsy, Hutchins said.","Spokesman Markel Hutchins: ""There were other things that led up to A.J.'s death""

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- An aggressive public relations offensive by the White House, celebrating the anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death, is kicking up a hot political fuss. But are we arguing over the wrong question? With their eyes clearly locked on the November elections, President Barack Obama and his team are going all out to dramatize his decision-making and success in taking out America's most wanted. What they're doing: Opening up the White House situation room for a presidential interview with NBC, running a television ad by former President Bill Clinton, feeding stories to authors and journalists, encouraging surrogate attacks on Mitt Romney's courage, even a catchy campaign slogan from Joe Biden -- ""Bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive."" In mock innocence, the White House says they are only responding to news media requests. Yeah, sure. Is this White House exploitation for political purposes indecorous and unbecoming, as Republicans claim? Of course it is. Another view: Why Obama owns bin Laden . President George H.W. Bush set the standard for exemplary conduct when he refused to dance on the Soviet grave after its empire collapsed and directed credit toward the U.S. military when they chased Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. But more often than not, a president looking toward re-election has gone too far the other way, milking foreign adventures for votes and Republicans have been as guilty as Democrats. One of my vivid memories from early White House days was the way we choreographed Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972, and especially his triumphant return, so that his helicopter from Andrews Air Force Base landed on the Capitol lawn and he then strode into the House chamber to report to a joint session of Congress. It was boffo television, and he won re-election in a landslide not long after. Or think of that ""Top Gun"" performance by President George W. Bush in 2003 as he landed on an aircraft carrier, stepped out in a flight jacket, and spoke to a prime time audience about Iraq -- with that ""Mission Accomplished"" banner just behind him. Even in my wildest dreams in the White House, I never dreamed of using an aircraft carrier as a prop. Not long after, Bush, too, won re-election. (It was not lost on the son that dad's approach hadn't won over voters for re-election.) So even though Obama's critics have a valid point about his current PR offensive, they shouldn't beat him up. The public is a good judge of when a president and his team overplay their hands. Indeed, it would be far better for Republicans to acknowledge that the president, his advisers and especially the CIA and the Navy SEALs handled bin Laden superbly. Because they did. This was a moment that richly deserves public praise. If they would acknowledge that achievement, his critics would then have the credibility to raise the more important and serious question: whether the killing of bin Laden and the gradual crushing of al Qaeda as a serious threat to the U.S. has been as transformative as the White House would lead us to believe. No one at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is hanging up ""Mission Accomplished"" banners, but with elections a half year away, the White House wants us to know that we have a warrior commander in chief at the helm nailing our enemies. Unfortunately, it isn't that simple. Serious observers are arguing that in the aftermath of bin Laden's death, the world may actually have become more dangerous. In Sunday's Washington Post, columnist David Ignatius persuasively makes the case that we got our man but, as bin Laden hoped, other militant Islamists are now gaining political strength in key countries such as Egypt and Syria. In an excellent essay in Time on bin Laden's elimination, Kennedy School scholar Graham Allison argues that as we now focus on Iran producing its first bomb in the coming 12 months, an increasingly unreliable Pakistan could produce 12 in the same time span. ""So as we applaud extraordinary performance in this operation,"" concludes Allison, ""we are left contemplating a discovery that means we are likely to soon face even more daunting challenges in the days and months ahead."" In a political campaign filled with too many diversions, these are the challenges we should be arguing about on the bin Laden anniversary. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","Is President Obama's team exploiting Osama bin Laden's death for political purposes?
David Gergen says the answer is yes, but other presidents have done similar things .
He says the real question is whether the world is safer after bin Laden is gone .

"New York (CNN) -- The head of the International Monetary Fund is being questioned by police in connection with the alleged sexual assault Saturday of a Times Square hotel housekeeping employee, New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne told CNN. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police pulled Dominique Strauss-Kahn off of an Air France flight destined for Paris at John F. Kennedy International Airport after the alleged incident, according to Browne. He was taken into custody and brought to a Manhattan police station for questioning, Browne said. Hours earlier, Browne said, Strauss-Kahn emerged naked when the 32-year-old hotel employee entered his room to clean it around 1 p.m. Saturday at the Hotel Sofitel. Browne said Strauss-Kahn tried to force himself on the woman, but she broke free and ran to the hotel's front desk. Hotel staff alerted the New York Police Department. By the time officers arrived, Strauss-Kahn had already left, leaving his cell phone behind at the hotel, according to Browne. ""The alleged victim was taken to Roosevelt Hospital (in Manhattan) and was treated for minor injuries,"" Browne said. Authorities then learned that the IMF managing director was on an outbound flight at Kennedy airport. New York police asked their counterparts at the Port Authority to hold the plane. Two plain-clothes Port Authority police detectives boarded the aircraft ""just before the door closed"" on the flight, and found Strauss-Kahn, 62, seated in first class, said a law enforcement official who had been briefed on the investigation. The IMF executive ""offered no resistance"" when he was led off the plane, after which he was turned over to New York police, added the official. Since being detained, Strauss-Kahn has declined to answer questions from New York police investigators nor has he made a statement, Browne said. No charges have been filed yet in the alleged incident. John Sheehan, the hotel's director of safety and security, said that Sofitel ""is fully cooperating with authorities."" ""We're taking this matter extremely serious, as it's developing,"" Sheehan said. A former French finance minister, national legislator and economics professor in Paris, Strauss-Kahn became the IMF's 10th-ever managing director in November 2007. He is also chairman of the IMF's executive board. While Strauss-Kahn hadn't officially entered the race, recent French opinion polls showed him leading prospective Socialist Party presidential candidates. The surveys suggested that he also could pose a formidable challenge to incumbent French President Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 election. Since assuming his position at the IMF, Strauss-Kahn -- and the world body -- have been repeatedly thrust into the spotlight to deal with a host of crises tied to the recent recession. In the past several months, for instance, the IMF head has weighed in on recent uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa and a multibillion-dollar bailout for Ireland's government. That institution, based in Washington, is widely seen as one of the most important in the world when it comes to addressing economic inequalities and crises. Strauss-Kahn became embroiled in controversy soon after joining the IMF, amid reports -- which he later acknowledged -- that he'd had an improper relationship with a female employee. The physical relationship was consensual, an independent inquiry found. The world body's executive board concluded in October 2008 that ""there was no harassment, favoritism or any other abuse of authority by the managing director."" ""Nevertheless, the executive board noted that the incident was regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment on the part of the managing director, as he has acknowledged and for which he has apologized,"" the IMF said in a statement at the time. Strauss-Kahn also issued a statement following the closing of the investigation, noting that he'd ""apologized for it to the (board of directors), to the staff of the IMF and to my family,"" as well as ""the staff member."" ""I agree with the board that the personal behavior of the managing director sets an important tone for the institution and I am committed, going forward, to uphold the high standards that are expected of this position,"" he said in the statement. CNN's Miguel Susana and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","NEW: Strauss-Kahn did well in polls of possible French presidential candidates .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghanistan's presidential election will go to a second round after no one candidate garnered more than 50% of the vote, the country's election commission said Saturday. The top two vote-getters, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, will be in a runoff slated for June 7, said Independent Election Commission head Ahmad Yusuf Nuristani. ""I think the elections went pretty good, we are satisfied with it and with the results,"" Nuristani said on state television. Seven million Afghans went to the polls on April 5 to choose a successor to outgoing President Hamid Karzai. It will be the country's first democratic transfer of presidential power. The preliminary results were announced Saturday, showing Abdullah with 45% of the votes and Ghani with 32%. Zalmai Rasoul's presidential hopes ended with a third place finish with 12% of the vote. Abdullah and Ghani were seen as the front-runners going into the April 5 ballot. Abdullah, who is associated with the Tajik ethnic group, is partnered with Mohammad Mohaqeq, a leader of the Hazara ethnic group. He also has a Pashtun on the ticket. An eye doctor by training, Abdullah became Afghanistan's foreign minister under Karzai. He ran against him in 2009 but dropped out to protest what he saw as large-scale voter fraud. He is considered to be relatively liberal and has made at least one public statement in support of women's rights. Ghani, who earned his doctorate at Columbia University in the United States, is from the Pashtun ethnic group. His running mate is Abdul Rashid Dostum, a leader of the Uzbek ethnic group. Ghani was the country's finance minister under Karzai. Security will be a key issue for whoever is elected president. A series of deadly attacks marked the run-up to the vote, and Kabul was again rocked by violence Thursday when at least three American medical workers in the capital were shot by a policeman guarding a hospital. NATO troops are scheduled to draw down from Afghanistan by the end of the year. Karzai, who is constitutionally required to step down after two terms in office, has refused to sign an agreement to keep international forces in Afghanistan, also known as the Status of Forces Agreement. But the two leading presidential candidates have said they would sign it.","Afghanistan's presidential election will go to a second round .

"Washington (CNN) -- For the past 30 years, Chris McDaniel has attended the West Ellisville Baptist Church -- a house of worship that held a fish fry this month for the congregation's widows and widowers and where kids attend vacation Bible school in the summers. Such things are important to folks in McDaniel's hometown of Ellisville, Mississippi, population: 4,448. It is a town named for a Mississippi senator, Powhatan Ellis -- a relative of Pocahantas, but which proudly goes by the nickname ""The Free State of Jones"" thanks to Jones County's role in opposing the Confederacy during the Civil War. Raised in an environment where both conservative Christian values and an independent streak run deep, it is perhaps little wonder that one of the city's native sons would challenge long-serving Sen. Thad Cochran for office. And, if the money pouring into McDaniel's campaign coffers from conservative groups is any indication, hopes are high among such organizations that McDaniel just might pull off a rebellion of his own in Tuesday's runoff. ""It's all in God's hands,"" McDaniel told CNN. ""...God has a plan. We pray to find his will, and his will will be done. We're going to fight, every day he gives us, and we believe we're going to be victorious, pursuant to his will."" McDaniel, a conservative who has the grassroots support of the tea party, the Club for Growth and Sarah Palin among others, is challenging Cochran, a septuagenarian, who has the backing of such groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Mississippi Conservatives, a super PAC headed by the nephew of former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour. 'The indifference that comes from a long-term incumbent' McDaniel has ""been able to capitalize on the indifference that comes from a long-term incumbent,"" said John Bruce, chairman of the University of Mississippi's political science department. ""He's also been able to capture some of the more national anti-establishment Republican movement."" Tea party conservatives -- who were dealt setbacks in Republican primaries in Kentucky and other states in the spring -- are banking on Mississippi as the best chance to eject another ""establishment"" Republican. The group's organizers are galvanized by a surprise upset in the Virginia GOP primary when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost to tea party-backed political newcomer Dave Brat. ""McDaniel reflects that change momentum we're seeing all over the country,"" Sal Russo, co-founder and a chief strategist for the Tea Party Express told CNN. Cochran's ""been a distinguished senator over the years but he's lost track with where the people of Mississippi are."" If McDaniel and Cochran's inability to net 50% of the vote in the June 3 Republican primary is any indication, then the people of Mississippi are split. Blogger's arrest shakes up Mississippi Republican primary . It's also a race that, at times, waded into the Mississippi mud. Last month, political blogger Clayton Kelly was arrested after authorities charged him with breaking into a nursing home where Cochran's wife, Rose, has lived for roughly 14 years. Photos of the elderly woman ended up in a political attack ad on YouTube, according to the Clarion-Ledger. Both Cochran and McDaniel denounced the act, but the fallout prompted both campaigns to accuse the other of playing dirty politics. But in Jones County at least, where Ellisville is located, the odds are in the hometown boy's favor. Daniel handily won his home county in the June 3 primary with 11,519 votes to Cochran's 1,941, according to the Mississippi Secretary of State's office. Native son . McDaniel is the grandson of country music star Luke McDaniel, who went by the stage name ""Jeff Daniels."" He grew up as an only child whose parents worked at Jones County Community College. His was a religious upbringing and, according to his campaign's Facebook page, he ""committed his life to Jesus Christ at the age of 13."" He was also an athlete who excelled in basketball and won a scholarship to attend the University of Mississippi. He eventually earned a law degree from Ole Miss and married Jill, an educator and former beauty pageant queen who was once ""Miss Mississippi."" The couple are raising their children Cambridge and Chamberlain back in Jones County. In addition to practicing as an attorney, McDaniel was also a syndicated conservative radio host of ""The Right Side Radio Show,"" which says it offers ""today's news commentary from the Southern side of Christian conservative politics."" Back then, his knack for hammering liberal policies caught the attention of local conservatives. ""I'd hear him on the radio, and I'd think 'that guy's a true conservative,'"" said Grant Sowell, a longtime associate and chairman of the Tupelo Tea Party. Complete coverage: 2014 midterm elections . McDaniel's on-air comments would later come back to haunt him. Earlier this year, a radio clip surfaced of McDaniel vowing ""I ain't paying taxes,"" if his taxes increased because reparations were paid to the descendants of Africans who were enslaved. He also made fun of Spanish and said ""a dollar bill can buy a mansion in Mexico."" In the spotlight . McDaniel was thrust into the national media spotlight. Campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch blew off the blowback. ""The liberal press clearly loves to attack conservatives of all types,"" Fritsch told the Wall Street Journal. ""When Chris got into this race he knew they would throw mud, so it's no surprise they'd dredge up decade-old comments made on conservative talk radio. McDaniel burst onto the Mississippi political scene in 2010 as a freshman state senator when he challenged Gov. Haley Barbour's veto of a measure that would block the state from using eminent domain to take land to be used by private companies. That effort failed but inspired a grassroots-backed initiative which was ultimately successful. That same year, he led the legal effort in his state to have the courts declare Obamacare's insurance mandate unconstitutional.

"(CNN) -- Maybe we've seen ""The LEGO Movie"" too many times. But we couldn't help breaking into an enthusiastic rendition of ""Everything is Awesome"" when we came across these Hong Kong-themed Lego photos by 36-year-old photographer Ric Tse. Made by combining Lego minifigures, props and images, Tse's ""Legography"" series captures the spirit of Hong Kong in toy form, whether it's Louis Vuitton-toting shoppers, a Chinese lion dance or punters checking out the betting prospects at the horse track. Some come with a side of social commentary that perhaps only a local would recognize, such as ""Rubber Duck Fever"" or ""June Fourth Vigil,"" both featured in the above gallery. Inspired by the streets . Tse, a freelance photographer with a full-time gig in property management, says inspiration usually strikes when he's out shooting photos of daily life in Hong Kong. ""During the shoot, whenever I capture something interesting I think, 'Would it work with Lego?' If that's a yes, I'll just do it."" Turns out, Tse wasn't even a big Lego fan when he started out. ""It was during an annual cleanup that my girlfriend, now wife, found an old box of Lego,"" says Tse, who produced his first Lego-based photograph in 2010. ""I had never played with Lego bricks before and found it interesting. I held a tiny figure and thought, if I could use this in my photography it would be interesting as well. That's where the concept came from. ""Since then, it's evolved to focus on people, incidents and things with a unique Hong Kong flair."" Four years on, he's created 30-some Leography images. If you're thinking about befriending Tse in the hopes of getting invited over to play with his massive Lego stash, bad news. Your kids likely have a more impressive collection than he does. ""I probably only have five or six boxes of Lego. But because of Legography, I've quite a library of figures -- about 80 of them."" Creating awesomeness isn't easy . Tse says getting the background of his photos to look realistic takes time and experience. ""The ones that are taken in an actual outdoor scene with Lego figures -- it takes about a week to plan, prepare and buy props,"" he says. ""The second type are taken at home with a background image taken by me. ""The production process includes taking photos from the actual location, buying the props and setting up the shooting scene at home. ""As it is more complicated, it usually takes about two weeks."" For example, his ""Sweet Memories"" image features a Lego van that he's covered in signs and menus from a photo of an actual Hong Kong Mister Softee truck. The photo is sure to hit locals with a vanilla-flavored cone of nostalgia, as these once popular moving ice cream purveyors have been around since the 1970s. His ""June Fourth Vigil"" image, a recreation of the annual commemoration of those killed in Tiananmen Square, was his most challenging work to date. ""It took me three weeks,"" he says. ""I wanted to create the special candle vigil effects, so I bought some tiny LED light bulbs and parts. Then, I studied how to light them up from the Internet. ""It was also a lot of work to set up the scene as I had to find ways to hide the wires."" ""We had a crowd around his photos all weekend"" Tse's Legography photos are currently on display at the city's Picture This gallery. Founder Christopher Bailey says it was an easy decision to exhibit the pics, as the venue seeks to promote young Hong Kong photographers who may otherwise struggle to find outlets for their work. ""We feel that Ric is very clever and insightful and captures in a very unusual and creative way the essential spirit of Hong Kong,"" says Bailey. ""He is of that 1980s generation who are concerned about the direction Hong Kong is taking and often feel unable to make their voices heard properly. ""Ric's photography and Legography is his very creative outlet to show his views."" The response to Legography has been huge, he adds. ""At the recent Affordable Art Fair, held last month, we had a crowd around his photos all weekend and sold them extremely successfully. We were pleased that the buyer profile was so broad, from kids to retirees and of all nationalities."" Bailey says the gallery doesn't limit how long a photographer's work is on display so there are no plans to remove Ric's exhibition any time soon, though it's a popular series and prints are selling fast. ""They are limited editions and we anticipate that some of them will sell out quite quickly. One image has already sold over 20 pieces from an edition of 30.""

"(CNN) -- When a New York elementary school invited rock star Billy Joel to a tribute concert of his greatest hits, the last thing they expected was for him to actually show up. But that's exactly what the ""Piano Man"" singer did. Vocalists in grades kindergarten through second performed ""The River of Dreams: A Billy Joel Tribute Concert"" on Wednesday in front of an audience consisting of their peers, teachers, families -- and Billy Joel himself. ""We really didn't expect him to come,"" Nomi Rosen, principal of Deasy Elementary School in Glen Cove, Long Island, told CNN Thursday. Joel, who is a Long Island local, found out about the concert after word of mouth spread through the area, Rosen said. Joel arrived just five minutes before the concert began and took a seat in the back. ""I ran up to him to see if he wanted to go up to the front, and he said 'No, no, I don't want the kids to be nervous,' "" Rosen recounted. With his permission, Rosen announced on stage that the ""Uptown Girl"" singer was present ""and that's when the roars started."" Joel hits that were featured were ""Movin' Out,"" ""We Didn't Start the Fire,"" and ""Uptown Girl."" The tribute closed out the festivities with ""New York State of Mind"" and ""Piano Man,"" according to a statement on the school district's website. Every spring at Deasy Elementary, the music teacher prepares a tribute to a different artist. Last year, it was the Beatles, although this is the first time the artist being honored actually showed up, Rosen said. According to Rosen, the parents and the older students were in awe at the singer's presence, but not everyone was as impressed. ""The younger kids were like, 'Of course he is coming. We're singing his songs he wants to hear us sing!' "" Joel is on tour and not available for comment, according to representatives for the singer.

"(CNN) -- Ever since the dawn of the space program, more than 55 years ago, the world has been fascinated with astronauts and space exploration. So it was pretty exciting when CNN got to do its first iReport interview from outer space. Dozens of CNN viewers and readers sent in questions for NASA's Steve Swanson, who has more than 15 years of experience on space missions and was open to answering any and all queries about life 250 miles above Earth. Answering from the International Space Station on Tuesday, Swanson took on the iReporters' questions -- many of them from children -- with aplomb. There was a 7-year-old girl's question about what it feels like when you blast off from Earth, an inquiry about NASA's plans to explore reusable spacecraft, and one question that every astronaut has probably been asked before: ""What do you do in your free time in space?"" The cutest moment had to be when 5-year-old Brockton Estrada of Brandon, Florida, told Swanson he wished he could join him up there. ""Brockton, I wish you could come up here too. You'd love it,"" Swanson said, with his microphone floating in the air. Then he did a somersault to show the boy what you can do when you're not limited by gravity.

"(CNN) -- When Robinho completed his dramatic deadline-day transfer from Manchester City to AC Milan last month, he became the latest in a long line of flamboyant big-name players to move to the San Siro. Most would agree the attacking prowess of the 26-year-old party-loving, Brazil striker would help bolster the attack of any team in the world, but it's his ability to help decide the future of Italian politics that was arguably just as attractive to his new employers. That is because club owner Silvio Berlusconi also happens to be the prime minister of Italy and -- according to leading commentators -- AC Milan's success has been inextricably linked to Berlusconi's rise to power. It could be just a coincidence of course, but Robinho's arrival, on the back of the purchase of Barcelona superstar striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic comes at an apposite time for the beleaguered statesman. The 73-year-old has the support of less than 30 percent of voters according to a recent poll for the newspaper La Repubblica -- following the defections of dozens of members of parliament in July and the departure of Gianfranco Fini -- a co-founder of Berlusconi's ruling ""People of Liberty,"" over policy disagreements. So could the capture of Robinho help shore up Italy's coalition government? There is no doubt that Berlusconi is a man who stirs the emotions of his compatriots in many different ways. To his followers, he is an achiever. An innovator, somebody who has changed Italian culture and business practices for the better. A world statesman of the very highest caliber. To his critics, he is a chancer; an embarrassment who continually flouts his authority with bizarre decision making amid lurid accusations about his personal life. And, to the supporters of AC Milan, he is the man in power. The owner, to be cheered when results are going well and jeered after another defeat. Rome-based football journalist Patrick Agnew has no doubt there is a correlation between Berlusconi's standing in the opinion polls and the arrival of big-name stars at his beloved Rossoneri. ""Berlusconi will frequently use the club to recreate a wining image for himself,"" Agnew told CNN. ""Off the pitch, his center-right coalition government is under great pressure at the moment. And, on the pitch, he was forced to watch rivals Inter win everything last season."" Agnew added: ""Berlusconi was also shocked by some of the banners he saw fans holding, when he turned up to watch the team train in July. He knew he had to buy some big names to boost his popularity, that's why Robinho and Ibrahimovic have arrived. ""Berlusconi has always seen Milan as a huge publicity vehicle and likes rubbing shoulders with the big-name players he can attract. It's all part of the image, that's why David Beckham has twice played here. It boosts ""brand Berlusconi"" when the polls suggest he needs a boost."" The career paths of Berlusconi the politician and Berlusconi the football club owner run hand-in-hand as the billionaire has unashamedly courted the popular ""football"" vote to achieve his political aspirations. When deciding to enter the political arena by creating a new party in 1993, Berlusconi chose the popular football chant ""Forza Italia"" -- roughly translated as ""Go Italy"" -- a name that helped progress the businessman to the office of prime minister within a year. Berlusconi's sudden and spectacular rise to the political summit came just as one of the greatest Milan sides of all time was marching towards the Italian league title. In fact, in the same May month that Berlusconi was sworn into power, his Milan side -- boasting Dutch superstars Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten -- thrashed Barcelona 4-0 in one of the most devastating European Cup final displays ever seen. Political analyst Franco Pavoncello, dean of the John Cabot University in Rome, told CNN: ""The success of AC Milan definitely helped propel Berlusconi's political aspirations and it is doubtful whether he would be prime minister now without that link. ""Berlusconi is a unique man. Whatever he touches turns to gold and his only aim is to be a success. The split in his coalition means he has some political maneuvering to do to avoid a possible election next year. ""But, if an election did happen, signing some big names to help Milan achieve success again can only help his cause with the electorate."" Where Milan's transfer policy appears to differ from many of their rivals is their apparent willingness to sign players that come with ""baggage"", be it big egos like Ibrahimovic, a party-loving image like Robinho and Ronaldinho, or the media frenzy that surrounds Beckham. It has lead to criticism that Berlusconi is ultimately overseeing a short-term policy that sums up his own personality, rather than encourage the long-term success and growth that signing younger, less well-known, players could bring. Pavoncello believes there is a reason for this. ""Berlusconi's successes have straddled politics, sport and the media. He brought commercial satellite TV channels into people's homes and likes the glamour that these big stars bring to him and his team. ""The fact that some players might have suspect temperaments will not be a concern to him. He just wants to win and win for the present. Don't forget he is not a young man. He wants to be around to see Milan win the big trophies and by signing these players it is the best way to achieve that success.""","Robinho is the latest big-name player to be signed by Italian giants AC Milan .

"(CNN) -- An Illinois businessman believed to have had Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, was not infected with the virus, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said Wednesday. The finding means there has been no confirmed transmission of the virus within the United States. Two confirmed cases of MERS have been imported into the country. On May 17, local, state and federal health officials reported preliminary tests showed that the businessman appeared to have tested positive for MERS. He had met with the first confirmed MERS patient in the United States, an American resident who had traveled from Saudi Arabia to Indiana. The face-to-face meeting included a handshake with the infected patient. Public health officials said they became concerned about the potential for a more contagious virus when preliminary testing indicated MERS may have been transmitted during that meeting. However, after more extensive blood tests, the ""CDC has concluded that the Illinois resident was not previously infected with MERS-CoV,"" according to the agency. As of Wednesday, the World Health Organization has received reports of 636 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS. 5 things to know about MERS . The first instance of MERS in the United States occurred in the patient who was working as a health care provider in Saudi Arabia and then traveled to Indiana. In the second case, a health care provider who lives and works in Saudi Arabia received a MERS diagnosis in Florida. The Florida and Indiana cases are not linked, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. MERS is a coronavirus, the same group of viruses as the common cold. It attacks the respiratory system, according to the CDC. Symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure. It was first found in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. Experts believe the MERS coronavirus requires close and sustained contact, such as between family members or health care workers, to spread between humans. ""While we never want to cause undue concern among those who have had contact with a MERS patient, it is our job to move quickly when there is a potential public health threat,"" the CDC's Dr. David Swerdlow said in a statement. ""Because there is still much we don't know about this virus, we will continue to err on the side of caution when responding to and investigating cases of MERS in this country.""

"(CNN) -- The two teams contested one of the most dramatic matches in football history, and now Bayern Munich and Manchester United will meet again in the quarterfinals of the European Champions League. Bayern are looking to become the first team to defend the Champions League title, while United's task has been made harder by the loss of Robin van Persie for the tie. The Dutchman, whose hat-trick enabled the Reds to come from two goals down to knock out Olympiakos, suffered a late injury on Wednesday that will keep him out of both legs of the quarterfinal. ""Following further investigation, Robin van Persie has a sprained knee, which will keep him out for around four to six weeks,"" the club announced on its Twitter page on Friday. The second leg takes place in Munich on April 9, leaving the 30-year-old striker to concentrate his return on the closing stages of the Premier League season and June's World Cup in Brazil. His absence is set to boost Pep Guardiola as his all-conquering squad attempts to reassert its dominance at home and abroad. The five-time European champions are on the verge of wrapping up the German title and will wrap up a Bundesliga triumph this weekend if they win -- and Borussia Dortmund and Schalke fail to. But to stand any chance of retaining their continental title, Bayern must beat the team that inflicted one of the German club's most painful defeats in the final of this competition 15 years ago. United won the Champions League in 1999 by scoring two goals in injury time to beat Bayern 2-1, but such halcyon days are in stark contrast to the club's current predicament. Manager David Moyes has struggled to get the best out of his team since replacing Alex Ferguson, the Scottish coach who masterminded United's win in 1999 and also its Champions League final victory over Chelsea in 2008 as well guiding the club to 13 English league titles before retiring in May 2013. Moyes' team sits seventh in the Premier League, quite a fall from grace for a team that lifted the English championship last season. Friday's draw in Switzerland also threw together Spanish title rivals Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. Barca's modern Champions League history is formidable, with the Catalans lifting European football's most prestigious trophy in 2006, 2009 and 2011. Barca won their first European Cup in 1992. But in the Spanish league Barca sit in third position, behind second-placed Atletico. Diego Simeone's team has caught the eye this season, disrupting the Spanish duopoly of Barca and Real Madrid through exciting play and the goals of striker Diego Costa. For Real it's a rerun of last season's semifinal against Borussia Dortmund. The German team stunned Real by destroying the nine-time European champions 4-1 in the first leg. Dortmund prevailed 4-3 on aggregate before losing to Bayern in the final. Former Real coach Jose Mourinho will pit his Chelsea team against Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain. Mourinho is looking to win the tournament with a third club after triumphs with Porto in 2004 and Inter in 2010. PSG will be relying on the mercurial talents of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has scored 10 goals in seven Champions League appearances this season, while former Chelsea defender Alex also plays for the Parisian club.

"(CNN) -- If you are noticing as you travel that more fellow travelers are Chinese, you are not wrong in your observation. It is estimated that almost 100 million Chinese traveled out of China in 2013 with this number expected to reach 200 million by 2018. These staggering figures can be attributed to China's growing middle class, more annual leave, easier visa applications to more countries and increased air travel routes to overseas destinations. Today the United States is the top destination for Chinese travelers, followed by several Asian destinations, with Italy, France and Australia also featuring high on the list. As the Chinese take more trips overseas, their booking methods, preference for group size and the types of experiences they desire are also shifting rapidly. China now has more than 618 million Internet users, about 80% of whom access the Web via their smartphones. So it is not surprising that the technology-savvy Chinese are increasingly booking more travel online. Guided tours remain popular, but group sizes are shrinking and more are opting for individual travel, with the younger generation gradually choosing ""adventure"" travel. Shopping is still a priority for Chinese travelers, and this is evident as the item most often left behind in rooms occupied by Chinese guests are old pieces of luggage, presumably because they have upgraded to newer and branded ones to accommodate shopping items. However, ""seeing the world"" and ""experiencing life"" are growing aspirations as they explore new lands. Based on these trends and developments, the travel and hospitality trade must recognize that a fuller, more nuanced understanding of the cultural and social backgrounds of Chinese travelers, as well as the operational aspects of dealing with the rise of Chinese tourism, is not only fundamental, but absolutely necessary across the sector. From the perspective of a leading global hospitality company providing a ""home away from home"" for travelers, we have to be even more attuned to the unique qualities of each nationality, Chinese travelers included. In 2011, recognizing China's rising outbound tourism, we launched a program called Hilton ""Huanying,"" which means ""welcome"" in Chinese. Hotels in our portfolio in the Huanying program offer Chinese-speaking front office staff, amenities such as teapots and slippers in guest rooms, Chinese-language TV channels and a range of traditional Chinese dishes such as congee, noodles and dim sum on the breakfast buffet. While we believe these are steps in the right direction, we are also aware that a lot more can be done to understand and court this fast-growing demographic. As much as the Chinese seek distinct experiences as they travel, we too must recognize that practices such as tipping and queuing are not as common in Chinese culture. And therein lies an opportunity for us as a hospitality company to play an active role in the educational process. For instance, Chinese guests staying at our Conrad Maldives Rangali Island resort are fascinated with the coral formations around the resort, and sometimes try to bring a piece back as a souvenir. Our resort team members receive cultural training that enables them to then educate their Chinese guests on the length of time coral takes to form and the fragility of the formations, and hence the importance of leaving them in their natural state. To put things into context, there was a comparable phenomenon years ago when other nationalities such as Americans and Japanese embarked on international travel, and went through similar ""growing pains."" However, the sheer size of China's population is such that when even 1% of the population travels, that is a huge number of people and as such their traits and behaviors are amplified, and inevitably more obvious. Ultimately though, it is a receptiveness to understand, coupled with mutual respect that endear people to learn from one another. We also firmly believe that to win the hearts and minds of the Chinese outbound traveler, we first need to build up strong brand equity within China itself. Being familiar with what a brand has to offer provides a level of trust and comfort to Chinese travelers as they venture further and further afield. I will not deny that the sheer size of China's outbound tourism numbers, combined with the speed at which travelers' tastes are changing, make it challenging for those in the travel or hospitality trade to adapt at an equal if not faster pace. But frankly, to not do so is at the peril of your business.","Martin Rinck: More and more Chinese are traveling around the world .
A more nuanced understanding of the cultural and social backgrounds of Chinese travelers is needed .

"London (CNN) -- Former tabloid editor and ex-Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson was sentenced Friday in London to 18 months in prison for phone hacking offenses. Coulson, who was editor of News of the World from 2003 to 2007, was convicted last week at the Old Bailey court of conspiracy to hack phones between 2000 and 2006. He had denied the charge. He could have been given up to two years in prison. Handing down sentences to Coulson and four of his former colleagues at the newspaper, owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Judge John Saunders said the Prime Minister's ex-aide had to face the heaviest penalty. ""There is insufficient evidence to conclude that he started the phone hacking, but there is ample evidence that it increased enormously while he was the editor,"" he said. ""On the jury's verdict he knew about it and encouraged it when he should have stopped it. It was his reputation as an editor and journalist, which was increased through the stories that were obtained by phone hacking and, even though he resigned, he did so with his reputation intact."" Coulson's former colleagues pleaded guilty to phone hacking charges before the case came to trial. Two of the four, journalists Neville Thurlbeck and Greg Miskiw, were each given a six-month prison sentence, reduced in part from what it could have been in light of their guilty pleas, the judge said. Journalist James Weatherup received a four-month sentence, suspended for a year, and 200 hours of community service. A suspended sentence means he should not go to prison unless he breaks the law in that time. Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for a year, and was also ordered to do 200 hours of community service. Sentencing Mulcaire, the judge described him as ""lucky."" The sentence was complicated by the fact that he had already been sent to prison for six months for phone hacking in 2007. This trial involved additional charges. The judge said that besides Mulcaire, the defendants ""are distinguished journalists who had no need to behave as they did to be successful"" but that their reputations in fact aided their wrongdoing. ""They all achieved a great deal without resorting to the unlawful invasion of other people's privacy. Those achievements will now count for nothing."" He added, ""All three have expressed remorse for what they have done. I am afraid that that has the appearance of regret for the consequences, both to them and others, of getting caught, rather than true remorse."" Coulson, Thurlbeck and Miskiw are all in custody and will start their sentences immediately. Victims of hacking . In his remarks to the court, the judge also recognized the controversy surrounding the case. ""There will be those who will be outraged that I haven't passed sentences well in excess of the permitted maximum,"" he said, ""and there will be those that think that it shouldn't be a crime for the press to intrude into the lives of the famous and that the legislation and this prosecution is in some way an attack on the freedom of the press to carry out their vital role as public watchdogs."" He also focused on the impact on the thousands of victims of phone hacking -- who were not just those who put themselves in the public eye. ""Targets of phone hacking were politicians, celebrities and royalty. In addition, there were people who were targeted simply because they were friends of, worked with or were related to famous people,"" the judge said. Journalists in search of stories listened to ""intensely personal"" messages that should have remained private, he said. As a result, information ""ended up as front page exclusives and caused serious upset and distress to the subjects and to those close to them,"" he said. It also fostered an ""undercurrent of distrust"" between friends and family who -- unaware of the News of the World's practices -- suspected each other of selling the information. He also commented on the News of the World's ""unforgivable"" hacking of the voice mail of murdered teenager Milly Dowler. ""The fact that they delayed telling the police of the contents of the voice mail demonstrates that their true motivation was not to act in the best interests of the child but to get credit for finding her and thereby sell the maximum number of newspapers,"" he said. The 168-year-old newspaper was closed down in 2011 in the wake of public outrage prompted by the hacking of Dowler's phone. Joan Smith of the media reform campaign group Hacked Off said the sentences had a ""symbolic importance"" beyond the individual penalties. ""I don't think the length of the sentences really matters very much,"" she told CNN. ""It's the fact that a court has said that this is not just unacceptable, but against the law. ""So it means as a society we are saying that we don't think that this behavior should happen and it will be punished."" Retrial on additional charges . Coulson faces a retrial on two charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office after the jury was unable to reach a decision. The newspaper's ex-royal editor, Clive Goodman, also faces a retrial on the same charges. Both have pleaded not guilty. Coulson resigned from the Sunday tabloid in January 2007 after its then-royal editor, Goodman, and Mulcaire were jailed for hacking into voice-mail messages left for royal aides. Coulson said he knew nothing about the hacking but resigned because he was editor of the paper at the time. In that July, then-opposition leader Cameron hired Coulson as his director of communications. Cameron became British Prime Minister in 2010, and Coulson moved with him to Downing Street. In January 2011, Coulson resigned from his post as coverage of the phone hacking scandal broadened. He insisted he was innocent but said he had become a distraction for the government. Cameron apologized in Parliament last week for hiring Coulson, saying it had been ""the wrong decision."" Another of Murdoch's former newspaper chiefs, Rebekah Brooks, was cleared of all charges after the eight-month trial at the Old Bailey court. Her husband and three others were also cleared of all the charges against them.

"Washington (CNN) -- The son of U.S. Sen. James Inhofe radioed that he was having control problems with his twin-engine airplane and that one of the engines had shut down shortly before the plane crashed November 10, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Perry Inhofe, an orthopedic surgeon in Tulsa and the only person on the plane, died in the Owasso, Oklahoma, crash. In a preliminary report, safety board investigators said Perry Inhofe had been cleared to land on runway 18 Left at Tulsa International Airport and had cleared the runway's outer marker when the plane began a left turn. When the air traffic controller asked Inhofe about the deviation, Inhofe reported that he had a control problem. ""The left turn continued, and the controller then cleared the pilot to maneuver to the west and asked if he needed assistance,"" the report reads. ""The pilot informed the controller that the left engine was shut down."" The controller declared an emergency for the pilot and asked about the number on board and the fuel remaining, but got no answer, the report says. The plane, a Mitsubishi MU 2B-25, completed a 360-degree turn before radar contact was lost. Several witnesses to the crash said one engine propeller appeared not to be rotating as the plane made a left turn and the wings began to rock back and forth. The plane then made a right turn, followed by a left turn, and a steep spiral to the left before it descended out of view, according to the report. The plane's fire-damaged wreckage was found in a wooded area five miles north of the airport. Eight days after the crash, Sen. Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, spoke on the Senate floor of his ""horrible loss,"" thanking the Senate chaplain and others for their tributes for his son.","Perry Inhofe radioed that one of his engines was out, plane had control problems .

"(CNN) -- It's a sentiment many of us have shared: ""Marriage isn't for me."" But when writer Seth Adam Smith shared concerns over his impending marriage with his father, his advice proved to have mass appeal. ""You don't marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy,"" Smith wrote in a blog post recounting his father's words. ""More than that, your marriage isn't for yourself, you're marrying for a family. Not just for the in-laws and all of that nonsense, but for your future children. Who do you want to help you raise them? Who do you want to influence them? Marriage isn't for you. It's not about you. Marriage is about the person you married."" By Thursday, four days after Marriage Isn't For You published, the post had received 24 million views, Smith said in a follow-up post on his blog. It led to a great deal of media coverage and TV appearances on the Today Show, Fox & Friends and more. ""Honestly, I thought that 5,000-10,000 clicks would have been a monumental accomplishment. So to see a number like 24 million is staggering, inspiring, overwhelming, and more than a little intimidating,"" Smith wrote in the post. Whether it's a fear of commitment, the complexities of cohabitation or just a love of one's own, blissfully uninterrupted company, there are an awful lot of deterrents to a stroll down the aisle.

"(CNN) -- It happens every four years, usually right around September. Calls come in from all over the United States from people threatening to flee their homeland if a candidate they despise wins the Oval Office. ""That's the amazing thing, when they speak on the phone. They're adamant. They feel very, very strong about it,"" said David Cohen, a Montreal-based immigration lawyer. ""'This government doesn't speak for me' is the language that we often hear."" As a partner at the Campbell Cohen firm, which specializes in immigration to Canada, Cohen says he has received these calls for decades. It sometimes makes him ""feel like a therapist because they vent for a while, get this cathartic release."" But when it comes down to it, Americans don't move to Canada unless it's for a relationship or new job -- essentially, love and money. Opinion: Where Obama, and America, go from here . Cohen says he can remember only three of four cases in more than 30 years that involved someone actually making good on their threat to move to Canada to escape an American president. This election cycle, he said, most of the calls ""tended to be conservative or Romney supporters. There were not as many from the other side, so maybe they had kind of a premonition."" It's all part of the election season's bluster cycle, and while partisan hot air is typical this time of year, this year's squabbling has been ""palpably ugly,"" even if most of it is just talk, said Jerrold Post, director of George Washington University's political psychology program and author of ""Political Paranoia: The Psychopolitics of Hatred."" ""That's always been the case: more extreme talk than actions,"" he said. ""You can entertain any idea you want to, but there's a difference between having an idea and acting on an idea."" ""But,"" Post added, ""throw enough ugly ideas into a pot and something is going to boil over."" Sure, Facebook and Twitter were rife with threats to leave the country if Barack Obama or Mitt Romney won, but we've also seen the more serious headlines. Bryan Fischer of the evangelical group the American Family Association reportedly said last week, ""I think there will be blood"" if Obama wins. In north Georgia, the president of the Cottages of Woodstock homeowners' association, a residential community for the elderly, said he would shut the complex's gates for fear of ""negative repercussions (that) may occur because of the results of the election,"" The New York Times reported. In August, Lubbock County, Texas, Judge Tom Head warned that the country could descend into civil war if Obama was re-elected and, as the county's emergency management coordinator, he considered whether he'd have to ""call out the militia"" if Obama ordered U.N. troops to quell the uprising. Opinion: Obama's critics, repudiated at last . More recently, after Tuesday's election results came in, real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump called for ""revolution!"" and urged his 1.8 million Twitter followers to ""march on Washington and stop this travesty."" He further called on them to ""fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice,"" while proclaiming the country was now in ""serious and unprecedented trouble...like never before."" Trump has since deleted the revolution missive. Post noted that Trump was at the forefront of the so-called ""birther movement,"" which falsely claims Obama wasn't born in the United States, so he wasn't surprised to see Trump sound off, but ""the intensity of that was rather shocking."" Best Election Night tweets . Asked if he thought Obama's race played a part in the vitriolic nature of the polemics around the country, Post said it ""seems to be an issue that was played upon, but you can certainly have hatred and delegitimization with two white candidates as well."" One place where race played a factor is Oxford, Mississippi, where Ole Miss students ""exchanged racial epithets and violent, politicized chants"" after Obama's re-election was announced, according to the student-run Daily Mississippian. University police had to ""forcibly disperse"" a crowd from a popular gathering spot on campus, the paper said. A university statement said the crowd reached 400 people at its pinnacle, and there were only two arrests for disorderly conduct. School Chancellor Dan Jones was quoted as saying Ole Miss ""universally condemned"" the racial epithets and uncivil language, and he regretted that a few students had tarnished the reputations of those classmates ""who are more representative of our university creed."" Obama makes history again . It appeared to be an isolated incident. In Lubbock County, GOP chairman Carl Tepper chuckled when asked if Judge Head's ominous prediction about Obama's re-election had come to fruition. ""No unrest,"" he said. ""Just a lot of disappointed people."" The staunchly conservative county voted more than seven to three for Romney, he said, so now the focus moves to strengthening the Republican Party and ""carrying our message of self-reliance to the rest of the country."" ""Republicans are pretty naturally a law-and-order-type people,"" he said. ""I'm still satisfied America has this amazing, peaceful process of selecting government. No matter who wins, we still have our rights, our businesses, our schools, and life goes on. We'll get 'em next time."" So, there are no tanks rolling through the nations' metropolises, no disappointed partisans reaching for their rifles. As Tepper said, life goes on, as it does after each election cycle, despite the disappointment of those in the losing candidate's camp. And those souls who swear they're abandoning this land for fear of Obama turning tyrannical in his second term? Yeah, not happening. Obama photo a social-media sensation . Cohen, the immigration lawyer, said that though the calls inquiring about Canadian citizenship will continue for the next few months, he feels Americans are simply too loyal to leave the country they love. ""I've had Americans tell me this: When your national anthem plays, the hair on their arms stands up, and that's not like most people in the world,"" he said. ""Americans at the end of the day are just a very patriotic group, and it doesn't matter what side you're on."" Post said he hopes bipartisanship will take hold on Capitol Hill, but it won't be easy because each party is torn by conflicting ideals: catering to their bases and governing in the best interest of the people. ""It's hard to reach across the aisle and get slapped down, but that's what has to happen. There's a lot of wounds to heal,"" Post said. No shortage of pressing issues for Obama's next term .","Montreal-based immigration attorney says Americans simply too patriotic to flee homeland .

"(Mental Floss) -- Have you ever been watching television and thought, ""Wow, this soap opera is so good it could cause the downfall of a corrupt communist regime,"" or even, ""I bet one day this show is going to send the first woman into space""? Well, maybe you're not giving the boob tube enough credit. Popular television shows have influenced politics in the United States and around the world. While others are busy blaming television for all of society's downfalls, we think it's time someone stood up for ye olde idiot box. After all, these 10 television shows didn't just entertain, they helped convince the world to get with the program. 1. ""DALLAS"" The Show that Overthrew a Dictator . (Well, kind of.) ""Dallas"" was one of the most popular TV shows in history -- and nowhere was it more talked about than in Nicolae Ceausescu's communist Romania. How did the soap opera get past Romanian censors? With help from ""Dallas"" leading man, J.R. Ewing, of course. Because J.R. was portrayed as a despicable oil baron, Ceausescu's government presumably decided the show must be anti-capitalist. Whatever the reasoning, ""Dallas"" became a runaway hit when it arrived in Romania in 1979. A series about wealthy, beautiful people (evil or not) was an inspiration to Romania's poor and dejected masses. Eventually, the government decided such Western television was a bad influence, and ""Dallas"" was taken off the air in 1981. But by then, it was too late. The fantasies of Western life lived on in the imaginations of Romanians, and in 1989, Ceausescu was overthrown during a public uprising. Not incidentally, the actor who played J.R., Larry Hagman, visited Romania some years later and was treated as a hero. In an interview following the experience, Hagman said, ""People from Bucharest came up to me in the street with tears in their eyes saying, 'J.R. saved our country.' "" 2. ""SEE IT NOW"" The Show that Ended McCarthyism . If you know your 1950s history (or if you saw the movie ""Good Night, and Good Luck""), you know the impact crusading journalist Edward R. Murrow had on American politics. His vehicle for galvanizing change? The current affairs show, ""See It Now,"" which premiered in 1951. Well known as a World War II radio correspondent, Murrow wasn't a fan of television initially. He wanted to go beyond the talking-head discussions and newsreels that filled most nightly news shows at the time. So when he finally decided to move forward with ""See It Now,"" he did so on his own terms. The show's debut episode featured television's first live coast-to-coast transmission, which included a split-screen of the Brooklyn Bridge on one side and the Golden Gate on the other. Murrow also broke new ground by airing a day in the lives of Korean War soldiers. Of course, the show's most influential role was in exposing Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist fear campaign and opening Americans' eyes to the many lives and careers it was ruining. Thanks in part to fallout from Murrow's broadcast on March 9, 1954, the U.S. Senate reprimanded McCarthy for abusing his power, and McCarthyism came to an abrupt end. Murrow wasn't afraid to take on rogue senators, and later, he proved he wasn't scared to take on Big Tobacco, either. Two episodes of ""See It Now"" explored the link between cigarettes and cancer -- a brave move, considering television depended heavily on tobacco sponsorships at the time. But perhaps Murrow had a personal interest in the story. A three-pack-a-day smoker who regularly appeared on camera with a cigarette in hand, Murrow died of lung cancer in 1965. 3. ""GENERAL ELECTRIC THEATER"" The Show that Turned Ronald Reagan into a Republican . In the early 1950s, film actor Ronald Reagan was at a low point in his career. So when Taft Schreiber, of the Music Corporation of America, got him a gig as the host of the anthology series ""General Electric Theater,"" Reagan jumped at the opportunity. For $125,000 a year and part-ownership of the program, he not only hosted the show, but also toured America as a ""goodwill ambassador"" for the electricity giant, giving speeches to plant employees and acting as its public spokesperson. By the time ""General Electric Theater"" was cancelled in 1962, Reagan was a new man. Turns out, all those years defending free enterprise for one of the nation's biggest multinational companies had transformed Reagan into one of America's leading conservative speakers. Although the actor had long been a Democrat, the Republican Schreiber convinced Reagan to change political parties. Four years later, the newly Republican Reagan was elected governor of California, and the rest is presidential history. 4. ""CATHY COME HOME"" The Drama that Transformed the Welfare State . Directed by Ken Loach (who later became one of Britain's most respected filmmakers), the drama ""Cathy Come Home"" was a poignant episode of the BBC-1 anthology series The Wednesday Play. It told the tragic story of Cathy Ward, a young wife and mother who becomes the victim of Britain's welfare state. Going from working-class struggle to dire poverty, Cathy's journey begins when her husband loses his job following an accident and becomes unable to support the family. In a painful spiral toward destitution, Cathy suffers through various states of homelessness, separates from her husband, and eventually, has her children forcibly taken away from her by government council workers. A truly horrifying story, its impact was compounded by the fact that ""Cathy Come Home"" was filmed in such a realistic style that some viewers thought it was a documentary. And although the Conservative Party government claimed the movie was ""full of blunders,"" Labour Party politician Anthony Greenwood said the show should be ""compulsory viewing once a month for the next five years."" British audiences agreed, and ""Cathy Come Home"" was aired again shortly after. The ensuing public outrage helped bring major changes to British welfare law. Other nations followed suit, with similar reforms and charities. 5. ""THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS COMEDY HOUR"" The Show that Swung an Election . ""The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour"" was many things. It was the first network TV show to make fun of the Establishment, support America's counterculture, and have enough nerve to put blacklisted singers (such as Joan Baez and Pete Seeger) back on the air. Ironically, however, the show's major achievement might have been making Richard Nixon president. As a gag, show star Pat Paulsen ran for office during the 1968 presidential election. ""I'm consistently vague on the issues,"" announced Paulsen on national television, ""and I'm continuing to make promises that I'll be unable to fulfill."" Regardless of his humorous motives, Paulsen seemed to have a ""Ralph Nader Effect,"" stealing 200,000 votes from the Democrats and helping to swing one of the closest elections in history. Thanks to Paulsen's efforts, Nixon narrowly defeated Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey. ""Hubert Humphrey told me I cost him the election,"" recalled Paulsen, ""and he wasn't smiling when he said it."" E-mail to a friend . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- Radical Islamists are compiling a list of unmarried mothers in northern Mali, raising fears of cruel punishments such as stoning, amputations and executions, a senior United Nations official said. Islamists controlling most of the north have vowed to impose a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. Local radical groups have said the law condemns relationships outside marriage. The U.N. assistant secretary-general for human rights, who just returned from a visit to Mali, said there are reports Islamist groups are compiling lists of women who have had children out of wedlock, or who were unmarried and pregnant. ""The threat is there, it's real and people live with it and they are afraid of those lists,"" Ivan Simonovic said this week. ""This could indicate that these women are at imminent risk of being subjected to cruel and inhumane punishment."" In July, Islamists forced a man and a woman into two holes and stoned them to death for committing adultery as terrified residents quietly watched in remote Aguelhok town. Extremists have conducted public executions, amputations, floggings and other inhuman and degrading punishments, Simonovic said. European official: Al Qaeda threat in northern Africa 'spreading' Women and children face greater risk, he said. More women in the region are ending up in forced marriages. And with wives costing less than $1,000, husbands are also reselling the women, according to Simonovic. He said the process is ""a smokescreen for enforced prostitution and rapes"" occurring in the region. ""Civil and political rights are being severely restricted as a result of the imposition of a strict interpretation of sharia law, and systemic cruel and inhumane punishments are being implemented,"" Simonovic said. The militants are also buying children and enlisting them as soldiers, paying their families $600 -- a major incentive in a country where more than half the population lives on $1.25 a day, he said. In addition, the Islamists have also banned smoking, drinking, watching sports on television and listening to music. ""We don't have to answer to anyone over the application of sharia,"" Islamist commissioner Aliou Toure said in August. ""This is the form of Islam practiced for thousands of years."" Mali plunged into chaos in March after a military ruler overthrew the president, shaking one of West Africa's most stable democracies. The coup leader stepped down in May and transferred power to a civilian transitional government, but uncertainty looms. Ethnic Tuareg rebels and Islamist militants took advantage of the chaos to seize the northern portion of the country. Months later, two groups with ties to al Qaeda toppled the Tuareg movement. The two groups now control two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. West African states and the nation's transitional government have asked the U.N. Security Council to authorize the military intervention to oust the radical groups. The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution Friday that gives regional leaders 45 days to provide specific plans for an international military intervention to oust the rebels. In its resolution, the U.N. Security Council condemned human rights abuses by extremist groups, including ""hostage-taking, pillaging, theft, destruction of cultural and religious sites, and recruitment of child soldiers."" The primary responsibility to curtail abuses rests with the transitional government, but those outside the West African nation have a role to play as well, the Security Council said. A day before the resolution was approved, thousands marched in the capital of Bamako to back efforts to send international troops to the north. Jihadists are using the north for drugs and arms trade, to train recruits and plan new attacks, according to Alpha Moulaye Haidara, a leader of a group of northern Malians advocating action. ""It's unacceptable what the Islamists have done,"" said Papa Maiga, who attended the march. ""I'm here to say Mali needs help, and I hope the international community listens."" Journalist Katarina HÃ¶ije contributed to this report.","Women are living in fear of cruel punishments such as stoning and executions .

"(CNN) -- Shipping containers have long been a sturdy mainstay of global maritime trade. In the city of Brighton, on the southern English coast, the durable metal boxes now also provide a low-cost housing option. In early December Brighton Housing Trust (BHT) and property developer, QED, opened 36 shipping containers retrofitted with kitchens, bathrooms and insulated plaster-board walls. The units have been erected on spare land in the city and will be used to house local homeless people, the number of which has been increasing steadily in recent years, according to BHT chief executive, Andy Winter. See also: Where is the world's most valuable property? ""There's a chronic shortage of affordable housing in Brighton,"" Winter told CNN. ""I was initially very skeptical about housing people in metal boxes ... but the containers have been converted to an extremely high standard."" Temporary accommodation like this ""could really make a difference in the short term,"" he added. While the concept of transforming shipping containers into housing units has been experimented with before -- including in Amsterdam, where containers are used to house students, and London, where they offer a quirky waterside abode beside the Thames -- Winter believes the idea, or similar iterations of the concept, could offer a timely solution to urban housing challenges the world over. Low supply, lack of available land as well as stringent planning laws have seen rents and property prices soar in many major cities in recent years. Houses prices in London increased by 10% in a single month in October, according to property experts, Rightmove. See also: Mumbai's rising property starlet . Small, unobtrusive and easy to assemble housing could, as such, provide a quick and cost effective solution to these growing concerns, Winter believes. Various prototype designs and inventive micro-homes concepts have popped up in the likes of Germany, Sweden and the United States in recent years. Some come in the shape of standalone miniature structures while others consist of entire apartment blocks. According to Ian Kent, the president of Nomad, a Canadian company that has designed a 10 foot by 10 foot ""micro-house"" that can be purchased for as little as $25,000 and shipped to virtually any location in the world, the concept could solve all manner of growing housing problems. See also: China's crazy property bubble . ""Cities all over the world are letting us know they are in dire need of this. The size by default makes everything easier to build (and) maintenance while running it. It becomes a great solution for housing,"" Kent said. He also highlights the possibility of their use in developing nations with fast growing cities, as a emergency accommodation in the aftermath of natural disasters as well as being collected on a piece of property as a community, like a university campus.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Former President Jimmy Carter reiterated Wednesday that he believes racism is an issue for President Obama in trying to lead the country. In Atlanta, Georgia, on Wednesday, Jimmy Carter again linked harsh Obama criticism to racism. ""When a radical fringe element of demonstrators and others begin to attack the president of the United States as an animal or as a reincarnation of Adolf Hitler or when they wave signs in the air that said we should have buried Obama with Kennedy, those kinds of things are beyond the bounds,"" the Democrat who served from 1977-1981 told students at Emory University. ""I think people who are guilty of that kind of personal attack against Obama have been influenced to a major degree by a belief that he should not be president because he happens to be African American. ""It's a racist attitude, and my hope is and my expectation is that in the future both Democratic leaders and Republican leaders will take the initiative in condemning that kind of unprecedented attack on the president of the United States,"" Carter said.  Watch Carter speak at Emory » . Carter's comments came a day after he said racial politics played a role in South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson's outburst during Obama's speech to Congress last week and in some of the opposition the president has faced since taking office. ""I think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man, that he's African-American,"" Carter told ""NBC Nightly News."" ""I live in the South, and I've seen the South come a long way, and I've seen the rest of the country that shares the South's attitude toward minority groups at that time, particularly African-Americans."" Michael Steele, the first African-American to chair the Republican National Committee, denied Wednesday that race is fueling protests.  Watch Lou Dobbs' guests debate the issue » . ""President Carter is flat-out wrong,"" Steele said in a statement. ""This isn't about race. It is about policy."" The House voted Tuesday to formally disapprove of Wilson's behavior during the joint session of Congress. The resolution was approved largely along party lines, with Republicans calling the measure unnecessary partisan politics. Wilson apologized to the White House last week, but congressional Democrats said he owed the chamber a similar statement of regret. Steele said Democrats are just trying to divert attention from what he called the president's ""wildly unpopular government-run health care plan."" Actor and comedian Bill Cosby, who is black, said Wednesday in a written statement that he agrees with Carter. ""During President Obama's speech on the status of health care reform, some members of Congress engaged in a public display of disrespect,"" he said.  Watch Carter link animosity toward Obama to racism » . ""While one representative hurled the now infamous 'you lie' insult at the president, others made their lack of interest known by exhibiting rude behavior such as deliberately yawning and sending text messages."" Carter's comments on racism came during his 28th annual town hall meeting at Emory, where he has been a professor since 1982. He spoke an a variety of issues. Carter criticized former President George W. Bush for his handling of North Korea, whose then-leader Kim Il Sung had persuaded by Carter to abandon his nuclear ambitions and allow international inspectors into the country. ""Unfortunately, when President George W. Bush came into office, he threw away all of those agreements ... and declared that North Korea was one of the 'axis-of-evil' "" nations, Carter said. That led the current North Korean president, Kim Jong Il, to order the reprocessing of the nation's spent nuclear fuel rods, to expel the inspectors and to explode two nuclear devices, destabilizing the region, Carter said. The former president said top U.S. officials should consider acceding to North Korea's requests by negotiating directly with its leaders, guaranteeing not to launch an attack against the country and, over a period of time, establishing full diplomatic relations. ""I don't see why we shouldn't,"" he said. ""That's the only thing that can keep North Korea from continuing with their reprocessing of fuel."" But Carter predicted Bush would do well as a former president. ""I suspect he is going to fulfill his destiny in a very admirable way,"" the Sunday School teacher from Plains, Georgia, said. Asked what he would do if he were allowed to return to office for a single day, the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize winner said: ""Bring peace to Israel and its neighbors."" He predicted that global warming will occupy much of  Obama's time once a health plan is passed and said the United States needs to wean itself from its dependence on imported oil. Carter noted that when he became president in 1977, the nation was importing 8.6 million barrels of oil per day. By 1982, that number had been halved to 4.3 million. ""Now, it's 13 million barrels per day, and we're heavily dependent, as you know, on imported oil from some countries that don't really care about our own well-being."" Carter cited Egyptian President Anwar Sadat as the most interesting person he met during his presidency. He praised Sadat for allying with him in 1979 to forge a peace treaty with Israel. Carter blamed ""political problems"" for his inability to overhaul the nation's health care system in 1979 so that all 15 million Americans then without health insurance would have gotten coverage. That number has tripled in the intervening years. He also said he opposes sex-ed programs in the nation's public schools that teach abstinence only, saying such programs only increase the number of abortions and unwanted children. The 84-year-old former politician said the best moment of his life -- so far -- was when Rosalynn Smith told him 63 years ago that she would marry him. The former president also took a swipe at rapper Kanye West's behavior on Sunday, when he jumped onstage during the MTV Video Music Awards and took the microphone from country singer Taylor Swift during her would-be acceptance speech for the Best Female Video. West declared that Beyonce Knowles should have won. ""I thought it was completely uncalled for and his punishment was to appear on the new Jay Leno show,"" Carter said. His reference to West's television appearance as punishment was tongue-in-cheek, since the musician had been booked on the show long before the incident took place. On Monday, West appeared on the debut of Leno's 10 p.m. show and said he knew his actions were wrong. Swift said on Tuesday that West had called her directly and apologized.","Carter follows up Tuesday comments, again linking Obama criticism, race .

His trademark dreadlocks and ferocious forehand were melded to a happy-go-lucky attitude, and a genuine sense of fun on the court. Perhaps that is why his 1983 French Open victory in front of a rapturous crowd at Roland Garros in Paris is still held in such reverence. That, and his stint as captain of his country's Davis Cup team in which he led France's men to their first title in the prestigious competition for 59 years. A year after his second triumph as captain, he switched to the Fed Cup, skippering France's ladies to their first crown. For tennis fans in France, he can do no wrong. But now it is all about the music, after his impromptu jam sessions with fellow major winners John McEnroe and Jim Courier -- among others -- spawned a thriving second career path. ""I just loved it so much I kept doing it,"" Noah explains. ""The difference is that once I just wrote on a piece of paper some lyrics and then put some drums, and then this thing became No. 1 and that was an accident. ""I was not prepared for that. I started to do TV shows, write some more songs and the next thing I know I am doing little clubs with my own band. ""We started to play in tennis events and then one day we had an album that sold millions, so that was a big difference for all of us. After a few years preparing, playing clubs, we started to play big venues."" This is where Noah's prowess as a champion tennis player came to the fore. Having performed in front of thousands of expectant fans -- no more so than on court at Roland Garros in 1983 -- he was used to the acute demands it would bring. ""The pressure before a game is so much stronger and intense than before you go on the stage; of course it is pressure, but I mean you are in a locker room playing this other guy,"" he says. ""I am prepared for the pressure as a professional athlete. I think you are really prepared for intense pressure because you are under pressure every game. You lose and it hurts -- physically, mentally, it hurts. You don't have that in music. ""Competition is not that healthy, I would say. While I will be in the same locker room as now when I am going to do the concert and there's 15,000 people and I hear 10 minutes before the concert people going 'Yannick, Yannick' -- they all came because they love me. ""And nothing to do with ego, but I know they came because they like me so I'm going to do my best to make them happy. This is my family waiting for me not some other guys just waiting to criticize me and write something in a paper ... I'm not like this or I missed a backhand down the line. ""Music is supposed to be just fun -- that's it -- so yes I enjoy it. It's all about passion. That's who I am, if I don't have passion I am not delivering."" Passion was a defining characteristic of Noah's career on court. It permeated his run to the French Open final 31 years ago, and was replicated on the streets of Paris as the capital rallied round its rising star. Heading into the tournament seeded at six, Noah enjoyed a comfortable passage to the quarterfinals where Ivan Lendl lay in wait. Like Noah, the Czech was yet to capture a major title -- he would go on to win eight, including the French the following year -- but was beaten in four sets. By the time Noah had brushed aside fellow Frenchman Christophe Roger-Vasselin in a one-sided semifinal, the wave of national euphoria he was riding made defeat in the final seem inconceivable. And when he duly beat Sweden's Mats Wilander, a posse of friends and family -- led by Noah's father -- rushed on court to celebrate with the champion, who was soon engulfed by a delirious public. But despite the reverence in which this iconic moment is held -- he was the first Frenchman to win it since 1946 -- and the fact that Noah's defining career moment happened at Roland Garros, it isn't a place he relishes returning to. ""I've had there the best moments of my life more than 30 years ago -- it's right here in my heart forever,"" he says of his sole grand slam triumph. ""I have my best moment on tape of my life. So every time I see it, every time I think about it I am complete. ""I don't need to go back to know the real thing -- I lived it, it's in my heart, it's in my memory forever, nobody can take that away from me. ""But I rather go to the U.S. Open or Wimbledon incognito, especially now with my short hair -- nobody knows who I am. ""In France if I go to Roland Garros there is just too much love, I cannot walk around so I cannot watch a game, I cannot watch, I like to walk around, have a beer, it's impossible. ""Even though I love my French Open, I don't have this luxury."" Noah's son knows a thing or two about adulation too. Joakim was recently crowned Defensive Player of the Year in the NBA as his Chicago Bulls side were defeated in the first round of the playoffs. He's been playing for the iconic basketball outfit since 2007 and is contracted on a multimillion-dollar deal until the end of 2017. ""I am proud but I am the happiest father -- how happy can you be when your son is fulfilling and living his dream?"" says Noah, whose father was a footballer from Cameroon who played for French clubs. ""Every time I see him getting introduced, I get emotional, I get tears in my eyes. ""I always go back to this little kid who said, 'One day I will play on the NBA.' I said 'Yeah kid' but then he kept trying, posters all over his bedroom, basketball players, watching tapes, playing all the time, not being so good but always this passion. ""When I see Joakim today -- All Star, Chicago center -- I see my baby with this same passion."" Passion is a word that proliferates Noah's vocabulary, even when talking about the current state of men's tennis in France. There are four French players in the top 30 ahead of the 2014 French Open, which starts Sunday. So who does he think has the best chance to emulate his victory? ""I'm going to surprise you, I think (Gael) Monfils can do it,"" he says of the world No. 24. ""From what I know he's not working as hard as he should on a regular basis. He can work hard and then he gives up for a while. But I think he's the one who could have the opportunity to beat these beasts, (Rafael) Nadal and (Novak) Djokovic. ""To win the French Open you have to understand you have to beat not one of these guys but two of them. That's tough.""","Frenchman Yannick Noah has gone from grand slam winner to rock star .

"(CNN) -- Twitter users can now let any person, company or, presumably, drunken green monster send them private messages on the site. The feature appears to be rolling out gradually. Some users had the ability as of Tuesday, while others didn't. And it's not automatic: Users will have to opt in to it to enable the new feature. Until now, people could send private messages on Twitter to people who follow them but not to others. The move comes as Twitter, which is wildly popular (it crossed the 200 million-user mark in March) but not yet profitable, prepares to offer its stock publicly. As word of the new feature rolled out, that had many users speculating, not always positively, about how companies could use the feature to spread the word about their products. ""Should be renamed 'Check this box if you would like 99% more spam!' "" wrote a commenter on a story from tech site The Verge. In addition to allowing brands to send personal messages, or receive them, the new feature could be used by media sites to send news alerts. Twitter has experimented with a service that would send links to news articles to users privately. Early observations Tuesday of the change, which Twitter has not acknowledged publicly, were focusing on the potential upsides and downsides. ""Enabling this option could potentially mean open season on your Twitter inbox,"" wrote Darrell Etherington for TechCrunch, ""and that's probably why it's off by default -- but if dealing with a potential influx of spam is worth opening up a new channel of communication for you, then this is a welcome change indeed.""","Twitter is making direct messages open to people you don't follow .

"(CNN) -- Lou Hablas has supported Livestrong for years and worn the iconic yellow bracelet in honor of his uncle, stepmother and friends who have lost loved ones to cancer. He also has volunteered for the cancer charity as a photographer at sporting events that raise money for Livestrong's programs. The 49-year-old Georgia resident says he'll continue to wear the bracelet despite news that embattled cyclist Lance Armstrong is stepping down as chairman of the charity he founded 15 years ago. But the poster of Armstrong leading his Discovery teammates in the team time trial at the 2005 Tour de France is coming down from his office wall amid news that the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency found ""overwhelming"" evidence of Armstrong's involvement in doping as a professional cycler. ""As a human being who has watched too many people suffer the loss of a loved one -- especially children -- I love what Lance created in Livestrong,"" Hablas said. ""As a cyclist, I love what Lance accomplished, though like so many others I always suspected that he was guilty of doping."" Like many who admired the accomplished cyclist and cancer research advocate, Hablas is attempting to reconcile images of Armstrong as a fallen hero and a cancer survivor who used his stardom to dramatically change the stigma attached to the disease. ""What Lance initiated through the formation of a foundation in his name and efforts through Livestrong far exceed this formal and seemingly final recognition of Lance's fallibility,"" Hablas said in a CNN iReport. ""Cancer sucks and it is much bigger than Lance Armstrong."" In the wake of news that the allegations cost Armstrong a major endorsement deal and chairmanship of Livestrong, CNN iReport solicited views on Twitter on Armstrong's conflicting legacy using the hashtag #livestrongthoughts. Also, the International Cycling Union announced Monday that Armstrong is being stripped of his Tour de France titles. ""Casting the doping allegations aside, Lance Armstrong did more good than bad, he changed a generation's view on cancer,"" tweeted Eric Liu, echoing a common sentiment. ""My #livestrongthoughts are it's not about Lance but about helping cancer patients. Doper or not, cancer patients rely on #livestrong,"" user Alex Anderson said. Others, however, who saw Armstrong as a symbol of hope and solidarity were completely devastated by his fall, with some cynically wondering if Livestrong was a front to deflect attention from doping allegations. ""It seemed that only a few years after his early comeback, he reverted into the same crass and cocky fella he was known to be pre-cancer. He lost any humility and never seemed contrite or thankful to be alive anymore,"" iReporter Paul Smeulders said. 'It appeared he started using LIVESTRONG as a brand to elevate himself and as a shield to cover or dodge criticism of his unsportsmanlike behavior."" Wendy Adams of Manchester, Pennsylvania, and her sisters have been wearing their yellow bracelets since their father was diagnosed with end stage prostate cancer in 2004. ""We bought bracelets for more strength, for unity, and suddenly Lance wasn't just an athlete any longer, he was hope,"" Adams, 51, said in a CNN iReport. ""We were connected to others who were proudly wearing the same [bracelet] yet living this horror of cancer, all of us, together with Lance, a man who went through it, and came out stronger and better."" When her father died in 2005, the family respected his wish to be cremated wearing the bracelet and spent $200 dollars on the bracelets for family and friends to hand out. Now, she says she can't wear the bracelet with pride anymore because of its connection to Armstrong and the organization. She has taken it off and vows to never again wear it. ""My heart is broken by this news. I never thought Lance was involved in doping, I thought he was above it, an honest man with integrity and honor,"" she said. ""Lance is Livestrong, he is the face of hope. And when that face is that of a liar, a manipulator, for me? I can't wear it with pride anymore."" Still many see the charity as something bigger than Armstrong and plan to continue supporting the charity and wearing the bracelet. Less certain is whether Armstrong will retain his hero status. Sarah Atwell, a 29-year-old breast cancer survivor, said she'll continue to wear the bracelet because of what it means for those who have been touched by the disease. ""To me, the organization has become more than Lance. It has established itself as a valuable resource for cancer survivors and families and that is more important than these allegations,"" Atwell said in an iReport. ""The yellow wrist band that I wear each day reminds me of all that I have been through, the people I have known and lost along the way, and that we have a long way to go in our collective fight against cancer,"" she said. ""It represents my friend Adam's struggle and shows cancer survivors that others are thinking about cancer."" Avid cyclist Eric Hoffman lost his father to bladder cancer in 2001, two painful months after his diagnosis. ""My father's death afforded me the opportunity to look at life in a very different way. That day that I saw him close his eyes for the last time, I knew that I didn't want anyone else to have to go through the same experience that he did."" He purchased a Livestrong bracelet as a sign of hope, strength and perseverance against the disease, he said. ""I also use it as a reminder, when I'm climbing those long lonely steep canyons on the bike, that the pain and suffering that I'm enduring is pittance and short-lived compared to what others are experiencing in their battle against cancer,"" Hoffman, 42, said in an iReport. When a friend recently asked if he still wears the bracelet, Hoffman told him, ""it'll come off when there's a cure for cancer."" ""I still wear the bracelet and always will until this thing is cured. It helps me to maintain focus on what is important."" Carlos Rosado, and iReporter, believes that Armstrong's controversy has tainted Livestrong's legacy. Rosado has supported the charity since its inception, but he would like to see its name changed in order to continue his support. He also says that Armstrong should no longer be the face of the charity. ""Seven Tour de France wins is a long time to keep up a lie. He was worshipped and adored by many people,"" said Rosado, 42. ""If you can't accomplish the feat without cheating then it is not a feat,"" he said. ""It is a lie, and lots of people were looking up to those lies."" ""Like"" CNN Living on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people across the world railed against corporate power, grinding poverty and government cuts Saturday as the Occupy Wall Street movement spread to the streets of Europe, Asia and Australia -- and took a particularly violent turn in Rome. Firefighters battled a blaze at an Interior Ministry building near Porta San Giovanni in Rome, the main gathering site of the Italian protesters taking part in the Occupy movement Saturday, said eyewitnesses who reported seeing a Molotov cocktail thrown near the building. A spokesman for Mayor Gianni Alemanno, who condemned the violence, confirmed 70 people were injured, 40 of them police officers. No arrest numbers were available late Saturday. Police said hundreds of anarchists in Rome moved in where peaceful demonstrators had gathered as part of the global Occupy movement. The anarchists -- some wearing ski masks and belonging to a group termed ""Black Bloc"" -- torched cars, broke windows and clashed with police. ""It's been completely hijacked by these violent factions, and the police are nervous, and the situation is very tense,"" Barbie Nadeau, a Newsweek correspondent, told CNN. ""I myself saw at least -- I would say -- a dozen people who probably needed some hospitalization or some care -- some stitches certainly."" Two police officers were seriously injured and two young men lost parts of their hands in explosions when protesters torched cars, she said. In London, protester Peter Vaughn, reflecting the mood of many in the crowd there, said people criticized financial institutions that have ""gambled away our money."" ""We're giving people a real voice against a government that just ignored us,"" he said. One protester in Belleville, France, referring to the country's leaders, said government isn't listening to the people and dialogue with them is impossible. ""You are not listening to us, whatever we do, however we vote, however we demonstrate. It does not give any result. Quite the opposite, as poverty and austerity plans continue. So we can't go on like this so we are getting out and showing ourselves,"" he said. The protests spread amid the growing financial crises for several Western countries. Finance ministers with the Group of 20, meeting in Paris, pledged Saturday to take ""all necessary actions"" to stabilize global markets and ensure that banks are well capitalized. Europeans turned out amid debt troubles and austerity plans in Greece, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Germany. United for Global Change -- the central site for the movement organizing worldwide protests -- said 951 cities in 82 countries were to take part in the demonstrations after online organizers called for a worldwide rally. More than 10,000 demonstrators of all ages gathered peacefully in Madrid's spacious Plaza de Cibeles on Saturday and than walked uphill to Puerta del Sol. The ""May 15 Movement"" started five months ago to the day over austerity measures and high unemployment. Some demonstrators said they felt Spain's protest had gone global and that the world had joined the movement started in their country. The newspaper El Pais said tens of thousands of protesters turned out in Barcelona. Around the world, protesters marched, listened to speeches, and displayed banners reading anti-corporate slogans, including the now ubiquitous ""we are the 99%,"" ""Banks are cancer"" and tax the rich 1%."" The vandalism that erupted in Rome angered peaceful protesters. There were car fires and masked people breaking windows at banks and stores, where many thousands faced a large police presence. Firefighters were working to contain the blaze and the tensions calmed down in the evening hours. But the echo of Molotov cocktails could be heard and a lingering cloud of black smoke could be seen, Nadeau told CNN. In Germany, police used pepper spray on two protesters who crossed beyond police lines. Still, the demonstrations across the world were peaceful overall, inspired by the protests in the United States. In London, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke to demonstrators. The demonstrations are contained to an area in front of St. Paul's Cathedral. There have also been three arrests, two for assault on police. ""What is happening here today is a culmination of greed that many people all over the world have worked towards from Cairo to London,"" Assange said. Tens of thousands demonstrated in German cities, witnesses said. Peaceful protests with a festive atmosphere blended with a mood of anger toward big business, where demonstrators carried signs saying ""Goldman Sucks,"" ""Eat Cash,"" ""People should not be afraid of their government,"" and ""The government should be afraid of their people."" ""They are stealing our rights,"" one banner read at a demonstration of several thousand people in Madrid. Canadians turned out in Toronto, with placards jutting up from a crowd saying ""Arrest the 1%"" and ""Stop ignoring the youth, we are your tomorrow."" A sign on a dog said ""99% against (corporate) fat cats."" Retired businessman Wong Chi Keung, in Hong Kong, said, ""We should not let the banks get away with being big bullies."" Debbie Chen works for a group protesting against Apple's treatment of its workers in China. ""As the world's most valuable company they earn the lion's share while the workers on the production line earn only 1% of the selling price of an iPhone. We hope there can be more even distribution of profits,"" she said. About 200 people marched through Tokyo carrying various signs, including ""No More Nukes and ""Free Tibet."" The crowd included children jumping and skipping behind the adults. Some protesters wore costumes -- including a giant panda. ""I'm here because young Japanese people are suffering for losing their jobs, but not many speak out their issue to the public,"" said Kesao Murakami. ""I really want young people to appeal forcefully to the public saying, 'We are in trouble.' "" In the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, about two dozen people -- some wearing masks -- gathered near the U.S. Embassy. ""We wanted to show that the American regime, its system of imperialism needs to be destroyed,"" said Rudi Daman, leader of the International League of Peoples' Struggle. The group urged its chapters to stage a global day of action against ""imperialist plunder, repression and war."" Australian cities of Melbourne and Sydney joined rallies against ""corporate greed"" as protesters aligned themselves with the global movement. ""Our protests are to show our solidarity with Occupy Wall Street and also protest various problems -- from indigenous issues in this country to government problems,"" said Alex Gard, one of the Melbourne organizers. ""We know we have it better than the protesters in the States ... but there are still problems in this country."" Organizers urged protesters to bring sleeping bags and other soft items to sleep on. ""I've heard people say they plan to be there for days, even months,"" Gard said. Organizers worldwide started social media pages on Facebook and Twitter devoted to ""October 15"" â€” #O15 on Twitter â€” urging protesters to join the global call for protests. The worldwide movement is galvanized by the Occupy Wall Street movement started last month as a backlash against the economy and what demonstrators say is an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite. Occupy Wall Street organizers say they are inspired by the Arab Spring that led to the toppling of regimes in Tunisia and Egypt. The founding movement in the United States has spread to other major cities in the nation.

"(CNN) -- Are you addicted to your phone? According to recent research sponsored by SecurEnvoy, an internet security firm, more people feel anxious and tense when they are out of reach of their phone -- and the younger they are, the more likely the stress. Known as ""nomophobia,"" or ""no mobile-phone phobia,"" a recent online survey of 1,000 people in the UK found that almost two thirds (66%) of respondents were afflicted, a rise of 11% when compared to a similar study four years ago. ""Some people get panic attacks when they are not with their phones,"" said Michael Carr-Gregg, an adolescent psychologist working in Melbourne. ""Others become very anxious and make all endeavors to locate the mobile phone. I have clients who abstain from school or their part-time jobs to look for their phones when they cannot find them in the morning."" CNN Photos: De-Vice: Our mobile addiction . According to the survey, the younger you are, the more prone you are to nomophobia. The youngest age group (18 -24) tops the nomophobic list at 77%, which is 11% more than that of the next group -- those aged 25-34. ""This is the most tribal generation of young people,"" said Carr-Gregg. ""Adolescents want to be with their friends on a 24-hour basis."" Women are also more likely to be unnerved by cell phone separation, with 70% of respondents reporting the malady compared to 61% of men. Andy Kemshall, the CTO and co founder of secure Envoy, believes that may be because men are more likely to have two phones and are less likely to misplace both -- 47% of men carry two phones, compared to only 33% of women. Major drivers of nomophobia include boredom, loneliness, and insecurity, said Carr-Gregg, while some young nomophobes cannot bear solitude. ""Many of my clients go to bed with their mobile phones while sleeping just like how one will have the teddy bear in the old days,"" he said. ""While teddy doesn't communicate, the phone does,"" said Carr-Gregg, adding insomnia to the list of potential problems. ""This reduced the amount of time to reflect,"" he said. ""Some kids cannot entertain themselves. The phone has become our digital security blanket."" As smartphone penetration spreads across the globe, so does nomophobia. On a visit to Singapore in February this year, Carr-Gregg spoke to students from a peer support group at the United World College and identified similar problems. ""There is no doubt that nomophobia is international,"" he said. ""[But] without phones, there will not be nomophobia."" Meanwhile, Indian researchers have also evaluated mobile phone dependence among students at M.G.M. Medical College and the associated hospital of central India. India, after China, is the second largest mobile phone market in the world. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) reported that there were 884.37 million mobile connections in India as of November, while China had 963.68 million. The cross-sectional study, published by the Indian Journal of Community Medicine three years ago, recruited 200 medical students and scholars. About one in five students were nomophobic, results showed. The study claimed that the mobile phone has become ""a necessity because of the countless perks that a mobile phone provides like personal diary, email dispatcher, calculator, video game player, camera and music player."" ""There is an increase in the nomophobic population in India because the number of mobile phone users has increased,"" said Dr. Sanjay Dixit, one the researchers and the head of the Indian Journal of Community Medicine. ""We are currently doing another research on mobile phone dependency, it's not published yet, but analysis shows that about 45% of the Indian population, not just medical students, is nomophobic."" With the augmented ownership and usage of smartphones among adolescents, Dixit says the young population is more at risk, partly because they can access the Internet through phones more easily, increasing the time spent on phones. ""We found out that people who use mobile phones for more than three hours a day have a higher chance of getting nomophobia,"" he said, warning this can pose potential dangers. Accidents lurk while nomophobes fix their attention on phones. According to Dixit, up to 25% nomophobes reported accidents while messaging or talking on the phone, which includes minor road accidents, falling while going upstairs or downstairs and stumbling while walking. More than 20% also reported pain in the thumbs due to excessive texting. ""One could look at this as a form of addiction to the phone,"" said Eric Yu Hai Chen, a psychiatrist and professor at The University of Hong Kong. ""The fear is part of the addiction. The use of hand phone has some features that predispose this activity to addiction, similar to video games, naming, easy access."" To tackle anxiety and accidents induced by phones, Dixit suggests switching off the phone, especially while driving. ""People can also carry a charger all the time,"" he said. ""Our study shows that the no-battery-situation upsets nomophobes the most. ""People can also prepay phone cards for emergency calls and credit balance in phones to ensure a constant and functioning network,"" he said. Other solutions include supplying friends with an alternate contact number and storing important phone numbers somewhere else as backups. ""Enforcing a period when handset is turned off can help loosen its hold over everyday life,"" said Dixit. Sometimes, the problem can even be the cure. ""One of my clients actually makes use mobile phone apps to deal with anxiety,"" said Carr-Gregg. ""It's called iCounselor Anxiety."" The launch of the app presents users with a scale to rate their anxiety levels from 1 to 10, where 10 is ""panicked."" After choosing the level, ten recommendations of calming activities will be suggested, followed by instructions to change the user's thoughts, so to change subsequent feelings. ""It is almost like having a psychologist in your phone,"" said Carr-Gregg. Prevalent it may be, nomophobia, however, is not yet a qualified phobia. ""Nomophobia is not included in the DSM [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders] yet,"" said Dixit. ""But it is an up coming problem. For the first time on this continent [India], we are trying to make it more scientific,"" he added, referring to his undergoing research on nomophobic India.","According to a recent survey by an internet security firm, more people are ""nomophobic""

"(CNN) -- It's not enough to be a fantastic speller anymore. A student who wants to win the National Spelling Bee must now be a whiz at vocabulary. The Scripps National Spelling Bee will add the evaluation of vocabulary to the competition's early rounds, according to a release from the bee. ""It represents a deepening of the bee's commitment to its purpose: to help students improve their spelling, increase their vocabularies, learn concepts and develop correct English usage that will help them all their lives,"" said Paige Kimble, the director of the bee. ""Spelling and vocabulary are, in essence, two sides of the same coin,"" she said. ""As a child studies the spelling of a word and its etymology, he will discover its meaning. As a child learns the meaning of a word, it becomes easier to spell. And all of this enhances the child's knowledge of the English language."" Since 2002, a written or computer spelling test has been a component of the bee that, with onstage spelling, helped determine which spellers advanced to the semifinals. This year, a speller's qualification for the semifinals and championship finals will be based on a cumulative score that includes onstage spelling, computer-based spelling questions and computer-based vocabulary questions, the release said. Vocabulary evaluation will count for 50% of a speller's overall score, and the score determines which competitor goes on to the semifinals and the championship finals, the bee said. The bee will take place May 28-30 at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Oxon Hill, Maryland. ESPN will broadcast the competition.

"(CNN) -- Michelle Wie clung on to a share of the lead at the U.S. Women's Open Saturday as the former teenage prodigy bids for her first major title after a series of near misses. Wie shot a two-over 72 on the testing Pinehurst No.2 course, which was used for the men's U.S. Open won by Martin Kaymer last week. It left her on two-under 208 to be joined by South Korea's Amy Yang, who posted a third round two-under 68 with six birdies. ""I was hitting the ball really solid today, and I had good speed on the greens,"" Yang said. ""I had a great round today."" Wie, now 24, has twice led her national open going into the final round, in 2005 and 2006, but finished tied for 23rd and tied third respectively. In fine form in 2014, Wie finished second in the opening major of the season, the Kraft Nabisco Championship, and won the LPGA Lotte Championship in April. She led after two opening rounds of 68, but admitted she had to ""grind it out"" during her third round. Asked about her prospects of victory Sunday, Wie remained non-committal. ""I'm just grateful to have another opportunity,"" she told Sky Sports. ""I'm going to play as well as I can and hope for the best."" Wie might have held a one-shot lead but missed a 10-foot birdie putt on the final green, the sort of chances which were being holed on the first two days. In a tournament which was dominated at the start by the astonishing feat of 11-year-old Lucy Li in qualifying for the championship, 53-year-old Juli Inkster struck a blow for the diminishing band of veteran players on the LPGA Tour. American Inkster carded a best of the day 66 to join the group tied for third on two-over, which also included Australian amateur Minjee Lee, South Korean Choi Na-Yeon and Northern Ireland's Stephanie Meadow. Inkster, playing her 35th U.S. Open, has won seven majors and is set to retire at the end of the season.","Michelle Wie tied for lead at U.S. Women's Open .

"(CNN) -- Michael Stuhlbarg didn't know which way his life would turn. The Coen brothers had auditioned him for one part in their new movie, but they decided to go a different direction. Then they had another part in mind, or perhaps a third. Stuhlbarg was left with uncertainty, adrift amid forces he couldn't control. It's sort of the predicament faced by his character in the Coens' film ""A Serious Man,"" which was released on video Tuesday. Physics professor Larry Gopnik is a Job-like man who is being victimized by an unseen hand, or perhaps sheer random bad luck. It's 1967. His wife wants a divorce so she can marry an acquaintance; his son, preparing for his bar mitzvah ceremony, is escaping into marijuana and the Jefferson Airplane's ""Surrealistic Pillow;"" his daughter is a shrill teenager. An unknown critic threatens his tenure, a grumbling student threatens his ethics and the Columbia Record Club is threatening his credit. (In the film's one notable anachronism, the club demands payment for two albums that weren't released until 1970. Talk about bureaucracy.) The film, which begins with a quotation the Coens attribute to the Jewish sage Rashi -- ""Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you"" -- uses Gopnik's rather mundane, if mixed-up, life to take on some challenging themes, including the presence of God, the fickleness of fate and the need for humility. These are intertwined with science, math and comedy. (It was made by the Coens, after all.) The film and Stuhlbarg have been widely praised. Stuhlbarg was nominated for a Golden Globe as best comedic actor, and ""A Serious Man"" -- which was named to dozens of year-end top 10 lists -- is up for two Oscars, including best picture. CNN spoke with Stuhlbarg, who's been primarily known as a stage and television actor, in a phone interview. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Congratulations on the best picture nomination. How did you get the role? Michael Stuhlbarg: Originally Joel and Ethan Coen brought me in to audition for the part of Velvel, the husband in the Yiddish parable in the beginning of the story. I had to go to a Yiddish tutor [to] learn the scene in Yiddish, which was fun. I had very little experience with that. I did the scene ... and then they weren't sure at that point whether or not they wanted to hire someone who could speak Yiddish fluently or an actor to just do it phonetically. They ended up going with folks who could speak it fluently. And then maybe about five months passed by, and they called me back to audition for the parts of Larry and for Uncle Arthur. And so I learned a couple scenes of each of those characters, and I read for [the Coens] and they laughed and that was really wonderful. And then I kept inquiring periodically afterward as to whether I was still in the running, and I kept hearing yes, I was still in the running, still in the running. And eventually I got a call saying I was going to get one of those parts, but they just didn't know which one yet. So I started working on both of them, and about six or seven weeks before the principal photography began, I got a call from Joel saying, ""We'll put you out of your misery; you're playing Larry."" CNN: This is the blackest of black comedies. Did you find the script thrilling or depressing when you first read it? Stuhlbarg: I laughed a lot, actually. Frankly, I thought it was high comedy. I found myself giggling throughout the entire thing. Maybe it's how specific [the Coens] are in the rhythms in which they write, or the background I was familiar with -- in being raised in the Jewish religion -- but it tickled me. CNN: Were you concerned when you saw the script, that this might be a little too Jewish, a little too esoteric? Or when you get a script from the Coen brothers, do you say I'm in, regardless? Stuhlbarg: Absolutely -- I'm in, regardless! If they want to use me, I'll do anything they want. I thought it was a hysterical screenplay, so beautifully constructed and written. And I thought it was also a universal story as well. We're all familiar with those times when things go wrong in our lives, and we do the best we can to try to sort them out. CNN: How does working with the Coens compare to your other film experiences? Stuhlbarg: Well, Joel and Ethan have been working with a lot of the same folks almost as far back as [1984's] ""Blood Simple."" So it's like joining a little repertory company of people who have been together for years. They have their own vocabulary, and the set is a well-oiled machine. So showing up there, there's very little that you have to concern yourself with other than doing your job. CNN: Have you been approached by rabbis, by clerics, by physics professors about the film? Stuhlbarg: Not so much. I actually sought out the help of a physics professor while I was doing my research before we started shooting. That was a big concern of mine. I wanted to feel secure enough to get up in front of a group of people and be able to clarify any questions that might come up discussing Schrodinger's paradox or the uncertainty principle. But I haven't spoken to many clergy. I've read some things that people have written on the film, but I've been somewhat removed from the reactions. CNN: What's up next for you? Stuhlbarg: At the moment, I'm filming a new HBO series, ""Boardwalk Empire."" (Stuhlbarg plays organized crime boss Arnold Rothstein.) It's going very well. It's a tremendous cast of actors and a wonderful group of writers, and a tremendous pedigree with Mr. [Martin] Scorsese executive producing, and he directed the pilot. CNN: Did ""A Serious Man"" have any effect on you in terms of reconnecting you to Judaism or thinking about the big questions in life? Stuhlbarg: Hmm. (long pause) I was pretty much able to leave the character at the door when I came home. ... But I found that the little quote at the beginning of the movie -- ""Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you"" -- I've taken that away with me as a kind of beautiful watchword of how I live my own life, to try to receive the difficulties of whatever it is that comes into your life with simplicity. And that's a blessing.","Michael Stuhlbarg got lead role in Coens' ""A Serious Man"" after some delay .

"(CNN) -- The Iranian parliament on Saturday voted to designate the United States' Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S. Army as terrorist organizations, IRNA, the country's state-run news agency, reported. The Iranian parliament says the U.S. Army and the CIA are ""trained terrorists,"" IRNA reported. The CIA and the U.S. Army ""trained terrorists and supported terrorism, and they themselves are terrorists,"" the parliament said, according to IRNA. The Iranian parliament said the condemnation was based on ""known and accepted"" standards of terrorism from international regulations, including the U.N. charter. The parliament said it condemns the ""aggressions by the U.S. Army, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan"" and calls on the United Nations to ""intervene in the global problem of U.S. prisons in Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib and secret jails in other countries,"" IRNA reported, quoting a statement from Iranian lawmakers. The Iranian parliament also decried the CIA's and U.S. Army's involvement in the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II, U.S. involvement in the Balkans, Vietnam and the U.S. support of Israel. Of the condemnation, Paul Gimigliano, a CIA spokesman, said, ""There are some things that don't even deserve comment. This is one."" National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said he declined to comment ""on non-binding resolutions passed by parliaments in countries with dubious records on human rights, democracy and that are state sponsors of terror."" There was no immediate response from the U.S. State Department. Washington and U.S. military leaders have long accused Iran of training and equipping insurgents in Iraq. The United States and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage for 444 days. The Iranian lawmakers' condemnation was in apparent retaliation for the U.S. Senate's resolution Wednesday requesting that the United States designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, or Quds Force, as a foreign terrorist organization. The Senate resolution passed a day after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told the U.N. General Assembly that an agreement reached last month between his country and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over its disputed nuclear program has, in the Iranian view, settled the matter. Iran says its nuclear program is necessary for civilian energy production. The United States and other Western nations have accused Tehran of trying to build a nuclear weapon. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- No U.S. troops were killed in Iraq in August, marking the first month without an American military death there since the United States invaded the country in 2003. A total of 4,464 American troops have died in Iraq since the invasion, including 56 since the United States declared an end of combat operations exactly a year ago, according to a CNN analysis of Pentagon statistics. But none died in August, either due to hostile action or from accidents. That's in stark contrast to the American mission in Afghanistan, where August was the deadliest month since the invasion nearly 10 years ago. At least 66 Americans died there in August, a tally pushed to record levels by the death of 30 troops in a single helicopter crash August 6. While the United States pulled its combat troops from Iraq last year, between 46,000 and 50,000 troops have remained to provide support and training. They have a January 1, 2012, deadline to withdraw, but the United States is widely expected to agree to some kind of limited extension of training personnel and equipment. For Iraqis, August saw the worst wave of violence to strike the country in months. On August 15, for example, a barrage of attacks across the country killed at least 84 people and wounded more than 200.","More than 4,400 American troops have died in Iraq -- but not a single one in August .
Afghanistan, on the other hand, saw a record number of U.S. deaths in August ."
"(CNN) -- It was ""censorship day,"" the 20th of the month, the day Nyein Nyein Naing, executive director of Myanmar's Seven Days News Journal, takes her stories to a government office for pre-publication scrutiny. Normally, a report on refugees fleeing from the conflict-ravaged Kachin state would not be accepted. Its distribution would most likely result in jail time for the author and suspension of the journal. But August 20 was a new day for Myanmar, the day the government rescinded repressive media censorship laws that had hindered and intimidated the country's journalists for decades. Still, Naing had her concerns. After nearly 50 years under the auspices of autocracy, Myanmar is shifting from the tough economic, social and political policies that have shrouded the sovereign state in global isolation. Is now a good time to visit Myanmar? Since President Thein Sein's inauguration as Myanmar's first civilian leader in half a century, the light of significant freedoms has emerged from the fog of Myanmar's military rule. Freedom of the press is stressed as ""one of the most important reforms in the long run"" by Suzanne Dimaggio, vice president of global policy programs at Asia Society, a nonprofit organization that aims to strengthen ties between the United States and Asia. Yet, according to her, it's ""not quite completely open, but it's certainly moving in that direction."" U.S. President Barack Obama voiced similar views, as his historic trip to Myanmar, also known as Burma, brought not only praise for the recent reforms, but also encouragement for the ""greater progress that needs to be made in the future,"" as he put it. The era of government-controlled media that banished daily newspapers, banned all forms of hard news and established pre-publication censorship is approaching the end of its long reign. But some journalists are still treading lightly. As a test of the new exemption from government review, Seven Days ran the Kachin refugee story as their front-page article. Nothing happened. Myanmar still lacks daily newspapers; it has only weekly magazines. Until a few months ago, weeklies could cover only ""culture, arts, sports and things like that, but not hard news,"" said David Hoffman, founder and CEO of Internews, an international media development nonprofit that has clandestinely trained more than 1,000 Burmese journalists to operate beneath the government's radar for the past decade. ""One of the biggest reforms that people are waiting for is the move to daily newspapers, which will probably happen in a couple months,"" Hoffman said. Who is Aung San Suu Kyi? Among the hurdles facing journalists is the lack of technology. Myanmar has the fewest cell phones of any country in the world, even fewer than North Korea, according to CIA World Fact Book, and only 1% of the country's population has Internet access, according to Freedom House. Despite the lack of connectivity around the country, Hoffman said, ""We still trained people (in social media) because we saw it as an effective tool in a closed society."" With the lifting of press restrictions, Dimaggio said, she believes people ""will have greater access to Internet and online sources ... as the economy opens up and more telecom companies move in."" Facebook and Twitter may be more widely used when the government monopoly on telecom is liberalized, she said. Across the border from Myanmar, in Chiang Mai, Thailand, experienced journalists working for Internews have covertly taken in Burmese reporters who receive training for a month or so before returning to either work clandestinely or for independent journals. ""Basically, we try to teach what language to use in reporting on conflict that will not inflame the situation -- making sure your facts are right, getting them verified, basic journalism ethics,"" Hoffman said of Internews' operation during Myanmar's military rule. When they were reporting in a closed society, Hoffman said, the Burmese had developed their own figurative writing style to report on off-limit topics. Obama encourages 'flickers of progress' Electricity shortages are not normally the most exciting stories, but for one editor of a large Burmese journal it's the article he is most proud of. The headline read, ""Living in the dark,"" and though he was reporting on electricity blackouts, the editor was actually alluding to Myanmar's political situation. Boosted by the covert media training, the transition from a society mired for the past 50 years in government-controlled information to one that embraces a free press has been a smooth, yet groundbreaking path, experts say. The new freedoms may represent dashes instead of solid double lines, but more reforms must be made for Myanmar's press to be labeled truly open and its people completely free. Emphasizing that Myanmar is still at the beginning of the transition, Dimaggio said there is room for improvements, especially in regard to the escalating violence between Buddhists and the Muslim Rohingyas. ""This a real destabilizing factor for the country that has really undermined some reforms,"" she said. Since the government loosened control of its information flow, Internews has set up a permanent journalism school in Yangon, the former capital. There, reporters are being trained in conflict-zone journalism -- as the country continues to witness ethnic clashes -- as well as broadcast journalism to prepare for the impending telecom liberalization. Hoffman, recently returned from Myanmar to assess the progress of the media, described it as ""the most exciting thing"" he's ever seen. ""You just can't believe it -- the reforms are across the board,"" he said. ""They've opened the door to democracy, and I don't think they can close it again.""","One editor was nervous about a story landing the newspaper in trouble, but nothing happened .
Free press is one of the ""most important reforms in the long run,"" an expert says of Myanmar .
Journalists trained to operate clandestinely make the transition to reporting openly .
Buddhist-Muslim violence could undermine the broad reforms, an expert says ."
"(CNN) -- A Texas woman apparently contracted HIV through sexual contact with another woman, the Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday, a rare female-to-female transmission of the virus. Testing confirmed the 46-year-old woman with newly diagnosed HIV ""had a virus virtually identical to that of her female partner, who was diagnosed previously with HIV and who had stopped receiving antiretroviral treatment in 2010,"" according to the CDC's Weekly Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. HIV transmission through female-to-female sexual contact ""has been reported rarely and is difficult to ascertain,"" officials said. Past confirmation of such transmission ""has been difficult because other risk factors almost always are present or cannot be ruled out,"" the report said. ""In this case, other risk factors for HIV transmission were not reported by the newly infected woman, and the viruses infecting the two women were virtually identical."" The CDC said it was contacted by the Houston Department of Health about the case in August 2012. The woman newly diagnosed with HIV did not report any other risk factors, such as injection drug use, tattooing, transfusions or transplants, officials said. She supplemented her income by selling plasma, and tested negative for HIV in March 2012. Ten days after donating plasma, however, in April 2012, she went to an emergency room complaining of a sore throat, fever, vomiting and decreased appetite, among other symptoms. She again tested negative for HIV. However, she tested positive for HIV when attempting to sell plasma 18 days later, and further testing confirmed the diagnosis. The woman is believed to have been infected by her 43-year-old sexual partner, the CDC said. She told officials the woman was her only sexual partner during the six months before she tested positive. The couple said they routinely had unprotected sexual contact and shared sex toys between them. At times, the contact was ""rough to the point of inducing bleeding in either woman,"" according to the CDC. The women said some of the unprotected sexual contact occurred during menstruation. Commonly, HIV infections in women who have sex with women are traced to risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use or heterosexual sex, the CDC said.","A Texas woman apparently infected her female partner with HIV .
Such transmission is rarely reported and ""difficult to ascertain,"" the CDC says .
The newly infected woman reported no other risk factors for HIV ."
"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine have decided to go ahead with a Sunday referendum on greater local powers, they said Thursday, defying a call by Russian President Vladimir Putin to postpone the vote. Putin had urged the pro-Russia sympathizers to delay the referendum to give dialogue ""the conditions it needs to have a chance."" Representatives from the council of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic and separatists from Luhansk told reporters they have voted to press ahead to ask eastern Ukrainians there if they want sovereignty from Kiev. ""After the vote that was held today, the unanimous decision was to go ahead with the referendum May 11,"" Denis Pushilin, the self-declared chairman of the Donetsk People's Republic said, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Pushilin said Putin's comments Wednesday were ""surprising"" but he respected him. There was no immediate reaction from Moscow or Kiev. Sunday's referendum could echo events in March when voters in Crimea approved a controversial ballot to secede from Ukraine and join Russia, which subsequently annexed the Black Sea peninsula. The move escalated the turmoil rocking the country. ""On the local 'referenda,' we strongly emphasize that they should not take place -- neither on 11 May nor at any later date,"" said Maja Kocijancic, spokeswoman for the European Union's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton. ""Such unauthorized local 'referenda' have no democratic legitimacy and can only lead to further escalation."" Separatists have been defiant in the past. An international pact reached among Russia, Ukraine and its Western allies in Geneva, Switzerland, last month that called for the rebels to disarm and vacate buildings seized in the volatile region has not yet materialized. In what seemed to signal a softening in Moscow's attitude toward Kiev, Putin also said Wednesday that Ukrainian presidential elections scheduled for this month were ""a step in the right direction."" However, he also voiced caution. ""But it will not solve anything unless all of Ukraine's people first understand how their rights will be guaranteed once the election has taken place,"" Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript following his meeting with the chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Putin also said that direct talks between Kiev authorities and representatives of the pro-Russian sympathizers in southeast Ukraine were key to settling the crisis. Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk dismissed Putin's comments on the referendum as ""hot air."" Amid the diplomatic tit-for-tat, Russia's Foreign Ministry said Thursday it had added names to its list of U.S. and Canadian officials barred from entering Russia, in response to sanctions impose by the United States and Canada on Russian officials. NATO: No sign of Russian troop withdrawal . In a statement on his official website on Thursday, interim President Oleksandr Turchynov said his government was ready for dialogue with those who want to talk -- but not with ""armed criminals with blood on their hands."" ""Ukrainian authorities have never conducted punitive operations in the east,"" he said, responding to Russian accusations over Kiev's military campaign to defeat the rebels who have overrun the east. ""The law enforcement agencies protect the lives and health of the citizens in the framework of the anti-terrorist operation performed against terrorists, saboteurs, and other criminals who murder, torture, and kidnap our citizens."" Police in Luhansk confirmed Thursday that Valeriy Salo, a man named by the Kyiv Post as the kidnapped head of a pro-Ukrainian group in the Donetsk region, was found dead in a burned-out car near the Luhansk village of Petrovskiy. Salo's family told police that on Wednesday evening an unknown armed group arrived at their home and took Salo away. The Kyiv Post said he was captured by representatives of the Donetsk People's Republic. Rights group Amnesty International last month raised concern over the reported abduction of journalists and local officials by the Donetsk People's Republic and other groups, and urged their immediate release. Poll: Lack of confidence . A majority of Ukrainians agree their country should remain a unified state, according to a poll released Thursday. The Pew Research Center poll, conducted in the first half of April, found that 77% of Ukrainians want the country to remain united; 70% in the east feel the same. Things differ in Crimea, where 54% of those surveyed voice support for the right to secede. The survey also highlighted a lack of confidence in the new government that came to power after pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted following months of protests. Just 41% say the interim authorities are having a good influence on the way things are going. ""Russia is viewed with the greatest suspicion. Three times as many Ukrainians say Russia is having a bad influence on their country as say it is having a good impact (67% vs. 22%),"" it said. Meanwhile, NATO hasn't seen ""any signs"" that Russia is withdrawing troops from Ukraine's border, said Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the military alliance's secretary-general. ""So far we haven't seen any indications that they are pulling back their troops. Let me assure you that if we get visible evidence that they are actually pulling back their troops, I would be the very first to welcome it,"" Rasmussen told a news conference in the Polish capital. White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest also told reporters Wednesday that ""there is not evidence to date that there has been a meaningful and transparent withdrawal of Russian forces from the Ukrainian border."" The comments came after Putin announced a troop pullback Wednesday, saying Russian forces are ""now not on the Ukrainian border but are carrying out their regular exercises at the test grounds."" Kiev, its neighbors and Western governments have voiced alarm over what NATO estimates are around 40,000 Russian troops massed along the Ukrainian border. Moscow has repeatedly said they are only carrying out exercises. The state-run ITAR-Tass news agency cited Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov as saying Thursday that Ukraine has deployed a 15,000-strong military force near Russia's borders. He reiterated Putin's comments that Russia had pulled back from the border and said Moscow's defense minister had informed U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel about this in a phone conversation. Military offensive . Violence has escalated on the ground as tensions rise. The State Department is now warning U.S. citizens to defer all non-essential travel to Ukraine. It also said Thursday that U.S. citizens should defer all travel to Crimea and eastern regions . Kiev last week launched its biggest military campaign yet to drive out pro-Russian militants who have reportedly taken over some public buildings in towns across southeast Ukraine. Five pro-Russian activists were killed overnight Wednesday when Ukrainian forces attacked barricades on the outskirts of Mariupol, a spokeswoman for the pro-Russian camp said. Elsewhere in the volatile Donetsk region, an uneasy standoff continued between the Ukrainian military and separatists. Both sides clashed Monday at the rebel stronghold of Slovyansk. Ukraine's security services said 30 ""heavily armed"" militants had been killed in recent days as part of the ""anti-terrorist"" operation in the area. Kiev and many experts in the West believe the separatists are backed by Moscow and fear that Putin is fomenting trouble to increase his influence in the region. The Ukrainian authorities have accused Russian special forces of leading the rebellion in the field -- a claim Moscow denies. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia accused Russian troops -- which he says comprise special forces and intelligence -- of infiltrating and destabilizing the east of the country. ""These well-equipped groups resort to guns, oppression and blackmail to intimidate people ... in an effort to channel them to their own purposes, and thus create the false impression that their demands are backed by broad public support,"" he said. ""Russia's major goal is to destabilize and control the country. We will not let this happen."" Moscow says right-wing, ultranationalist groups are behind the violence in Ukraine and that it has no direct influence over the pro-Russian groups. The violence in Ukraine has created the worst East-West diplomatic crisis since the end of the Cold War. However, French President Francois Hollande said Thursday that Putin would be welcome to attend next month's ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy, northern France. ""We may have differences with Vladimir Putin at the moment namely over the crisis in Ukraine but I have not forgotten and never will forget that the Russian people gave millions of lives (during World War II),"" Hollande told local television in a clip posted on the presidential palace website. ""That is why I told Vladimir Putin that as the representative of the Russian people, he is welcome to these ceremonies."" The government in Kiev is bracing for further unrest in the run-up to Friday's national holiday to commemorate the end of World War II. In a television address, Yatsenyuk urged Ukrainians not to take part in ""mass actions"" and not to respond to provocations. Kiev has said it is stepping up security measures ahead of the holiday.

"(CNN) -- A California transit authority has agreed to pay damages to five men who were detained with Oscar Grant, the victim of a high-profile fatal police shooting in 2009. The Bay Area Rapid Transport (BART) settled a federal civil rights lawsuit out of court for a sum of $175,000, spokeswoman Alicia Trost told CNN. ""This settlement closes the case for a considerably smaller amount compared to what would have been a long and costly trial if allowed to move forward,"" she said. Grant's killing sparked public furor, when cell phone video went viral showing former transit police officer Johannes Mehserle shooting him in the back, while another officer knelt over him. Grant was unarmed. His death became the subject of the award winning movie ""Fruitvale Station,"" named after the BART station, where he was shot. Mehserle testified at his 2010 trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun. He was sentenced to two years in prison after his involuntary manslaughter conviction but was released after serving 11 months. Activists felt the former law officer deserved the tougher conviction of second degree murder, and violent protests erupted after Mehserle's sentence was handed down. At least 150 people were arrested by the police, after crowds threw rocks and bottles and tore down fences. BART has implemented dozens of recommendations made by the Nation Organization of Black Law Enforcement (NOBLE) since Grant's killing, Trost said.","A former transit police officer shot Oscar Grant in the back in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- Half a million acres will be protected Wednesday when President Barack Obama establishes the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument. It's ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" to head off development on the swath of land in south-central New Mexico that has ""unique Pre-American, New Mexican, and American history,"" the monument's official website says. For Obama, signing a proclamation Wednesday at the Department of the Interior will bring to fruition a promise in his 2014 State of the Union address: ""I'll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said, ""By establishing the monument, the President will permanently protect more than 496,000 acres to preserve the prehistoric, historic and scientific values of the area for the benefit of all Americans."" Carney cited an independent study that found the monument could generate $7.4 million ""in new economic activity annually from new visitors and business opportunities, while preserving access for sportsmen, ranchers and recreational users."" The monument is apparently smaller than what some in New Mexico had sought. A proposal had called for 600,000 acres to be protected, according to the website. The United States has 77 other national monuments, according to the organization National Park Advocates, which operates nationalparkstraveler.com. Some were created by acts of Congress; others by presidential proclamation. The Bureau of Land Management operates 19 national monuments across nine Western states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington. In October 2012, Obama established the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument in California.

"(CNN) -- CNN en Español will launch CNN Latino, a new Spanish language syndicated programming block custom made for the U.S. Hispanic market, in late January 2013. CNN Latino targets the growing and diverse U.S. Hispanic market, delivering a broad spectrum of programming that will include news, lifestyle, documentary, talk and debate as an alternative to traditional Hispanic networks. Cynthia Hudson-Fernandez, senior vice president and general manager of CNN en Español and Hispanic strategy for CNN/U.S., made the announcement this week. ""There is a real demand for relevant, dynamic, quality programming and CNN Latino is a unique product designed specifically for the growing U.S. Hispanic audience, representing the dual reality of U.S. Latinos today who are multigenerational and proud to be bilingual. The launch of CNN Latino is the first step to bringing this syndicated programming block to local broadcast stations in key Hispanic media markets across the country."" According to the latest census, Hispanics made up more than half the nation's population growth from 2000 to 2010. The Hispanic audience in the United States is at 52 million and counting, and its purchasing power totals more than a trillion dollars, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. ""The U.S. market is so diverse and so large that there is room for two distinctive content options,"" said Hudson. There is a company-wide initiative at CNN to produce more content for the U.S. Hispanic audience. CNN Latino is a reflection of the continued investment in that growing market. ""We're adding over 25 staff positions at CNN in Los Angeles, Mexico, Miami and Atlanta,"" Hudson said, ""It's proof of CNN's initiative that believes in this market and is betting on the future."" CNN Latino will launch in Los Angeles with a branded programming block of customized content from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. -- including a locally produced debate show -- directed at the U.S. Hispanic audience. It will air on KBEH-DT channel 63, which is owned by Hero Broadcasting, and can be seen throughout the Los Angeles area, reaching more than 14 million people. Hero Broadcasting is a privately held television affiliate station group launched in 2007 by industry veteran Bob Behar. This will be CNN en Español's first attempt in creating an alternative programming block for broadcast Spanish-language TV geared toward the U.S. Hispanic market.","CNN Latino targets the growing and diverse U.S. Hispanic market, delivering a broad spectrum of programming .

"(Mental Floss) -- If you think comic book characters do amazing things in comic books, you won't believe what they can do off the page. For starters, Superman brought down the Ku Klux Klan, and Donald Duck raised ships from the ocean floor. 1. Superman defeats the Ku Klux Klan . In the 1940s, ""The Adventures of Superman"" was a radio sensation. Kids across the country huddled around their sets as the Man of Steel leapt off the page and over the airwaves. Although Superman had been fighting crime in print since 1938, the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further. It was on the radio that Superman first faced kryptonite, met The Daily Planet reporter Jimmy Olsen, and became associated with ""truth, justice, and the American way."" So, it's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named Stetson Kennedy decided to expose the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration. In the post-World War II era, the Klan experienced a huge resurgence. Its membership was skyrocketing, and its political influence was increasing, so Kennedy went undercover to infiltrate the group. By regularly attending meetings, he became privy to the organization's secrets. But when he took the information to local authorities, they had little interest in using it. The Klan had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them. Struggling to make use of his findings, Kennedy approached the writers of the Superman radio serial. It was perfect timing. With the war over and the Nazis no longer a threat, the producers were looking for a new villain for Superman to fight. The KKK was a great fit for the role. In a 16-episode series titled ""Clan of the Fiery Cross,"" the writers pitted the Man of Steel against the men in white hoods. As the storyline progressed, the shows exposed many of the KKK's most guarded secrets. By revealing everything from code words to rituals, the program completely stripped the Klan of its mystique. Within two weeks of the broadcast, KKK recruitment was down. And by 1948, people were showing up to Klan rallies just to mock them. Mental Floss: 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship . 2. Donald Duck's scientific breakthrough . In 1966, Danish engineer Karl Krøyer developed a method for raising sunken ships off the ocean floor by injecting them with polystyrene foam balls. However, when Krøyer tried to license his invention with the Dutch patent office, he was denied. Donald Duck had beaten him to the punch by 22 years. Indeed, Krøyer's concept could be traced back to a Donald Duck comic conceived by Carl Barks. In addition to being the most celebrated artist of the Donald Duck comics, Barks was known for his scientific prowess. So in a 1944 story, when Donald got a bump on his head that turned him into a genius, the duck managed to mumble, ""If I mix CH2 [a methylene compound] with NH4 [ammonium] and boil the atoms in osmotic fog, I should get speckled nitrogen!"" Although it sounded like nonsense, it wasn't. In 1963, chemists P.P. Gaspar and G.S. Hammond wrote a technical article about methylene that included a reference to the Donald Duck story. The final paragraph read, ""Among experiments which have not, to our knowledge, been carried out as yet is one of a most intriguing nature suggested in the literature of no less than 19 years ago."" A footnote revealed that ""literature"" as the Donald Duck comic. It seems the web-footed children's hero had deduced the chemical intermediate long before it had been proven to exist. Mental Floss: Musicians performing on Sesame Street . But why were these top American chemists looking to comics for inspiration? Apparently, Dr. Gaspar had been a lifelong Donald Duck fan, and he'd rediscovered Donald's early reference to methylene while collecting old copies of the classic adventures. Gaspar never disclosed how much his work owed to Duckburg's most famous resident, but then again, how many scientists would confess that they used comic books to bolster their research? 3. A Spider-Man villain keeps folks out of jail . In a 1977 edition of Spider-Man, Peter Parker has the tables turned on him. The villain, Kingpin, tracks down Spidey using an electronic transmitter that he'd fastened to the superhero's wrist. Although Kingpin loses in the end (he always does), one New Mexico judge saw beauty in his plan. Inspired by the strip, Judge Jack Love turned to computer salesman Michael Goss and asked if he could create a similar device to keep track of crime suspects awaiting trial. In 1983, Goss produced his first batch of electronic monitors. Authorities in Albuquerque then tested the devices on five offenders, using the gadgets as an alternative to incarceration. Today, the transmitters are a common sight in courtrooms across the country, usually in the form of electronic ankle bracelets. Most famously, Martha Stewart donned one while she was under house arrest in 2004. Perhaps she would have felt better knowing that the gadget had once nabbed Spider-Man, too. Mental Floss: Truth about lie detectors (and Wonder Woman) 4. Captain Marvel Jr. saves the bad-hair day . Like most American kids in the 1940s, Elvis Presley fantasized about growing up to be like his favorite comic book superheroes. But it turns out that The King might have been more interested in their fashion statements than their special powers. During his early teen years, Elvis was obsessed with Captain Marvel Jr., known as ""America's most famous boy hero."" A younger version of Captain Marvel, the character sported an unusual hairstyle that featured a curly tuft of hair falling over the side of his forehead. Sound familiar? When Elvis set out to conquer America with his rock 'n' roll ways, he copied the 'do, thus making it one of the most famous hairstyles of the 20th century. But that wasn't all. Captain Marvel also gets credit for the short capes Elvis wore on the back of his jumpsuits, as well as The King's famous TCB logo, which bears a striking resemblance to Marvel's lightning bolt insignia. Of course, Elvis never tried to hide his love for the Captain. A copy of Captain Marvel Jr. No. 51 still sits in his preserved childhood bedroom in an apartment in Memphis, and his full comics collection remains intact in the attic at Graceland. Plus, the admiration was mutual. Captain Marvel Jr. paid tribute to The King in one issue, referring to the singer as ""the greatest modern-day philosopher.""

"(EW.com) -- Cher will appear on two tracks off of Wu-Tang's upcoming ""secret album"" ""The Wu -- Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will defend his foreign policy Wednesday in a commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and lay out an interventionist, but not over-reaching plan, White House officials say. The speech comes amid stinging criticism of the President's foreign policy following a trip to Asia last month. Obama, who has carefully avoided mentioning any sort of military confrontation in his responses to the challenges in Syria and Ukraine, hit back at his critics, saying his goal is to avoid costly ""errors"" on the world stage. But the world waits for no man. Obama may advocate a risk-averse foreign policy, but he has a series of pressing global challenges which are likely to dominate the remainder of his term. Here are a few: . Russia . The political crisis in Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea have led to tensions between the United States and Russia that are reminiscent of the Cold War. Those tensions quickly have become the Obama administration's central foreign policy crisis and have tested Washington's mettle and its alliance with Europe. The United States and its allies have accused Moscow of backing militant separatists and fomenting ethnic skirmishes in eastern Ukraine, and while praising Ukraine's elections this weekend, have charged Russia with attempting to disrupt the vote. Russia has been kicked out of the G8 group of industrialized countries, and the United States and the European Union have slapped a series of sanctions on Russian officials and entities. But a military response has been all but ruled out and there seems to be little if any taste on either side of the Atlantic for the kind of sectoral sanctions which would deter Putin. The United States says Russia is feeling the economic heat from the sanctions, but this month in Shanghai, Putin signed a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping to provide China with $400 billion worth of natural gas from Siberia over the next 30 years. Moreover, Russia has proven it can impose costs of its own. Although Washington and Moscow teamed up on a deal to rid Syria of its chemical weapons, Russia's political and military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and its pledge to provide weapons to governments across the Mideast continue to frustrate the United States. With a veto-wielding permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, Russia is able to block action on world crises. The U.S. needs to work with Russia on a nuclear deal with Iran and on curbing North Korea's own nuclear ambitions. In today's world, a new Cold War simply seems impractical. Syria . Three years into Syria's bloody civil war, the opposition remains weak and fragmented, extremists continue to grow in numbers and influence and al-Assad remains firmly in power. A year-long effort to bring the opposition and the regime to the table for peace talks was a failure, and a political negotiation seems further away than ever while the humanitarian catastrophe continues to grow. Despite the U.S.-Russia agreement to remove Syria's chemical weapons, the regime is believed to have launched chlorine attacks which are now being investigated by U.N. inspectors. The administration talks of needing to change al-Assad's ""calculus,"" but Obama has resisted pressure from many of his top advisers to involve the United States deeper in the conflict. Without a decisive change in the balance of power on the military field, it seems unlikely al-Assad will feel compelled to make a deal. Iran . World powers are just under two months away from a July 20 deadline for a comprehensive deal with Iran on its nuclear program. An interim pact reached with Tehran in November eased some economic sanctions in return for Iran rolling back parts of its nuclear program, which the United States and others believe is designed to produce a weapon. Iran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful. U.S. negotiators say progress has been made in several rounds of negotiations and the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- and Iran have begun to draft an agreement. But a number of significant roadblocks remain, including the future of Iran's heavy water reactor in Arak, its underground facility at Fordo and whether Iran will maintain the right to enrich a small amount of low-grade uranium on its own soil for medical and research purposes. Iran has said those are all sticking points, but Israel and the United States aren't likely to budge on them. A recent U.N. report also warned that Iran continues to pursue ballistic missile capability and Tehran appears unwilling to discuss its missile technology as part of the nuclear negotiations, to the great frustration of the U.S. and its European allies. New concerns have also surfaced over reports that Russia and Iran are discussing an oil-for-goods deal, which could violate the terms of the interim agreement, circumvent sanctions and derail the fate of the talks. Terror threat . The United States got Osama bin Laden and diminished the capacity of al Qaeda's senior leadership in Pakistan, but a recent State Department report said the terror group's affiliate organizations have gotten even deadlier. And a series of al Qaeda-based threats to attack American and Western targets in Europe is causing major concern inside the U.S. intelligence community. The State Department report said the group's affiliate in Yemen -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- is among the most lethal of the network and ""continues to pose the most significant threat to the United States,"" which shut down its Embassy in Yemen due to the threats. The civil war in Syria has created conditions allowing parts of the country to become a new haven for al Qaeda-linked groups and thousands of foreign fighters -- a situation that U.S. officials warn could come back to threaten the U.S. homeland. Next door in Iraq, a weak security environment in the western section of the country, along with the destabilizing effects of the situation in Syria, have allowed a former al Qaeda affiliate, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, to move across the border with ease to conduct its own attacks. Terrorist groups across North and West Africa are posing an ever-greater threat -- from Mali and Libya, where al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other extremists groups are growing in strength -- to Kenya, where militants from al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked group in Somalia, are blamed for an increasing number of attacks. The recent kidnapping of hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls by Boko Haram has suddenly raised the profile of this al Qaeda-linked group. While al Qaeda's affiliates are grabbing the headlines, the body's core group in Pakistan may be making a comeback. Officials tell CNN's Barbara Starr the core is seeking to place operatives to attack U.S. targets at home and abroad. Asia . The more pressing crises in Ukraine and Syria have prevented the Obama administration from focusing on the long anticipated ""pivot to Asia,"" billed as an effort to cement American presence in the region and counter China's rise. However, the region is experiencing significant chaos, and managing China has proven a formidable challenge. Tensions continue to escalate between Japan and China over a set of deserted islands in the East China Sea. Beijing is also stepping up its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and this week a Chinese vessel rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing boat after a series of anti-Chinese riots that left four Chinese workers dead and more than 100 injured. The two closest U.S. allies in the region -- Japan and South Korea -- are feuding over what Seoul perceives as inadequate remorse from its brutal colonization and the use of Korean ""comfort women"" during World War II. Elsewhere in the region, Thailand's military seized power in a bloodless coup. And Washington's ambitions at increasing trade in the region appear stalled. Obama traveled to Japan last month to forge a deal with Japan to move ahead with the 12-nation free-trade Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) but left Tokyo empty-handed. The turmoil is distracting from the region's most dangerous threat -- unpredictable North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his nuclear arsenal. Kim's erratic behavior and threats of a fourth nuclear test have prompted the United States and Korea to shelve the scheduled transfer of wartime operational control of troops on the Korean peninsula from Washington to Seoul. And more ... Plenty of other challenges remain: from managing relations with Egypt after the near-certain election of former defense minister Abdel Fattah al-Sissi -- whose interim government has been accused of widespread human rights abuses -- to salvaging the Mideast peace process, after talks broke down last month. As Obama winds down the war in Afghanistan, violence is surging in Iraq, the first war he brought to a close -- a potent reminder the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan must be managed carefully. And as the President seeks to articulate a foreign policy that avoids aggressive military entanglements while countering critics calling for a more aggressive U.S. foreign policy, it remains certain that his inbox will remain full.","Obama delivers the commencement address Wednesday at West Point .

"(CNN) -- UEFA's new system of financial regulation faces judgment in the European courts -- but not before 2015. UEFA, the body which governs soccer in Europe, introduced Financial Fair Play (FFP) at the start of the 2012-13 season as a way of preventing clubs from spending beyond their means and posting unsustainable yearly losses. The rules give UEFA sweeping powers, including exclusion from the lucrative Champions League, to punish financially recalcitrant clubs. However the regulations have been challenged by an Italian football agent who claims FFP breaches European Union competition laws. Daniel Striani has hired the lawyer that helped revolutionize the way football's transfer system works to fight his corner. ""The court has now issued the procedural calendar : hearing in February 2015 and therefore the judgment can be expected around March or April 2015,"" Jean-Louis Dupont, who in 1995 helped Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman change European law to allow players to move for free at the end of their contracts, told CNN.

"(CNN) -- HBO's deadly ""Game of Thrones"" returned Sunday night with one ominous rallying cry -- ""All men must die"" -- and few disappointments. Now that it's in its fourth season, the fantasy series could be excused if it started to show wear and tear. After all, we've seen programs with simpler plots and fewer cast members lose their edge in less time. But Sunday's premiere, ""Two Swords,"" proved that creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are just getting started. (In fact, the only real letdown for fans didn't have anything to do with ""GoT"" at all, but HBO's mobile platform HBO Go, which crashed due to an overwhelming demand for Sunday's premiere.) HBO Go crashes under heavy 'Game of Thrones' demand . Adapted from George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" book series, ""Game of Thrones"" is at its heart a bloody race for power between competitive houses in Westeros. After the third season left avid watchers in a state of shock thanks to a gruesome wedding ceremony, they returned on Sunday to find the ""Game's"" major players repositioning themselves on the board. With the famous Stark Valyrian steel sword split in two by Hand of the King Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance), viewers were made keenly aware of the fissures that abound throughout the Seven Kingdoms. Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) is building an army while trying to keep a handle on her still-growing dragons, and Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) has begun to cross out names on her list of vengeance. In the North, the Free Folk -- or the Wildlings as they're called -- have their eyes trained on breaching the Wall where the men of the Night's Watch, including a Jon Snow (Kit Harington) ready to pay for his broken vows, stand guard. And in King's Landing, where the precious Iron Throne sits, the ruthless and rich Lannisters are not as secure as they'd like to believe. With a grand wedding approaching for the young King Joffrey, there are visitors from Dorne afoot -- and they, too, like to pay their debts. ""Right off the bat, season four sends the viewer a signal: Forget the Westeros you knew,"" warns the A.V. Club's Erik Adams, who gave the episode a B+ grade. ""Forget where on the board you've mentally placed any of 'Game Of Thrones'' chess pieces. It's not a reboot, but 'Two Swords' is a starting place that feels distinct."" While ""fortunes have risen and fallen while we were away, and the awful power of King Joffrey seeps deeply into the Seven Kingdoms,"" the episode ""stealthily belongs to the Starks -- who are down, but not out. That's an enticingly rich way to begin a season."" Time magazine's Eric Dodds agrees that while ""the Lannisters appear strong and unchallenged with the Starks out of the picture and Jaime returned home only slightly worse for wear, the cracks are readily apparent. ... By all accounts, the season-opener was setting the table for what promises to be a season filled with violence and intrigue. For now, the fear is only creeping in along the edges. Once it arrives in full, that's when the real fun is likely to begin."" It's true that not much happened in the way of action -- by ""GoT"" standards, anyway -- but it was rich in character development, says The Daily Beast's Andrew Romano. ""(A)nd character, ultimately, is what 'Game of Thrones' does best,"" he observes. ""Some viewers might even complain that there wasn't enough sex or swashbuckling in 'Two Swords' -- that the episode was 'slow.' But it is in these slow moments -- the moments between each big plot twist, when showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff decelerate the narrative to linger over the nuances of character -- that 'Game of Thrones' truly distinguishes itself from other epic television series."" Even better, The Hollywood Reporter's Tim Goodman says that the next two episodes should be just as good. ""The consistent excellence in 'Game of Thrones' is truly something to behold,"" Goodman says in a review. ""Even in three episodes, viewers will sense things tightening up -- that winter and war are coming and they are coming on full-stop. If there's anything to complain about with 'Game of Thrones' it's the 10-episode seasons, which cry out for 13 episodes given the immense world that 'Thrones' inhabits.""","""Game of Thrones"" began its fourth season on Sunday .

"CHARLESTON, South Carolina (CNN) -- Magoline Hazelton is used to people driving by her home just to take a look. She's also known as the ""house lady"" by her fellow residents in North Charleston, South Carolina. Steel shipping containers, like these at a depot, can be turned into homes. From the outside, Hazelton's home doesn't seem much different from the rest of the neighborhood. But there's one big difference. Her house is made from cargo shipping containers. Using containers to build homes has increasingly become a trend in the past several years because it can be cheaper and faster than using traditional construction methods. There are also plenty of containers at most major ports. About 18 million containers are used worldwide to transport a variety of everyday products, such as cars, toys and food. Because the United States imports more than it exports, many containers end up stacked at ports.  See one of the homes being built » . SG Blocks, a company whose name stands for safe and green blocks, has made a business from the container overflow. Co-founder David Cross previously worked as a merchant marine and spent a lot of time at sea, dealing with shipping containers. ""As you're looking down the deck of the vessel, you see hundreds to thousands of containers perfectly configured,"" Cross said. ""They were stacked nine high below deck, five or six high on deck, and I just kept seeing hotel after hotel on the deck of our ship.""  Watch how residents like living in the homes » . Cross also saw value in the strength of the material. ""The containers are designed for hostile dynamic life at sea ... capable of carrying 60,000 pounds. It just made imminent sense, that with minor modification, it could become a multi-family living system."" In 2003, Cross partnered with engineer Steve Armstrong to help bring the idea to fruition. A year later, Hazelton's house was built in South Carolina. According to Cross, modifying containers into homes uses significantly less energy than melting them down. ""These containers weigh about 9,000 pounds, and it takes about 9,000 kilowatt hours of energy to melt down 9,000 pounds of steel,"" Cross said. ""We modify that existing piece of steel with approximately 400 kilowatt hours of energy input. [That's a] 95 percent energy footprint reduction."" The energy saved by transforming a single container into a home, rather than melting it down, can power a standard 70-watt lightbulb for up to 15 years. The time it takes to assemble a container home can vary, according to Cross. Hazelton's home took 10 weeks to build. Generally, SG Blocks has found that recycled homes cut construction time in half. ""Typical homes can take four to eight months [to build],"" Cross said. ""For container homes, it's usually two to four months."" According to Armstrong, who is president of SG Blocks, the cost of building a single family container home is comparable to a traditional home. ""But you get a steel home instead of a wood home,"" he said. ""So, it's more durable and has a lower carbon footprint. It's also water resistant and termite resistant."" The construction becomes cheaper as you get into multi-family homes. According to Armstrong, multi-family mid-rise units cost 10 to 15 percent less than typical ""stick frame"" homes. ""That's a lot to do with speed and ease of construction,"" he said. Companies around the world are using shipping containers as building materials to create offices, army barracks, dorms and even designer homes. ""[We] can make these look like anything you want. [We] can put a pretty dress on any skeleton,"" Armstrong said. ""So, if you want it minimalistic, so you can see the container walls, we can do that. If you want stucco or brick or siding, [we] can do that as well."" While each container has its own roof, when multiple containers are put together side by side, there are gaps between the boxes. Therefore, a traditional roof is put on top of the entire home, providing additional safety in inclement weather. ""When the boxes are joined together, the gaps are sealed, so even if you lose your roof above, you'd have some protection,"" said Armstrong. The second roof also provides another benefit. Hazelton finds she can't even hear the rain hitting her home when it's pouring outside. Her house has been almost maintenance free since she moved in. ""The only thing I've done here is exchanged the hot water heater. Nothing else I've had to do in the last five years ... so far, it's pretty good.""","18 million shipping containers transport goods worldwide; many left at U.S. ports .

"New York (CNN) -- In addition to phone records and email logs, the National Security Agency uses Facebook and other social media profiles to create maps of social connections -- including those of American citizens. The revelation was disclosed by the New York Times on Sunday, using documents provided to the newspaper by former government contractor Edward Snowden. ""We assume as Americans that if somebody in the government is looking at your information, it's because they have a reason, because you're suspected of a crime,"" Karen Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School, told CNN. But the documents do not specify how many Americans' social connections have been analyzed, or whether any have been implicated in wrongdoing. NSA: Some used spying power to snoop on lovers . Change in policy . The surveillance began after a policy change in November 2010. Prior to then, the ""chaining"" of a foreign person's contacts had to stop when it reached an American citizen or legal resident. The policy change was intended to help the NSA ""discover and track"" connections from a foreign intelligence subject to an American citizen, the leaked documents show. It allows NSA analysts to use social media, geo-location information, insurance and tax records, plus other public and private sources to enhance their analysis of phone and email records, The Times reported Sunday. The ""metadata"" from phone and email records in the database include details such as who a person called or e-mailed. A PowerPoint slide provided to the newspaper by Snowden shows how analysts use software to create diagrams of where a person was at certain times, their traveling companions, their social networks and email correspondents. Defending the practice . President Barack Obama has ordered a review of NSA's data collection practices because of Snowden's leaks. But the president has defended the use of such methods to gather intelligence on terrorists and other threats. In response to the latest disclosure, the NSA again emphasized it does not listen to phone calls or read emails of Americans without obtaining a court order. But the newly disclosed system ""tells an extraordinary amount about who you are ... who your closest allies and friends and colleagues are,"" Greenberg said. ""To pretend that you have to read the information to be going into what a person is doing is making a false distinction."" Opinion: Give Apple your fingerprint? It's your call .

"(CNN) -- Tornado-spawning storms that tore through parts of Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska over the weekend will move across the central United States on Monday. The National Weather Service said severe weather and flooding will be possible from the central Plains to the Great Lakes region. Colder air will continue to bring heavy snow across portions of the Rockies. On Monday, there's a 50-60% chance of thunderstorms in Omaha, Nebraska, and Kansas City, Missouri, the weather service said. Clear weather is forecast for Tuesday. Though the storms in the Plains bypassed the cities, residents of rural areas began cleaning up after twisters wreaked havoc. No deaths or serious injuries were reported. In Sutton, Nebraska, at least one tornado touched down Sunday. Loren H. Uden, Emergency Management Coordinator for Clay County, told CNN a police officer was hurt when high winds blew the windows out of a cruiser. Ten grain bins were damaged and roofs were blown off eight businesses. At least one farm was wrecked. ""I guess it just lifted up the house and slammed it back down, because it's just in a pile of rubble right now,"" said McKenzie Griess, whose car was crushed by a tree in the severe weather. ""This was my cousin's house. He and his wife lived there with their two kids. They weren't home. They got out in time. They went to my aunt's house a couple of miles away. It's freaky to see,"" she said. In Orrick, Missouri, outside of Kansas City, a twister damaged 200-300 homes in the town of about 900 people, reported CNN affiliate KCTV. The local high school was damaged so badly that graduation next Sunday will have to be held in a neighboring school, KCTV reported. ""It has been tough,"" resident Lana Ryan told the affiliate. ""We've all kind of been in shock when this happens."" Residents said the last tornado hit Orrick back in 1967. ""Orrick has been blessed for many years, so I guess it was our turn,"" Ryan said. The storms downed trees, caused high water and knocked out power in Omaha and its outskirts. ""You could just see a wall fo water coming down the street. I kind of told my wife we'll go hide in our little area,"" Robert Walko of Elkhorn told CNN affiliate WOWT, . Behind the severe weather affecting the Plains, meteorologists are keeping a watchful eye on a snowstorm in the Rockies. Winter storm warnings and advisories have been issued for parts of Utah, Colorado, southern Wyoming and western Nebraska. Higher mountain elevations could see 1 to 2 feet of snow, with isolated pockets of up to 3 feet. Denver could get up to 5 to 10 inches of snow. Although snow might seem unusual this time of year, it's actually not record-setting for the Mile High City. Denver received an inch of snow on May 11, 2011, and even recorded snow as late as June 12 in 1974. The Southwest won't escape this wild weather either. Very strong, damaging winds will blow into parts of southern California, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico with gusts up to 50 to 60 mph. Dry conditions mixed with gusty winds will enhance the fire threat. CNN's Matt Daniel, Todd Borek, Matthew Stucker and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","More storms possible Monday across central U.S.

"(CNN) -- French fashion designers don't hold a monopoly on haute. Every April the country's top pâtissiers and chocolatiers prove they can be just as outlandish as they unveil their annual collection of chocolate Easter eggs. These edible delights take countless forms. Master pâtissier Christophe Roussel looked East when creating ""Sweet Japon,"" a sushi plate made entirely of chocolate, chocolate paste, marzipan and nougat. Chop sticks allow choc-o-holics to dip their sugary maki and sushi in salted butter caramel. Guy Krenzer and his army of pastry chefs at Maison Lenôtre dreamed up a blue-and-white chocolate egg that resembles traditional Chinese porcelain. At Le Bristol Hotel, head pastry chef Laurent Jeannin has sculpted an open-work chocolate egg that is inspired by the Piaget Rose jewelry collection. Children staying at the hotel can participate in the Bristol's annual Easter egg hunt in its French garden. The child who finds a pink egg will win the sculptured chocolate—and an 18-carat pink gold Piaget diamond ring that is hidden inside. Pierre Mathieu, the head pastry chef at the Mandarin Oriental Paris, says that France's obsession with the high-end egg stems from the country's history of gastronomy and Catholicism. Apparently a gorgeous egg honors both. For his part, Mathieu and his team have crafted 50 limited edition eggs, each of which weighs 450g (the same as a 12 ounce can of soda), and costs 68 € ($95). Inspired by the Chinese tangram puzzle, the egg has seven removable pieces that together form a shape at the egg's base. ""I thought I could work on the idea of a chocolate egg that could be as delicious as it is playful, with an 'Asian' story and origin,"" Mathieu says. ""This was a good way to combine the French knowledge we use to make chocolate with the Mandarin Oriental Asian heritage."" But this is no game. ""The most difficult part of the process is to fix the whole egg with the most accuracy and neatness as possible,"" he says. ""I want the egg to look like a jewel, or a collectible."" International appeal . French chefs are bringing their magic to the U.K., and helping to elevate Easter eggs beyond the cream-filled, grocery store variety. At the Four Seasons Hotel London at Park Lane, French pastry chef Loic Carbonnet spent 25 days making 50 Easter eggs, which are actually three eggs in one. A nine-inch egg, made from the finest Valrhona chocolate, houses a five-inch egg, made with the brand's Ivoire White chocolate, which in turn contains a three-inch egg made from Madagascan dark chocolate. The $125 price tag reflects the labor involved in this most delicate process: Loic and his team spent seven hours crafting the first egg. They had to watch the temperature throughout. To temper the chocolate Carbonnet first had heat it to around 50 or 55 degrees Celsius (122 to 131 degrees Fahrenheit), then cool it to around 28 degrees C (82 degrees F), and then mold and shape it at no more than 32 degrees C (90 degrees F). ""It's a long process because you have to temper the chocolate, then mold it, then create the right thickness,"" Carbonnet says. ""If it's too thick guests cannot break it. If it's too thin it will be too fragile to travel."" Four millimeters is a safe thickness. Carbonnet points out two other perils of his work. If water finds its way into the chocolate bowl, the chocolate will never harden and it will be impossible to use during molding. The other issue is timing. A chef who leaves his chocolate on the stove for 15 minutes is signing his own pink slip. ""The chocolate dictates your work and when it's ready,"" he says. ""It's like cooking a piece of meat for a guest who wants it medium rare. If you wait and let the meat rest for too long it will be overcooked. It's the same with chocolate. You cannot have a second chance."" All dressed up . For luxury hotels, Easter eggs are more than just sweet treats for guests. They are also an opportunity to help connect their brand with the joys of Easter. At Claridge's, London's iconic Art Deco hotel, limited edition Easter eggs have become one of the hotel's most anticipated traditions. Pastry Chef Ross Sneddon now has the process down pat. ""We use two molds which we then assemble to make one hollow egg,"" he says. ""Once they are gently warmed, we melt and temper the chocolate by flooding, pouring, lining each egg shell 3 times with thin layers of chocolate. These shells are left to crystallize properly in their molds overnight."" They then de-mould the eggs, assemble the two halves, fill them with miniature chocolate eggs, and, to avoid a heavy and unsightly seam, use a warm metal tray ""to melt the seam edge of the eggs which are then carefully joined together and left to set."" But perhaps the most crucial step—and the one responsible for the first impression—is the packaging. His team use special black-and-white foil meant to invoke the hotel's lobby. ""We hope and hear that people love our Easter Eggs,"" he says. ""It's a little bit of magic of Claridge's that people can take away with them"".

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- Chemical attacks with chlorine gas. Barrel bombs dropped from regime helicopters. Syrians starved into submission in opposition-controlled areas. The alleged assaults by the Syrian government against its own people are atrocious. But in an exclusive interview with CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, the country's deputy foreign minister says such claims are rubbish. ""I assure you 100% that chlorine gas has never been used by the government,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al Mekdad said. His assertion came shortly after Human Rights Watch said it had strong evidence that showed regime forces carried out a chlorine gas attack in the rebel-held village of Kfar Zeita. According to the rights group, 11 people were killed and 500 were injured in three towns following the gas attack. But Mekdad acknowledged that the government is not fighting lightly against opposition forces. ""My friend, we shall not attack them with flowers, because they are not attacking us with flowers,"" he said. ""They are attacking with most sophisticated weapons, given to them by the United States, given to them by Europe, given to them by Turkey, given to them by the Saudis and others."" Last September, a U.S. official said CIA-funded weapons have started flowing to Syrian rebels. A rebel leader told CNN at the time that he ""can't talk about weapons,"" though he did stress that opposition forces were getting help. ""We are getting now a lot of support from our American friends, but I can't talk in detail about all kinds of the support,"" he said. Sanctions from United States . On Wednesday, the United States announced sanctions against two al Qaeda leaders operating in Syria. The U.S. Treasury Department took action against Abd Al-Rahman Muhammad Zafir Al-Dubaysi Al-Juhni and 'Abd Al-Rahman Mustafa Al-Qaduli. The pair were named as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, meaning any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. citizens are prohibited from doing business with them. According to the Treasury Department, Al-Juhni was one of a group of senior al Qaeda members who conducted operations against Western targets. Al-Qaduli is a senior official in the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, formerly known as al Qaeda in Iraq, the department said. He is based in Syria for the terrorist network. Al-Qaeda is one of the groups of fighters who have entered the battlefield in Syria. Their alliance with some factions of the opposition has led to tensions and rifts between those fighting against the Syrian government. ""Our action today highlights al Qaeda's and similar groups' efforts to take advantage of the unrest in Syria and sends a strong warning to the legitimate Syrian opposition and those who wish to support it that they must reject the attempts of (terrorist groups) to elicit support for their cause by preying on the sympathies of the international community for the plight of the Syrian people,"" Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen said in a statement. Claims of forced starvation . Mekdad also vehemently denied claims that the regime has been cutting off food access to people in Homs, which has been an opposition stronghold during much of the country's 3-year civil war. ""We are not starving anybody. We are trying to reach all those civilians under the control (of the rebels). And on different occasions, many convoys carrying humanitarian aid have gone but were turned back by the terrorist groups,"" Mekdad said. The Syrian regime has consistently referred to opposition fighters as ""terrorists."" ""If they are speaking about (the) starving of terrorism and terrorists, yes we have to do our best, and I think this is our right to do it,"" Mekdad added. Syrians return to Homs to see what war left them . Botched truce . A truce began May 7 in Homs, and opposition fighters and their families there were evacuated to Addar al-Kabira, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. But government forces shelled Addar al-Kabira this week, according to the opposition. ""The regime's shelling of the town of Addar al-Kabira north of Homs, to where rebels of Homs retreated in line with a deal organized by the U.N., makes evident the falsity of the truces that the Assad regime seeks to promote,"" Nasser al-Hariri, a member of the Syrian Coalition, said in a statement Tuesday. Originally, the opposition had agreed to allow aid into pro-government neighborhoods in Aleppo, both Shiite enclaves, in exchange for the safe passage of fighters out of Homs. Survival in a siege: leaves become food, faith becomes strength . Election coming up . Despite the ongoing war that has killed more than 100,000 people, Mekdad said the country is ""absolutely"" fit to hold a presidential election on June 3. When asked how Syrians in war-torn Aleppo would be able vote, the deputy foreign minister lambasted the United States and European countries. ""This double standard by certain ... European countries and the United States among others -- they don't want anything to move in Syria. They don't want legitimacy in Syria. They want the disintegration of this country,"" Mekdad said. ""Or, in fact if we have to take into full consideration what they want: They don't want Syria to exist, or they want to hand Syria over to terrorist groups."" The United Nations has asked the government to reconsider the election as the carnage continues to mount every day. But even if Syria proceeds with a presidential vote, the election might not yield any significant change. President Bashar al-Assad's family has had a tight grip on power in Syria for the past 43 years. Al-Assad succeeded his father in 2000 and won a second term in 2007, unopposed. Al-Assad is running again this year. Frederik Pleitgen reported from Damascus; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Barbara Starr also contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. Treasury Department announces sanctions on two al Qaeda leaders .

"(CNN) -- The family of Kendrick Johnson has sued a south Georgia school district claiming it was negligent in protecting their son from harassment and bullying, which they contend led to his death. Johnson's body was found in a rolled-up mat in the Lowndes High School gymnasium on January 11, 2013. The lawsuit was filed in State Superior Court on Tuesday. It alleges that Lowndes County Board of Education was negligent and violated Johnson's constitutional right to equal protection based on race. Johnson was African-American. Investigators with the Sheriff's Office ruled his death accidental -- concluding that Johnson climbed into the center of the gym mat to reach for a shoe and got stuck. Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson believe that their son was beaten to death. They hired an independent pathologist, who found ""unexplained apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma"" to the teen's neck and concluded the death was a homicide. The U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia launched a federal investigation into the case on October 31, 2013. An attorney for Lowndes County Schools had not returned CNN's request for comment by Tuesday evening.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- With a new armed threat breathing down its neck, Libya's discordant government made a snap announcement on Tuesday -- elections will be held in just over a month. The move was intended to stem a spike in violence that has prompted the U.S. military to ramp up preparations for a possible emergency evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. Just two days prior, armed men claiming allegiance to a newly formed movement called the Libyan National Army stormed parliament and announced they had suspended it. The declared goal of the LNA is to eradicate Islamist militants from Libya, including Ansar al-Sharia -- the group blamed for the September 11, 2012 deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. Nearly 80 people have died in less than a week in battles initiated in the name of the LNA. Why it's all gone so badly wrong . Politics and bullets . But the effectiveness of any solution involving an election is sure to find doubters in Libya. Only 1.3 million out of an estimated 3.4 million eligible voters are registered to vote, according to Libya's elections commission. During the country's last election in February, only 14% of eligible voters participated, and boycotts and violence spoiled polls in some cities. The budding military alliance is a reflection of the political deadlock in Libya, which has increasingly pitted Islamists against those who oppose them. Their squabbles have paralyzed government, hindered elections, foiled security efforts and cost the interim administration its legitimacy in the eyes of many Libyans. After the raid on parliament -- known as the General National Congress -- its speaker, an Islamist, called upon a large Islamist militia to take up the fight. Gunfire from the skirmishes that followed crackled through Tripoli for nearly two days. Four people died and 90 were wounded, health officials said. Turmoil in Libya: Fighting sweeps across Tripoli following violence in Benghazi . New military force . Still, it was much less bloody than a battle in Benghazi last week led by retired Gen. Khalifa Haftar, who first declared the existence of the LNA. Haftar's men launched a land and air offensive against the Benghazi bases of Ansar al-Sharia and Islamist groups with ties the government in Tripoli. The resulting battle killed 75 people and wounded 141 more. Haftar was once a general in the Libyan army under dictator Moammar Gadhafi but had a falling out with him and emigrated to the United States, where he lived for almost 20 years. He returned in 2011 to participate in the revolution to overthrow Gadhafi. He has criticized the government for not getting a grip on violence, particularly from Islamist groups, and has called for the government in Tripoli to be removed from power. He has named his campaign against Islamist militias Operation Dignity. Militants have attacked foreign diplomats, Westerners, Libyan journalists, activists and judges, but they have aimed most of their violence at government security forces with nearly daily bombings, kidnappings and assassinations. Establishment army clout . Many of those who have declared alliance with Haftar come from the ranks of Libya's army, including well-respected officers, and they have been on war footing with Islamist militias already. Members of secular militias have also joined the LNA. The central government has vehemently objected to Haftar's offensive, but the retired officer, who fought to overthrow former dictator Moammar Gadhafi, vowed to not stop until Libya is ""purged"" of extremists groups. It's unclear whether there was any coordination of the attacks in Tripoli and Benghazi by forces claiming loyalty to the Libyan National Army. But their common enemy is clear: Libya's Islamists. U.S. prepares evacuations . As violence spread early this week, the U.S. military doubled the number of aircraft standing by in Italy if needed to evacuate the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. About 250 Marines plus seven Ospreys and three C-130 planes were in place, just in case, a Pentagon spokesman said. No decision has been made to close the embassy, he said, but one of the lessons of the Benghazi incident that killed the U.S. ambassador and three more U.S. citizens was the ""need to be more agile.""

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy and Adam Scott showed they were rolling into top form ahead of next month's U.S. Open with impressive victories on either side of the Atlantic Sunday. McIlroy put his personal difficulties behind him -- he broke off his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki earlier in the week -- to win the European Tour's flagship event at Wentworth, while Scott lived up to his billing as the new world number one with a playoff success in the Colonial event in Texas. Both carded final rounds of 66 to achieve their wins, McIlroy by a shot from Ireland's Shane Lowry at the European PGA Championships, while Aussie Scott had to go to extra holes to beat Jason Dufner. In doing so, he put paid to the chances of Sweden's Henrik Stenson snatching the top spot in the rankings. Stenson had earlier finished seventh behind McIlroy and needed Scott to finish lower than 13th to claim the status. But there was no danger of that as the 2013 U.S Masters champion rolled home several clutch putts in his four-under effort. He was tied on nine-under 271 with American Dufner, who also shot a 66, but finally prevailed at the third playoff hole. ""It's so satisfying in so many ways to get it done,"" Scott told the PGA Tour official website. He had been four-over-par early in his first round before battling back through the field. The 25-year-old McIlroy also trailed for much of the four rounds on the famous West Course, being seven shots behind tournament leader Thomas Bjorn going into the final round. But Bjorn, who opened with a superb 62, finished with a round 13 shots more for a 75 to open the door for the likes of McIlroy. ""I played well, I played solid but I struggled Friday,"" McIlroy admitted afterwards. ""I was fortunate today a few people made mistakes ahead of me, and I took advantage of that,"" he added, referencing Bjorn's collapse from taking a five-shot lead into the last day. Yet the tournament had been overshadowed by the media storm that followed McIlroy's announcement he was to split Wozniacki. The on-off relationship had been followed as keenly in gossip columns as it had on the sports pages, but the announcement, coming shortly after the wedding invites had been sent out, had created a cloud of publicity that stubbornly followed McIlroy around Wentworth. ""The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realize that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails,"" McIlroy said in a statement released to the press. ""There is no right way to end a relationship that has been so important to two people ... I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had. I will not be saying anything more about our relationship in any setting."" McIlroy later admitted that focusing on golf helped him forget about his personal issues and as the week went on he found top form. His final round, included an eagle and six birdies, the final two on the 17th and 18th to post a 14-under total which could not be matched. His Irish friend Lowry got closest, finishing a shot back, with two-time Luke Donald and Bjorn tied for third on 12-under. It was McIlroy's first victory in Europe for 18 months and stands him in good stead ahead of his challenge in the U.S. Open at Pinehurst where he will be bidding to add to his 2011 success in the major. Scott and 2013 PGA Championship winner Dufner will also be hoping to carry their fine weekend form into the second major of the season in search of their own second triumph at golf's highest level.","Rory McIlroy comes from behind to win PGA Championship .

"Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- It conjures images of cauldrons and pointed hats if you live in the western world or exotic masks and sacred objects if you're on the African continent. Around the world a sense of mystery and fear engulfs witchcraft and nowhere is this more evident than in the East African nation of Tanzania. Here, faith in this specific form of African tradition can turn deadly. People with albinism have been dismembered in western parts of the country because so-called witchdoctors perpetuate a belief that albino body parts bring great wealth. From the archives: Scores of albinos in hiding after attacks . Those suspected of witchcraft are also targeted; an estimated 600 elderly women were killed in 2011 due to the suspicion they were witches, according to the Legal and Human Rights Center in Tanzania. In fact, the Pew Forum on Religious and Public life conducted 25,000 face-to-face interviews in 19 African nations and found that among them, Tanzanians hold the strongest belief in witchcraft. It says 60% of the Tanzanians interviewed believe that sacrifices to ancestors or spirits can protect them from harm, and that many Christians and Muslims incorporate elements of traditional African beliefs into their daily lives. Dark arts flourished in Tanzania partly because, compared to its neighbors, it was ""less colonized"" by European powers, explains Joachim Mwami of Dar Es Salaam University. The anthropology professor says for centuries, witchcraft has ""served to explain anything inexplicable,"" in rural villages like a severely sick child or strange illness. Professor Mwami admitted that, ""even in my own family, I was advised [as a child] not to visit certain relatives considered to be witches,"" even though there was no proof. He says without access to education, people are more likely to follow the claims of traditional healers and pass down those beliefs to the next generation. Students at Dar Es Salaam University were reluctant to talk to CNN about opinions relating to witchcraft. Some explained, even if they don't personally believe in the practice, their relatives take it seriously. Others feel one must believe in the practice for it to have any power over them. So even with a university education, some students retain some faith in witchcraft. Read related: Saudi woman beheaded for witchcraft . Believers seeking healing regularly visit Mama Safi, a self-proclaimed ""good witch,"" who gained her powers after being visited by spirits, she says. ""I'm able to remove evil, stomach sickness, migraines, typhoid and diabetes too,"" she boasts. Safi conducts parts of her ceremonies in Arabic, even though she claims to have never studied it. Her fee ranges anywhere from $20 to $120 depending on the service provided; expensive when you consider most Tanzanians live on less than $2 a day. Professor Mwami says the charging of any type of fee is not typical among traditional African healers and is more common among con artists capitalizing on the fears of others. Debunking the claims of other so-called witches is Suleiman Musa, a man with albinism living in fear while trying to raise awareness about his genetic condition. Albinism reveals itself through a lack of melanin or coloring in the skin, hair and eyes. Musa says many of his albino friends fled their rural homes after being chased out by locals. He too experiences prejudice and animosity from strangers. ""I bear the pain because I can't do anything [else],"" he says. Tanzania's first elected albino lawmaker: 'We deserve rights' However, in the bustling city of Dar Es Salaam he's found support through an informal football team made up of people with albinism; Albinos United. He relishes the chance to explain to onlookers that he's ""normal, because this is the color God chose for me."" Musa doesn't believe treatment of albinos will improve if Tanzanians remain uneducated about albinism. Professor Mwami agrees that education is precisely what's needed to address issues surrounding witchcraft saying, ""the popularization of science is the only answer to these predicaments as far as Tanzania and belief systems are concerned.""","Some 60% of Tanzanians believe sacrifices to spirits or ancestors can protect them from harm .
Witchcraft serves to explain things that are inexplicable to those in rural villages without education, says anthropology professor .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has tapped a leading general accused by the United States of being a drug ""kingpin"" to be the country's new defense minister. Gen. Henry Rangel Silva will replace Carlos Mata Figueroa, according to the state-run AVN news agency. Chavez, who called Rangel a ""good soldier,"" made the announcement Friday in the central city of Guanare, the agency reported. The United States added Rangel to its kingpin list in 2008 for allegedly providing support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC. A statement from the Treasury Department then said that the general ""materially assisted the narcotics trafficking activities of the FARC,"" and pushed for more cooperation between the Venezuelan government and the leftist rebels. Since 2003, the U.S. government has considered the FARC a ""significant foreign narcotics trafficker."" The action froze whatever assets Rangel may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibited citizens from doing business with him. He is not the only Venezuelan official designated by the United States as a drug kingpin. In September, the Treasury Department added lawmaker Freddy Bernal -- a Chavez loyalist -- and three other officials to the list. All were accused of allegedly providing support to the FARC, which has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. While severely weakened in recent years, the guerrilla group continues to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces.","Gen.

"(CNN) -- Margaret Delfino donated her 200th pint of blood last week, bringing her total to to more than 25 gallons. Maragaret Delfino has been donating blood since 1954. She has donated more than 25 gallons of blood. Delfino, a 90-year-old great-grandmother in Bakersfield, California, began giving blood in 1954. She donated regularly until 2001, when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. After five years of treatment, her doctors declared her cancer-free and she then continued donating. Now she brings several family members with her when she donates at the Houchin Blood Bank in Bakersfield, hoping they'll donate, too. Delfino says only a small percentage of people in her area donate blood. ""To think in Kern County that there are only 3 percent who give blood when there are so many who are able to donate,"" she said. Delfino wants to get the message out for more people to donate. ""It can mean the difference between life and death for some people,"" she said. She said she believes that donating blood is one reason she may have survived her cancer. ""Because I donated all that blood, and the doctors were changing my blood, is why I came through the cancer the way I did,"" she said. Delfino has plenty of family support, too, and she would like to see her family members follow in her footsteps. ""She's just an inspiration to all of us,"" said Jennifer Parks, Delfino's granddaughter. ""She's been a huge part of my children's lives, who are now 9, 8 and 5. My children know where her interest lies and that is in donating blood."" Jennifer does not donate, but her sister Natalie does. ""Natalie and my grandmother coordinate their days so they donate together,"" said Parks. ""My grandmother drives herself to the blood bank, which is about six miles, and it's a date they have every eight weeks."" All three of Delfino's children, two grand-children and four of eight great-grand-children live in Bakersfield. Delfino says it is the children who keep her motivated. The great-grandmother still lives in her own home on slightly more than an acre of property and enjoys gardening, planting flowers and time with family.

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN)  -- Nepal has given its security personnel permission to shoot pro-Tibet demonstrators during China's Olympic flame climb to Mount Everest's summit early next month. Everest and the Himalayan mountain range seen from the air. ""About 25 soldiers and policemen have established camps on the mountain and they have been ordered to use force if necessary to stop any anti-Chinese activities,"" Mod Raj Dotel, spokesman for the home ministry, said Sunday. ""This could mean shooting if necessary."" Security personnel will also check mountain climbers for non-essential expedition materials, Dotel added. ""If anyone is found with anti-Chinese material their permit will be canceled and returned from the mountain,"" he said. Chinese climbers plan to take the Olympic flame to the top of the world's highest peak, at 8,848 meters (29,028 feet) as part of the global relay leading up to the August 8 opening of the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Spring is the most popular season for climbing Mount Everest, which straddles the border between Nepal and Tibet, an autonomous region of China. The Nepali government has granted permits to dozens of climbers from 30 expeditions this season. But between May 1 and May 10, climbers are barred from going above 6,400 meters until the torch run is completed. China plans to take the Olympic flame to the summit sometime then. Harsh weather conditions allow only about two opportunities in May for a push to the summit. The Chinese have not allowed any expedition to climb the mountain from the north side, according the Kathmandu representative of the Tibet China Mountaineering Association. Almost every day in the past month, Nepalese police have arrested pro-Tibet protesters from in front of the Chinese Embassy and the United Nations offices. The demonstrators are released later in the evening.  Watch protests in Kathmandu » . Supporters of Tibet denounce the government's stance toward the autonomous region, and many believe China should not have been awarded the honor of hosting the Olympic Games. Earlier torch relay stops in London, England; Paris, France; and San Francisco, California attracted tens of thousands of demonstrators. They led to attacks on the torch and relay participants, and prompted police to make dozens of arrests. Subsequent stops in Argentina, Tanzania and Oman were trouble-free. In Pakistan, authorities closed the relay to the public. And India shortened the relay and kept thousands of anti-Chinese protesters at bay by sealing off roads and shuttering buildings along the route. The relay went smoothly in Bangkok, Thailand, on Saturday, amid heavy security and scattered protests along the route. The flame arrived in Malaysia on Sunday. About 1,000 police officers will be on hand to watch for protesters during a relay in the capital city Kuala Lampur Monday.

"(CNN) -- The FBI has rescued 168 children and arrested 281 pimps in a countrywide crackdown on child sex trafficking. The operation, which took place over the last week in more than 100 cities, involved nearly 400 law enforcement agencies, authorities said Monday. The message, said FBI Director James Comey, should be clear: ""Our children are not for sale. ... We will respond and crush these pimps who would crush these children."" Since 2008, the FBI and its partners have rescued close to 3,600 children. The agency said investigations have led to 1,450 convictions and the seizure of more than $3 million in assets. ""These are not far-away kids in faraway lands. These are our kids, on our street corners, our truck stops, our motels, our casinos. These are America's children,"" Comey said. Speaking alongside the director, Leslie Caldwell, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's criminal division, stressed scores of more children remain victimized. She urged anyone with information about such abuse to contact authorities.

"(CNN) -- I am encouraged by Mark Cuban's clunky remarks. Granted, when Dallas Mavericks owner made statements about prejudice and Donald Sterling, they were insensitive and ironic. ""If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it's late at night, I'm walking to the other side of the street,"" he said in an interview on inc.com, triggering fresh painful images of Trayvon Martin. He went on to say if he saw ""a white guy with a shaved head and tattoos"" he'd do the same thing. The irony is many members of the NBA are black, several white players have tattoos and many of them likely have a hoodie hanging in their lockers. However, Cuban was willing to be self-reflective in his attempt to voice his bias and made mistakes in that effort -- that is critically important to advancing our public discourse on the complexities of race in America. I don't think anyone can disagree at Cuban's basic premise that we all have some level of prejudice or bias. Yet what rouses emotions to a call for action is the most destructive and violent strains of prejudice, bigotry and racism. What we witnessed in the Donald Sterling interview with Anderson Cooper was not him trying to have an honest conversation about bias like Cuban; what we saw was a bigot in denial arguing his case to keep his property. That property otherwise known as the LA Clippers is slipping from him. Commissioner Adam Silver said Donald Sterling violated the NBA constitution and is confident the league will be able to force Sterling and his wife to sell the franchise. Sterling has lost his legacy and will be forever known as a disgrace to the NBA and an icon of ignorance. At this point, the best way Sterling could change the way he'll be remembered in history is to come clean. ""Hi. My name is Donald Sterling. I am a racist. I need help."" It's been said the worst thing to be labeled in America is racist. But why the worst? It certainly is not the most unnatural thing to be, especially if you're from a certain era or region. American history is steeped in racist institutions, ideology and imagery. Being a racist in America isn't the lowest, actually it's highly probable. Donald Sterling has proven to be an all-star racist and he is part of an American legacy. All men are created equal: An enlightened philosophy, yet a near impossible practice. Our revolutionary road towards equality is long, bloody, littered with hypocrisy and utterly beautiful. What makes this country great is not its perfect walk to freedom for all, but its commitment to paving the way mile by painful imperfect mile. Racists are not always hateful or uneducated -- they are complicated, resistant, underdeveloped people, often the product of complex, cruel, greedy times and institutions. The brutal business of slavery in the U.S. is older than its Constitution. The Declaration of Independence was drafted during the height of the transatlantic slave trade while also slaughtering millions of indigenous Americans. It's complicated. How can America expect its citizens not to be conflicted? The foundation of our mighty agricultural economy was built on the international institution of slavery. Strong black bodies were bought and sold to perform specific work, which they were able to do with superior efficacy. The extraordinary physical capabilities and the impressive capacity to adapt and innovate of black men (and women) made many white men very rich for many years. Donald Sterling is not so singular, not some ancient artifact -- he has built his wealth on an old successful American business model. He is not alone or fully to blame for his racist mentality. The belief that the best use of black and brown people is to serve, labor, produce and entertain is part of America's long history and continues to this day. There are obvious metaphors connecting antebellum plantation operations to Sterling's comments about his ownership of the LA Clippers. However, we don't have to look as far back as slavery for support for why his being a racist isn't shocking. Donald Sterling (born Donald Totowitz) was born in 1934. Brown v the Board of Education was in 1954. Rosa Parks was arrested in 1955 and the landmark civil rights decision in Loving v the State of Virginia happened in 1967. Sterling was an adult with a character and morals already formed before the arrival of the civil rights movement. The movement happened but it's naive to believe the whole country would move with it. Sterling lived and flourished during legal, government sanctioned discriminatory and racists policies. Wealth for the privileged white male can create a power buffer against the messy work of civil rights. Clearly Sterling is a shrewd businessman. So if there were no obvious or immediate benefit for him to have an awakening of equality, why would he? It pays for Sterling, and has for many others, to be racist. To declare, ""I am not a racist"" while clearly communicating racist beliefs is actually the worst. Adding insult to ignorance, Sterling said ""I am not a racist"" countless times during his interview with Anderson Cooper, alternating it with some of the most racists statements heard in mainstream media this century. Proclaiming, ""I am not a racist "" while proving your racist ideology is more insulting and more dangerous than actually being racist. Denial is more diabolical than ignorance. It prevents the possibility of education and evolution. It would be far more encouraging if the next Sterling would just come out say. ""Yes, I am a racist"". Or during the inevitable awkward public apology, instead of the expected and lame, ""If I offended anybody I'm sorry,"" be courageous, admit it: ""What I said was racist and I am sorry."" Now that would be progress. It's also time for America to be really brave and take full responsibility for its racist past and current racist practices. To stop clutching its proverbial pearls every time one of our neighbors or leaders or landlords exposes their racist education. Our collective denial is stalling our advancement to a more perfect union. Donald Sterling is accomplished and educated, so one can only imagine the beliefs of the scores of less fortunate and underexposed. Numerous white supremacist groups are thriving right in our back yards. They too are citizens stuck in time, pathetically clinging to a bitter romanticized past where America was ruled solely by white males. Racists or people holding racist beliefs have to stop being cowards, face their racism and be willing to recover so we can all can get down to the better business of creating a land of the free home of the brave. Being a racist is not the worst. Lying about it, denying it and refusing recovery is. Admitting racism may very well be the first and critical step to actually ending it.

"(CNN) -- A missing Fort Bragg, North Carolina, soldier may be in danger, police said Tuesday. The GI's sister tearfully called for her safe return. Army Pfc. Kelli Bordeaux, 23, left a bar, Froggy Bottoms, early Saturday, Fayetteville police said in a news release. The GI had been drinking and was given a ride home by a bar employee, according to a U.S. Army official who spoke on condition of anonymity. At some point, Bordeaux sent two text messages, according to the Army official. One said, ""got home safely."" The official didn't know who the text was sent to or the contents of the other text. Fayetteville police searched Bordeaux's apartment and vehicle, according to the Army official, who did not know where the vehicle was found. Bordeaux was reported missing Monday when she failed to report for duty, the official told CNN. Older sister Olivia Cox said it was out of character for Bordeaux to miss work. ""Kelli is a good soldier,"" Cox told reporters Tuesday evening in Fayetteville. ""Kelli is not a soldier who would go AWOL."" Cox, who declined to discuss anything related to Bordeaux's visit to the bar, said she doesn't know of anyone who would harm her sister. Bordeaux's mother, Johnna Henson, said police told her an individual gave the young woman a ride to the bar, where she took part in karaoke. Henson told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that her daughter was ""spooked"" while someone was driving her home. Bordeaux reportedly told the driver to let her out before she reached the apartment, Henson said. Henson said she doesn't believe Bordeaux reached home. Bordeaux is described as 5 feet tall, weighing 99 pounds, with blond hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a pink halter top and black shorts, according to police. Bordeaux lives off-post and is from St. Cloud, Florida, according to Jackie Thomas, a public affairs officer at Fort Bragg. The soldier joined the Army in April 2011 and reported for duty at Fort Bragg in November, Thomas said. Bordeaux, a health service specialist, is assigned to the 601st Area Support Medical Company, 261st Multifunctional Medical Battalion, 44th Medical Brigade. She had attended college, relatives said. ""She joined the military to make her family proud,"" said Cox. ""She just wanted to have that future securely in place. She knew the military would do that."" Bordeaux and her civilian husband have been married two years, according to Cox. The sisters last communicated on Friday. ""I texted her. And we laughed and joked and everything was happy,"" said Cox. Detectives ask those with information to call the department at (910) 433-1856 or CrimeStoppers at (910) 483-TIPS (8477).

"(CNN) -- Two high school students -- managing editors at their school newspaper in Ann Arbor, Michigan -- wrote a distressing op-ed that appeared recently in The New York Times. Madeline Halpert, a junior, and Eva Rosenfeld, a sophomore, had undertaken a Herculean task. After bonding over the discovery that both were being treated for depression, they linked up with other journalism students and gathered highly personal stories about mental illness from teenagers in their school district. Incredibly, all their subjects agreed to be identified. No unnamed sources. No pseudonyms. These were reporters who did their homework, and subjects who saw the merit of going public about their experiences with everything from depression and anxiety to eating disorders and drug abuse. The two student editors were gearing up to devote an entire edition of the paper to telling the mental health stories of their peers. And then, the head of their school put the kibosh on the project. The stories were not to be published lest they trigger bullying or further mental health problems for the afflicted students. I read the two girls' story the morning after a remarkable night of witnessing just the opposite -- the progress that comes when school administrators encourage their students to speak and write openly about mental illness. High school students in the tiny New England town of Ledyard, Connecticut, population 14,687, for six years have been competing in an essay contest called ""Breaking the Silence about Mental Illness."" The project got started when two Ledyard high school health teachers teamed up with the leader of a local mental health support group to invite kids to compete for annual prizes of $250, $150 and $100. The prize money comes from the local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. I was one of four judges, which has given me a ringside seat to this work in progress at changing attitudes. Importantly, if you include our contest coordinator who oversees the project, three in our group of five are mental health professionals who can spot when an essayist hasn't gotten the facts right, or displays red flags that should be brought to the attention of a parent. All of us have a connection to mental health issues, whether it is in a lifelong professional devotion, our own mental illness, or the care of a loved one. On Wednesday night, we honored our latest crop of courageous teenage writers in a meeting room at a state mental health center in Norwich, Connecticut. Ben Coffing read his third-place essay, ""ADHD Though My Eyes"" and taught the audience a little something about the pain of feeling different. ""Imagine being called SPED in the hallway just because you have to work harder at school than someone else,"" he said, referring to the derogatory slang that some students throw at special education kids. As far back as Ben can remember, kids thought he was weird because he was ""a little bit different."" But he also thinks having ADHD has made him ""a very caring person when others have a problem or issue."" I mean, can you top that, or what? Molly Barnett read her second-place winning essay, ""Breaking The Silence About Mental Illness."" ""Try to put yourself in their shoes,"" she said of people struggling with a mental health condition. ""Imagine going through each day, each hour, fighting the voices screaming in your head, as if you have schizophrenia."" Kathleen Ferry, the first-prize winner, began to sob just a few paragraphs into reading her gripping essay about what she called the ""alternate reality"" of two weeks in a psychiatric hospital. I offered to read the rest, and Kathleen stood beside me as I shared her words about ""going from ER visit to ER visit"" in her struggle with a worsening depression. After her last line -- ""I am living proof that things do get better; all you need is guidance"" -- Kathleen got a standing ovation from the audience of parents, siblings, friends and local residents. And then she posed for a picture with her $250 check, and took a seat next to her mom, who wrapped her arms around Kathleen and planted two big kisses on her right cheek. Parents or guardians of our winners always show up for the big night. The contest drew 36 entries in 2008, its launch year. That inched up to 40 in 2009 and then a record-breaking 92 by 2013, just months after students in another Connecticut school got a crash course on mental illness in the Sandy Hook massacre. This year, 149 Ledyard students submitted essays -- another record. The wisdom, honesty and emotion of the entries compounds with each cycle. Mental illness in children: Where to turn . What's always striking is how wide a population is affected by mental illness in such a tiny community. The two student editors in Ann Arbor observed the same thing on a larger scale. Cheryl Jacques, an essay contest judge and executive director of the Southeastern Mental Health Authority, a division of Connecticut's Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, said kids suffering with mental illness are craving information that can help them make sense of what they're feeling.

"(CNN) -- Two decades of satellite readings back up what dramatic pictures have suggested in recent years: The mile-thick ice sheets that cover Greenland and most of Antarctica are melting at a faster rate in a warming world. That's the conclusion of an international network of scientists who released their review of one of the biggest question marks in climate science Thursday. The net loss of billions of tons of ice a year added about 11 millimeters -- seven-sixteenths of an inch -- to global average sea levels between 1992 and 2011, about 20% of the increase during that time, those researchers reported. While that's a small number, ""Small changes in sea levels in certain places mean very big changes in the kind of protection of infrastructure that you need to have in place,"" said Erik Ivins, a geophysicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and one of the contributors to Thursday's study. Chasing down the world's vanishing glaciers . Long-term climate change fueled by a buildup of atmospheric carbon emissions is a controversial notion politically, but it's one accepted as fact by most scientists. Previous estimates of how much the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets contributed to the current 3 millimeter-per-year rise in sea levels have varied widely, and the 2007 report of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change left the question open. While the 19-year average worked out to about 20% of the rise of the oceans, ""for recent years it goes up to about 30 or 40%,"" said Michiel van den Broeke, a professor of polar meteorology at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. The rest comes from thermal expansion -- warmer water takes up more space. The research released Thursday was backed by the European Union, NASA, the National Science Foundation and research councils in Britain and the Netherlands, with the findings published in this week's edition of the peer-reviewed journal Science. The project involved 47 scientists who compared readings from various satellite-based methods, including radar and laser readings and measurements of the minute gravitational changes around the ice sheets. They concluded that Greenland and two of the three ice sheets that cover Antarctica have lost an estimated 237 billion metric tons, give or take a few billion, in the past 19 years. The ice sheet that covers eastern Antarctica grew, but only by about 14 billion tons -- not nearly enough to offset the losses from the layer that covers the western portion of the continent and the Antarctic Peninsula. ""Antarctica is losing mass, but it's not losing as much mass as many of the reports had suggested,"" Ivins said. ""Greenland, on the other hand, is losing more mass today than it was in 1990 by a factor of five."" Satellites reveal rare levels of Greenland ice melt . Don't panic: At the current rate, it would take between 3,000 and 7,000 years for those regions to become ice-free, said Ian Joughin, a glaciologist at the University of Washington. ""But we can see that the trend is towards increases, and that that's something we do need to worry about,"" Joughin said. ""And that if we really want to have meaningful information that, you know, planners can use to build seawalls and things, there's going to have to be a big push to improve our projections of sea level rise using models."" In July, researchers watched as a stretch of unusually warm temperatures melted nearly the entire surface of the Greenland ice sheet. The study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd of Britain's University of Leeds, said the results are the clearest evidence that the ice sheets are losing ground and are intended to be the benchmark for climate scientists to use for future calculations. With environmental spotlight on Greenland, more tourists want closer look . ""Any model that someone would use to predict sea level rise is only really as good as the data that goes into it,"" Shepherd said. ""And the fact that our data is twice or three times as reliable as the most recent overarching assessment has to give some weight to improving the value of those model predictions in the future."" Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climatologist who was not part of the study, said the data collected could be used to fine-tune computer models of future climate change. But he said scientists need to learn more about the physics and mechanics of the ice sheets before developing effective projections of what effect they'll have on continued sea-level rise. ""Right now, all of that is very complicated stuff, and we're not at the point where all of that is integrated into the models we have now,"" Schmidt said. The findings were published as representatives of U.N. member states are gathered in Qatar in hopes of hammering out a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 pact aimed at reining in carbon emissions. That pact committed developing nations to reduce emissions with a goal of limiting the rise of global average temperatures to 2 degrees C (3.6 F) by 2100. But global emissions have gone up by about 50% since Kyoto, the World Meteorological Organization reported last week. The pact largely exempted developing nations like China and India, now the No. 1 and No. 3 emitters. The No. 2 producer -- the United States -- never ratified Kyoto.

"Washington (CNN) -- Ten years after an anthrax attack killed five people and awakened the nation to the dangers of bioterrorism, the United States remains largely unprepared for a large-scale bioterrorism attack or deadly disease outbreak, according a new report from the WMD Terrorism Research Center. The report, released Wednesday, gives the country mostly B's and C's for its ability to handle small-scale events, such as the anthrax letter attack of 2001, and failing grades for its ability to handle large-scale events, like the global epidemic depicted in the movie ""Contagion."" Notably, the report gives the country a ""D"" across the board for the country's ability to develop and quickly approve medical countermeasures such as diagnostic tools and vaccines, which are crucial in outbreaks of all sizes. The bipartisan center, headed by former Sen. Bob Graham, D-Florida, and former Sen. Jim Talent, R-Missouri, is an offshoot of the congressionally chartered WMD Commission, which concluded early last year. In its report, the center says the U.S. has spent more than $65 billion on bio-defense during the past decade, but still has holes that leave it vulnerable. ""Today we face the very real possibility that outbreaks of disease -- naturally occurring or man-made -- can change the very nature of America,"" the report concludes. Technology is also making it easier for terrorists to create deadly mischief, the report says. A small team of individuals with graduate-level training and readily available equipment ""could produce the type of bio-weapons created by nation-states in the 1960s,"" the report warns. The threat isn't simply hypothetical, the report says. Ayman Zawahiri, the presumed leader of al Qaeda following the death of Osama bin Laden, is a medical doctor with a known interest in bioterrorism, having started a bio-weapons program in Afghanistan and Malaysia in 1999, the report notes. The report's authors say they recognize that budget constraints are preventing governments from addressing all of the shortcomings in current bio-terror preparedness. They recommend focusing on potential large-scale outbreaks, saying such preparations would automatically improve preparedness for smaller outbreaks. ""If you focused just on the 'F' grades, you can pour a lot of money down that hole,"" said the center's Randy Larsen. ""If we work to make D's into C's, that is the best strategy for the nation."" Such a strategy will mean improving detection and diagnosis of large-scale diseases and attacks, improving the development of medical countermeasures such as vaccines, and developing methods of dispensing those countermeasures to large populations. Center President Lynn Kidder said that because of budget pressures, she is ""gravely concerned"" about the nation's ability to sustain gains in public health made during recent years. Government leaders need to understand that biomedical programs ""are not just nice-to-have programs. These are an integral part of our national security,"" she stressed. The center stressed that one key to improving the nation's preparedness is leadership. ""We have recommended that there should be someone in the federal government who has (bioterrorism preparedness) as their sole responsibility,"" Graham said. ""That someone should be an individual who has the capability to direct and influence actions by the multiplicity of agencies that are involved and provide leadership to non-federal entities."" The office of the vice president would be an appropriate spot for that job, Graham suggested. The nation also needs to invest in ""purpose-driven science,"" the report concludes. Scientific initiatives should focus on developing medical countermeasures to bio-weapons, environmental remediation, and bio-forensics to determine the source of attacks. Talent said the government should not follow the usual pattern of ignoring the threat until it is too late, and then throwing ""enormous amounts of money at it."" Instead, Talent said, the government should focus on the shortcomings identified in the report.","America is unprepared for a major bioterrorism attack or disease outbreak, a new report concludes .
Big concern is attack with biological weapons .
Hospitals could not handle deadly disease outbreak, says report ."
"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- A history of slipshod inspections is at least partly to blame for the disaster that destroyed the drill rig Deepwater Horizon and unleashed the worst oil spill in U.S. history, a former Interior Department official says. Bobby Maxwell worked for 22 years as an auditor and audit supervisor for the Minerals Management Service, and he said the disaster would not have happened if inspectors had done their jobs. But he said a ""culture of corruption"" enveloped the agency, ""and it permeated the whole agency, both the revenue and the inspection side."" The Minerals Management Service, a division of the Interior Department, is the primary federal agency that conducts safety inspections and collects revenue on the more than 3,500 oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico. Before leaving the agency in 2006, he supervised more than 100 auditors, who dig through oil company documents to make sure the federal government is getting all the royalties it's owed. He won an award from his bosses at the Interior Department. And although not an engineer by training, he spent a great deal of time on offshore rigs, many times working alongside Minerals Management Service inspectors. But he said that the agency was badly flawed and that investigators looking into the explosion that killed 11 workers aboard the rig in April should be asking questions about how those inspections were conducted. ""What types of inspections? Who did them? Did they give them any waivers? Was the equipment adequate? Did they think they needed a second blowout preventer? Did they demand BP put it in? MMS is responsible for that, too,"" he said. As an auditor, Maxwell said, he was flown to offshore oil rigs routinely, sometimes in the company of Minerals Management Service inspectors. He says that when he was present, agency inspectors he saw were doing little real work. ""It seemed like a formal process they would go through,"" he said. ""We showed up on the rig. They had a checklist they would run through quickly, check things off, say things like 'Hi, Joe. Hi, John. See you at this weekend's fishing tournament.' "" In May, an inspector general's report on the Minerals Management Service office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, sharply criticized a ""widespread"" culture of taking gifts from industry officials before 2007. Many of the inspectors joined the agency from the industry and had relationships with people in the business that originated ""well before they took their jobs with industry or government,"" the report states. Inspectors got paid meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored; let oil and gas company workers fill out their inspection forms in pencil, with the inspectors writing over those entries in ink before turning them in; and in 2008, one conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company that operated them, the report found. And a 2008 inspector general's report found that regulators in the agency's Denver, Colorado, office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them. Maxwell worked out of the Denver office during that period and traveled to the Gulf region frequently. He is now in the fifth year of a whistleblower lawsuit he filed against the Kerr-McGee Oil Co., claiming that the firm cheated the Interior Department and the U.S. Treasury out of tens of millions of dollars in revenue from the company's oil concessions in the Gulf. The company, which has since been acquired by Anadarko Petroleum, denies the accusations. A federal judge in Denver is hearing that lawsuit, and should he win, Maxwell will stand to gain about $6 million in whistleblower fees. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has publicly criticized some Minerals Management Service inspectors, saying they had a ""cozy relationship"" with oil company executives and workers. He has announced plans to split the agency into separate energy development, enforcement and revenue collection divisions, saying they have conflicting missions. In a statement issued to CNN, the Interior Department says that real change -- ""systemic and not cosmetic"" -- is coming to the service. Salazar ""is well aware that we need to clean up the troubled agency,"" the department said. But Maxwell said that even if the agency is split up, it won't make much of a real difference. ""You still have the same people,"" he said. ""If you had people issues with the corruption and jobs not being done, you still have the same people in the name of a new agency. So those people may not be changing what they are doing. Therefore, you have the old agency with the new name, with the same corruption."" Maxwell says he decided to speak out because he was ""tired of seeing us not being able to do the job we were hired to do."" He says he is both angry and heartbroken over the damage done to the marshlands, the water and to the economy of the Gulf states, especially Louisiana. ""The only way to potentially change it is to stand up and be recognized and tell what was happening,"" he said.","Bobby Maxwell spent 22 years at Minerals Management Service .

"(CNN) -- A powerful storm including a lightning strike in the launch pad area caused minor damage to the space shuttle Endeavour, a NASA official said Thursday. Continuing bad weather has prevented further inspection of the shuttle scheduled to launch on its final mission on April 19, said Allard Beutel, a spokesman at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The storm Wednesday included a wind gust of 90 miles per hour at launch pad 39A, as well as a lightning strike ""inside the pad perimeter,"" Beutel said. ""We didn't take a direct strike on the pad,"" Beutel said. ""Anytime you get that much electricity inside the perimeter you have to check things."" NASA officials so far know of minor damage to insulation foam at the top of the shuttle's external fuel tank, according to Beutel, who said a full assessment of damage won't be possible until further inspections take place. NASA says the storm that included high winds, lightning and hail blew in at about 5:20 p.m. Wednesday. ""No one was injured and initially no obvious damage was observed. The storm moved through the area quickly,"" said a NASA news release Wednesday. Endeavour is scheduled to blast off to the International Space Station on April 19.

"(CNN) -- Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka slumped to a tame defeat in the fading gloom of a rain-hit opening Monday at Roland Garros to Spanish outsider Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. Third seed Wawrinka, who won the Monte Carlo Masters at the start of the clay court season, showed little of that form as he surrendered 4-6 7-5 6-2 6-0 on Philippe Chatrier to the world number 41. The Swiss number one looked to restoring equilibrium when he took a hard-fought second set, but was outplayed in the remaining two to suffer an embarrassing first round exit in the second grand slam of the season. He saved one match point a 0-5 down in the fourth but then completed a match of 61 unforced errors by hitting a backhand long. Garcia-Lopez raised his arms in triumph while Wawrinka trudged off after the final action on the show courts after a weather-hit second day. ""It wasn't good at all, I kept trying to find my game, anything to get back in it but I just need to take a few days off now and figure out what happened,"" Wawrinka told gathered reporters after his defeat. ""He's a really good player but it was me, I couldn't find solutions and it was just terrible and a really big disappointment."" Earlier the two favorites for the men's title, eight-time champion Rafael Nadal and world number two Novak Djokovic eased their way through between the rain showers. Nadal dropped only three games in a ruthless demolition of Amerian Robby Ginepri, while Djokovic could afford to delight the Philippe Chatrier crowd with an impromptu chat with a ball boy. The 27-year-old Serbian was sitting under an umbrella during a break in play when he gestured to the young man to join him. They sat for several minutes talking and Djkovic even offered his new friend a drink before clinking bottles with him. The crowd lapped it up and burst into applause and after his 6-1 6-2 6-4 demolition of Portugal's Joao Sousa, Djokovic revealed the subject of the conversation. ""We had a nice chat,"" he told the official French Open website. ""He's a tennis player, so I asked him how long he's playing, and, you know, how he's enjoying his time as a ball kid. ""It was a nice, fun time, something unusual for the grand slams. He accepted the offer to sit down, which I didn't think he would do, but he did. So he's very spontaneous little boy, and I hope I see him my next match."" That will be against Frenchman Jeremy Chardy, with second seed Djokovic predicting a tougher test. Defending champion Nadal was even less troubled by Ginepri, who has not won a match on the ATP Tour all season and but for a spell in the second set did not muster much resistance. It was the top seed's 60th win at the French Open and he later shrugged off suggestions he had been snubbed by not playing on the main showpiece court of Philippe Chatrier and instead placed on Suzanne Lenglen. A fellow professional had called the decision ""bizarre"" but Nadal claimed not to be bothered by the scheduling. ""It doesn't really matter a lot,"" he said. ""Roland Garros is a pleasure for me, is a really honor, and is a special feeling. So all the memories at this place give me are unforgettable. ""And doesn't matter if it's Chatrier or Lenglen or another court,"" added the Spaniard. Nadal has suffered shock defeats in the clay court season and came close to losing in the final of the Madrid Masters to Kei Nishikori until the Japanese player succumbed to a back problem. Great things were still expected of Nishikori at the clay court grand slam, but the ninth seed did not appear to have shrugged off his injury as he went out 7-6 6-1 6-2 to Slovak Martin Klizan in his opening match. ""It's tough for me, but I guess this is my tennis life, you know. I have to take care of my body and injury will come again, for sure. So I have to mentally be ready,"" he said. ""I have to do whatever I can do to get healthy."" In the women's draw there was an easy first round win for seventh Maria Sharapova as she beat fellow Russian Ksenia Pervak 6-1 6-2. Sharapova, who lost last year's final to Serena Williams, needed only 27 minutes to wrap up the opening set and carried on her domination into the second. She will now face Bulgaria's 2010 Wimbledon semi-finalist Tsvetana Pironkova for a place in the third round but Williams looms as a possible quarterfinal opponent for the 2012 champion.

"(CNN) -- Pakistani police officers will be investigated because they didn't intervene when a woman was publicly beaten to death with bricks, a court official said Friday. Pakistani Chief Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, speaking live on state TV Friday, said he's asked the police inspector general to provide a full report on the so-called honor killing of Farzana Parveen, 25, who apparently died because she married a man against her family's wishes. ""I have also ordered that a case be filed against the police officers present at the crime scene,"" Jillani said, because it appears the ""cops helped the criminals by watching the crime as silent spectator."" Authorities said they arrested two of the woman's cousins, an uncle and a driver. Her father was arrested earlier. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday called the killing ""totally unacceptable"" and said it's a ""great shame"" for such a crime to happen in the presence of police. About 20 people, including members of Parveen's immediate family, attacked her with bricks Tuesday outside a court building in Lahore, police said. Aamir Jalil Siddique, vice president of the Lahore High Court Bar Association, told CNN, ""We believe that this was an oversight on the part of the police -- they were stationed there and did not do anything. We have security, Punjab police officers, at the high court 24 hours a day. The advocate general's office, which is next door to the gate, has additional security."" Such killings not uncommon . Despite the expressions of public outrage, such killings are an ingrained part of Pakistani culture, though they usually happen in rural areas, not large cities such as Lahore. Human rights activists said bystanders, including police, often don't intervene because the killings are considered family matters. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 869 women were victims last year in the nation of about 180 million people. These killings are so named because the women are accused of bringing dishonor upon the family such as having an adulterous affair, being raped or wearing clothes consider revealing. Women's rights advocates say the actual number may be much higher. The United Nations estimates at least 5,000 women worldwide die yearly in such killings. The prevalence of violence against women in Pakistan became apparent Thursday when Parveen's husband, Mohammad Iqbal, revealed to CNN that he killed his first wife six years ago so he could marry Parveen. His son said Iqbal served a year in jail. Iqbal, a neighbor of Parveen's family, said he and Parveen were supposed to marry with the family's approval last year. In December, Parveen's mother died, and her father and brothers decided Parveen, who came from a village in Punjab, should instead marry a cousin, police said. Opinion: How stoning of a woman riled the world . Bride's family infuriated . Parveen and Iqbal eloped and were married January 7 in a court ceremony. But Iqbal told GEO TV that Parveen's family was infuriated and filed a kidnapping case against him and other members of his family. They also demanded 100,000 rupees (about $1,000), he said. The couple went into hiding and filed statements in court to prove the kidnapping allegations false, Iqbal said. On Tuesday morning they were scheduled to appear before a judge when Parveen's family allegedly attacked outside the court building. ""We went to the court to seek justice to tell them what had happened. We were sitting there when all of a sudden they appeared,"" he told GEO TV. ""Someone fired shots in the air. My wife and I were sitting and then bricks were thrown, then a lady came and took Farzana away. ..."" Police stood and watched and didn't come to their aid, Iqbal said. He said the crowd killed his wife and her unborn child. In addition to the prime minister, other officials rushed to denounce the killing. The chief minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, gave a 24-hour ultimatum to the inspector general to arrest the suspects. He asked that a murder trial be held in an anti-terrorism court. Britsh Foreign Secretary William Hague said, ""There is absolutely no honor in honor killings, and I urge the government of Pakistan to do all in its power to eradicate this barbaric practice.""

"(CNN) -- On January 26, a ruling by the Librarian of Congress made unlocking a cell phone for use on other carriers illegal under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. Unbelievably, such a policy means that those unlocking their phones could face up to five years in jail and a $500,000 fine. This ruling affects average people, international travelers and hundreds of thousands of our service members. Unlocking your phone not only allows you to move from one carrier to another when your contract is up; it also increases the resale value of your device. This prohibition is a violation of our property rights. It makes you wonder, if you can't alter the settings on your phone, do you even own your own phone? This ruling is a clear example of crony capitalism, a consequence of a few companies asking for the law to be changed to their benefit despite the invasion of our property rights, its impact on consumers and its impact on the overall market. This decision makes it harder for new participants to enter the market, which hinders competition and leads to less innovation. This is why the trade association representing more than 100 wireless carriers across the country (Competitive Carriers Association), including T-Mobile and Sprint, is strongly in favor of unlocking. It's unfortunate that AT&T and Verizon's main lobbying organization was the main proponent of this ban (the Wireless Association). In a number of articles for The Atlantic, I helped turn this into a mainstream issue: ""The Most Ridiculous Law of 2013 (So Far): It Is Now a Crime to Unlock Your Smartphone"" and ""The Law Against Unlocking Cellphones Is Anti-Consumer, Anti-Business, and Anti-Common Sense."" I teamed up with Sina Khanifar, an entrepreneur whose company had been shut down for unlocking phones, and we led an advocacy effort for a White House petition. Our White House petition reached 114,000 signatures, the first petition to reach the new threshold of 100,000, which requires a response. Our movement involved a new coalition of actors, many of whom were part of the vocal opposition to the doomed Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, but also involved groups such as the Tea Party Nation and the National College Republicans. The White House reversed course and came out strongly in favor of unlocking and against the criminal penalties: . ""The White House agrees with the 114,000+ of you who believe that consumers should be able to unlock their cell phones without risking criminal or other penalties. In fact, we believe the same principle should also apply to tablets, which are increasingly similar to smartphones. And if you have paid for your mobile device, and aren't bound by a service agreement or other obligation, you should be able to use it on another network. It's common sense, crucial for protecting consumer choice and important for ensuring we continue to have the vibrant, competitive wireless market that delivers innovative products and solid service to meet consumers' needs."" The White House also came out in support of finding legislative fixes to solve this problem. The Federal Communications Commission has announced an investigation into this issue, and the chairman and a commissioner have publicly spoken in support of unlocking. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, took the lead on this issue and announced that he is working on legislation to fix this problem. This is terrific news and a great way for those in Washington to help win over the digital generation. Other members of Congress are also coming out in favor. There is a groundswell of momentum on this issue. But will Congress actually fix the problem, or will it just check the box? Ordinary and commonplace technologies have been made illegal by default without any serious policy consideration. Use of these technologies has to be approved for personal use every three years by the Librarian of Congress -- but even when approved -- developing, trafficking and selling the technologies is still illegal. That's the fundamental problem with unlocking, and that's the problem that must be permanently fixed, requiring nothing less than legislation to legalize unlocking for personal use permanently. Merely temporarily reversing the decision of the Librarian of Congress and keeping the underlying technology still illegal, and the personal exception subject to periodic new approval would put us back in this boat every three years. Such a nonsolution would show that Congress, even in the wake of SOPA, still isn't serious about innovation. Unfortunately, legislation by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, does this very thing, but I have confidence that in the coming weeks it can be improved to fix the problem. But beyond unlocking, there are other issues that need to receive serious review and consideration. Currently, there is an exception for personal jailbreaking (allowing individuals to install unapproved applications by altering the phone's operating system), but developing, selling, trafficking or discussing the underlying technology is still illegal and there are no personal exceptions for tablets or other devices. This makes no sense, especially when according to @Saurik, 23 million iOS devices are running a version of Cydia -- a rough barometer of the number of devices that have been jailbroken. Until recently, personal jailbreaking was illegal as well -- meaning that all of the owners of those devices could be criminally liable. A law that potentially makes 23 million people felons punishable by up to five years in prison for activity that does not harm anyone else is a law that must be fixed. Additionally, accessibility technology for individuals who are blind and deaf is effectively illegal as well and subject to the same ridiculous approval process by the Librarian of Congress. It is unconscionable that persons who are deaf and blind are considered felons punishable by up to five years in prison and a $500,000 fine for using technology that they may need to access media. We want every teenager who knows how to code to have an incentive to develop a new accessibility technology that may help these people enjoy media -- we may have no idea the potential innovations that we have criminalized senselessly. This technology should be made permanently lawful for personal use, creation, trafficking and selling. Lastly, research into computer science and cryptography for academic purposes should be lawful (read more on the topic here). There is a current exception, but it is narrow and unclear, and this has a chilling effect upon a lot of legitimate research -- some of the research would actually help protect intellectual property by helping to make digital rights management software stronger. Computer science research should not be banned without explanation if we want economic growth in the technology sector. Last year the proposed SOPA law would have censored the Internet and curtailed technological innovation. It is easy to see why it inflamed millions of Americans whose opposition killed the legislation. In this case, the government has banned broad categories of technologies -- and broad categories of uses -- without any clear governmental interest. This is another extreme and unacceptable violation of personal freedom. A free society shouldn't have to petition its government every three years to allow access to technologies that are ordinary and commonplace. A free society should not ban technologies unless there is a truly overwhelming and compelling governmental interest. Congress must act to legalize cellphone unlocking substantively, but then it must legalize other technologies that have been banned without explanation.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- New clashes erupted in eastern Ukraine as the divided country prepared for presidential elections this weekend, raising the question of whether pro-Russian forces sought to disrupt the vote in a move that the United States and its European allies say would trigger tougher sanctions on Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that his government would respect the will of the Ukrainian people in Sunday's vote, but added Russia would closely monitor events. In a speech to an international economic forum in Saint Petersburg, Putin also warned of a ""dangerous civil war"" underway in Ukraine following what he called a ""state coup"" carried out ""with support of the West, the United States"" that ousted the country's pro-Russian leader earlier this year. Latest fighting . At least 32 people were killed and 44 injured in clashes between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian separatists in the Luhansk region, according to the country's anti-terror office spokesman, Vladislav Seleznev. The clashes took place Thursday afternoon and lasted for a few hours, Seleznev told CNN on Friday. A total of 30 pro-Russian separatists and two Ukrainian soldiers were among the dead, while the injured included 37 separatists and seven Ukrainian soldiers, Seleznev said. Ukraine's defense ministry reported on its website that 20 separatists died in the Luhansk clash, with more than 30 wounded. The reports could not be independently confirmed, and some previous casualty claims by Ukrainian sources have proven unreliable. On Friday, pro-Ukrainian militias heading to shut down a pro-Russian checkpoint in Donetsk region came under attack, according to a regional Ukrainian authority and the chief of staff of one of the groups called the Right Sector. The Donetsk regional authority said one person died and nine were wounded, while the Right Sector official said four pro-Ukrainian fighters got trapped and may have been killed or captured. There were no further details on the affiliations of the casualties, and the reports also could not be independently confirmed. Sunday's election will choose a successor for ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych in the country riven by Russia's takeover of the Crimea Peninsula and aggression blamed on pro-Russian factions in some eastern regions of the country that have ethnic Russian populations. Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security service, said Friday that no military operations were planned for the election. But alternative secure voting places would be arranged for some people in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions because of the separatist threat. Showdown . The Ukraine crisis has created a showdown between Putin and Western allies over what U.S. President Barack Obama calls Russia's illegal expansionist moves. Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently said disruption of the Ukraine vote by Russia would bring further sanctions targeting specific sectors of the Russian economy. So far, U.S. and European sanctions have targeted individuals and some banks and other entities. On Friday, Putin reiterated Russia's assertion that according to Ukraine's Constitution, the ousted Yanukovych remains the nation's legitimate president. He also questioned whether the election should be held now, given the current violence in eastern Ukraine. According to Russian state media, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Meshkov said Friday that Russia would decide whether or not to recognize the Ukraine vote only after it takes place. ""Let's wait for the elections first. Naturally, when Russia considers this issue (on legitimacy) we will take into account all factors,"" the official ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Meshkov as saying. The latest violence extended increased unrest in recent weeks in eastern Ukraine, which includes areas with ethnic Russian populations loyal to Moscow instead of the Ukrainian government in Kiev. After the Russian takeover of Crimea, Putin massed an estimated 40,000 or more Russian troops near the border with eastern Ukraine. This week, he said those forces were starting to withdraw, as called for by Obama and NATO allies. On Friday, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said the United States has seen small numbers of Russian troops withdrawing back to their garrisons or home bases from the border region. Kirby described those numbers as ""not great"" and said tens of thousands of Russian troops remained near the border. According to Kirby, it was ""too soon for us to say this is the wholesale withdrawal"" of troops that Putin indicated he had ordered. Donetsk violence . The Donetsk violence on Friday involved an effort by pro-Ukrainian militias to take down a pro-Russian checkpoint near Karlivka, according to Right Sector Chief of Staff Andriy Denysenko. The pro-Ukrainian forces came under attack by separatists and were forced back to a Ukrainian military checkpoint, Denysenko told CNN. Four of the pro-Ukrainian militia fighters got trapped in a cafe and were presumed by pro-Ukrainian militias to be dead or captured, he said. According to the Donetsk state administration, the battle left one person dead and nine injured. Disturbances also were reported Friday in Slovyansk, a stronghold for the separatists in the eastern Donetsk region. A CNN team in Slovyansk heard about 10 explosions in what sounded like the outskirts of the town, following shelling overnight around a militant barricade. The self-declared mayor of Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, has said that anyone who tries to vote in the presidential election will be arrested. On Friday, Ponomaryov showed a CNN crew missile launchers known as man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) that he said were obtained on the black market in the 1990s and now could be used on Ukrainian military aircraft in the event of civil war. Matt Schroeder from the Small Arms Survey, an independent expert who saw CNN images of the weapons, confirmed they were for use with surface-to-air, shoulder-launched, heat-seeking missiles. However, Schroeder said he was unable to tell from the images what model they were and if they were functional. In another indication of the heightened tensions, Ukraine's Border Service said Friday that its guards had thwarted another attempt by armed men to illegally bring weapons and ammunition over the border from Russia. Attacks on media . Meanwhile, the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe released a report Friday that detailed a deterioration of media freedom in Ukraine. Dunja Mijatovic, the group's representative on media freedom, said she was ""alarmed by the rapidly deteriorating conditions and climate for the media."" The 14-page report on events from last November 28 until Friday cited more than 300 cases of attacks on journalists including killings, kidnappings, detentions and acts of intimidation, as well as cases of equipment being confiscated and destroyed. ""The on-going attacks on journalists are nothing short of gross and severe violations of fundamental human rights,"" Mijatovic said. ""Journalists are deliberately targeted for doing their job, trying to tell the outside world of the events that is taking place in Ukraine."" In his remarks to business leaders, Putin said he was ""optimistic"" the crisis in Ukraine could be resolved. He defended Moscow's recent disputed annexation of Crimea, saying its action had prevented violence there and ensured the ""possibility of free will for the people"" who chose to join Russia in a democratic referendum. The United States and its European allies have refused to recognize the Crimea annexation, saying it remains an unresolved issue in their demand for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity to be respected. Unpaid gas bill . Putin also said Russia had tried to help Ukraine in its difficult economic situation, but that Kiev must pay off the hefty arrears owed to Russian energy giant Gazprom for natural gas. ""The risks today of delivery of the gas supply are not our fault but quite honestly, everyone understands that this is because of the transit country Ukraine, which has abused its situation,"" he said. ""We provided Ukraine with 10 billion cubic meters of gas for free,"" he added. ""This is not sensible; this is really stupid, and we must have limits."" Asked if he could work with a Ukrainian government led by Petro Poroshenko, a billionaire businessman and seasoned politician seen as a front-runner in Sunday's election, Putin joked that he could -- if Ukraine pays the $3.5 billion it owes. Kiev and European Union leaders have urged Russia not to use the energy supply as a weapon. Putin also called for dialogue between Russia and the United States over the crisis in Ukraine, suggesting Washington had not taken Russia's interests into account until now. He was critical of the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West, warning that they would have a ""boomerang"" effect and hurt the United States and the European Union. The Russian President also suggested the U.S. sanctions could be a ploy to give American companies a competitive advantage in Europe.

"(CNN) -- If Mars has any exhibitionist tendencies, this should be a good month -- one packed with star power -- for the red planet. On Tuesday night, Mars, Earth and the sun were positioned along a nearly straight line, called the date of opposition because Mars and the sun are on opposite sides of the sky, according to NASA. If the orbits of Mars and Earth were perfectly circular, April 8 would also have been when the two planets were nearest each other. But because they're slightly egg-shaped, the date of closest approach does not occur until Monday. That night, the two planets will be a mere 57 million miles (92 million kilometers) apart. Also on tap for the celestial show is a total lunar eclipse, when the moon will turn as red as Mars itself. ""Mars rises in the east at sunset and soars almost overhead at midnight, shining burnt-orange almost 10 times brighter than a 1st-magnitude star,"" NASA says. But no need to set your alarms or to buy a telescope: Mars, in all its glory, is easy to see on any clear night in April with the naked eye. If you miss this event, you can witness the next ""opposition of Mars"" in 26 months. A recent view of the planet taken from space has proved far different, but no less tantalizing. Was it a Martian playing flashlight tag with the Curiosity rover? The faraway glare from an extraterrestrial's TV? Or maybe someone warming up over a fire on the Red Planet's surface? Probably not. Still, the latest snapshot from the Curiosity is pretty cool. It shows the stark Martian landscape with a light shining in front of a mountain chain. While enjoying the shot, the Curiosity Rover's official Twitter feed says it's more illusion than evidence of life: ""Ooh. Shiny. Bright spot in this pic is likely a glinting rock or cosmic-ray hit."" A few pictures -- shot April 2 and 3 through the rover's ""right-eye"" camera -- show the bright spots, while those shot within a second through the ""left-eye"" camera don't, said Guy Webster, a spokesman with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Hence, it's unlikely any being -- from whatever world -- caused them. Each time, ""the sun was in the same direction as the bright spot -- west-northwest from the rover -- and relatively low in the sky,"" said Webster, who said one could surmise that the sun was reflecting off the rock the same way in each shot. Or perhaps, he added, the spots could be a function of light affecting the camera itself. Either way, the pictures add to the vast photo album that Curiosity has created since setting off from Earth in November 2011 and landing -- some 8-1/2 months later and 99 million miles away -- on Mars. The 1-ton, SUV-sized vehicle is carrying 17 cameras and a number of scientific instruments, making it far from your average shutterbug. That's not the only event of significance to Earthlings who like to look up. CNN's Sheila Steffen and Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.","On Monday, the moon will turn as red as Mars itself .

"(CNN) -- Virginia Tech plans to consider all its options after it reviews a jury verdict that found it was negligent in a 2007 shooting rampage that left 33 people dead, including the gunman, a university spokesman said. The move follows Wednesday's verdict by a seven-member jury in Christiansburg, Virginia, that awarded $4 million each to two victims' families who sued the state for wrongful death in the shooting massacre. ""We are disappointed with today's decision and stand by our long-held position that the administration and law enforcement at Virginia Tech did their absolute best with the information available on April 16, 2007,"" Mark Owczarski, a university spokesman, said in a statement. ""We will discuss this matter with the attorney general, carefully review the case and explore all of the options available."" The jury found Virginia Tech failed to notify students early enough following the discovery of two shooting victims at West Ambler Johnston dormitory. The two students were the first victims of Seung-Hui Cho, who went on to kill 30 more people at Norris Hall -- home to the Engineering Science and Mechanics Department -- after chaining the doors closed. He also wounded 17 people before killing himself. The families of Erin Peterson and Julia Pryde, who were killed in Norris Hall, argued that had officials notified students, faculty and staff earlier of the shooting at the dormitory, lives might have been spared. Peterson died while in her French class; Pryde was shot while attending an advanced hydrology class. The Peterson and Pryde families did not accept a portion of an $11 million settlement between the state and the families of victims, opting instead to sue for wrongful death. ""It certainly was the end of a long process for us where we just said we wanted to get a little bit more truth. A little bit of accountability and we weren't just going to go away, and so we came here and this is what happened,"" Harry Pryde, Julia's father, told CNN affiliate WDBJ of Roanoke, Virginia. While the jury awards the families $4 million each, an attorney for the state has asked the judge to reduce the verdict to $100,000 per claim. State law limits awards to $100,000, though the judge approved a request by an attorney for the family to file a motion on the matter. The university does not believe the evidence presented during the trial showed there was an increased danger on campus, Owczarski, the university spokesman, said. Virginia Tech President Charles W. Steger, in a letter to the school's faculty, staff and students, said the killings ""were an unprecedented act of violence that no one could have foreseen."" The evidence presented during the trial ""established that it was the unanimous decision of three law enforcement agencies that the mass shooting was simply not foreseeable. Only with hindsight can one conclude that Cho's unprecedented acts were foreseeable,"" Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, a spokesman for the state attorney general, said in a statement following the verdict. Authorities initially believed the shooting at the dormitory was a case of domestic violence, a jealous boyfriend who shot the couple. While police were questioning a possible suspect, Cho opened fire at Norris Hall. The Department of Education found, in a 2010 report, that Virginia Tech did not notify students in a ""timely manner"" -- as dictated by what is known as the Clery Act -- after the shooting at the dormitory. The government also fined Virginia Tech for failing to follow internal school policies. According to the Department of Education report, police went to the dormitory at 7:24 a.m. after being notified about the shooting of two students. The university notified students, faculty and staff of the shooting in an e-mail at 9:26 a.m., the report said. It was about 15 minutes after the e-mail that Cho began his rampage, it said. Since the massacre, the school has beefed up its communications, using methods that include e-mail notices; telephone, cellular phone and text messages; classroom electronic message signs; posters; university website notices; campus loudspeakers and desktop alerts. In addition, the safety phones in the campus and local community are connected to the campus 911 emergency operator and residential buildings are accessible only through a key card. Door alarms sound, alerting police, if an exterior door is propped open in a residence hall.

"(CNN) -- Two college football players were arraigned in Massachusetts Superior Court on Wednesday for allegedly kicking and beating a homeless man until a passerby shielded the victim's body with her own, the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office said. Craig ""C.J."" Parsons, 22, and Anthony Varrichione, 23, were charged with aggravated assault and battery and aggravated assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Additionally, Parsons was charged with ""with violating the state's witness intimidation statute in an attempt to stymie the investigation,"" the District Attorney's Office said. Parsons is a senior football player at Boston College, and Varrichione, a former quarterback, recently graduated from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Both men pleaded not guilty in court Wednesday, a spokesman for the District Attorney's Office said. The incident occurred early January 26. The unidentified victim, 50, is a homeless man who was panhandling in Boston's Allston neighborhood. After an argument between him and the other two men, Parsons and Varrichione allegedly punched and kicked him. Prosecutors say Parsons also knocked the man's head into the sidewalk, rendering him unconscious. A female passerby saw part of the attack and ran to the victim's aid, using her body to shield him from the attackers. Other witnesses called 911, and the victim was taken to a nearby hospital. The man is expected to survive but has no memory of the attack, prosecutors say. Wednesday's arraignment comes after a three-month grand jury investigation that called 17 civilian witnesses to testify after a Boston police investigation was unable to identify the attackers. The investigation also found evidence that Parsons told someone to not identify him to investigators, leading to his witness intimidation charge. Parsons, who was set to graduate this spring, has been given an immediate suspension from Boston College ""in light of the disturbing nature of the allegations,"" said Jack Dunn, director of communications for the college. Michael Doolin, Parsons' attorney, told CNN that his client is ""a wonderful young man from a fine family."" ""I think that after a full and thorough investigation, that when we get this case to trial, that C.J. will be exonerated,"" he said. Varrichione's attorney, Tim Flaherty, said his client ""has had no previous difficulties in life,"" adding that Varrichione is hopeful that a full examination of all of the circumstances will exonerate him. Parsons and Varrichione were released on their own recognizance Wednesday, their attorneys said. Varrichione is listed as having a height of 6 feet, 4 inches and a weight of 225 pounds on the Marist College Athletics website. Parsons played tight end for the Boston College Eagles and is listed as being 6 feet, 6 inches tall and weighing 253 pounds on the Boston College Athletics website.

"(CNN) -- A man in India set himself on fire and then grabbed a politician during a live television debate this week in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, authorities said. Police said Durgesh Kumar Singh came out of the crowd Monday as India's state-owned television station Doordarshan recorded the debate at a park in Sultanpur, about 100 miles from the city of Lucknow. He set himself ablaze with gasoline and threw himself on Kamruzzama Fauji, a local politician from the Bahujan Samaj Party. Singh died in the hospital a day later. Fauji is in critical condition with burns over 80% of his body, police said. ""People were just too shocked to know what was happening,"" local photographer Pankaj Kumar Gupta told reporters. The superintendent of police for Sultanpur district, Pratibha Ambedkar, was preparing for a visit by state Chief Minister, Akhilesh Yadav when she got a call from her office about a man threatening to set himself on fire. ""By the time we reached there, he had already set himself ablaze,"" Ambedkar told CNN. Singh, 35, had previously worked at a flour mill in Amethi, a neighboring district. His motives have yet to be confirmed, but authorities said the man's family claims he was being treated for mental instability. ""Before the incident, the man also made a call to the local police control room complaining of harassment from his family,"" said Ambedkar. India is in the midst of its nationwide parliamentary elections, which conclude May 12.

"(CNN) -- On a cold, rainy night in late November, Douglas Wright sat amid brambles and thick East Texas underbrush, watching over the body of his 28-year-old son, Alfred, who had disappeared almost three weeks earlier. ""His spirits got to me: 'Daddy, I knew you would find me,'"" Wright says, recalling the relief that had washed over him. Sabine County sheriff's deputies had searched for Alfred Wright but didn't find him, and volunteer searchers later found his body, his family says. A medical examiner says the death was accidental, but the family rejects that notion, citing what a different pathologist says appears to be ""severe trauma"" to his body. The Texas Rangers and FBI are investigating. Alfred Wright was last seen around dusk on November 7. The physical therapist was on his way to treat a patient. He had been having trouble with his pickup and pulled into CL&M Grocer, one of the few stores along an isolated stretch of Route 87. He called his wife, Lauren, and gave her directions to the store. Because their two young sons were home sick, she called his parents, who immediately left on the hourlong drive. What happened next changed everything. ""The last time I called him, I just heard heavy breathing. He was in distress of some sort. He was not responding to anything I was saying,"" Lauren Wright says. Around 6 p.m., Alfred Wright disappeared from where he was last seen alive. When his parents arrived about 20 minutes later, his truck was in the parking lot, but he was nowhere to be seen. His father asked the store clerk what happened. He says she told him that she was out having a smoke when Wright ""all of a sudden put his cell phone in his sock and took off like the truck was going to blow up."" The clerk did not want to be interviewed on camera but did tell CNN that Wright ""left on his own free will,"" a phrase she repeated several times. The next day, his personal effects, including his watch and ID, turned up on a nearby ranch. Deputies searched the property with cadaver dogs. His family says it was told by the deputies that Wright's scent had ""disappeared"" at a nearby creek. Four days after Wright vanished, Sabine County Sheriff Thomas Maddox called off the search, telling the family, ""Your son's just a missing person. My guys are tired. We've exhausted our resources and funds. We're done,"" family lawyer Ryan MacLeod says. Family members say the sheriff told them that ""there was no foul play"" and that Wright's disappearance was probably ""drug-related,"" most likely related to methamphetamine. The sheriff's daughter and Wright apparently knew each other through their health care jobs, which made the sheriff's actions even more surprising to the Wrights, who were left to search for their son on their own. He had been missing for 19 days when, during Thanksgiving week, dozens of volunteers did their own search in the cold and rain. Wright's body was found nearly three weeks after his truck broke down, in an area of the ranch supposedly already searched by deputies. 'He was neatly laid' Walking to the spot, Douglas Wright describes the position in which his son lay: ""His head was in this area, and his feet was back here. He was just, if I might say, he was neatly laid. He was neatly laid."" Alfred Wright was wearing only boxer shorts, tennis shoes and a single sock, inside of which was his cell phone, just as the clerk had described. The second sock was under the body. ""I was told by the mortician at the autopsy that when they pulled off his left sock, his keys was under his left foot in his shoe,"" his father says. ""What was weird about his sock,"" says his father, is that it ""was clean, and his sock was pulled up with his phone stuck in it as if he was in a Sunday school class. Neat. His tennis shoes was very clean."" And not just the position of the body seemed strange. ""This is the first thing I noticed -- how smooth his forearms and his back was. No scratches at all,"" his father says. After just one day, he and the other volunteers were caked in mud and their clothing torn from brambles, he says. Alfred Wright was missing an ear, two front teeth, and his throat appeared to be cut. The medical examiner attributed the trauma to ""animal and insect activity."" What's more, in an echo of the sheriff's prediction, the coroner's toxicology report described Wright's body as filled with drugs -- cocaine, meth and amphetamines. His death was ruled ""accidental"" due to a ""combined drug intoxication."" His family doesn't believe it. Family members say they never saw him do drugs, nor had his personality changed to suggest he was using drugs. They say he was the fun-loving, hardworking father he had always been. They want to know if the drugs entered his body while he was missing. Suspicious of the investigation, the family hired their own pathologist, who ultimately did a separate autopsy and, contrary to the medical examiner, found what appears to be ""severe trauma to the neck and head."" A month after Wright's body was found, Maddox handed the investigation over to the Texas Rangers. They have called the death ""questionable"" and say the autopsy is just one part of an active investigation. The week CNN was in Sabine County, the Texas Rangers announced they had called in the FBI to assist. After Alfred Wright's death, wife Lauren went through bank records. She found three charges her husband made at local hotels when she and the children were away the month before he died. Texas Rangers are pulling video from one of the hotels to review it for possible evidence. Feds, family seek answers a year after teen's mysterious death .

"(CNN) -- A 39-year-old woman in Utah told police she either strangled or suffocated at least six babies immediately after she gave birth to them over a period of years, a document shows. Megan Hunstman appeared in court Monday where she is facing six counts of murder, according to Chief Michael Smith with the Pleasant Grove, Utah, police department. She's being held on $6 million bail. Over the weekend, authorities found the remains of seven infants at a home where Huntsman used to live. ""During her interview, Ms. Huntsman admitted that between 1996 and 2006, she gave birth to at least seven babies at the Pleasant Grove residence, and that all of the babies, but one, were born alive, and that she either strangled or suffocated the babies immediately after they were born,"" read a probable cause statement. ""According to Ms. Huntsman, she then concealed their bodies inside boxes and placed them inside the garage of the Pleasant Grove residence,"" the statement added. Police first responded to the home on Saturday. Huntsman's estranged husband, Darren West, contacted authorities after finding a baby wrapped in a plastic bag in the garage, the statement said. A search warrant was obtained and officers discovered six more bodies at the home. ""Each baby was found wrapped in either a towel or a shirt, placed inside of a plastic bag, and each was contained in a separate cardboard box,"" the statement read. It was not immediately clear whether Huntsman has retained counsel. According to Smith, West does not face charges. ""He has been cooperative,"" the police chief said. ""But we continue to investigate what type of knowledge or role he may have played, if any."" The Utah case sounds eerily familiar to a case in France a few years ago. Prosecutors there charged a woman with murder in 2010 after she admitted giving birth to and smothering eight babies over a 17-year period. The case came to light when a couple gardening in their backyard in the northern town of Villers-au-Tertre found two babies' bodies in sealed plastic bags and called police. Police spoke to Dominique Cottrez and her husband, who had previously lived in the home, and Cottrez admitted immediately that she was the mother of the two babies, prosecutor Eric Vaillant told reporters. She then told police about six others concealed in their garage. It is unclear from subsequent media reports about the Cottrez case whether it has been resolved.

"(CNN) -- Arthur was downgraded from a hurricane to a post-tropical storm on Saturday, as its sustained winds dropped to 85 mph, according to CNN meteorologists. Tropical storm warnings previously issued for Nantucket and Cape Cod have been discontinued. The first named storm of this hurricane season caused street flooding and knocked out power along the North Carolina coast. The area appears to have been spared from large-scale damage. The center of Arthur is forecast to pass over or near western Nova Scotia on Saturday while also bringing heavy rain to New England, CNN meteorologists said.

"Melbourne, Australia (CNN) -- Li Na outperformed Maria Sharapova at the Australian Open, but can China's biggest sporting star now do the almost unthinkable and surpass the Russian as the world's richest female athlete? Maybe -- and that's according to the man who represents both players. ""She could,"" Max Eisenbud, the duo's agent, told CNN after Li won her second grand slam title. ""It'll be interesting to see how that shakes up. A lot depends on how she plays and how Maria plays. But they're both in the same stratosphere, for sure."" Sharapova has been No. 1 in the earnings department as named by Forbes magazine every year since 2005, the season after she opened her grand slam account as a 17-year-old at Wimbledon. Li's triumph in Melbourne last weekend, though, will increase her chances of landing more sponsors in her homeland, the world's most populous country and its largest second economy. CNN estimated China's economy to be worth $10 trillion in 2014. Li finished at No. 3 in the 2013 Forbes list, one spot behind the dominant force in women's tennis, Serena Williams. She was No. 2 the year before. ""Maybe we can do another one or two deals,"" said Eisenbud. ""But we can't add five more deals for her."" Li was certainly a popular women's champion at the season's first major, being the crowd favorite throughout the fortnight. Her on-court interviews have always evoked laughter and the soon-to-be 32-year-old especially sparkled during the trophy presentation after downing Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova. There she thanked Eisenbud for making her ""rich"" and had more words for her husband Jiang Shan. ""You are so lucky to find me!"" she quipped. As of Monday, the speech had been viewed on YouTube nearly one million times. Her light-hearted personality, along with the tennis success, makes for a desirable combination for sponsors, according to Michael Stirling, founder of Britain-based Global Sponsors. ""Sponsors will find her progress in winning the Australian Open, together with her public persona of being fun and honest in her interviews, refreshing and engaging,"" he told CNN. ""Winning the Australian Open will make many more people globally aware of who she is as a player and this will attract brands."" But overtaking the longer established Sharapova -- upset by Cibulkova in the fourth round in Melbourne -- might prove difficult. ""The Sharapova brand has been in existence for many years and the essence of it was caught when she won Wimbledon,"" Stirling said. ""She has built her brand over many years, and provided Sharapova continues to be a top-10 player her brand value remains enduring and more relevant as a global brand. ""Whereas, Li's brand is a new regional phenomena, which carries significant value in the emerging markets of the Far East and will ripple into other regions of the globe."" Along with a host of established backers, Sharapova launched her own candy line, ""Sugarpova,"" two years ago and pulled in $29 million in endorsements and prize money last year, Forbes said, as the Russian once again held top position. After Li became the first Asian player to win a grand slam singles crown at the 2011 French Open, her value soared. Companies including Samsung, Nike and Mercedes Benz helped Li achieve $18.2 million in last year's list, Forbes said. Li counts a following of roughly 22 million on Chinese social media and her popularity is set to increase, according to Renjie Liu, a journalist with Chinese website SINA. ""The people who have the most social media followers in China are movie stars,"" he told CNN. ""They have something like 80 million. It's a big difference. But Li Na is right behind them. She's the top of the sports industry. ""She was quite popular already but after the win it's getting more and more. People realize she's not only a tennis player. She's kind of a national hero. She also represents Chinese women in a very good way so I believe her image is getting bigger not only in China but in front of the world."" And to think Li almost didn't play at the Australian Open. She considered retiring -- for a second time -- after an early exit at the French Open last May. Criticism from the Chinese media in the wake of that second-round defeat to American Bethanie Mattek-Sands left her reeling. ""They gave me a very tough time when I played the French Open and it continued to Wimbledon,"" Li told reporters. Li decided to continue and, with famed coach Carlos Rodriguez by her side -- he formerly guided seven-time grand slam winner Justine Henin -- strung together a solid second half of 2013. She reached the quarterfinals or better at every tournament after Roland Garros, highlighted by an appearance in the final of the year-end championships in Turkey. Li was the first to admit she got somewhat lucky in Melbourne, only fending off a match point in the third round when Lucie Safarova missed a makeable backhand down the line. The unexpected exits of Williams and two-time defending champion Victoria Azarenka meant Li didn't have to face anyone in the top 20. But she was unfortunate in last year's final against Azarenka, falling twice, injuring her ankle and head. The previous year she was beaten by Kim Clijsters, taking the former world No. 1 to three sets in her maiden grand slam final. More than dollars and cents, Eisenbud said this title was about Li proving she wasn't a one-slam wonder. ""I don't think this win is about the money,"" he said. ""I think it's a big statement. A lot of girls have won a grand slam but winning that second one puts you in a different category. ""She's a wealthy girl and will get more deals and that will come, but this win is more about legacy. ""One of the things we're really looking to do is to solidify her desire to have a tennis academy in China. So that'll be a really big focus, having some sort of partnership with a property company there.""","Li Na is one of the world's richest female athletes following success in recent years .

"(CNN) -- Russia opposes U.S. and European leaders' calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to resign, Interfax news agency reported Friday, saying that the leader should get more time to implement reforms. The move by Russia counters efforts by leaders ratcheting up international pressure against a regime criticized for its brutal crackdown against protesters calling for reforms and the ouster of al-Assad. ""We do not support such calls, and we think that President al-Assad should be given time today to implement all of the declared reform processes,"" a Russian Foreign Ministry official told the nation's Interfax news agency. The White House has previously said al-Assad had ""lost legitimacy,"" but resisted calling explicitly for his ouster until now. ""The future of Syria must be determined by its people, but President Bashar al-Assad is standing in their way,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement Thursday. ""We have consistently said that President Assad must lead a democratic transition or get out of the way. He has not led. For the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside."" The leaders of Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European Union echoed Obama's demand. The refusal by Russia to go along with U.S. and European leaders' calls is a departure from its stance in June when Prime Minister Vladimir Putin criticized the crackdown and called for pressure to be put on Syria to stop the violence. The Russian Foreign Ministry official, according to Interfax, said ""what counts most is al-Assad's statement yesterday that they are stopping all military operations."" During a telephone call with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, al-Assad said military operations in the country had been halted. Opposition protesters have refuted the claim, saying security forces have been arresting people and setting up checkpoints in and around cities. Russia also was encouraged with Syria's agreement to accept a humanitarian mission from the United Nations into the country to look for the effects of the months-long military crackdown on anti-government protesters, the official told Interfax. The humanitarian mission will travel to Syria on Saturday, and spend three to four days in the country, the United Nations said. Syrian Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari said al-Assad has issued 20 reforms since March that will lead toward democracy by the end of the year. ""This is, after all, what the peaceful demonstrators are calling for,"" he said . The Foreign Ministry official, according to Interfax, said al-Assad has taken steps to implement a number of reforms, such as the adoption of ""appropriate laws,"" the announced amnesty for political prisoners and readiness to hold general elections before the end of the year. Senior U.S. officials, diplomats and members of the Syrian opposition have argued that the next several weeks will be critical in terms of isolating al-Assad, strengthening sanctions against the regime and bolstering domestic opponents of the regime. The campaign against Syria's leadership, involving intense diplomatic outreach by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Obama, has been based on the one the United States used in Libya, where the U.S. administration built international consensus for the NATO mission to protect civilians. U.S. and European authorities remain opposed to any military intervention in Syria -- a sharp contrast to their response to regime-sponsored violence in Libya. ""I don't think anybody believes that is the desired course of action on Syria,"" one senior administration official said Thursday. Russia also has threatened to veto any U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Syria that opens the door to international intervention. Several Middle Eastern countries with traditionally close ties to Syria, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, have been consulted in recent weeks, according to senior administration officials. Meanwhile, a U.N. fact-finding mission announced Thursday it has found Syria guilty of multiple human rights violations, and indicated it may be time for the International Criminal Court to become involved. ""The mission found a pattern of human rights violations that constitutes widespread or systematic attacks against the civilian population, which may amount to crimes against humanity,"" the report said. France and other European countries are pushing for a Security Council resolution condemning the al-Assad regime, but they are still facing stiff resistance from Russia, China, Brazil, India and South Africa. The United States is pushing for special session on Syria at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Switzerland as early as next week.

"(CNN) -- Fifty years ago, a Frenchman and a German -- seared by the devastation of World War II -- forged an enterprise with the less than exciting name of the European Coal and Steel Community. West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and French Prime Minister Robert Schuman's modest beginning to European integration -- to tie together the coal and steel industries of France, West Germany and the Benelux countries -- would over the next half-century become a behemoth of 27 states, many of which didn't even exist in 1952. That European Union vision is now at an historic crossroads and could over the next months begin to shred. A dysfunctional legacy . The European club has both expanded in number and deepened in purpose. Beginning as a common market with expensive subsidies to farmers, it evolved into a community with coordinated foreign and trade policies, open borders among many members, a common social policy and a powerful European Court. Vast sums have been spent on infrastructure for poorer members. Most notably, the Maastricht Treaty, named after the Dutch town where it was signed in 1992, began the process of monetary union and -- supposedly -- economic convergence among member states. The first part happened; the second did not. A ""stability and growth pact"" was meant to harmonize interest rates, inflation and government deficits. But there were no enforcement mechanisms beyond sharp words and a slap on the wrist. France and Germany were among the first states to breach the commandment that deficits shalt not exceed 3% of GDP. Some critics argue that Europe is like the python that swallowed a goat. In 1990, there were 12 members of the EU; now, the 27 members span an area from Lisbon to Tallinn, from Cyprus to Stockholm. How Europe grapples with the dysfunctional legacy of both an unbalanced deepening and headlong expansion will decide whether the eurozone recovers or withers. The state of things now . The first hurdle to overcome is the Greek election. Should a working majority emerge under the leadership of the New Democracy Party, Greece may follow through with the next tranche of public spending cuts demanded by its ""troika"" of creditors: the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. The new Greek government will expect in return help from the troika rather than the same diet of austerity, arguing that the Greek people have to be offered some incentive to endure more sacrifice. But if political paralysis begun by May's vote continues, the uncertainty over whether Greece can remain in the eurozone will intensify. Even if a weak pro-bailout government is formed, Greece is already behind on its obligations to privatize state industries and improve tax receipts. For Greeks, tax evasion is a national sport; the government is owed nearly 50 billion euros in back taxes. Greek media suggest depositors have withdrawn up to 5 billion euros from local banks in the past two weeks. Uncertainty in Greece would in turn intensify the pressure on Spain and Italy, amid doubts about the whole eurozone enterprise. The combined economies of Ireland, Portugal and Greece -- the three countries that have been bailed out -- are smaller than that of Spain, which has quickly been dubbed ""too big to bail, too big to fail."" The European Union's willingness to help bail out Spain's massively indebted banking system to the tune of 100 billion euros ($125 billion) produced a ""relief rally"" on the bond and stock markets, but the relief scarcely lasted 24 hours. By the end of last week, the yield on Spain's 10-year bond hovered around 7%, the financial equivalent of being admitted to intensive care with a raging fever. The new Spanish government has resisted a full bailout, arguing that it has undertaken drastic economic reform and that government finances (not too awful) should not be confused with the banks' (dreadful). But the influential ratings agencies do see a link; Moody's has cut Spanish sovereign debt to just a notch above junk status, on a par with Azerbaijan. Unemployment is at record highs, especially among the young; house prices are collapsing. The Italians are also getting fed up with austerity, as Prime Minister Mario Monti acknowledged in a recent interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. He has joined the ""growth club"" with new French President Francois Hollande but has precious little room for maneuver, as the price on Italian debt has also risen. The IMF has praised Monti's efforts to sort out Italy's public finances but says deregulation and labor reform require further effort, just as the Italian economy is forecast to shrink 2% this year. From outside the eurozone, its partners look on with horror. The governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, said last month, ""Our biggest trading partner is tearing itself apart with no obvious solution."" What will be Europe's future? Going forward (and, admittedly, simplifying the scenarios), Europe is looking at three paths, according to political and financial analysts. The first and most traumatic is a disorderly collapse of the eurozone, starting in Greece but spreading to Spain and Italy. This scenario begins with anything less than a clear victory for the ""bailout"" parties in Greece, followed by the virtual implosion of the Greek state, whose coffers are nearly empty. The current economy minister says Greece has enough money to survive until July 15. In this scenario, Germany opts to puts fiscal rectitude ahead of its pan-European principles. Many Germans are already thinking this way. Deputy Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter told the BBC on Thursday that debt was a ""national responsibility."" ""I don't see any strategies where we socialize and redistribute the bad political decisions made by some who are over-indebted,"" he said. Germany has ruled out the introduction of eurobonds, which would essentially dilute its credit rating to the advantage of the peripheral economies. And German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that Germany's role in saving the eurozone is ""not unlimited."" ""We must all resist the temptation to finance growth again through new debt,"" she said. Taken to its logical conclusion, this first scenario could reduce the eurozone to a Franco-German core, with the smaller Benelux states attached. The consequences for the European economy would be calamitous, with governments defaulting on debt, capital controls imposed to prevent money from fleeing states on the verge of falling out of the eurozone and the likelihood of prolonged recession across Europe. In addition, the very process of reverting to national currencies (for which there is no road map) would throw up a multitude of legal and contractual nightmares. And politically, the idea of European union would be set back decades. The second course is that Europe muddles through while continuing to grope toward banking and fiscal integration. A compromise between Greece and the troika (not so unlikely, given that 80% of Greeks want to stay in the eurozone) would bring the country back from the edge of the abyss, though any meaningful recovery would be years away. The new European Stability Mechanism, due to come into effect next month as a permanent rescue fund, would recapitalize banks and help cool yields on vulnerable sovereign debt (Spain, Italy, Cyprus). Its war chest of 500 billion euros would be bolstered as required. (French officials are already suggesting that it be allowed to borrow from the European Central Bank.) Merkel would make token concessions to the ""growth agenda"" at the European summit in Brussels at the end of this month. Moves toward a banking union that would insure deposits, progress toward common tax policies, the decline of government debt and the emergence of the eurozone from recession would ease the pressure on governments struggling to find common ground. Merkel has acknowledged that this is a ""Herculean task,"" but it is in Germany's interest. Very nearly 60% of German exports stay inside Europe, and are competitive because they are priced in euros rather than deutsche marks. A collapse of the eurozone would savage the German economy. Merkel has signaled her support for tougher European supervision of the eurozone banking industry, in an implicit criticism of the way the authorities in Madrid underestimated the plight of Spanish banks. That seems an important precondition for further German support. Next year, Merkel faces an electorate already impatient with German largesse for little return. Until then, the argument goes, she can't afford to be seen to be generous. The third course would see a daring leap toward much closer integration: the ""economic convergence"" promised by Maastricht but never realized as governments allowed debt to rise and failed to liberalize their labor markets, supervise their banks or harmonize their tax systems. This is the mantra of Hollande, who wants measures to stimulate growth and ""imagination and creativity"" to deepen financial union, such as a joint fund to pay down debt. There seems little prospect that such sudden and dramatic initiatives will gain the support of a European public no longer convinced of the benefits of deeper integration, nor of a German state unwilling to allow co-signers on its checking account. Last week, Adenauer's grandson, Stephan Werhahn, said that his grandfather and Schuman ""wanted to build a strong and independent Europe, but now with the bailout funds and billions in rescues, we are demolishing it."" And he announced that he was leaving the party his grandfather had founded. The counter-argument of history is that the European banking crisis of 1931 ""contributed directly to the breakdown of democracy"" in Germany and across the continent, according to economists Niall Ferguson and Nouriel Roubini. Writing in the Financial Times recently, they concluded, ""The EU was created to avoid repeating the disasters of the 1930s. It is time Europe's leaders -- and especially Germany's -- understood how perilously close they are to doing just that.""","A dysfunctional legacy hampers current eurozone woes .

"(CNN) -- There was no pretense with David Letterman, and the response to his retirement has been just as honest. From President Obama to Dave's late-night peers, the veteran host of CBS' ""The Late Show"" has left his fans devastated with his announcement that he plans to hang it up in 2015. ""There are more than 10 reasons #DavidLetterman will be missed,"" the President posted to his Twitter account Thursday, with a photo of himself laughing it up with Letterman. ""David @Letterman is the best there is and ever was,"" ABC's Jimmy Kimmel chimed in Thursday. ""There's a tear under the CBS eye!"" said Arsenio Hall. ""David Letterman - Simply The Best!!!"" ""It's been 31 incredible years,"" said Ellen DeGeneres. ""Television won't be the same without you, Dave."" On Thursday's ""Late Show,"" Letterman said that while everything's been great, he's simply ready to retire. ""We don't have the timing of this precisely down,"" he said, ""but sometime in the near distant future, 2015, for the love of God, Paul and I will be wrapping things up and taking a hike."" David Letterman announces retirement . On his own late night show, NBC's Seth Meyers took a moment to recognize Letterman's influence. ""I grew up on David Letterman,"" Meyers, who just recently took over ""Late Night,"" told his audience. ""I was a little too young for (Johnny) Carson, I discovered Carson in later years online and watching videos that way. But Letterman for me was a show that you had a cool uncle, or one of your friends had a cool older brother that told you to watch. ... If it wasn't for David Letterman, this show wouldn't exist. If it wasn't for David Letterman, I wouldn't be here."" It's David Letterman's comedy world . Since Letterman's announcement, the conversation has inevitably turned to who could replace him -- although Esquire magazine believes that may be impossible. But CBS, presumably, will have to find someone to take on Jimmy Fallon and NBC's ""Tonight Show"" at 11:30. One obvious option would be to bump CBS' ""Late Late Show"" host Craig Ferguson up an hour, and mimic what NBC's done with the handoff of ""The Tonight Show."" There's also interesting competition for Letterman's seat on cable, where Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart have proven that they can draw a young audience and hold it. And now that Chelsea Handler is reportedly ending her E! late night talk show, ""Chelsea Lately"" -- hers is another name floating amid the speculation, along with those of other funny ladies like Ellen DeGeneres and Amy Poehler. But the predictions haven't been limited to talk show hosts, as the Twitterverse has erupted with suggestions that comics like Louis C.K. or Jerry Seinfeld take over. The name of a different kind of entertainer showed up in The New York Times' take: Neil Patrick Harris. And there might be room for the Ghost of Jack Paar -- a combustible conversationalist who brings the ""talk"" back to ""talk show"" -- or some YouTube talent out there, yet unknown, who gets a ""Rocky""-like chance at stardom. Lena Dunham, for one, is rooting for CBS to be the network that breaks up late night's boys club. ""I love Letterman but I am really excited about what this could mean for the diversification of late night,"" she tweeted, although she added that she'll ""obvi ... miss Letterman and his gorgeous tooth scenario/general brilliance.""

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. authorities announced new sanctions and criminal charges against a Chinese businessman who the U.S. says supplied the Iranian military with parts for ballistic missiles and other equipment. Prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office on Tuesday unsealed an indictment against Li Fangwei, also known as Karl Lee, accusing him, his companies and associates of money laundering and wire fraud, and of being part of a ring that evades sanctions to supply Iran's missile program. The Treasury, Commerce and State departments also announced new sanctions against Li and his companies. The State Department also announced a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest, and the U.S. has sought an Interpol red notice to seek his detention. Chinese authorities aren't expected to turn over Li to face charges, so the actions by the U.S. for now are only likely to make it difficult for him to travel outside China without fear of arrest. Li was indicted in 2009 by a grand jury on charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney, accusing him of using false names to process payments of sales to Iran through New York banks. Treasury officials also sanctioned him in 2006, seeking to cut him off from the U.S. financial system. Despite those sanctions, U.S. authorities say, Li's companies and their Iranian partners used new shell companies and other ways to continue to do business. He told Reuters in 2013 that his companies did only legitimate business with Iran, selling steel and other metals.","U.S. authorities announce new sanctions and criminal charges .

"(CNN) -- The Metro-North train that derailed Sunday, killing four people and injuring dozens of others, was equipped with safety mechanisms that would have sounded a warning before slowing down the train if the engineer became unresponsive, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman said Thursday. It's unclear, however, if those mechanisms were activated before the crash. The train engineer, William Rockefeller Jr., apparently ""was nodding off and caught himself too late"" before the accident, a union representative told CNN. His lawyer said the engineer's schedule had been switched in November from a mid-afternoon start time to a predawn start. At the time of the accident, the train was in ""push mode,"" meaning that the locomotive was in the rear of the train pushing it along the tracks, with Rockefeller in a cabin at the front operating it remotely. His cabin was equipped with a ""dead man pedal"" that required constant downward pressure with the foot to keep the train moving, MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan told CNN on Thursday. ""Should you lose consciousness or die and the foot is taken off, a whistle sounds and the train begins to slow immediately to a stop,"" Donovan said. ""It's a pressure you have to keep -- your foot actively engaged."" The newer model locomotive in the rear, however, was equipped with a more sophisticated ""alerter"" system which sounds a tone every 25 seconds, requiring the engineer to respond with a tap within 15 seconds while the train is in steady motion, Donovan said. ""This train had one system in front and one in rear -- with the same goal of ensuring that engineers are alert,"" said Donovan. But it is unclear if the ""dead man pedal"" mechanism was activated when Rockefeller allegedly nodded off at the controls. ""That is unknown,"" Donovan said. The National Transportation Safety Board has not commented on those mechanisms but has said the signal and braking systems appeared to be functioning. Two passengers on the Metro-North train, meanwhile, have filed a notice of claim against the commuter railroad, an initial step in a lawsuit seeking damages in connection with the accident. Four people died and 67 others were injured in the crash Sunday. Denise Williams is a retired Army colonel and dentist who was on her way to a convention at the time of the crash. She suffered spine, collarbone and rib fractures after she was pinned inside an overturned car for about an hour, according to her attorney Michael Lamonsoff. Negligence accusations . Lamonsoff said Wednesday the suit on behalf of Williams will accuse the commuter railroad of negligence. He said state law requires that negligence claims be filed against the railroad, not the train engineer who allegedly nodded off as the train was speeding into a sharp curve. MTA doesn't comment on pending litigation, according to spokeswoman Marjorie Anders. ""While she was ... pinned down, there was a guy that, a chef who has cerebral palsy, he sat with her and prayed with her because they didn't know if she would live or die, and she was praying to live,"" Lamonsoff said. ""Bottom line is the guy was going 82 mph in a 30 mph zone,"" Lamonsoff said. He added that the railroad has been slow to implement what is known as positive train control technology, which combines GPS, wireless radio and computers to monitor trains and stop them from colliding or derailing. In 2008, Congress ordered rail lines to adopt the technology by December 2015. ""We have GPS on cars, they should have GPS on the trains,"" he said. ""They have been stonewalling. They have until 2015, they have asked for extensions, they haven't started any upgrades."" Edward Russell was among those seriously injured in Sunday's crash. He will ask for punitive damages in the amount of $10 million, according to his notice of claim, which cites ""loss of earnings,"" ""inability to work"" and ""post traumatic stress"" as part of the damage sustained from his injuries. Russell's attorney, Robert Vilensky, expressed concerns about the infamous sharp curve in the tracks at Spuyten Duyvil. ""It seems like there have been several incidents in the area, I believe there were four in the past year. There's something that seems to be amiss ... whether they're not doing enough to ensure safety, (or) not paying enough attention to it,"" Vilensky said. Russell's claim accuses the MTA, Metro-North, the City and State of New York of being negligent ""in allowing the train to run at a place where there is a sharp curve in the terrain, (and) in failing to change the design of the tracks when another incident had occurred similar to the incident herein several months previously,"" among other things. MTA spokesman Salvatore Arena said the agency began work to install positive train control technology on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad in 2009, budgeting nearly $600 million for its installation, including $428 million last month for a system integrator. The cost for full implementation is estimated at $900 million. Arena said implementing it by the 2015 deadline will be difficult because much of the technology is still under development, untested and unproven on commuter railroads the size of Metro-North and LIRR. National Transportation Safety Board member Earl Weener said Tuesday it's possible that positive train control could have prevented a derailment involving a high-speed train, like the one involved in the Metro-North accident. Train union kicked out of crash investigation . The NTSB, meanwhile, has booted the rail union from its investigation into the derailment for violating confidentiality rules. The agency made the announcement late Tuesday night, hours after a union representative told CNN the train engineer apparently ""was nodding off and caught himself too late"" before the accident. In its announcement, the NTSB specifically cited those comments as the violation. Anthony Bottalico, the union representative, told CNN that Rockefeller recognizes his responsibility in the incident. ""I think most people are leaning towards human error,"" Bottalico said. Rockefeller's lawyer, Jeffrey Chartier, characterized what happened as ""highway hypnosis."" He said his client had had a full night's sleep before the crash and had no disciplinary record. On Wednesday, Chartier said his client never blamed the accident on faulty brakes, disputing earlier statements attributed to Rockefeller. Living through a train wreck .

Wayne Gary Masciarella, who is in custody, is charged with first-degree murder, and more charges are expected, Sheriff David Andrews told CNN. Masciarella apparently had gone out Tuesday night with Cash and her boyfriend, William Austin Johnson. The couple lived together, and when all three returned to the apartment early Wednesday, there was an altercation. Cash and Johnson were both stabbed, officials say. Johnson managed to get away from the apartment and gave a statement to investigators at a local hospital. Based on his statement, the sheriff said authorities arrested Masciarella within a couple of hours. Johnson remains hospitalized at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

"(CNN) -- Having terrorized English Premier League defenses all season, Uruguay's Luis Suarez turned his considerable striking talents to putting the frighteners on the England national team. And then some -- England were left reeling as the Liverpool forward's two goals earned Uruguay a vital 2-1 win in their World Cup Group D match in Sao Paulo Thursday . This barely four weeks are undergoing knee surgery to all but end England's interest in the 2014 World Cup and keep alive Uruguay's hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages. It was a performance that Roy Hodgson's team were all too familiar with -- the Uruguayan scored 31 goals for Liverpool in the league last season -- but could do nothing about. Equally it was a performance that must have been particularly tough on the five Liverpool players that started for England and especially for Steven Gerrard, who played an unfortunate part in Suarez's winning goal. Suarez had watched from the bench as Uruguay stumbled to defeat in their opening match against Costa Rica but he didn't take long to make an impact against England. Plenty of questions had been asked if Suarez could be 100% fit after missing a month's football, but if anything he appeared refreshed by his layoff. A busy first half was capped with a goal six minutes before the break when Suarez headed past goalkeeper Joe Hart after Edinson Cavani's diagonal chip had split England's defense. Suarez almost beat the Manchester City keeper again four minutes into the second half with a low inswinging corner. Hart managed to bat the ball away off the line this time but should have been picking the ball out of the net three minutes later when Cavani was played through. A goal seemed certain but the Paris St Germain striker conspired to squirt his shot wide. The miss seemed to rejuvenate England who began to play their way back into the game. Having headed against the bar in the opening half, Wayne Rooney, restored to his more favored central attacking role, forced a fine smothering save from Fernando Muslera in the 53rd minute and Daniel Sturridge also went close shortly after. Rooney's first goal in three World Cup finals put England back on level terms in the 75th minute. When the Manchester United striker side-footed home from Glen Johnson's cross England looked to have seized the initiative at a crucial time. But it didn't last long as Suarez pounced on an error by his Liverpool teammate Gerrard in the 84th minute. A speculative punt up field glanced off the head of the England captain and into the path of Suarez who steadied himself before lashing in his 41st international goal. It was a goal that typified Suarez's predatory instincts, both in the finish but also the way he had almost expected that the ball would fall into his path. Defeat leaves England pointless from their two opening matches. At the very least they will need to beat Costa Rica in their final match and hope other results go their way. ""We're devastated,"" England manager Roy Hodgson told ITV Sport after the match. ""I thought we had done enough to get a draw. Suarez's first goal was exceptional. The second he was bit fortunate to get himself free. We know what he can do."" Lucky or not, Suarez's winner puts Uruguay level on three points with Costa Rica and Italy who play in Recife on Friday.

"(CNN) -- He was hoping to triumph in front of his home fans, but it all went horribly wrong for cycling star Mark Cavendish -- with members of the Royal family watching. With the 101st Tour de France starting in Britain this year, all eyes were on Cavendish in Saturday's opening stage in Yorkshire. But the 29-year-old, one of the most successful sprinters in the race's history, dislocated his right shoulder and suffered ligament damage after colliding with rival Simon Gerrans during the finish. Germany's Marcel Kittel won the 190.5-kilometer (118-mile) stage to take an early advantage in the month-long race, which is commencing in the UK for the first time since 2007. Cavendish, from the Isle of Man, admitted his maneuver was reckless and took full responsibility for the clash. ""It was my fault, I'll apologize to Simon. I tried to find a gap that was not there, I wanted to win,"" Cavendish was quoted as saying by the UK's Press Association. ""I felt really strong and was in a great position to contest the sprint thanks to the unbelievable efforts of my team. Sorry to all the fans that came out to support -- it was truly incredible."" An MRI scan later is expected to reveal the full extent of Cavendish's injuries and confirm whether he is fit enough to continue. ""Mark had lived this sprint in his mind at least 100 times before,"" his Omega Pharma-Quick Step team boss Patrick Lefevere said. ""He was so focused, he wanted to win so badly. It was so important for him."" Yorkshire police estimated that as many as one million people lined the streets along the route, the vast majority no doubt hoping to witness a Cavendish victory, while the race was seen off by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. William and Kate, along with Prince Harry, later had a clear view of Cavendish's crash. His spill in the final 200 meters enabled Giant-Shimano rider Kittel to race clear and take the yellow jersey ahead of Slovakia's Peter Sagan and Lithuania's Ramunas Navardauskas. ""I hope he gets well soon,"" Kittel said of Cavendish, who has won 25 Tour stages in his career and claimed the green jersey for top sprinter in 2011. ""I don't know how badly he is injured. I hope he is all right. I'm looking forward to hopefully seeing him tomorrow in the race again. I wish him all the best."" The 26-year old, who also won last year's opening stage, paid tribute to the enthusiastic Yorkshire crowd as well as his teammates who set him up for the win. ""It was so unbelievably loud. The fans were cheering,"" he said. ""My boys did an amazing job, they rode so strong. I felt so motivated and I had good legs today. I'm so, so happy that this worked."" Defending champion Chris Froome, who leads Cavendish's former outfit Team Sky, finished sixth after avoiding the fallout of the crash. ""It's unreal, absolutely unreal,"" Froome said. ""The crowds out there were just incredible. ""Just a shame for Cav in the final there. It would've been nice to have a British victory today, but that's racing. ""Today was more about staying out of trouble, getting to the finish without any big issues."" Sunday's stage two will take the riders 201 kilometers (124 miles) from York to Sheffield, featuring roughly 3,000 meters of climbing.","Mark Cavendish dislocates his shoulder in Tour de France crash .

"London (CNN) -- Rebekah Brooks was once feted as one of the rising stars of the British media: She was the youngest person ever to edit a national British newspaper, and made a stellar rise through the ranks of Rupert Murdoch's media empire. She held the top job at News International, News Corp.'s British subsidiary, for two years after editing the country's best-selling daily tabloid, The Sun, and its best-selling Sunday tabloid, News of the World. But following allegations of illegal eavesdropping by News of the World journalists when she was editor, she saw her fortunes fade. Brooks resigned as chief executive of News International in July 2011 amid public outrage over hacking allegations and was summoned by police the following week. It was the first time she was arrested and questioned by police investigating phone hacking claims. Brooks kept a low profile after her resignation but was ridiculed in the British press when it was revealed that London's Metropolitan Police had lent her a retired police horse in 2008. As politicians became engulfed in the scandal, with allegations that ministers acted improperly in their dealings with News Corp., Prime Minister David Cameron -- a family friend of Brooks' husband -- admitted he had ridden the horse. When Brooks appeared before the Leveson Inquiry into press standards in 2012, she was grilled about her relationship with Britain's current and former prime ministers and detailed her frequent contacts with Cameron in the run-up to the 2010 election. In October 2013, Brooks was among seven people to go on trial for phone hacking. She denied all charges of conspiracy ""to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority,"" conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and conspiracy to obstruct a police investigation. On June 23, jurors found her not guilty of the charges, the UK's Press Association news agency reported. Before she took the stand in February 2014, the defense reminded the jury that Brooks was not on trial ""because she was the editor of a tabloid newspaper"" or for working for media baron Rupert Murdoch or for ""any political views she may hold"" or for ""the support newspapers she edited gave to one party or another."" Rather, the defense said, her trial hinged on whether she knew about and endorsed a ""practice of phone hacking at News of the World during her editorship""; whether she had encouraged a Sun reporter to pay a public official; and whether she had asked her husband, Charlie Brooks, and her personal assistant, Cheryl Carter, to ""get rid of things ... to cover up the practice of phone hacking or of paying public officials."" Brooks denied any wrongdoing. Asked by her lawyer if she was ever asked to sanction the practice of phone hacking while editor of News of the World, from 2000 to 2003, Brooks said: ""No."" During the trial, prosecutors alleged that Brooks had a clandestine affair with co-accused Andy Coulson from 1998-2004, which they argued showed the pair's level of trust. Giving evidence, Brooks described her personal life as a ""car crash for many years,"" the Guardian newspaper reported. She denied there had been a long-standing affair but acknowledged there had been periods of physical intimacy. Coulson edited the News of the World from 2003 until 2007, having served as Brooks' deputy at the tabloid for three years before that. He went on to be David Cameron's director of communications, resigning from his role with the prime minister in 2011, when police launched a second investigation into newspaper eavesdropping. When Coulson gave evidence in April - with his wife watching from the public gallery - he said the affair ""shouldn't have happened,"" the BBC and Guardian newspaper reported. But he denied that it meant he and Brooks had shared sensitive stories, the outlets said. The revelations were seized on by UK media covering the case, with one newspaper - The Independent -- headlining its story ""The affair they didn't expose,"" a reference to the tabloid newspapers' history of revealing other people's cheating. In June, Coulson was found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones. Hard lessons learned . Brought up in Cheshire, northern England, in the 1970s, Brooks is said to have decided on a career in journalism at the age of 14, beginning with a job as a ""tea girl"" at her local paper. In her late teens, she moved to Paris, where she is reported to have worked at architectural magazine L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui and studied at the Sorbonne. On her return to the UK, she worked in regional papers before making the move to Sunday tabloid News of the World in the late 1980s. Starting out as a secretary, Rebekah Wade -- her maiden name -- swiftly made her way up the editorial food chain, becoming deputy editor by the age of 27. She tells of how, at a corporate golf day shortly after she was appointed, one senior executive ordered her to sew the buttons back on his shirt. Her response is not known. Sexism in the workplace aside, Brooks' rise through the ranks continued. She was named deputy editor of the hugely popular Sun newspaper, the News of the World's sister title, in 1998. In 2000, she returned to the News of the World, this time in the top job, becoming the youngest-ever editor of a national British paper. While editor of the weekly, Brooks argued for the creation of a U.S.-style ""Sarah's Law,"" which would allow parents with young children to know about anyone convicted of child sex crimes living close to their homes. As part of the controversial campaign, which was inspired by the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne in July 2000, Brooks took the decision to name and shame offenders in the pages of her paper. The lists sparked witch-hunts and riots, as communities across Britain tried to hound pedophiles out of their neighborhoods. It was condemned by police, but Brooks remains unrepentant. In a 2009 speech, she admitted the campaign was ""a blunt and contentious way of informing the public ... hard lessons were learned but I don't regret the campaign for one minute."" She married soap star Ross Kemp, famous for his hard-man role as Grant Mitchell in long-running British TV show ""Eastenders."" In 2003, she was promoted again, becoming editor of the Sun, a post she held until 2009 when she was handpicked for the role of News International chief executive by Rupert Murdoch. In the same year Brooks and Kemp divorced and she remarried horse trainer Charlie Brooks. The couple's wedding party was attended by a host of big names, including the Murdoch clan (Rupert, James and Elisabeth), the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and future-Prime Minister David Cameron. Brooks and Murdoch had been close for many years: before her downfall Rupert Murdoch was said to have treated Brooks like a daughter. Whether the relationship has survived the scandal remains unclear.","NEW: Rebekah Brooks has been cleared of all charges against her at a phone-hacking trial .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The Libyan government in Tripoli estimates the grinding conflict that has been tearing the country apart for the past five months has cost the national economy some $50 billion. ""The cost is colossal,"" said Abdulhafid Zlitni, planning and finance minister for the Tripoli government. In an interview with CNN, Zlitni said the suspension of oil and gas exports had accounted for a huge chunk of the losses. ""The income foregone because of the stoppage of the export of oil is something like $20 billion,"" he said. This has brought an end to what had been a surge in prosperity for the North African country. Last year, Libya's economy was booming, with gross domestic product surging 10.3%, according to the International Monetary Fund. And in a report published February 15, the IMF's executive board concluded, ""The outlook for Libya's economy remains favorable."" But two days later, protests against Col. Moammar Gadhafi's 41-year rule erupted in the eastern city of Benghazi. As protests spread to other cities and towns across the country, the Gadhafi regime embarked on a bloody crackdown. Today, the country is split into territories controlled by loyalists and opposition rebels. A NATO military alliance is now into the fourth month of a campaign of airstrikes against government targets after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilian lives. The civil war has all but shattered ambitious plans to upgrade transport, housing and infrastructure in a country that had long been isolated from the international community. ""The main objective was to create capacity for the economy to stand on its feet away from oil and gas production,"" recalled Zlitni somewhat wistfully, as he described a five-year, $170 billion plan to modernize Libya. In March, the legions of foreign workers who had been contracted to build railroads, airports, apartment buildings and telecommunications networks began fleeing the rapidly escalating conflict by the tens of thousands. The exodus included large numbers of engineers, construction and oil workers from China, Turkey, Egypt, and the Philippines, who crossed the western border with Tunisia on foot. At the time, many of them told CNN stories of being robbed at gunpoint by Libyan security forces who took their cell phones, laptops and money. Left behind were mammoth construction projects that still dot the Libyan landscape. Many of these unfinished structures were apartment buildings being built for an estimated 50,000 families across the country. ""So many infrastructure projects ... were carried out by international companies,"" Zlitni said. ""Yet the stoppage of these projects could be felt in the economy. Particularly in the building sectors, the transportation sectors, the communication sectors."" More ominous for the Libyan economy has been the Tripoli government's growing isolation. NATO is enforcing a no-fly zone over Gadhafi-controlled territory as well as a virtual blockade of Libyan ports. The sanctions have created huge fuel shortages. Long lines of cars now wait at service stations. This week, the government in Tripoli announced it was intervening to control rising prices of basic commodities. ""In a crisis situation like this traders tend to profit more than they should, and therefore there is an intervention by the ministry of foreign trade for the prices of consumer goods,"" Zlitni said. The minister said the government was fixing prices of rice, flour, meat, eggs, sugar and edible oils to prevent hardship among lower-income families. ""We subsidize, basically,"" Zlitni said, ""with large amount of funds."" But Zlitni warned it was growing increasingly difficult for the embattled Gadhafi regime to pay for these types of subsidies. He pointed out that foreign countries have frozen tens of billions of dollars in Libyan government assets that had been carefully invested overseas in ""treasury bills, bonds, stocks and investments in various international markets, whether in Europe, the USA or Asia."" Zlitni compared Libya's dwindling government coffers to the edible meat on an animal. ""This shouldn't last long, otherwise we'll be eating the fat and meat. And we'll very soon arrive to the bones."" Throughout the hour-long interview, Zlitni made no mention of the fact that last month, the U.N. Security Council added his name to a list of high-ranking officials in the Gadhafi regime now facing an international travel ban. He did, however, declare Tripoli's opposition to proposals to hand over frozen Libyan government bank accounts to the opposition Transitional National Council headquartered in Benghazi. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced Washington formally recognized the council in Benghazi as Libya's legitimate governing authority. State department officials said this could potentially give Benghazi access to some $30 billion in frozen Libyan funds in the United States. ""This is against international rules. The international monetary system cannot withstand action in this manner,"" Zlitni said. ""If you are freezing through United Nations Security Council action funds for any country, then you can't confiscate it. There are legal obligations of the banks."" But when asked what recourse Tripoli would have if the U.S. government went through with its threat, Zlitni conceded there are few options. ""We should file litigation against them,"" he said.","""The cost is colossal,"" says Abdulhafid Zlitni, Libya's planning and finance minister .

"London (CNN) -- A 51-year-old man was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of intimidation of a witness in connection with an investigation into alleged phone hacking, London's Metropolitan Police said. He is also suspected of encouraging or assisting an offense, the police statement said. The man, who was not identified, was previously arrested on April 5 last year on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and unlawful interception of voice mail messages, the statement said. He has been released on bail. His arrest comes a day after that of Rebekah Brooks -- the former editor of the British tabloid News of the World and a confidante of its owner, Rupert Murdoch -- and five others on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Dozens of current and former employees of News International, the News Corp. subsidiary that publishes Murdoch's British newspapers, have been arrested on suspicion of bribing police or illegally intercepting voice mail or e-mail. No one has been charged. Accusations of widespread phone hacking on behalf of News of the World prompted its publisher to fold the publication last July. Brooks had previously been arrested in connection with phone hacking and police bribery. She was released on bail Tuesday after a day of questioning. The widening scandal has spawned three police investigations, two parliamentary committee investigations and an independent inquiry. Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Wednesday released a copy of a letter sent to it by James Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's son, who stepped down as chief executive of News International last month. James Murdoch said he could have asked more questions of senior officers at the firm, but rejected the suggestion that his resignation as chief executive reflected unrevealed knowledge relating to the scandal. ""I take my share of responsibility for not uncovering wrongdoing earlier,"" he wrote in the letter, dated March 12. ""However, I have not misled Parliament. I did not know about, nor did I try to hide, wrongdoing. I do not believe the evidence before you supports any other conclusion."" Murdoch said he had resigned in order to focus on developing News Corp.'s television businesses from the company's New York base. He has twice been called to testify before the committee in London about what he may have known of misconduct by staff at News International. Police investigating phone hacking say that about 5,800 people, including celebrities, crime victims, politicians and members of the British royal family, may have been targets of the practice by journalists. The hacking involved illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a personal identification number to access messages remotely. CNN's Richard Greene and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","A 51-year-old man is arrested on suspicion of intimidation of a witness, London police say .

"(CNN) -- There's nothing broken about being the fourth-most valuable company in the world, which is exactly what Microsoft is today. That same company, however, is valued at half what it was 10 years ago. It's not exactly thriving, either. Regardless if the glass is actually half empty or half full, consumer confidence in Microsoft is at a low. It is ignored or considered uncool by younger generations. Older generations are often required to use the company's software at work, but turn to Apple or Google devices in their free time. A month from now Microsoft will release Windows 8, a bold new operating system that seeks to bring touchscreen interfaces to desktop computing. It's the company's biggest product since Windows XP and yet the only thing the tech world has seemingly talked about over the last 12 months is what the iPhone 5 might look like. In that sense, Microsoft is broken. Sure, the company that Bill Gates built has had a few bona fide hits over the last decade, most notably from its gaming division: Xbox Live, which is sort of the nighttime Facebook for gamers, and Kinect, a hands-free game controller that caught fire for a year before fizzling somewhat. Bing, Microsoft's search engine, also is gaining traction in the market. But when it comes to mobile devices -- the biggest area of growth in consumer tech -- Microsoft still lags behind its rivals. How Apple's story is like 'Breaking Bad' So how can the company right the ship? According to some of its biggest critics, here are eight ways Microsoft can reinvent itself, return to relevancy and dominate the tech world once more instead of just following it. 1. Make fewer things extremely well. Microsoft has been accused of many things. Being too focused isn't one of them. ""They spread themselves too thin across too many product lines,"" says blogger Mary Jo Foley, a longtime observer of the company. ""They let broken products hang on for far too long,"" resulting in mediocre stuff that few people care about, she says. The good news: ""They're getting better at this,"" Foley says. 2. Move all their software to the Web. Microsoft is in a bit of a pickle. Consumers want to manage, view and manipulate their files from any device connected to the Internet (aka cloud computing). But Microsoft still makes most of its money from locally installed software, so it has been very reluctant to offer its wares online at a discount (if not for free like Google). Keep it up, though, and Microsoft will be a goner, says Joe Wilcox, editor of Beta News. ""On phones and tablets, Microsoft's presence is insignificant or too low to quantify. If the so-called post-PC era is about cloud-connected devices, Microsoft operating systems have no meaningful presence."" 3. De-emphasize the desktop. Microsoft has made a fortune selling desktop operating systems. While the desktop will certainly remain an important computing tool for the foreseeable future, it's no longer the primary tool. It's really just one of many available portals now. ""Who cares about a desktop?"" says my twenty-something brother-in-law. So long as a device is portable and lets him access the Internet, he doesn't care who makes it or what it looks like. So, in addition to moving all its products online, Microsoft should make those products available on any device, independent of the operating system, like Google does across Macintosh, Android, iPhones, Windows and even their new Google Chrome OS. In other words, it's all about the apps, regardless of how you access them. 4. Lead instead of follow. Whether fair or not, the perception exists that Microsoft largely follows what Apple and Google do rather than making its own waves (think delayed Zunes, Bings, Windows Phones, Surface tablets and retail stores). Heck, even Kinect was a reaction to Nintendo's Wii. To really excite consumers, it would do well to try zigging while others zag. ""Even if Microsoft fails to be as successful during the cloud-connected device era as the PC, its efforts (good or bad) should pressure Apple, Amazon, Google and others do to better,"" says Wilcox. 5. Serve only one master. The last thing Microsoft needs right now is to further reduce its already dwindling market share. Yet that's what the upcoming Windows 8 might do as it tries to serve both touch users and traditional keyboard and mouse ones. ""I fear Windows 8 is too focused on touch-friendly computing,"" says Tim Stevens, editor of Engadget. Foley agrees: ""I think Microsoft may be too far ahead of its users in its decision to de-emphasize the old and familiar Windows for a touch-centric one."" It's OK to offer both touch and traditional software, as Apple does. But it works best when you keep 'em separated (as Apple has done with Mac and iOS). 6. Be ""cool"" in its own way. As dominant as Microsoft was in the '90s, its products were never a status symbol like Apple's are today. That's a fact. At the same time, there are varying degrees of coolness; you don't have to be hip so long as you're confident and unapologetic about who you are. The sooner Microsoft realizes this, the better it will embrace its potential as a respected and reliable maker of computing again, rather than just something the establishment makes you use. What's more, Microsoft is now in the ironic position to brand itself as David to Apple's Goliath, the counterculture to Apple's mainstream. You know, turn the tables on the very upstart company that used to ""think different,"" but that now suffers from groupthink because its products are so widely used. 7. Don't do what IBM did. IBM used to be a household name in computing. After it stopped selling to consumers, it found success in targeting big business. But it is less relevant and smaller than it used to be. This will also remain true of Microsoft if it fails to embrace the cloud-connected devices that are replacing PCs. ""If Microsoft retreats to the enterprise and cedes the consumer market, like IBM, they'll lose their relevance,"" says Wilcox. 8. Be the developer's favorite again. Microsoft Windows didn't become a juggernaut by being a better experience than Macintosh. It became a juggernaut because it offered third-party developers more money, which in turn resulted in more programs, which in turn brought in more users. Not any more. ""The roles are reversed,"" says Wilcox. ""Where are the most exciting apps today? Not Windows. They are on Android and iOS."" If Microsoft wants to dominate once more, it will need to entice more developer support to ensnare more consumers. As for the company's chances, insider opinion ranges from OK to great. ""I think it has enough cash reserves to swing and miss a few times and still come out looking good,"" says Stevens. ""But I don't know if it will ever regain the top spot."" Foley shares his skepticism. ""I'm not sure they can ever be a consumer powerhouse,"" she says. ""Do three rights undo 10 years of wrongs? I don't know."" Wilcox, on the other hand, says he's seen other decimated companies regain their luster -- most notably Microsoft's longtime rival from Cupertino. ""If Apple can rise from near ruin in 15 years to become the world's largest company, surely Microsoft can.""","Microsoft's products are ignored or considered uncool by younger generations .

"(CNN) -- Thus far, NBC's late-night transition has been like butter. Jay Leno hosted his final episode of ""The Tonight Show"" on February 6 with massive celebrity support and even bigger ratings, and Jimmy Fallon took over on February 17 with the same level of excitement. But there's still one more piece of the Peacock's puzzle left to be added: Seth Meyers. At 12:35 a.m., the 40-year-old ""Saturday Night Live"" star will step behind the desk of ""Late Night"" and occupy a chair once filled by David Letterman, Conan O'Brien and, directly before him, his pal and fellow ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Fallon. With that kind of history, it goes without saying that there's pressure on Meyers not to screw up. Yet instead of marching in and tearing down ""Late Night's"" past, Meyers is planning to keep tradition intact while playing to his strengths. After 12 years on ""SNL,"" nine of which he served as head writer, Meyers is by all accounts more of a cerebral comedian than a performer. His colleagues give him credit for being the guy who'd rather set up the joke than steal the thunder, and some of his best work doesn't even include his face. See: Tina Fey as Sarah Palin: . Or Louis C.K. as Abraham Lincoln: . Or Amy Poehler killing it as a rapping Sarah Palin: . ""There's the class clown, and then there's the guy who sits in the back and says an aside about the class clown,"" Meyers said to The Wall Street Journal. ""That's me."" On the surface, that tendency to hang back would make Meyers appear to be an ill fit for ""Late Night,"" whose most recent host liked to slow jam the news, throw down in lip-sync battles and play beer hockey with guests. But as Fallon takes his eager energy over to ""The Tonight Show,"" there's more room in NBC's line-up for a more even, straight player -- someone who can tackle politics with the same ease as a Kardashian scandal. Meyers' first week of guests sets the stage for that kind of high-low mix: the first two guests on ""Late Night"" will be his old ""SNL"" co-star Amy Poehler, along with Vice President Joe Biden. ""We want it to be not just creative people in the showbiz world, but we'd also love to have authors, politicians, athletes,"" Meyers told reporters of his ideal guest list earlier this year. ""We are open to everything and hopefully can get interesting people on not only that the audience knows, but the audience can get to know."" Tweaking the type of guests ""Late Night"" viewers are used to seeing is the kind of risk that Meyers' ""Late Night"" producer and champion, Lorne Michaels, wants to see. ""In my opinion, he has until next fall to find that show,"" Michaels told New York Magazine. ""He should be taking chances. It can't spring full-blown from Zeus' thigh on February 24. I don't want Seth to put pressure on himself or think that his show has to have that level of polish. It should find its way. I do think he's way better prepared than Conan (O'Brien) was when he began."" Better prepared or not, there is one O'Brien trick that Meyers would like to incorporate. The format of ""Late Night"" will still be pretty standard, with an opening monologue and an interview or two. But Meyers also wants to use his writing staff as a sort of communal sidekick that would allow him to do the kind of interviews with fictional characters fans remember from ""SNL."" (So does this mean that we'll get to see Bill Hader's now-retired character Stefon at some point? ""Bill and I spoke during my last 'SNL,' and we do think he'll turn up eventually,"" Meyers has said.) ""I want it to look and have the framework of the classic late-night model, but this is real estate where you can try out everything,"" he told USA Today. ""I liked how Conan used his writing staff to play different people. We have a writing staff that has a lot of that range. They're great writers, but they're also really funny performers. We are going to try to use them as often as we can. In a weird way, the closest thing I'll have to a sidekick is my writing staff and the people they'll play."" As the hour approaches, Meyers, a known ""worrier"" with a tendency to decimate office furniture when he's nervous, seems to have a zen approach to his late-night debut. He's fully expecting to have low moments -- ""There's no way I'm not going to spin out,"" as he told The Hollywood Reporter -- but he's also taking this one episode at a time. "" 'Weekend Update' was a big thing to step into. 'SNL' was a big thing to step into,"" he told the Boston Globe. ""I think I've found over the years, if you get too hung up on the legacy of what you are taking over, it gets in the way a little bit of doing the work. So our goal is just to try to do the funniest thing we can every night and get better each time out.""","Seth Meyers will take over ""Late Night"" on February 24 .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Casualties mounted in Yemen Wednesday as world powers grappled with the political crisis paralyzing the impoverished and restive nation. The United Nations Security Council met for the first time Tuesday to tackle the hostilities in Yemen, in which anti-government protesters have clashed with security forces and pro-government demonstrators over the last two months. The U.N. efforts to deal with the Yemen crisis coincide with the ongoing initiative of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, or the GCC -- a coalition of Gulf Arab nations working to ease tensions between Yemen's government of Ali Abdullah Saleh and a restive opposition. The Security Council was unable to agree on a joint statement, and it's unclear whether any diplomatic reaction will be forthcoming on Yemen in the coming days. But one diplomat said it was the first time Yemen was on the agenda of the Security Council and it was ""perhaps too early for everyone to agree."" This world and regional diplomatic focus on Yemen comes as protesters took to the streets in the capital of Sanaa and other cities across the country, which the United Nations calls the poorest country in the region. One death was reported in Hodeida on Wednesday, when security forces in civilian clothing shot and killed a protester, sources said. Security officials in the Aden province city of Khormaksar said a soldier was killed and three others were wounded. Security forces said they saw at least six local residents armed with machine guns attack security forces. Eyewitnesses said troops had been antagonizing Khormaksar by setting up checkpoints, questioning people on the streets, and using threatening language. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Sanaa over the killings of protesters on Tuesday, when at least five people died. In Taiz, eyewitnesses said four protesters were injured when they attacked government convoys with rocks and gunfire. One of the convoys was from the Taiz governor's office. Yemen's instability is rooted in grass-roots political and economic grievances, but the country's instability concerns the West. That's because the al Qaeda terror network has a strong presence there. The Saleh government has been a U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic militants there. At the United Nations, the Security Council was briefed by a senior U.N. political affairs officer and a U.N. envoy to Yemen. Germany and Lebanon introduced a statement on Yemen which would have called for restraint in violence, among other themes. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said the United States and other nations discussed calling for restraint and an end to the violence in Yemen with a credible transition to democracy. The United States and France wanted to also express support for the efforts of the GCC. Germany voiced concern about the deteriorating situation in Yemen at the meeting and called on all parties to have a dialogue in Yemen. It also expressed support for the GCC. But one U.N. diplomat said concerns from China and Russia blocked a unified response to the developments, and some countries wanted more time to consult their governments. Another U.N. agency, the United Nations Children's Fund, said Wednesday that too many children are exposed to danger in Yemen. UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado told journalists in Geneva, Switzerland, that at least 26 children have been killed, mainly by live bullets or ammunition over the last two months. Another 15 children were killed in a large explosion at the Abyan ammunition factory in March ""when civilians reportedly looted the facility, which had been previously taken over by militants."" Mercado said more than 80 other children had been injured in beatings, rock-throwings or shootings. She said nearly 800 others had been exposed to tear gas in Yemen. CNN's Richard Roth at the United Nations, CNN's Christine Theodorou in Abu Dhabi and journalist Hakim Almasmari in Sanaa contributed to this report.","NEW: Unrest reported in Taiz, Sanaa and Hodeida .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The good news for Chris Brown is a luxury rehab center in Malibu is better than the men's central jail in Los Angeles. The bad news is a Los Angeles judge ordered Brown to stay another two months in the anger management and drug rehab program he entered three months ago. Although Brown's probation officer reported the singer ""continues to make great improvement"" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, the judge decided during a hearing Friday he can't go free yet. He has to be tried on an assault charge in Washington first. Only then will the judge decide whether Brown must go to jail for violating his probation in the Rihanna assault because of the assault arrest a few blocks from the White House in October. Brown seemed disappointed by the decision, although his three months of therapy may have helped him handle the stress in court. He closed his eyes and appeared to meditate for about five minutes while his lawyer, Mark Geragos, met privately with the judge and prosecutor. ""Mr. Brown is able to use behavioral strategies to manage acting out on impulses,"" the director of his rehab program wrote in a letter to the court. ""Mr. Brown is teaming relaxation exercises that will reduce consequent impulsive behaviors."" He also looks physically better during his latest court appearance, something noted by his lawyer. The rehab director's letter revealed that Brown had been suffering from a ""severe case of insomnia,"" which has been ""stabilized."" Brown, 24, told his probation officer that he ""appreciates what he has learned in the rehabilitation facility, as it has allowed him to change his life for the better,"" the officer wrote in his report. Brown ""looks forward to staying out of trouble,"" the probation report said. He reports to a highway cleanup labor crew in Los Angeles three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements, the report said. At that rate, Brown could complete the labor in mid-October and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year. His legal troubles began five years ago when he beat then-girlfriend Rihanna in a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community labor. The judge has revoked Brown's probation twice in the last year, most recently because of his arrest on a sidewalk near the White House after allegedly punching a man. Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for ""throwing a rock through his mother's car window"" after a family session at the center, a probation report said. Brown was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment, the report said. ""Mr. Brown preceded to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it shattered,"" according to letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. His mother sat next to Brown at Friday's hearing. Los Angeles County Judge James Brandlin will revisit Brown's rehab versus jail status on April 23, a week after the assault trial in Washington.","Chris Brown must stay in rehab until his Washington assault charge is tried .

"(CNN) -- Microsoft's Windows Phone 8.1 just got an upgrade with the voice of Cortana. If you're an avid video game player, you're probably thrilled. Cortana is a character in the popular Halo video games series. She's sexy and smart and tries to save the world. So how does Microsoft's Cortana compare with Apple's Siri? We'll find out. But here's the interesting question: Why are Cortana, Siri, and basically all ""virtual assistants"" female? Sure, there's the biological factor, i.e., our time in the womb predisposes us to prefer the sound of a woman's voice. And then -- as CNN's Brandon Griggs pointed out -- there's also tradition. Ever since World War II, automated navigation systems in airplanes have used female voices, which stand out in the male-dominated cockpit. And let's not forget straight-up sexism, whose logic goes something like this: ""Well, if it's an assistant, it has to be female, right?"" All of these reasons certainly contribute to the choice of a female voice for the increasingly popular ""virtual assistant"" feature on smartphones, which understands commands and in some cases talks back. But let's not discount the influence of a certain AMC television program that has a hypnotic hold on Western culture right now: ""Mad Men."" Have you noticed that trendy clothes are tight-fitting right now? And ties are skinny? And fedoras are everywhere? Heck, even Lucky Strike's sales are booming. It's the Mad Men factor, and this phenomenon also makes everyone want a female assistant. But in 2014, assistants are about as rare as those IBM Selectric typewriters from Season 1, so we'll take the next best thing: the virtual version. Most of us have to make our own coffee, hang up our own coat, and set our own appointments. But by golly, having Cortana or Siri call someone for you makes you feel like a regular Don Draper, if just for a moment. Roger Sterling sure is a selfish rake, but wouldn't it be great if you had an assistant to do your shopping for you -- just like Roger? With Siri and Cortana, you at least have someone make your shopping list. Of course, we draw the line at boss-secretary romance. Let's not get carried away. A person and a computer program? No one would ever be weird enough to fantasize about falling in love with an operating system. Unless you count the $481 million in ticket sales from ""Her,"" a movie with this exact premise. But perhaps I haven't convinced you. For example, you might be wondering how there can be a distinction between the sexist reason for wanting a female assistant and the Mad Men reason. Isn't it the same thing? No. From fashion to furniture, everyone wants a little Mad Men in their life. And whatever form ""a little Mad Men"" takes, it must resemble the show as closely as possible. Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner takes pride in the deadly accuracy of his period details, and so do we, when we recreate aspects of the show in our lives. If all the assistants on Mad Men were men, everyone would want a male virtual assistant right now. Also, let's not forget that everyone roots for the female characters Joan Holloway and Peggy Olson, both of whom begin the show as assistants. They both break through the glass ceiling (in very different ways) on their way to the top of the advertising hierarchy. We want them to succeed, and we agonize over the injustices heaped upon them in their ascent. Whatever our gender, we also want female assistants, just like Joan and Peggy eventually have when they become powerful. There's a twist to this story. Cortana, the artificially intelligent character from Halo, was based on the ancient Egyptian queen Nefertiti. Some scholars believe Nefertiti ruled Egypt after the death of her husband, Pharaoh Akhenaten. Viewed from this perspective, Cortana represents not only a helpful, soothing voice, but also an eventual ruler. For those who are predicting world domination by robots, the choice of Cortana is certainly something to ponder.","Microsoft's Windows Phone 8.1 just got an upgrade with the voice of Cortana .

"(CNN) -- Despite the progress made toward gender equality, there remains this fact: Women still hold fewer leadership positions in government and industry, and men still face a social stigma if they stay home, as Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg writes in her much-discussed book, ""Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead."" Sandberg talks about the need for women to ""lean in"" to greater leadership roles at work and insist on equal partnerships at home. We wanted to know what ""leaning in"" looks like in practice. CNN invited families to share their successes and struggles at balancing work and family. Can women -- or for that matter, anyone -- be high-fliers at home and work? And if so, how does it work? What it means to ""lean in"" While arrangements differed, there was a common refrain: You can't go it alone, there's no right path and we need to stop judging each other's choices. 'It boils down to removing the stereotypes' ""In our household, there are no traditional roles,"" wrote Aisha Houser, a human resources specialist and mother of three in Huber Heights, Ohio. She and her husband both work full-time, and he also goes to school at night. Houser puts in longer hours most days so she can have every other Monday off for appointments. They keep their children -- ages 7, 5 and 20 months -- on a strict routine during the week. Working women, know your value . Above all, she said, ""husbands need to understand that they will have to clean, wash clothes, cook, dress the kids or whatever needs to be done. ... It boils down to removing the stereotypes of the traditional family."" Won't work 'if it means paying someone to raise our kids' Kelly Moening works as a federal law-enforcement agent, a job she wanted from the time she was a little girl. While she's investigating criminal activities, her husband is taking their daughter to ballet, helping their son with his homework, preparing dinner and doing the laundry. He stays home with their three children, ages 6, 3 and 1. Trained as a lawyer, he has never found a job that earned enough to support their family. As much as he wants to work, he doesn't want to do it ""if it means paying someone else to raise our kids,"" Moening said. Professionally, ""I am a better agent because he stays home. I couldn't do this job full time as a mother to three little ones, if he didn't handle everything else,"" Moening said. Confessions of a busy mom: 5 lessons . Moening's own parents both worked and her mother was the primary breadwinner. They raised her to associate happiness with a great job, not motherhood. Yet as proud as she feels about being a special agent, Moening would quit her job and retire at 35 if her husband found a job that paid as much as hers. ""Deep down, no matter how much opportunity is afforded me, I'm a mom through and through,"" she said. ""I have a fantastic job, no doubt. But I truly feel I would be more personally satisfied by not missing a moment of my kids' childhoods."" 'Life is a team effort' One of 10 children, David J. Hopper was raised in a traditional household. His father worked as a meat cutter and never washed a dish. Every night he sat in his place at the end of the table and was always served first. Hopper met his wife-to-be, Dawn, in 1999. He had two young children at the time and a job at an architectural firm that required he work up to 60 hours a week. All the day care pickups, cooking and housework fell to Dawn, who was also in graduate school working on her doctorate. Opinion: Why women trash each other . Things came to a head when Hopper's son was diagnosed with a developmental delay and needed extra care. Dawn was pregnant at the time, and it was too much for her to handle everything. He decided to quit his job and build his own practice. The balance shifted. ""Now I was home, running my business from the basement. Now I picked up the kids from school, tidied the house, did all the laundry and when she came home, she did the cooking."" Looking back, it was a ""slow change."" But he realizes now Dawn ""wouldn't be very happy without a career, and I wouldn't be very happy without that wife. In a way I'm married to her career, too."" 'The boys know they can always count on me' ""Parenting is hard, and it DOES take a village. Sometimes a village and a neighboring village, "" wrote Amy Lawson, a divorced mom of two boys in Gainesville, Florida. She works as an administrator in an OB/GYN office and maintains blogs about motherhood and social media marketing. Though technically she is a single mom, Lawson often feels the need to add the disclaimer that her ex-husband is very involved with their children, of whom they share custody. Opinion: Sandberg left single mothers behind . She said too many women have bought into the notion they need to ""bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan, and never let their man forget he's their man,"" to paraphrase the song used in the 1980s commercial for Enjoli, ""the 8-hour perfume."" ""There are times I ruminate on why I'm not the kind of mom that can stay home and make homemade hummus with organically grown crinkle cut cucumbers, then I stop thinking about that because there is laundry to be done, hugs to give, dinner to cook, homework to check and inevitably something to pull out of the dog's mouth,"" she wrote. ""Homemade hummus or not, the boys know they can always count on me and their dad, and their extended family, and that is my version of 'having it all.'"" 'It is hardly ever perfect' ""I used to be ashamed of the number of before- and after-care providers I employed,"" wrote Rebecca Giannelli, a mother of three and a registration coordinator for a large physician group in Illinois. Her husband has a job in the local public works department. They have three children, ages 2, 4 and 9. The traditional male and female roles are ""out the window"" in her house, she said. Her husband picks up the kids in the afternoon, gives them a snack, cleans up, starts the laundry and gets dinner going. They share homework and bath time. She schedules medical appointments, pays the bills and organizes the birthday parties. Though it often feels like they're getting through the day ""by the skin of our teeth,"" she said she looks to her children for guidance. ""They are brave and resilient and go with the flow,"" she wrote. ""You will not find a high maintenance child at my address. Food? Check. Semi-dry clothes? Check. A brother or sister to play with or annoy? They are happy."" 'I choose sanity' Web developer Janice Gervais wasn't expecting to actually want to stay home with her two daughters. But that's not an option. The family needs her steady paycheck and the health insurance that comes with it. The kids are in day care most of the week. At work, she said, ""leaning in"" to bigger opportunities -- as Facebook's Sandberg advises women -- doesn't feel realistic, either. ""I just don't have the mental ability to put in 10 hours of work a day and additional work on the weekends, which seems to be the unspoken requirement ... in order to receive promotions in a typical work environment, and then coming home and cook dinner, clean up, and give my children my 100% attention."" The myth of balancing motherhood and a successful career . She said she gets through each day by ""choosing sanity"" and not comparing herself to other families. ""My house is a war zone and guests know to call before they come over. Pursuing a higher career is on hold so the spare time I do get is spent with my kids. Their clothes are stained, their hair is a mess, their outfits don't match, but my sanity is still mostly intact. I just feel fortunate that I have the things I have, because so many others have far less."" 'Stop second guessing' Jennifer Reilly left a job as a senior executive with the New York Yankees to spend more time with her family. It was her dream job, but she was often gone from 8 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., working seven days a week. Her children were in seventh and tenth grades at the time. Open Mic: What's holding women back? Her lawyer husband had scaled back his practice to be at home for the kids after school. When she left the Yankees, they swapped; she started her own consulting business, he went back to a law firm. She plans to return to a more demanding job when her youngest leaves for college in a couple of years. ""The biggest mistake women make -- those that choose to stay at home and those that work and have others help with their kids -- is they think too much!

"(CNN) -- Two of the world's best-known public figures, Pope Francis and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, met for the first time Thursday in Rome. The Queen, accompanied by husband Prince Philip, is paying a one-day visit to Italy at the invitation of Italian President Giorgio Napolitano. She and the Duke of Edinburgh attended a lunch hosted by Napolitano, whose role as head of state is largely symbolic, at the presidential palace before heading to Vatican City. The private audience with Pope Francis was the first meeting between the 87-year-old queen, who is Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and Pope Francis, head of the Roman Catholic Church. But she has met some of his papal predecessors. According to Vatican Radio, Thursday's audience marked the queen's seventh encounter with a pontiff and the fifth different pope she has met. Besides trips to Rome, she also welcomed Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI, now Pope Emeritus, on their respective visits to Britain. Her first papal encounter was with Pope Pius in 1951, the year before she ascended the throne, the broadcaster said. The Queen's latest visit to Italy, at the invitation of Napolitano, was initially planned last year but was postponed because of illness. Britain's ambassador to the Holy See, Nigel Baker, told Vatican Radio the Queen had decided to take advantage of the rescheduled trip to meet Pope Francis. ""If you look back in terms of Queen Elizabeth's reign, it is extraordinary how far the relationship between Britain and the Holy See, and between the Anglican Church and the Catholic Church, has developed since 1952 when she became queen,"" he said. A key aspect of that has been her several encounters with different popes over the years, Baker said. Francis, who's from Argentina, was elected pope in March of last year after Benedict took the almost unprecedented step of resigning from the papacy. Britain and Argentina have a sometimes testy relationship, thanks to an unresolved dispute over the Falkland Islands. The two countries went to war over the South Atlantic territory in 1982 after the then-military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands, which Argentinians call Las Malvinas.

"(CNN) -- I really am speechless, which makes it that much harder to write this column. After everything I've seen covering modern parenting over the past several years, I kind of feel like nothing can really surprise me anymore. Oh how wrong I was, because when I heard about comments from Boomer Esiason, the former football star and now CBS NFL analyst and radio host, I thought he had to be joking. Did he really suggest that New York Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy should have encouraged his wife to have a C-section, which is major surgery, so that he wouldn't have to miss Opening Day? Murphy's wife went into labor, so he flew to be with her, missing the season's first two games. Major League Baseball allows a player to miss up to three games for paternity leave. During a conversation on his radio show with co-host Craig Carton, Esiason, a father of two, said he would never have done what Murphy did. ""Quite frankly, I would have said C-section before the season starts,"" Esiason said. ""I need to be at Opening Day. I'm sorry. This is what makes our money. This is how we're going to live our life. This is going to give my child every opportunity to be a success in life. I'll be able to afford any college I want to send my kid to because I'm a baseball player."" What about family, Esiason? What about not scheduling a major surgery that takes up to four weeks or longer to recover from? (I should know. I had two unplanned C-sections!) All that, just to avoid missing the first two games of a 160-plus game season? After being widely criticized for his remarks, Esiason offered a lengthy apology on his radio show on Friday. ""I want to say again on this radio show that in no way, shape or form was I advocating anything for anybody to do. I was not telling women what to do with their bodies ... I would never do that. That's their decision,"" said Esiason. ""And the other thing, too, that I really felt bad about is that Daniel Murphy and Tori Murphy were dragged into a conversation, and their whole life was exposed. And it shouldn't have been. And that is my fault. ""I apologize for putting him and his wife in the midst of a public discussion that I basically started by uttering insensitive comments that came off very insensitive. And for that I apologize."" Esiason said he tried to reach out to Murphy to apologize personally, but it does not appear that they connected. He said he was in touch with the owner of the New York Mets and the team's public relations chief. 'The choice of parents' For his part, Murphy, whose wife ended up having a C-section, is shrugging off any criticism of his decision. ""That's the choice of parents that they get to make,"" Murphy said on Thursday, before Esiason's public apology. ""That's the greatness of it. You discuss it with your spouse, and you find out what you think works best for your family."" Not surprisingly, outrage in social media over Esiason's original remarks was pointed solidly in one direction. ""There are so many reasons this is so wrong,"" a mother said on my Facebook page. She had three C-sections, none of them by choice. ""He has no idea what in the world he is talking about,"" she added. ""(A C-section) is no walk in the park for mom or dad, whether you are a baseball player or not, whether you are in the off season or not."" Another woman, also on Facebook, cited what she called ""the lack of sensitivity and sophistication"" around these issues of gender and reproduction. ""I also think (despite what he says), if it were (his) wife, he would not feel the same way."" Don't show me the money, parenting advocate and author Sue Scheff said on Facebook, criticizing Esiason for suggesting that money should be more important than family. ""Games happen a lot. How often is the birth of your child?"" she asked. ""Easy for him to say, he'll never have to have one,"" said a man, who did not want to be identified, referring to a C-section. Esiason made his comments during an exchange with his co-host, who thought Murphy should have gotten back to work once the baby was born instead of taking an additional day of paternity leave. (Another WFAN radio host, Mike Francesa, also took issue with Murphy being out for two games.) In Esiason's defense, his first comments when the subject came up were that Murphy had ""legal rights to be there if he wants to be there."" As a football player, he's also coming from the mindset of his sport and how key players haven't traditionally missed one of the season's games for a birth, noted @heymatt on Twitter. In fact, Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco's wife gave birth one hour before game time in September, and Flacco played that game against the Cleveland Browns. Elective C-sections: 'That's not that common' But what got under people's skin, more than anything, was the idea of suggesting that a wife have major surgery to accommodate her husband's schedule. ""Major surgery should only be used when medically advised, not for convenience,"" said @elia_eltringham, also on Twitter. C-sections may be scheduled because of the estimated size of the child and the age of the mother, or if a mother had a prior C-section, doctors say. Some women have chosen to have them because of fears of incontinence after a vaginal birth. Nearly one-third of births are currently done by C-section, which is a significant jump from the 20% of deliveries resulting in C-sections in 1996, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Lillian Schapiro of Atlanta said she has seen a movement away from scheduled C-sections in her practice. ""I would say a few years ago, there was more of a trend to have scheduled C-sections, and now there is much more a move back to allowing nature to run its course, and people wanting to have a more natural experience,"" said Schapiro, an ob/gyn affiliated with Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. Dr. Lynn Friedman, an ob/gyn with Mount Sinai Hospital in New York -- and one of my doctors during my pregnancies -- said her practice also hasn't seen a rise in elective C-sections. ""A purely elective (C-section) ... someone who just says 'I don't want to labor,' I mean, that's not that common, and that's really still very much discouraged,"" Friedman said. ""For someone to say 'My career is something that would make my wife schedule a section' ... I think in the 21st century ... that's really still a very sexist thing to say, and I think a ball team should understand that their player should be with his wife. I mean, I just think that's grotesque."" What do you think of what Boomer Esiason said about scheduling a C-section to suit a ballplayer's schedule? Chime in in the comments or tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","Boomer Esiason said athlete's wife should have scheduled C-section to avoid game .

"(CNN) -- Jason Collins became the first openly gay man to play in the NBA on Sunday night, wearing a Brooklyn Nets uniform in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers. Collins, who lives in Los Angeles, signed a 10-day contract with the Nets on Sunday. He entered the game with 10:28 left in the second quarter, receiving a round of applause from the L.A. crowd at the Staples Center. Brooklyn won the game 108-102, and Collins played 11 minutes, not scoring any points but pulling down two rebounds and making one steal. When Collins took the court, he became the first openly gay athlete in any of the major American team sports -- baseball, football, basketball and hockey. But in a post-game interview, Collins talked like a jock, not a history maker. ""It felt fun,"" Collins said. ""It felt good to get back out there on the court."" ""Jason told us that his goal was to earn another contract with an NBA team. Today, I want to commend him on achieving his goal,"" said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. ""I know everyone in the NBA family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment."" Last year, the center, who was a free agent at the time, made the disclosure about his sexuality in an April column that appeared in Sports Illustrated magazine. ""I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn't the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, 'I'm different.' If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I'm raising my hand,"" he wrote. Collins, 35, is a big, end-of-bench bruiser who can harangue opposing centers. Over 12 seasons, he has a career average of 3.6 points per game, and he hasn't averaged more than 2 points a games since his 2006-07 season as a Net when the team called New Jersey home. Collins received a congratulatory tweet from Michael Sam, the all-American football player from the University of Missouri who recently came out. Sam tweeted, ""Congratulations to my friend @jasoncollins34 - excited to see you do work out there #Brooklyn."" Collins said he didn't expect to create such media stir in the coming games. ""There's only so many questions you guys can ask,"" he said.","Collins makes his first appearance of season in Nets game against the Lakers .

"(Health.com) -- People with diabetes are at increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke at an early age, but that's not the only worry. Diabetes appears to dramatically increase a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia later in life, according to a new study conducted in Japan. In the study, which included more than 1,000 men and women over age 60, researchers found that people with diabetes were twice as likely as the other study participants to develop Alzheimer's disease within 15 years. They were also 1.75 times more likely to develop dementia of any kind. ""It's really important for the [public's] health to understand that diabetes is a significant risk factor for all of these types of dementia,"" says Rachel Whitmer, Ph.D., an epidemiologist in the research division of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a nonprofit health-care organization based in Oakland, California. Health.com: Signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes . Whitmer, who studies risk factors for Alzheimer's but wasn't involved in the new research, stresses that many questions remain about the link between diabetes and dementia. The new study was ""well done"" and provides ""really good evidence that people with diabetes are at greater risk,"" she says, ""but we really need to look at other studies to find out why."" Diabetes could contribute to dementia in several ways, which researchers are still sorting out. Insulin resistance, which causes high blood sugar and in some cases leads to type 2 diabetes, may interfere with the body's ability to break down a protein (amyloid) that forms brain plaques that have been linked to Alzheimer's. High blood sugar (glucose) also produces certain oxygen-containing molecules that can damage cells, in a process known as oxidative stress. In addition, high blood sugar -- along with high cholesterol -- plays a role in the hardening and narrowing of arteries in the brain. This condition, known as atherosclerosis, can bring about vascular dementia, which occurs when artery blockages (including strokes) kill brain tissue. Health.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . ""Having high glucose is a stressor to the nervous system and to the blood vessels,"" says David Geldmacher, M.D., a professor of neurology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""The emerging information on Alzheimer's disease and glucose shows us that we do need to remain vigilant on blood sugar levels as we get older."" Studies dating back to the late 1990s have suggested that people with diabetes are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, but the research has been marred by inconsistent definitions of both diabetes and dementia. The authors of the new study, led by Yutaka Kiyohara, M.D., an environmental medicine researcher at Kyushu University, in Fukuoka, sought to address this weakness by using the gold standard of diabetes diagnosis, an oral glucose tolerance test. This involves giving a person a sugar-loaded drink after they have fasted for at least 12 hours, and then measuring how much glucose remains in their blood two hours later. Health.com: Exercise tips for people with type 2 diabetes . At the beginning of the study, the tests showed that 15% of the participants had full-fledged diabetes, while 23% had prediabetes, also known as impaired glucose tolerance. The participants were all dementia-free when the tests were done, but over the next 15 years 23% received a diagnosis of dementia. Slightly less than half of those cases were deemed to be Alzheimer's disease, with the remainder roughly split between vascular dementia and dementia due to other causes. (The diagnoses were confirmed with brain scans of living patients and brain autopsies in deceased patients.) Both diabetes and prediabetes were associated with an increased risk of dementia diagnosis, although the association was weaker for prediabetes. And the link persisted even after the researchers took into account several factors associated with both diabetes and dementia risk, such as age, sex, blood pressure, and body mass index. Health.com: Natural ways to lower blood pressure . The results were published today in the journal Neurology. The next step, Whitmer says, will be to understand whether controlling blood sugar and reducing risk factors for type 2 diabetes also reduces dementia risk. She and her colleagues have several studies underway investigating these questions. Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .","People with diabetes were twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease .

"(CNN) -- Traces of narcotics and hypodermic needles found with the bodies of two American security officers on the container ship Maersk Alabama suggested the deaths resulted from drug overdoses, a Seychelles government official told CNN on Thursday. Seychelles police identified the bodies found Tuesday as Jeffrey Reynolds and Mark Kennedy, both 44. They worked for Trident Group, a Virginia-based maritime security services firm, and Trident Group President Tom Rothrauff said both were former Navy SEALs. ""It's bizarre. Of course, it's a shock. They're all great guys,"" Rothrauff said. ""I'm absolutely clueless as to what happened."" Police said an autopsy would be carried out later this week. But the Seychelles government official, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said the presence of drug traces and paraphernalia ""would suggest that their deaths were a result of drug overdose."" The 500-foot Maersk Alabama was the target of an attempted hijacking in the pirate-infested waters off east Africa in 2009 -- an incident that inspired the 2013 film ""Captain Phillips."" The shipping giant Maersk, which hired the Trident Group to guard its ships, said Thursday that Trident would be conducting random drug tests of its employees. ""Based on our experience with the contractor, this is an isolated incident,"" Maersk said. But it said new drug tests would start immediately and the company's shore-leave policy was under review. The Maersk Alabama has since left the Seychelles capital of Port Victoria, the company said Thursday. Police said the ship arrived in the Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, on Sunday with a 24-man crew and had been expected to leave Tuesday. The bodies were found by a colleague who had gone to check in on one of the men in a cabin at about 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, Seychelles police said. Lt. Cmdr. Jamie Frederick, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman, said the service was investigating the deaths, as required by American law. But he said the deaths ""do not appear to be criminal in nature, related to vessel operations, the material condition of the ship or their duties as security personnel."" In April 2009, four armed pirates attempted to hijack the Maersk Alabama 380 miles off the coast of Somalia. After the crew sank the pirates' vessel and foiled their efforts to take control of the container ship, the pirates took the ship's captain, Richard Phillips, hostage on a lifeboat. The incident ended three days later when Navy sharpshooters killed three of the pirates and captured the fourth. Phillips was unharmed. The ship was attacked by pirates again later that year, but armed security personnel fought them off. Another attempt by pirates to board the ship, in March 2011, was thwarted when security personnel fired warning shots. 2010: Hero skipper ignored pirate warnings, crew says . 2009: Crewman's e-mail gives harrowing details of hijacking .","NEW: Maersk, security contractor launch drug action plan after deaths .

"Washington (CNN) -- It may seem counterintuitive, but federal aviation officials said Wednesday they will make the skies safer for air travelers not by punishing FAA employees who report making mistakes, but by protecting them from punishment. Federal Aviation Administration officials announced that as part of a new ""safety culture"" at the agency, they would fully embrace nonpunitive reporting systems, in an effort to generate information that could expose bigger dangers. ""Make no mistake about it: We don't condone (errors),"" said David Grizzle, the FAA's Chief Operating Officer. ""However, we presume the good intent of our controllers and are more interested in the free flow of information than we are in punishing for errors."" The FAA took a half-step in that direction in 2008, creating a nonpunitive reporting system for air traffic controllers. On Wednesday, the FAA said it was expanding the program to employees who maintain radar installations and other systems. And it changed longstanding FAA nomenclature. From now on, ""operational errors"" -- for instance, when an air traffic controller brings two planes too close together -- will be known as ""operational incidents."" TSA experiments with lighter screening of elderly . The change will reduce the ""stigma"" associated with errors, Grizzle said, thereby increasing information and allowing the agency to make life-saving changes. The new system, paradoxically, will mean an increase in reported ""operational incidents"" in the short term, officials said. Incident reports ""will certainly go up in the next few years with all of our additional reporting systems,"" Grizzle said. But risk will be going down, he said. Safety advocates have long touted the benefits of nonpunitive systems, and some welcomed the FAA's announcement. ""It's a good, positive step,"" said Michael Goldfarb, a former FAA chief of staff who now heads a consulting business in Washington. ""Mistakes happen and we need to learn from our mistakes."" Goldfarb said the FAA was correct in expanding the system to include the agency's technicians. ""The technicians are the forgotten part of aviation,"" he said. ""They're the ones out there 24/7 keeping things working. They don't get the attention the air traffic controllers do."" In announcing the new reporting systems, the FAA cast itself as a victim of its success. FAA officials said they used to be able to measure risk by counting accidents. The fewer crashes, the better the agency was doing. But with the commercial aviation accident rate at historically low levels -- there has not been a fatal commercial crash in three years -- the agency needs to look at other data to identify risky behaviors and incidents, and to address them. One measure has been ""operational errors,"" or instances in which controllers deviate from established protocols. Currently, 99.9 percent of operations occur completely according to procedures, Grizzle said. Grizzle said the FAA is activating sophisticated software that will monitor operations and will bring more errors, or incidents, to light. The FAA said the voluntary reporting system for controllers has provided nearly 10 times the data during the past three years compared to the traditional reporting system. It also led to the FAA's issuing scores of corrective actions, making aviation safer in the United States. It also helped the agency to identify the top hazards, and to focus on those hazards. Officials said there are safeguards to protect employees from abusing the nonpunitive reporting system. After a mistake is reported, the incident is reviewed by a three-person panel, with representatives from management, the union and an oversight organization. The panel can ask for additional information, launch an investigation or take other action as appropriate. If an error was intentional, the FAA can take action, officials said.","FAA officials say the agency won't punish any employees who report making mistakes .

"(CNN) -- This year's Hollywood Issue of Vanity Fair magazine showcases a diverse group of actors and actresses -- which is generally making the Internet very happy. Among the performers featured on the magazine's March cover, an annual showcase for Hollywood's best and brightest, are six actors of color: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Idris Elba, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Naomie Harris and Chadwick Boseman. All starred in notable movies in 2013, and two -- Ejiofor and Nyong'o -- are up for Academy Awards. They share the cover with some Hollywood royalty, including Julia Roberts and George Clooney. 2014 awards season: Does diversity matter more than wins? Observers welcomed the wider palette. ""Can we get all the-times-they-are-a-changin' for a minute?"" wrote Jezebel's Dodai Stewart. ""Vanity Fair's 20th annual Hollywood Issue has a three-panel gatefold cover, as usual, but this year, there are actual black people on the first third, i.e. the part you see on the newsstand. Progress!"" As Stewart notes, in years past, the magazine has been criticized for featuring a narrow branch of Hollywood talent -- usually a gathering of exquisitely made-up, mostly white, twentysomething and thirtysomething actresses. The 2010 cover, which included a host of young female stars such as Anna Kendrick and Carey Mulligan, probably came in for the most criticism. That year, Jezebel tersely headlined its story, "" 'Young Hollywood' Is White, Thin."" Vanity Fair has also been criticized for sexism, particularly the 2006 cover, which featured dressed-up fashion designer Tom Ford alongside the nude (and very pale) Scarlett Johansson and Keira Knightley. But this year has brought approval. Salon's Daniel D'Addario praised the range of age and celebrity wattage as well as race. ""(The cover shows) a healthy and interesting mix of celebrities on every rung of the star system, from the megastar Roberts to the emerging (Margot) Robbie, as well as more than just a group of white stars,"" he wrote. The Twitterverse has been equally enthusiastic. ""Look at all these beautiful black people on the cover of Vanity Fair,"" wrote @MiaTheBoss. ""I love this!! Yes, Vanity Fair for setting a record. 6 people of color on their cover,"" tweeted @JermaineBrowne. However, some people said they believed the cover wasn't diverse enough. On Vanity Fair's website, rmpfdx wrote, ""Black and white is not diversity. It's easy tokenism. Where are the Latinos (who far outnumber blacks in this country)? Where are the Asians? Where are the Native Americans? Hollywood always make sure to include one black and then forgets that other colors and ethnic groups exist too. This cover doesn't inspire -- it sickens."" In a press release, Vanity Fair played up the abilities of the cover stars. ""For the 20th annual Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue, the magazine celebrates a year of spectacular film with a group of distinguished actors,"" the magazine said. The cover photo was shot by Annie Leibovitz.","Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue features six performers of color .

"(CNN) -- A pillar of black smoke billowed over downtown Lynchburg, Virginia, after a train carrying crude oil jumped its tracks and caught fire Wednesday afternoon, city officials said. Between 12 and 14 cars from a CSX freight train were involved in the derailment, which occurred along the James River and left oil burning along the river's surface, city government spokeswoman JoAnn Martin said. About 50,000 gallons of crude oil are missing from the tankers, she said. It's unclear how much of the oil burned in the blaze and how much spilled into the water. Buildings near the derailment were evacuated for several hours, and firefighters let the fire burn out on its own, she said. Travis Uhle was working at the Depot Grill when he came out and witnessed the crash. ""You just saw it going sideways on two wheels and then one went down, and the train just kept on coming,"" Uhle told CNN affiliate WDBJ. ""And then just a dogpile on top of that."" At least three tank cars fell into the river, a photograph taken at the scene showed. Lynchburg police Lt. David Gearheart said the fire was contained, but still burning, four hours after the derailment. CSX said three of the cars caught fire after the derailment, the cause of which wasn't known Wednesday. ""CSX is responding fully, with emergency response personnel, safety and environmental experts, community support teams and other resources on site and on the way,"" it said. ""We are committed to fully supporting the emergency responders and other agencies, meeting the needs of the community and protecting the environment."" William Hayden, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, said it was ""too soon to say"" what the environmental impact of the accident would be. The spill was contained before it stretched more than a quarter of a mile downriver, he said, but it wasn't clear Wednesday evening how much oil had spilled into the James. ""We have people on the scene providing technical assistance to make sure the leak is contained properly,"" Hayden said. An oil boom in North Dakota and Canada has led to a fourfold increase in the amount of crude shipped by rail since 2005, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Environmentalists and regulators have been paying more attention to those shipments since a July derailment and fire killed 47 people in a small town in Quebec. In March, environmentalists warned against having trains hauling oil from North Dakota's Bakken shale pass through downtown Lynchburg en route to a storage depot in Yorktown. Glen Besa, director of Virginia's Sierra Club chapter, said Wednesday's accident only heightens those worries. ""This train track runs right through the heart of Richmond, by the way. This could easily have happened in the heart of the capital city,"" Besa said. He said it wasn't clear whether the oil would burn off completely without leaving residues on the ground or in the river. ""These are the questions that should have been asked before we started doing this,"" he said. Casey Hernandez, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said Virginia received just under $400,000 last year in Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparation grants. She noted, too, that the department has held two all-day hazmat transportation training workshops in the state since September. The volume of oil spilled or burned wasn't immediately known. The NTSB and the Federal Railroad Administration are sending investigators to the site, those agencies said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was monitoring the air at the request of state officials, EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones said. Martin said Lynchburg's drinking water wasn't affected by the spill. But in Richmond, more than 100 miles downriver, authorities have begun drawing drinking water out of a separate canal rather than the James as a precautionary measure, said Angela Fountain, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Public Utilities. John Aulbach, director of the state Office of Drinking Water, said it would take three to four days for any oil that may have spilled to reach Richmond, and it would be ""very diluted"" before it reached that point. Other communities can bypass the river as well. ""We're not expecting any effects to drinking water,"" Aulbach said. CNN's Athena Jones, Cristy Lenz, Greg Seaby, Greg Botelho, Kevin Conlon, Matthew Stucker, Jonathan Helman and Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report.","NEW: Official: 50,000 gallons of crude oil are missing from the tankers .
