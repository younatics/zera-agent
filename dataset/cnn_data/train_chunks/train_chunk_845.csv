"By . Simon Tomlinson . Congress has unveiled a $1.1 trillion spending bill that aims to prevent another government shutdown which boosts funding slightly for military and domestic programs - but not for 'Obamacare' health reforms. With a deadline looming at midnight tomorrow for new spending authority, lawmakers will still need a three-day stop-gap funding extension to ensure enough time for passage of the spending bill this week. The measure eases across-the-board spending cuts by providing an extra $45 billion for military and domestic discretionary programs for fiscal 2014, to a total of $1.012 trillion. It also provides an additional $85.2 billion for Afghanistan war funding that is typically handled off-budget. 'Can't please everyone': Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Barbara Mikulski (center) said a new $1.1trillion spending bill unveiled by Congress yesterday could not reflect the wants of just one party . The spending measure fills in the details of a budget agreement passed in December in the aftermath of a 16-day shutdown of many government agencies in October. The shutdown was prompted largely by disputes over funding for 'Obamacare' health insurance reforms. Although many programs will get a slight increase over 2013 levels and avoid steep cuts previously slated for this year, the proposed bill does not provide any increase for implementation of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law. According to a House Republican summary, a public health fund will be reduced by $1 billion to prevent Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius from 'raiding' these funds to spend on Obamacare insurance exchanges. Boost: The bill provides an extra $85.2 billion for Afghanistan war funding that is typically handled off-budget . The chairs of the Senate and House of Representatives Appropriations Committees said in a joint statement that the deal will eliminate the economic instability caused by Congress' recent funding battles. 'As with any compromise, not everyone will like everything in this bill, but in this divided government a critical bill such as this simply cannot reflect the wants of only one party,' Democratic Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Republican Representative Harold Rogers of Kentucky said in a statement. White House Budget Director Sylvia Mathews Burwell said the measure will help fund critical investments in education and infrastructure. 'This legislation adheres to the funding levels in the budget agreement enacted in December, unwinds some of the damaging cuts caused by sequestration,' she said in a statement. The military avoids about $22 billion in the across-the-board cuts, with total non-war spending of about $520.5 billion under the bill, while agencies focused on domestic programs will get $491.8 billion, representing an increase of about $22 billion over sequester levels. Blow: The proposed bill does not provide any increase in funding for implementation of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law . But some controversial budget items took a hit. The . spending measure provides no funds for high-speed rail projects, and it . again denied a funding transfer needed to pay for critical reforms to . the International Monetary Fund. But both Republicans and Democrats touted a provision in the bill that reverses planned military pension cuts for disabled veterans, a controversial part of the December budget deal that helped pay for about $6 billion in new spending. Military retirees of working age were to see smaller cost-of-living increases in their pensions starting in 2015, but it was later discovered that the change was inadvertently applied to disabled veterans and survivors of deceased veterans as well. While the spending bill will reverse the cuts for disabled veterans and survivors, many Republicans in Congress still want to cancel the cuts for all retired military service members. Negotiations on the measure bogged down as lawmakers attempted to attach policy provisions on issues ranging from restricting abortions to curtailing regulation of carbon emissions. Many of these were successfully fought off, including new abortion provisions, Mikulski told reporters. Democratic aides said the bill includes no new provisions prohibiting regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, nor forestry and stream management. They also prevented new gun-rights language from inclusion. But Republicans did get a policy provision into the measure that prohibits funding of the Obama administration's 'light bulb standard,' which prohibits the manufacture of incandescent light bulbs in favor of newer technologies that reduce energy consumption. Passage of the measure would leave just one more significant fiscal policy hurdle during the current fiscal year which ends on September 30 - an increase in the federal debt limit. This will likely be needed by March or April to avoid a default on the Treasury's debt and the resulting market turmoil.","Provides an extra $45billion for military and domestic programs for 2014 .

"By . Julian Gavaghan . Scores of passengers on board a luxury cruise liner have had their £2,000 holidays ruined by a sickness outbreak. Around 170 passengers on the Boudicca were hit by the suspected norovirus during its 13-night trip to the Canary Islands. The virus, which causes vomiting and diarrhoea, is highly contagious and those infected were quarantined during the doomed voyage. 'Cursed': The Boudicca, which has been hit by outbreaks several times before, was infected again during a 13-night cruise to the Canary Islands . The ship, carrying around 828 passengers and 348 crew, was greeted by NHS staff and ambulance crews when it docked in Greenock, Scotland last night. One passenger told the Daily Mirror: ‘We started calling the ship HMS Holby City. ‘There were two nurses wandering around all the time visiting people, most of them elderly. ‘Half the facilities were shut down and we were even told not to swap quiz sheets to stop the bug spreading. ‘Passengers were offered £150 discounts on their next cruise. We don’t know anyone who accepted. ‘People had spent up to £2000 on the cruise and their holidays have been ruined.’ The 53-year-old woman said a woman in her 80s, who suffered a heart attack, was winched off by a helicopter rescue crew after a stop in Madeira. It is not known if her condition was linked to the outbreak. The Boudicca, owned by Fred Olsen, underwent an intensive fumigation yesterday before leaving for a cruise to the Adriatic 90 minutes later than scheduled. The deep cleaning process was supervised by experts from Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS. Port: The ship docked at Greenock, where it underwent a fumigation process . The Boudicca has been ravaged by viruses before - with some passengers even calling it 'cursed' It was hit by three sickness outbreak in as many weeks in 2010 and forced to cut short its voyage and return to port on one of those occasions. A spokeswoman for Fred Olsen said the latest bug was a viral infection which caused mild gastroenteritis symptoms. The spokeswoman said: ‘During this cruise, the highest number of guests needing to be kept in isolation at any one time was 35, out of a total number of people on board of 1,176, comprising 828 guests and 348 crew. ‘The total number of cases reported during the 13-night cruise was 170. ‘Boudicca returned to Greenock yesterday, and departed on a 21-night 'Adriatic with Croatia' cruise D1210 last night. ‘She departed at 6pm, instead of the original scheduled time of 4.30pm, in order for a complete and intensive fumigation process to take place, details and timings of which were notified to all guests prior to the cruise’s departure. The cleaning procedure went ahead, and also included the Cruise Terminal. ‘The Port Health team spent 30 minutes examining the ship and she was given the necessary clearance to sail from the Port. ‘At Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, the health, safety and well-being of our guests and crew on board remains our priority at all times, and we believe that our systems for preventing the spread of illness on board our ships are amongst the best within the industry. ‘Fred Olsen Cruise Lines' ships meet, at all times, the highest safety, hygiene and health standards, and comply fully with the strict requirements and inspections of their Flag State and relevant authorities.’","Suspected norovirus outbreak forced Boudicca crew to quarantine some infected passengers during cruise .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Released: Convicted child sex offender Cory Roberts has been freed from prison . The Washington mother of a young rape victim was horrified to hear that the violent sex offender who left her three-year-old daughter permanently brain damaged has been freed. Cory Roberts, a repeat offender, was moved to a halfway house in Tacoma on Monday. A technicality has meant that Roberts has been released rather than being committed for life to a secure facility for predators. Roberts spent 24 years in prison for the violent attack on Kelly McGinnis's daughter, who he had been asked to babysit. Two weeks ago, officials contacted Ms McGinnis to tell her that the 37-year-old was due to be released. 'It just tears me apart that he's out. He's done with his sentence and my daughter is . continuing to serve her life sentence,' Ms McGinnis told Komo4. Her . daughter was left partially blind, brain damaged, and has to use leg . braces to walk. She has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old and can . still remember parts of the attack at her home in 1990. Ms McGinnis said her daughter is still terrified of Roberts and constantly asks if he is still in prison. For now, . Ms McGinnis said, she will pretend he is in prison because she fears her daughter . would not be able to cope knowing he had been freed. Scroll down for video . Distraught: Kelly McGinnis was horrified to hear that the man who raped her daughter is to be freed . Dark past: A newspaper clipping of Roberts, who was 13 when he brutally attacked a three-year-old girl . After . being sent to a juvenile detention center, Roberts raped two boys who . shared a cell with him, and in 2001 he was accused of raping another young child. Ms McGinnis agreed to talk about the brutal attack on her daughter, to let people know Roberts had been freed. 'I want people to know he's out, what . he's capable of, of what he could do to somebody else, another child,' she said. 'I cannot sit by and just let this happen. I can't not say . anything because he's a monster,' Ms McGinnis said, adding that she feared he could attack again. The Washington Department of Corrections had tried to block Roberts' release, possibly for life, but a legal loophole has led to him being placed under a community supervision order instead. 'The . crime Roberts was convicted of 24 years ago when he was 13 is among the . worst imaginable,' a spokesman for King County Prosecutor's office said.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Authorities in Alaska . say they are investigating claims by a confessed Anchorage killer that . he is responsible for three additional deaths. A . news release says Joshua Wade has agreed to provide information on . three additional killings. In exchange, prosecutors will transfer him to . a federal prison outside Alaska. Wade was convicted of killing nurse Mindy Schloss and convicted of evidence tampering in the death of Della Brown. Authorities in Alaska say they are investigating claims by confessed Anchorage killer Joshua Wade that he is responsible for three additional deaths . KTVA-TV reports Wade contacted them several times last winter and told them he killed three others. Wade . says he killed someone when he was 14 and strangled someone else five . years later during a botched robbery. He says the third unrevealed . killing occurred the night Brown died. He says there was a man with Brown whom he beat and shot. Wade, 34, has admitted killing Della Brown and Mindy Schloss. Wade . was sentenced to life in prison in February 2010 in the 2007 death of . Schloss, a neighbor who worked as a nurse practitioner. 'I deserve much worse,' he tearfully said at his state court sentencing. In . a signed plea agreement for the slaying, Wade also acknowledged that he . killed Brown, another Anchorage woman, in September 2000 by hitting her . on the head with a large rock. Brown's battered, partially-nude body . was found in an abandoned shed. Wade pleaded guilty in federal court to first-degree murder and carjacking in the 2007 death of Mindy Schloss Schloss, a nurse who lived next door . Wade also admitted to killing Della Brown, an Alaska Native woman whose battered, partially-clothed body was found in an abandoned shed in Anchorage . An Anchorage . jury acquitted Wade of Brown's murder but convicted him of tampering . with evidence, for which he served 6  1/2 years in prison. In . telephone calls last winter from jail to KTVA, Wade claimed he killed . someone else when he was 14 and five years later, strangled someone in a . botched robbery. The third additional death, . he said, came the night Brown was killed. There was a man with her in . the shed. Wade told the station he knocked the man unconscious, put him . in the trunk of his car, and then went for drinks. When he returned, he heard thumping in the trunk. 'And . I opened it, nobody was around, it was dark, and pulled him out and . pretty sure that I'd killed him that time by stomping on his head,' Wade . told the station, which didn't air the interviews last winter but did . so Thursday night, after police announced the news conference. 'I drove . out to the valley, found a spot, took the guy out, took his clothes off . and shot him in the head two times with a shotgun and pretty much took . everything from the shoulders up.' Months . after his release from the evidence-tampering conviction, Wade bound, . gagged and kidnapped Schloss, shooting her in a wooded area near . Wasilla. Wade was sentenced to 99 years in . prison for the murder of Schloss. A state court judge placed a . restriction on the parole board to make Wade serve at least 66 years. If . Wade were to be released after that, at age 95, he would be turned over . to federal authorities to serve out the remainder of a life sentence . for murder committed during a carjacking. That . sentence was handed down in federal court, where Wade got into a heated . exchange with U.S. District Court Judge Ralph Beistline, who called . Wade heartless, selfish and a coward. Red-eyed with emotion, Joshua Wade is seen with defense attorneys Jim McComas, left, and Cynthia Strout, right, after an Anchorage, Alaska, jury cleared him of murder charges Wednesday, April 16, 2003 . In an angry voice, Wade told the judge, 'Don't push it, man.' Beistline responded, ""I'm going to push it."" Wade . repeated the threat, and the judge said the angry outburst was very . revealing and underscored what a danger Wade would be if free. Wade denied to the station that he was a serial killer. 'Absolutely not,' he responded.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . California auditors found 39 cases where female state prison inmates may not have understood they were submitting to medical procedures that would leave them sterile, according to a report released Thursday. State law prohibits inmates from elective sterilizations as methods of birth control. However, prison officials allow sterilizations in cases deemed medically necessary. The audit was prompted by the Center for Investigative Reporting, which last year found that doctors sterilized nearly 150 female prisoners without obtaining proper consent. Unaware: California auditors found 39 cases where female state prison inmates may not have understood they were submitting to medical procedures that would leave them sterile . Auditors confirmed 144 cases between 2006 and 2013 in which inmates had their fallopian tubes tied or cut for the sole purpose of birth control. The report identified 39 'unlawful' cases with apparent violations of state rules requiring inmates understand the nature and permanence of the procedures. The Press-Enterprise reported that st least 11 of the 39 sterilized inmates were serving time at the California Institution for Women in Chino. Margarita Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the California State Auditor, said those 'tubal ligation' sterilizations involved 17 doctors and eight hospitals. The sterilizations were performed by private doctors at facilities outside the prisons, which is typical, she said. No names were released. The cases will be referred to California's medical board and the Department of Public Health, said Liz Gransee, a spokeswoman for the federal court-appointed official who controls prison medical care. State Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson called the findings shocking. She said she fears that inmates may feel pressure to undergo sterilization. 'The experience in and of itself is extraordinarily coercive,' Jackson said of obtaining health care behind bars. 'It's very difficult for a woman to exercise her free will under those circumstances.' Jackson, a Democrat from Santa Barbara, is the author of a bill that would make it clear that the state's prisons and jails are prohibited from sterilizing inmates for the purpose of birth control. The measure passed the Senate 36-0 last month and is before the Assembly. Auditors said there was confusion over the prison policy. High concentration: At least 11 of the 39 sterilized inmates were serving time at the California Institution for Women in Chino . The federal receiver's office took control of prison medical care in 2006, but said it didn't learn about the sterilization procedures until the legal advocacy group Justice Now raised the issue in January 2010. The receiver's office previously said it immediately took steps to stop the practice. The report found one sterilization since then, in 2011, but said the tubal ligation was medically necessary. But in 27 cases auditors found the inmate's doctor did not sign a required consent form saying the patient appeared mentally competent, understood the permanent effect and had waited at least 30 days and no more than 180 days to reconsider. Auditors were critical of the receiver's office, saying it failed to make sure its staff obtained necessary approvals from inmates and from two medical procedure review committees before inmates were sterilized. They recommended that the federal receiver adopt better procedures to monitor its medical staff and the medical providers who work under contract with the state. That includes improving medical record-keeping and making sure inmates give their informed consent to medical procedures. Gransee put a positive spin on the findings. 'We are glad to see that our efforts to stop the practice have been successful,' she said, adding the receiver's office will work with auditors 'to improve our process further.'","State audit found 39 cases where inmates may have been unaware they were undergoing procedure that would leave them sterile .

"By . Emma Patterson . Jessica Simpson has banned cell phones and cameras at her wedding tomorrow - which is being organized by the same celebrity party planner who worked on her first wedding. The blonde, 33, is set to tie the knot with long-time love Eric Johnson, 34, at the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California, which today is a bustling hive of activity. There are strict guidelines for guests who have been sent a lengthy email with Dos' and Don'ts before the wedding weekend, which kicks off tonight with a huge July 4 bash - theme 'Let's Celebrate the Red, White and Blue' - before the black-tie affair tomorrow at 4pm. And the invite signs off with the message: 'We hope that this weekend leaves you with memories that will last a lifetime.' Scroll down for video . I Do: Jessica Simpson and her long-time love Eric Johnson will tie the knot on Saturday in California at a rustic-chic wedding . Settling in: Ashlee Simpson and fiance Evan Ross grabbed a drink and explored the grounds on Thursday before the wedding . To stop any photos leaking ahead of Jessica and Eric's big money magazine deal, the invite reads: 'Please note that there will be no cell phones or cameras allowed at the wedding location. We kindly ask you to leave your cell phones and cameras in your hotel room or check them in upon arrival with our security team.  Security will be checking all guests upon arrival.' And although guests - set to include Jessica's best pal Cacee Cobb and her husband actor Donald Faison - ARE allowed to bring phones and cameras to today's Independence Day celebration - they are limited as to what photos they can actually take. The . email states: 'On the 4th of July, guests will be allowed to have their . phones and cameras. We look forward to sharing the photos and intimate . moments from this day with our guests only. We kindly ask you to refrain . from posting images or details on your social networking sites in order . to respect and protect our privacy. ' Incredibly, invitees still do not officially know the location of of where pop singer turned clothing millionaire Jessica and former footballer player Eric will say their vows tomorrow. Guests were told at which hotels to say at in the Santa Barbara area - and shuttles will be ferrying them to and from the unknown location. Only on the journey will they learn their final destination. While tonight's attire is 'upscale casual' - for men, 'anything from a button down to a suit', and a 'summer dress or equivalent' for women, on the wedding day, guests have been urged to wear 'gowns and tuxedos' for the event, which has been described as 'rustic-chic'. Meanwhile, Jessica already has her 'Something Old' as wedding planner to the stars Mindy Weiss did her first wedding to . Nick Lachey in October 2002. And Mindy has also organized a farewell brunch for the newlyweds and their guests on Sunday, where they will be allowed to have their cell phones and cameras and give the happy couple a send-off. Speaking about the wedding, Mindy said: 'I'm really excited about it.' Lighting up: The couple were spotted puffing on cigarettes as they took in the luxurious estate . Getting ready: Golf carts, party supplies and shrubbery were delivered to San Ysidro ranch in Montecito, California, early on Thursday morning ahead of Jessica Simpson's wedding tomorrow . Jessica and former NFL player Eric began dating in 2010 after they were introduced to each other at a mutual friend's party. They got engaged just five months after they started dating, but that was over four years ago . Wedding plans suffered a major delay due to the birth of their two children, Maxwell, two and Ace, 13 months. Trucks . carrying party supplies, furniture and shrubbery were spotted at the . location on Thursday morning, just hours before Jessica's sister and . bridesmaid, Ashlee, 29, arrived with her fiance Evan Ross, 25, in tow. Jessica and Evan drove from Los Angeles on Thursday and were spotted relaxing in the grounds of the luxury estate. There was no sign of Jessica, who no doubt was enjoying some relaxing time before the big day. And guests are in for a treat, as Jessica previously told Today: ''It’ll definitely be extravagant. I don't do things small.' This will be the second marriage for Jessica, who divorced Lachey in 2006. The pair originally planned to wed in Italy but moved the nuptials to California in a bid to make it easier for guests to attend. It has emerged that after starting to plan the wedding, Jessica and fiancé Eric realised it would be 'too much' to ask all their guests to fly overseas. Careful: Jessica's pals carried a number of garment bags into the resort ahead of her wedding . They had initially set their hearts on marrying on the idyllic Italian isle of Capri, where they vacationed back in July 2010. The couple had even visited the island last year to scout destinations, visiting  Augustus Gardens and La Fontelina. Beautiful: The San Ysidro ranch is set in Montecito and has beautiful views of the surrounding countryside . Jessica has been working hard to lose weight before the big day and has amped up her usual workout to include six miles on the treadmill daily. The Weight Watchers spokesmodel has stuck to her meal points and does squat-and-lunge sessions with fitness guru Harley Pasternak 'three to five times a week.' Is that the dress? Garment bags were carried in to the estate by guests although Jessica's dress has been kept completely under wraps .

"By . David Mccormack . The judge overseeing Casey Kasem’s feuding relatives has revoked an earlier decision ordering doctors to artificially feed and hydrate the ailing American Top 40 host. Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy determined on Wednesday that giving Kasem food and fluids would be harmful and cause more pain for the 82-year-old former radio and TV personality. His daughter Kerri Kasem initially implemented the end-of life measures on June 6. Casey Kasem's wife of 34 years, Jean, stormed out of court on Wednesday after a judge revoked an earlier decision ordering doctors to artificially feed and hydrate the ailing American Top 40 host . On Monday, Murphy ordered the reinstatement of feeding and other care while a court-appointed attorney consulted with Casey Kasem and doctors. Kasem's wife of 34 years, Jean Kasem, stormed out of court after Murphy's decision, reports The New York Daily News. ‘You have blood on your hands,’ she said. Judge Daniel Murphy said he changed his mind after receiving medical records from St. Anthony’s Hospital near Seattle saying the ailing radio host was not responding to artificial nutrition and fluids, leading to painful complications. 'It would be acutely harmful for Mr. Kasem to have nutrition and hydration restored at this time,' the judge said. 'This was at the advisement of doctors at St. Anthony's.' Health concerns: Hospital staff caring for Casey Kasem claim they warned his wife of the dangers of moving him . Daughter Kerri Kasem initially implemented the end-of life measures on her father on June 6 . Jean Kasem, 59, told the judge her husband expressed his wish to live using eye and eyebrow movements during a five-minute meeting at the hospital last week. 'They had to pry his hands off me,' she told the judge under penalty of perjury. He said Jean did not act 'in the best interests' of her sick, 82-year-old husband when she removed him from a 'skilled' California nursing home at 2:30 in the morning May 7 against doctors orders and took him to a private residence in Washington State. Jean Kasem and her husband’s eldest daughter Kerri have been fighting in courts in Washington state and Los Angeles over his care in recent months. 'We have lived in sheer horror of this girl,' she said, pounding her fist on a courtroom table. ‘(Kerri) has had in her possession her father less than a week and decided to stop all medication and kill him,’ testified Jean. Kerri’s lawyer Troy Martin vehemently disputed that claim. 'Nobody . wants Mr. Kasem to die. This is without question the most difficult . thing I have ever had to do and Kerri has had to do,' Martin told the . judge on Wednesday. Jean, the wife of Casey Kasem, spoke with her attorney Steven Haney about the latest developments in the case which sees her at war with Casey's children from his first marriage about his ongoing care . Casey Kasem is now in hospice care. Kerri Kasem released a statement saying the court decision upheld her father’s explicit wishes as expressed by him in his health directive. 'If the extension of my life would result in a mere biological existence, devoid of cognitive function, with no reasonable hope for normal functioning, then I do not desire any form of life sustaining procedures, including nutrition and hydration...' 'Transitioning our father’s treatment to comfort-oriented care was one of the hardest decisions we’ve ever had to make,' said Kerri.

"By . David Mccormack . Singer Heather Naylor of The Electric Barabellas has accused Sydney Holland of wrestling control of Sumner Redstone's life and forcing him to pull support for her MTV series, which was canceled in 2013 . Media mogul Sumner Redstone’s complicated professional and private life is being played out in court with his 43-year-old live-in girlfriend involved in a potentially damaging legal battle with the star of an ill-fated MTV reality series that the 91-year-old billionaire had befriended. The nonagenarian’s girlfriend Sydney Holland has been waging her legal battle against Heather Naylor, a singer who starred in the short-lived MTV series The Electric Barbarellas, since August. Holland is suing Naylor for $1 million, claiming the singer stole her computer containing ‘highly personal’ photos from the home she shares with Redstone, according to court documents obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. Last week, . Naylor launched her own counter-claim in which she accuses Holland of . wrestling control of Redstone's life and forcing him to pull support for . her MTV series, which was canceled in 2013. Naylor . claims the cancellation of Barbarellas, a reality show about her . all-girl band, led to the implosion of her promising career. Redstone is the executive chairman of Viacom which owns MTV. When Barbarellas debuted in 2011, there were accusations that Redstone had forced the network to broadcast the show after he had struck up a personal relationship with Naylor. The allegations that Redstone was pushing MTV management to give more airtime to the Electric Barbarellas had emerged a year earlier. In July . 2010, Redstone had been caught on tape demanding that a journalist . reveal his source at MTV who was providing embarrassing details about . Redstone and Naylor. On the message, Redstone told the reporter that ‘we're not going to kill’ the source, adding ‘We just want to talk to him’. He also told the reporter he would be ‘well rewarded and well protected’ if he gave up his source, although the reporter declined. Media mogul Sumner Redstone's complicated professional and private life is being played out in court with his 43-year-old live-in girlfriend Sydney Holland involved in a potentially damaging legal battle . A Viacom spokesperson later confirmed that it was Redstone's voice on the message and said the mogul had made a mistake. When the show eventually aired in 2011 it attracted poor ratings. A second season was commissioned, but later cancelled after ratings fell to less than a quarter of what the first season had attracted. In her cross-complaint, Naylor accuses Holland of using her influence to have the show killed. ‘Holland grew jealous of Naylor's relationship with Redstone and made efforts to cut off all ties between Redstone and Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. Members of The Electric Barabellas, including Heather Naylor center, arrive at the 2011 MTV Movie Awards at Universal Studios' Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, California . In June 2013, Naylor alleges that Holland took steps to isolate Redstone, including attempting to limit access to him and firing loyal staff. Naylor claims that her ‘relationship with MTV and Viacom came to a halt’ as a result of Holland and her relationship with Redstone also ‘disintegrated.’ Holland’s attorney Patty Glaser had denied that her client had anything to do with Barbarellas' demise. Naylor's lawyer has been probing Holland’s relationship with Redstone for potentially scandalous material to use against her. Holland was asked in a recent filing if she had met Redstone on a ‘millionaire matchmaker’ dating site. Redstone is the executive chairman of CBS Corporation and Viacom and according to Forbes he is worth US $6.2 billion . Glaser described that questions about Holland's sexual history and relationship with Redstone as 'inappropriate and harassing'. She asked the judge to prevent the line of questioning she described as 'titillating', but not relevant to who stole the laptop. Glaser hopes the case can be resolved before a trial. 'The computer and whatever is on it should be returned to Sydney Holland,' she told The Hollywood Reporter.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The top civil servant at the Home Office today came under pressure over 114 missing files related to allegations of child abuse over three decades. Mark Sedwill revealed he has not even asked to see a list detailing what the documents related to, as he told MPs he presumed they had all been destroyed and not to 'assume there's anything sinister' at work. The home affairs select committee said a trawl of files last year was 'not satisfactory' and it was 'odd' that a report he commissioned had not been read by Home Secretary Theresa May. Scroll down for video . Home Office permanent secretary Mark Sedwill told the home affairs committee that he did not inform Mrs May that his department had lost 114 files . Mr Sedwill came under pressure for not even having looked at the list of 114 files which have gone missing . MPs have condemned the loss of the documents on an 'industrial scale'. Today the committee demanded to know why Mr Sedwill did not have the details of the names and serial numbers of the files which were missing. He has refused to name the 'mystery man' he asked to trawl the Home Office library, but insists he relied on their 'judgement'. At the weekend Mr Sedwill revealed that a review carried out last year of 746,000 Home Office files covering 1979 to 1999 had identified ‘573 relevant files which had been retained’. But he admitted that another 114 ‘potentially relevant files’ had been destroyed, missing or not found. However, today Mr Sedwill said he did not know if the serial numbers of the missing files had been studied, to see if those adjacent in the records were also missing or if only those linked to child abuse allegations had been 'deliberately removed'. Tory MP Nicola Blackwood said if there are no other cross-references to the missing files it would be 'somewhat sinister'. Alarmingly, last year's trawl of files had unearthed 13 items of alleged child abuse, of which four had never been passed to the police. Four of the cases involved members of staff at the Home Office who have been prosecuted and sacked in connection with 'pornographic images', Mr Sedwill revealed. It follows the revelation that in 1983 Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens handed a dossier detailing allegations of abuse to the then-home secretary, Leon Brittan. But the Home Office now says it cannot find the file. The handling of files at the Home Office has fuelled claims of an Establishment cover-up. Labour MP Keith Vaz called Mr Sedwill to give evidence to the home affairs committee after revealing the loss of the files . The Home Office has been given until noon on Friday to release details of the missing files to MPs. Appearing before the home affairs select committee today, Mr Sedwill was challenged about his decision to commission an internal review last year of the way the Home Office dealt with allegations of abuse. Last year's review concluded the Home Office had behaved properly, but growing questions about a cover-up has triggered a fresh review. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: 'There is a feeling in the committee that the first review was not satisfactory.' He said there remains several issues which 'still need to be chased up'. Mr Vaz demanded to know if Mr Sedwill had told Mrs May last year that his department could not find dozens of files. 'You didn't tell her then that 114 files had gone missing?' Mr Vaz asked. Mr Sedwill replied: 'I don't recall doing so. I shared with the Home Secretary the executive summary and broad conclusions. I told her what we were doing with the material. 'But it would not be appropriate for her or indeed for anyone other than a small number of people not least sensitive personal information within the report. 'Indeed I did not see all of the accompanying material myself.' He added: 'I am concerned frankly about the 114. I am concerned about all the material that we cannot find. 'Most of these files were probably destroyed, because the kind of topics that they covered would have been subject to the normal file destruction procedures that were in place at that time. 'They cannot be confirmed to be destroyed because there is not a proper log of what was destroyed and what wasn't.' But Mr Vaz said: 'This is an odd report that you have commissioned that the Home Secretary did not want to read.' Later Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said:'There are clearly big questions for the Home Secretary to answer on how seriously the 2013 review into historic allegations of child abuse was taken. 'Neither she nor her senior official appear to have been briefed on its contents, nor are they aware of the details of the 114 files that went missing. 'This evidence also shows that Theresa May's decision to instigate only a review of a review into the Home Office handling is simply not adequate. 'Given the seriousness of the allegations and the weaknesses of the 2013 investigation she must now widen the remit of this latest review into the Home Office to ensure it has full investigative powers and has a free rein to look more widely into the way things were handled in the Home Office Whitehall and Westminster - regardless of how long ago these are said to have taken place.' Home Secretary Theresa May has asked Peter Wanless, the chief executive of the NSPCC, to lead a review into the Home Office handling of historic allegations of child abuse . A dossier of allegations of abuse was first passed to then-Home Secretary Leon Brittan (left, leaving his home in London today) by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, but it has been lost or destroyed . Mrs May has asked Peter Wanless, the chief executive of the NSPCC, to lead a review into the Home Office handling of historic allegations of child abuse. Mr Wanless will also examine an internal review into claims the Home Office funded the Paedophile Information Exchange, a paedophile campaign group that was disbanded in 1984.  His report is expected to take eight to 10 weeks. Mrs May said she was confident that the work commissioned by Mr Sedwill was 'carried out in good faith', but added that with 'allegations as serious as these the public need to have complete confidence in the integrity of the investigation's findings'. Last year's investigation found 13 items of information in Home Office files about alleged child abuse dating back to the period 1979-99, and passed police details of four of the items about which they were not already aware. But Mrs May told MPs that, while records of a number of letters from Mr Dickens were found, there was no sign of a 'Dickens dossier'. The investigation found that 114 potentially relevant files were not available, and were presumed 'destroyed, missing or not found', although the independent investigator made clear that he found no evidence to suggest that the files had been removed or destroyed 'inappropriately'. Mr Wanless is also to examine that finding that public funds totalling almost £500,000 were given to two organisations with links to the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE). The Voluntary Services Unit (VSU) provided £65,750 to the Albany Trust between 1974 and 1980 and £410,500 to the Princedale Trust between 1974 and 1984.","Mark Sedwill grilled by MPs about Home Office handling of 30 years of files .

"By . Toby Harnden . More Democratic superdelegates are boycotting their party’s convention in North Carolina amid fears that any association with President Barack Obama will doom them to defeat in November. Representatives Kathy Hochul and Bill Owens of New York, who both won special elections in seats previously held by Republicans, have joined four Democrats from the Rust Belt in skipping the Democratic convention in Charlotte at the start of September. Rep Hochul told The Daily: ‘I guarantee that my time will be better spent meeting the farmers, small business owners and other people who put me here.' In an excuse not much more convincing than ‘I’m washing my hair’, a spokesman for Rep Owens insisted: ‘He just has a packed schedule back home.’ Beleaguered: President Obama has now been abandoned by six Democratic superdelegates . Staying away: Kathy Hochul, left, and Bill Owens, right, both representatives from New York, will not be at the Democratic convention to cast a vote for Mr Obama's re-election . At least six superdelegates, given a vote in the presidential nomination process because of their status as senior elected officials, will not be casting their ballots for Obama. On Tuesday, Representative Mark Critz of Pennsylvania, who has just won a tough Democratic primary in a newly-drawn district, said he had decided to stay at home rather than travel to Charlotte for Obama’s formal nomination in early September. ‘Since I was elected, my focus has been on creating jobs for people here, rather than focusing on the agendas of the political parties in Washington,' he told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. On Monday, Governor Earl Ray Tomblin, Senator Joe Manchin and Representative Nick Rahall, all seeking re-election this year, announced they would not go to Charlotte. Opponent: Mitt Romney will take heart from Mr Obama's struggle to hold on to his support . A Tomblin spokesman said the governor had ‘serious problems’ with both Obama and Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee. ‘The governor feels that his time is best spent working in West Virginia to move our state forward instead of attending a four-day political rally in North Carolina.’ Manchin said in a statement: ‘I intend to spend this fall focused on the people of West Virginia, whether that’s representing them in my official U.S. Senate duties or here at home, where I can hear about their concerns and ideas to solve the problems of this great nation.’ Last month, the Senator refused even to say whether he would vote for Obama, stating that ‘I’ll look at the option’, adding that the last four years ‘have made it pretty rough’ for West Virginia. Obama lost West Virginia by 18 percentage points in 2008 after having been trounced there by Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. His poor showing there, and in industrial areas of neighbouring Pennsylvania, underlined his difficulties in attracting white, blue collar voters. That problem has only increased since he was elected, the economy has faltered and unemployment nationally has risen to 8.2 per cent. Manchin has expressed his dismay with Obama’s stances on coal and energy issues, arguing that he is backing environmentalists over workers. Boycott: Mark Critz of Pennsylvania, left, and West Virginia's governor Earl Ray Tomblin, right, have decided not to attend the Democratic convention in Charlotte in September . Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia will attend the convention but he is not facing re-election this year. Jim Burn, Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman, told the Tribune Review that he suspects that other candidates for the House of Representatives would stay at home rather than join the celebration in Charlotte, where Obama will be re-nominated in a 70,000-seater stadium. ‘Like Critz, that is the right thing for them to do. They should be home winning votes, not be seen at a party.’ In 2008, Manchin, then West Virginia’s governor, spoke at the convention in Denver and urged Democrats to vote for Obama. ‘My fellow Americans, we need a new leader for new times. Barack Obama is the only candidate in this race who has captured our nation's hopes for the kind of change we so desperately need. Let's do what's right for America and elect Barack Obama as the next president of the United States.’ Since he won a special election in November 2010 to replace the late Senator Robert Byrd, however, he has become an Obama critic, in part at least to preserve his hopes of being elected to a full six-year term this year. He said last month: ‘I’m worried about me. I’ve said it’s not a team sport. You need to go out and work for yourself. Critz is due to face Keith Rothfus, a Republican, in a district that will be tough for any Democrat after McCain won there by eight points in 2008. Mike Mikus, Critz’s campaign spokesman, said that internal polling showed Obama  was down double digits to Mitt Romney in the redrawn district. He added that this made the decision to skip the convention ‘pretty easy’ and ‘it is fair to say’ that Critz would not ask Obama to campaign with him. Lukewarm support: West Virginian congressmen Joe Manchin, left, and Nick Rahall, right, have refused to commit wholeheartedly to the President . Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly two to one in West Virginia and Democratic politicians hold 70 percent of local elected offices there, but Obama is so unpopular that Romney is virtually guaranteed to win the state. Staying away from the convention will not stop Republican opponents from tying the four boycotting superdelegates from the Rust Belt to Obama. Bill Maloney, seeking to unseat Tombin, demanded that the Democrat go to Charlotte to vote against Obama’s nomination. ‘Earl Ray Tomblin has chosen to support Barack Obama by not going to his own convention to vote against the president,’ he said. ‘Barack Obama and his job-killing policies are hurting West Virginians. It is now clear that Earl Ray Tomblin supports Barack Obama and his policies.’ The absence of a number of superdelegates will add to a number of headaches for Obama surrounding the Charlotte convention. Unions are furious that North Carolina will host the convention because they view the state as unfriendly to labour. The state’s unpopular Democratic governor Beverly Purdue has opted not to seek re-election. David Parker, the state party chairman, is being sued by a male former employee who left his job after he accused the male party executive director of sexual harassment. The executive director’s ex-girlfriend then stated he had contracted HIV from him. One of North Carolina’s most prominent Democrats, John Edwards, has just narrowly escaped being convicted of corruption charges after admitting fathering a child from an affair conducted while his wife was dying of cancer. Most Democrats are increasingly pessimistic about Obama’s chances of winning North Carolina, where he just prevailed over McCain four years ago.",Two New York congressmen join four others in announcing they will not attend party convention in September .
"By . Emma Reynolds . Train drivers have been ordered not to stop at the station nearest to the Olympic Park – because it is too hot. The Greater Anglia rail company says soaring temperatures mean it is not safe for trains to travel as quickly as usual. So, to minimise delays, it has ordered drivers to go straight through Stratford – the main gateway to the Olympics. Can't handle the heat: Train services were slowed down or cancelled because of the soaring temperatures . Too warm a welcome: The sun meant that trains did not stop at Stratford today . The company said yesterday that its . overhead cables, which date back to the 1950s and are in desperate need . of upgrading, cannot cope with trains travelling at normal speeds if the . temperature is more than 30C (86F). Network Rail said last night that the . ageing cables were in the process of being updated. A spokesman . apologised for any disruption and stressed that the vast majority of . services would still run to Stratford. Greater Anglia confirmed that at least . nine services on the Norwich to Liverpool Street service would not stop . at Stratford, while there would also be revisions and cancellations . affecting trains headed for Colchester. A spokesman said: ‘There are . some revisions in place to our mainline timetable. We are working with . Network Rail to minimise the disruption for our customers.’ Temperatures are predicted to drop . before the opening ceremony on Friday. But fears are growing that . London’s antiquated transport system will cause chaos for millions . travelling to the Games. The network was widely declared to have failed . its first ‘test run’ for the Olympics on Monday night. As 40,000 spectators flocked to the . Olympic Park for the opening ceremony rehearsal, two key routes to the . stadium were suspended. The Central Line was closed for two . hours by a power cut, while the North London line closed for an hour . after a track buckled in the heat. Many performers were late as a . result. Excuse: Greater Anglia trains said the problems were down to older sections of overhead lines expanding and sagging in high temperatures . Graduate Sam Batt, 22, of Ealing, West . London, said he left home at 4.30pm but did not arrive at the stadium . until about 8.10pm – missing the first 40 minutes. After the ceremony, spectators were . forced to queue for nearly an hour and a half just to get into Stratford . tube station because it was so overcrowded. Many did not get home until . the early hours. There were similar problems on the . Underground last week, when a fault on another key Olympic route – the . Jubilee Line – meant trains were suspended and some passengers stuck . inside boiling hot carriages for up to 25 minutes. And those who have chosen to travel by . road have fared even worse, with athletes reporting that it has taken . up to five hours to get from Heathrow to the Olympic Village by bus. Signs intended to welcome Arabic visitors to the Olympics are ‘completely incoherent’. The huge banners are hung in the . shopping centre which borders the Olympic Park, Westfield Stratford. But . the Council for Arab-British Understanding said the words were back to . front and not joined up properly. It was the equivalent of an English . language sign intending to say ‘welcome to London’, instead saying ‘N O D . N O L O T E M O C L E W’. Westfield Stratford apologised and said it . would replace the posters. Arduous journey: Many passengers travelling from London's Liverpool Street station during tonight's rush hour could be affected (file picture)","Soaring heat meant some main line trains were not stopping at the Olympics serving station of Stratford .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . When she awoke from a 14-week coma caused by a deadly brain condition, Liz Oldershaw's family were happy just to see her awake. However, their joy at her recovery soon turned to worry as they discovered she had lost most of her memories - and even how to talk, read and write. Liz, 24, could not even remember that she didn't like to eat bananas after her brain was damaged by encephalitis - swelling of the brain. Remembering: Liz Oldershaw, 24, lost her memories to a brain condition, but is rediscovering her past through photo albums with the help of her mother, Cathy, 52, and other family members. Reminders: This collage of photographs from her past helps Liz find out about the memories she has lost . Piecing together: Liz is using the albums and scrapbooks to reassemble her past, which she says is like a 'jigsaw' But in the two years since waking up, she has been able to rediscover her life thanks to photo albums and diaries painstakingly put together by her friends and family. Liz, from South Brent, Devon, said: . 'When I look through the scrapbooks from mum and the rest of the family . I’m just overwhelmed with emotion. 'I . just started crying when I looked through it, I couldn’t believe I had . been through all this and had no recollection of it at all. 'My . mum and family must have been terrified when I was ill and when I . looked at the scrapbooks she’d made, I couldn’t believe that I’d done so . many things that I had no memory of. 'I’m . now unsure whether the memories I have are those of my own or just from . photographs and other people’s memories - but I’m so thankful to my mum . for going to so much trouble.' Liz caught the disease - usually caused by the herpes simplex virus that also causes cold sores and chicken pox - after returning from a family holiday to the Carribean. Snapshots: Liz says she isn't sure whether the photographs bring her memories back, or whether she learns them again . Re-learning: Liz struggled even to speak after she woke up, but is re-learning language with help from her loved ones . Struggle: Liz had also lost the ability to write - as this attempt at spelling her own name shortly after she recovered shows . Learning: But she gradually improved, as can be seen in these later writing exercises . The condition - which can be fatal - causes excess fluid and swelling inside the skull, and can lead to brain damage. In Liz’s case, her immune system responded by attacking her own brain, which did even more damage. She said: 'I was lying on the floor at home and began having a seizure. 'That’s the last thing I remember. It’s only thanks to reading my mum’s diary that I learned about what happened to me.' When she woke up, 14 weeks after . doctors were forced to sedate her, huge chunks of her life were missing, . including birthdays, holidays and her time studying psychology at . university. Her mother . Cathy, 52, and sister Sarah, were shocked at her condition but resolved . to help her remember who she was using This Is Your Life-style . scrapbooks. Cathy said: . 'I tested Liz’s memory by asking her if she liked bananas, which I know . she hates, and when she said she liked them my stomach sunk as I knew . that her memory had been affected. Hospitalised: Liz was struck down by encephalitis - a potentially fatal swelling of the brain . Bruised: The condition also left Liz with worrying marks on her arms, left, and legs, right . Medicine: As part of her recovery, Liz has to take all of the pictured tablets on a daily basis . 'Liz had regressed back to being like a small child when she woke up from the sedation and so we had to teach her everything all over again. 'When she was trying to string a sentence together she would just forget a word as she was talking, she still does it now. 'Her determination to learn to walk again was incredible and she was back on her feet quickly but we knew this would be a long road to recovery.' Cathy, a GP, couldn’t understand what was happening when Liz first became ill and doctors were equally as baffled. It wasn’t until blood tests sent to Oxford University Hospital were looked at that the doctors had an idea of what was happening to her daughter. She said: 'I was so worried when she first fell ill, she just changed and became a whole other person. 'When they said they wanted to sedate her I knew it was something serious and all I could think was how much I wanted her to be better again. Together: Liz (second from left) has been helped through her recovery by her mother Cathy (left), father Chris (right) and sister Ruthie (second from right) Road to recovery: Liz, left, and Cathy, right, have worked hard to recover her old life and allow her to move on . Confidence: Liz is currently unable to work, but volunteers with the encephalitis society to help people in a similar position to her . 'I kept a diary of everything that went on as it was good for me to write it down and get my feelings written down. 'I also decided to create the scrapbooks so that Liz would have something to go through to remember the things she forgot. 'I am so glad she can’t remember the time that she was ill as it was such a traumatic time, I wouldn’t want her to keep that memory.' While Liz remembered some parts of her life, she claims that her memories are like a jigsaw without all of its pieces. Liz has been unable to work as she still has relapses and hasn’t built up the confidence she once had before. Liz said: 'I do a lot of voluntary work with The Encephalitis Society and they have helped me in so many ways. 'There are a lot of other young people who have been through a similar situation to mine and it has such a devastating effect. 'People assume that memory loss comes with age but this disease takes memory from young people who have barely been able to make that many memories. 'I studied psychology at university and so learning about the human mind and then having this happen to me was so ironic. Memories: Liz, pictured left with her sisters Sarah and Ruthie, is using photographs to remember moments like this, which she otherwise has no recollection of . Recollection: The photographs help Liz piece together events such as this holiday to Grenada in the Caribbean . Faces and places: Liz, here with her ex-boyfriend Tim, said she is trying to look at what happened to her as positively as possible . 'It fascinates me how this disease works and how it affects your behaviour and your memory in such an extreme way.' 'I’m not going to let this determine who I am as a person, it doesn’t control me. 'I have met so many great people through the encephalitis society and have been given so many great opportunities. 'You could look at all the things that have changed in a negative way because of this but I just prefer to look on a more positive side and look at what I can do to help instead.' Phillippa Chatman, operations manager of The Encephalitis Society, said that Liz's fight to regain her life is typical of people who suffer from the disease. She said: 'Liz has shown amazing strength of character since being affected by Encephalitis. 'As with any case, it was a highly traumatic time for Liz and her family, and it shows just how devastating this condition can be. 'Like many others, she was left to pick up the pieces and start again, learning to walk and talk. 'As well as raising funds for The Encephalitis Society, Liz is now an OCN accredited Regional Representative, where she offers guidance, help and support for others who have been affected. 'It’s a service that is absolutely invaluable to our charity. It’s an absolute pleasure to have Liz on our team and we’re very proud of her accomplishments.'","Liz Oldershaw, 24, developed encephalitis and was put into a 14-week coma .

Two B-2 Spirit aircraft from the U.S. Air Force have been deployed at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire. It is very unusual for the groundbreaking bombers to be deployed outside of the U.S., because their long-flying ability meaning they can normally operate from a domestic base. Scroll down for video . Sentinel of the sky: This is the incredible moment a U.S. stealth bomber is refuelled over the Cornish coastline. The high-tech aircraft, which has a wingspan of 52-metres and can fly for as long as 44 hours, was photographed above Cornwall's picturesque northern coastline. It was performing a mid-air refuelling with a KC-135 Stratotanker from RAF Mildenhall. The image was captured on June 11 by Senior Airman Christine Griffiths and now released by the U.S. Air Force. The U.S. military said the B-2 was 'participating in familiarisation training operations' in the UK. Admiral Cecil Haney, commander, U.S. Strategic Command, said: 'This deployment of strategic bombers provides an invaluable opportunity to strengthen and improve interoperability with our allies and partners. 'The training and integration of strategic forces demonstrates to our nation's leaders and our allies that we have the right mix of aircraft and expertise to respond to a variety of potential threats and situations.' The billion-dollar bomber, which has a crew of two, has an unrefuelled range of approximately 6,000 nautical miles and can hold 75-tonnes of fuel. File picture .

"These remarkable images show the moment a young pelican chick's head almost disappears into the mouth of its mother as it hungrily takes advantage of feeding time. The adult pelican can be seen to withstand what appears to be a rather uncomfortable feeding session to comfort her hungry youngster. The chicks - aged just two to three months old - are reliant on their mother for food. The head of a young pelican chick almost disappears into its mother's mouth during feeding time at a zoo in Indonesia . Photorapher Dikky Oesin, 38, took the images of the birds' feeding time at a zoo near his hometown of Jakarta, Indonesia. The father of three takes his son there almost every week and seizes the opportunity to practice his photography. Mr Oesin said: 'Strangely, this happened at a time when I just wanted to go home. 'But when I heard the noisy sounds of the birds crowded together, I decided to go and take a look. 'My son was very surprised when he saw the chick's head disappear into the mother's mouth - but for me, I was rather concerned about the mother. 'The beak of its chick is almost at the entrance to the stomach.' Dikky Oesin, 38, took the images at a zoo near his hometown of Jakarta, Indonesia . Mr Oesin said: 'My son was very surprised when he saw the chick's head disappear into the mother's mouth - but for me, I was rather concerned about the mother' The feeding process continued for around half an hour during which time Mr Oesin crept closer and closer to the pelicans - despite their intimidating size. An average adult pelican stands at about one and a half metres tall. Mr Oesin said: 'I went from being 15-20 metres away to taking photos just three metres from the birds. 'They didn't mind our presence - especially as we were by the zoo keeper who was feeding them fresh fish.'","Dikky Oesin took the images at zoo near his home in Jakarta, Indonesia .

Tragic accident: An Amtrak train struck and killed guitarist Jeff Ray who played in the Jersey Boys band in Las Vegas . No injuries: None of the train's 130 passengers were hurt in the accident . The accident occurred at about 3:30pm near C Street Southwest and Eighth Street. NWCN reports that Ray was unable to get off the tracks before the train, traveling at 79 miles per hour, struck him. Ray was in the area to perform with the Top 40 cover band The Jone$ at Muckleshoot Casino in Auburn. The train was heading to Seattle, having originated in Portland. There were 130 passengers on the train. No one on-board was hurt in the incident.

"By . Lewis Smith . A Roman backstreet used by some of the first Christians to worship in York has been found under the city's Minster. Archaeologists discovered the paved street during construction of a visitor centre in the medieval minster's undercroft. It is thought to have been used for several centuries and shows signs of having been repeatedly patched up and repaired. Archaeologist Ian Milsted brushes clean the newly discovered Roman street beneath York Minster . The street originally ran behind the Roman basilica, the site of today's Minster. The Very Reverend Vivienne Faull, the Dean of York, said: 'While it was not as grandly paved as the main streets of Roman York, you can imagine that this backstreet, situated as it was between the Basilica and the Praetorium, was exactly the kind of place where the real business of the empire was done. 'It probably even witnessed the very first Christians on their way to worship.' A Minster spokeswoman added: ""The backstreet was used for hundreds of years and was frequently patched and repaired, falling into disuse at the same time as the basilica itself."" Excavations were carried out by the York Archaeological Trust as part of the £20 million York Minster Revealed project. Ian Milsted, the trust's Lead Archaeologist,said: 'Before this, there had been no archaeological excavations at York Minster for over 40 years, so it's a huge privilege to be revealing pieces of the past in such an iconic building, all of it contributing to our picture of life in ancient York.' Paving from the street that once ran past the Roman basilica in York can be seen centuries after it was last used. Roman York, then called Eboracum, was founded in AD71 was a major military and economic hub in Britain until the early 5th Century. Analysis of all the finds made during the dig, including four human skulls that were unearthed last March, is expected to be published early next year. The Minster dates from 1220 but the first church on the site was built in 627 for the baptism of the Anglo Saxon king Edwin. The York Minster Revealed project is a five-year scheme designed to conserve and restore historic features while improving access for the public.","The road was repeatedly patched up to keep it in use for centuries .

"By . David Mccormack . As the only daughter of one of American's most notorious mobsters, Sandra Lansky lead a charmed life as a young girl who everyone – even Frank Sinatra – feared because of her close connections to the mob. Now 76, Sandra has written a book – Daughter Of The King: Growing Up In Gangland – all about her experiences growing up with her father, Meyer Lansky, and many of the most feared Mafia bosses of the 20th century, how she feels an important part of their legacy has been forgotten and all about the passionate affair she shared with crooner Dean Martin. Known as the ‘Mob's Accountant’, Lansky was a major organized crime figure who, along with his associate Charles ‘Lucky’ Luciano, was instrumental in the development of the 'National Crime Syndicate' in the United States. As the only daughter of one of American's most notorious mobsters, Meyer Linsky, Sandra, right, lead a charmed life as a young girl who everyone feared because of her close connections to the mob . For decades, the stoic, well-dressed Jew, was one of the most powerful individuals in America. His gambling empire stretched from Las Vegas to Havana, with his partners in crime, Lucky Luciano and Bugsy Siegel. ‘They spoiled me rotten,’ Sandra told the Tampa Bay Times about the mod bosses who her father worked with and whom she called uncle. But while all of them ended up either murdered or in prison, the U.S. Justice Department never found her father guilty of anything more serious than illegal gambling. Sandra lived a charmed existence for much of her life of the back of her father’s reputation and his considerable wealth. Sandra Lansky lived a charmed existence for much of her life of the back of her father's reputation as a mob boss and his considerable wealth . She fondly remembers the time he took her to the Majestic Theatre to see Carousel, the hottest ticket on Broadway, and he bought all the seats in front of them so their view was unimpeded. The Daddy's girl got married at the tender age of 15. However, her playboy husband turned out to be a 'gay fortune hunter' so she quickly moved on to dating singers and movie stars. In her book, she writes of how Frank Sinatra once came over to say hello to her father and spilled a champagne bucket of ice in her lap and looked as though he had made a fatal mistake. While Frank Sinatra ran scared of her after spilling ice all over her in front of her father, Sandra established a much stronger bond with another crooner, Dean Martin. She fondly recalls the night they made love six times. ‘I had never seen anything like Dean Martin’s masculinity. We made love six times in a night that wouldn’t stop. I counted. Sandra Lansky fondly recalls her affair with crooner Dean Martin and how they made love six times one night . 'He wasn’t a big man, just about five foot nine, but he was strong, a boxer from a steel town, and he made me feel that he was ravenously grateful for a woman’s softness after being locked in the blast furnaces all day. ‘His image as a heavy drinker was for the press. With me he wanted to be fully conscious and savor every moment. Between rounds of lust, we’d split a Coke,’ she writes. While Sandra was enjoying an affair with Dean, his wife gave birth to a daughter Gina, but the pair had an unspoken pact not to discuss their families. ‘I didn’t dare let Daddy know of my affair. Dean asked me to travel with him to Chicago, New Orleans, and San Francisco, to go with him on the road, to be his girl. But not his wife. That would have been the rub for Daddy. I never thought of him as vindictive, but he was over-protective. ‘He would have felt Dean was using me. That I was using Dean would not have occurred to old-fashioned Daddy. Where misbehavior was concerned, Daddy had a policy of zero tolerance.’ But the casual nature of her relationship with Dean suited Sandra just fine, she as enjoyed the company of countless other men. After years refusing to talk about her upbringing, Sandra Lansky had a book about her family published earlier this year . ‘I was living the glamorous life of the madcap Manhattan heiress/gay divorcee. I would still see Dean Martin from time to time, meeting him for a secret rendezvous in Chicago or Boston. Dick Shawn would call when he was in the city. There were plenty of other stars, Jeff Chandler, David Janssen, Hugh O’Brien — Wyatt Earp himself.’ Next she fell for a man called Gabby Harnett who she thought was the one, until he revealed himself as an undercover cop who wanted her to rat on her father. When Harnett asked for her help she ran straight to her daddy, who she said forgave her for not realizing sooner. He then decided to 'use him.' 'The plan was to feed Gabby and the FBI disinformation to send them on wild goose chases. He gave me a list of names to drop, names and places,' she recalled. She said they had a few more dinners, and numerous meetings that included FBI agents. But then she became distracted with a guy from a major Mafia family, Vince Lombardo. In 1964, Sandra married Vince Lombardo, a mobster, who promised her father he'd get out and stay out as long as he was with Sandra. 'Vince made the deal,' she said and the couple remained happily married until earlier this year when he died. In 1964, Sandra married Vince Lombardo and the couple remained happily married until earlier this year when he died . Her father and uncles may have been some of the most powerful criminals in the world, but Sandra firmly believes they also did a lot of good, such as raising money for orphans and helping to battle Nazi infiltrators during WW II. Lansky was apparently instrumental in helping the Office of Naval Intelligence's Operation Underworld, in which the government recruited criminals to watch out for German infiltrators and submarine-borne saboteurs. During this time, Lansky helped arrange a deal with the U.S. Government via a high-ranking U.S. Navy official. This deal would secure the release of Luciano from prison; and in exchange, the Italian Mafia would provide security for the war ships that were being built along the docks in New York Harbor. German submarines were sinking Allied shipping in great numbers along the eastern seaboard and the Caribbean coast, and there was great fear of attack or sabotage by Nazi sympathizers. 'They did a lot of good,' Sandra told the Tampa Bay Times. 'At the end of the war, he was given a copy of the signing of the surrender, from the Navy department.' 'He was very proud of that,' she said. In her book, Sandra describes how daddy would take her to Broadway shows where the ushers knew his name and to famous supper clubs with her many mobster 'uncles.' It was in one of these supper clubs, The Riviera club in New Jersey, where she and 'Daddy' ran into Sinatra. Power of the mob: 'Frank (Sinatra) right, was more fidgety in Daddy's presence than any bobby-soxer would have been in his,' Sandra recalls in the book of her father, left . She recalls one night, when she was . 10 or 11, Sinatra came over to their table to say hello after his set. She said she felt very grown-up, out 'on the town' with Daddy but . Sinatra was less excited. 'I . had never seen anyone so nervous as Frank, particularly a star who had . all the teenagers in New York screaming for him,' Sandra writes. 'But . Frank was more fidgety in Daddy's presence than any bobby-soxer would . have been in his.' She . said the crooner was so anxious that when he reached over to shake her . hand, he knocked over an champagne bucket of ice, which was chilling her . ginger ale, into her lap. 'He . nearly died,' she remembers, adding 'Maybe he was worrying about dying . for getting me all wet. Maybe Daddy had given him one of his looks.' Either way, Frank quickly got on his knees and began frantically drying her off with a bunch of napkins. He only relaxed when she began laughing and said that he was tickling her. She said the twinkle returned to her father's eyes, and Frank began to breathe easier. The singer then gave her a big hug, as if she had saved his life by forgiving him. Booked: Gambling boss Meyer Lansky, right, smokes a cigarette as he is booked on charges of vagrancy at the West 54th Street police station in Manhattan in 1958 . The first time she became aware of his murderous ways was early October of 1951, when her father took her to dinner with 'Uncle Willie' Moretti - the underboss of the Genovese family. The pair chatted about Havana and her Daddy was 'quiet, thoughtful and a little sad' as they reminisced about old times. Willie turned to Sandra and joked that Lansky took her mother on honeymoon with the gangster Dutch Schultz. 'Is that any way to treat a lady?' he said. At that, the mob boss became uncomfortable and asked for the check. The next day at school she noticed one of the school janitors was reading a newspaper with Uncle Willie on the cover. She said she almost burst out with how she had dinner with him last night. Then she read the other half of the paper. 'Dead!' it said. 'Mob Boss Exterminated in N.J.' Dead: Cliffside Park, New Jersey-Racketeer Willie Moretti lies in his own blood after being shot to death ina restaurant in 1951. Sandra recalls having dinner with 'Uncle Willie' the night before his murder . And he was pictured in a pool of blood lying on the tile floor of a bar. 'I ran to the bathroom and threw up,' she writes. Lansky died of lung cancer on January 15, 1983, age 80, worth almost nothing on paper. However, the FBI believe he had over $300 million in hidden bank accounts and his family still wonders where it went. After years refusing to talk about her upbringing, the writers Nick Pileggi and Norah Ephron convinced her to tell her story and matched her up with a writer.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The parents of a seven-year-old Burmese refugee who was raped and beaten to death have broken down in tears as her killer was convicted of the heinous crime. Esar Met, 26, also a Burmese refugee, was convicted on Friday of kidnapping and murdering Hser Ner Moo in Salt Lake City in March 2008. But prosecutors have not asked for the death penalty due to a language barrier - an issue that has already caused nearly six years of costly legal delays. Instead, Met faces 20 years to prison in life when he is sentenced on May 7. As jurors, who appeared as if they had been crying, delivered their verdict, Hser's mother, Pearlly Wa, could be heard sobbing in the gallery. Guilty: Esar Met is handcuffed at the conclusion of his murder trial in Salt Lake City on Friday. He was found guilty of kidnapping and murdering seven-year-old Hser Ner Moo, who vanished in 2008 . 'Still no more daughter,' Hser's . father, Cartoon Wah, said outside the courtroom, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. 'My only daughter is still no . more.' Hser Ner Moo was found dead in a pool of her blood at the bottom . of Met's shower in 2008. In the nine-day trial, child abuse expert Lori Frasier testified that the little girl suffered an excruciating death and had gruesome injuries to her genitals, as well as a broken arm. 'This would have been terrible pain for . her,' Frasier testified, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. 'This kind of injury would have required force.' Mikal Wersland, a sergeant with the . South Salt Lake Police Department who had helped search for the little . girl after she vanished, also gave emotional testimony as he recounted . how a colleague called him to say they had found the girl's body the day . after they began looking for her. 'They . told me they found what they believed to be blood evidence in the . stairwell of one of the apartments we hadn’t been able to search,' he . said, using a tissue to wipe tears. 'I . just thought about this poor family and having to - just the thought of . having to tell this family what had happened to their little girl.' Missed: Hser Ner Moo was kidnapped, raped and beaten by a man she had grown to trust, prosecutors said . Heartbroken: Hser's mother Pearlly Wa, pictured in November 2012, sobbed as Met was convicted . Loss: Cartoon Wah, pictured in 2012, said losing his daughter has been the worst experience of his life . Hser's heartbroken parents gave their . own emotional testimony earlier last week as they sobbed about how much . they missed their only daughter. 'She was my one, my only one,' her . father, Cartoon Wah, said through an interpreter on Wednesday, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. 'I have lost many things in my life, but this . was the biggest loss of my life... Now I have to carry on living with . this broken heart and support my family.' Before moving to Utah, the family had fled the Burmese jungle for a crowded refugee camp in Thailand, which later burned down. Her father recounted their fears as they waited for news of their missing daughter. 'The night [she disappeared] my . wife was crying,' Wah said. 'It had been too long, so we assumed, we . thought maybe our daughter is already dead.' Crime scene: A photo shown in court reveals blood in the basement bathroom where Hser was found . Gruesome: Another image shows blood against a wall in the bathroom where her body was discovered . Cordoned off: A photo shows the front of Met's apartment in Salt Lake City where Hser was found dead . Scene: Hser and her family lived at this South Salt Lake complex, where she reportedly befriended Met . His wife, Pearlly Wah, sobbed as she added: 'This is the biggest loss of my life. If you . gave me the whole world of happiness to exchange for this little girl, I . would say no. Nothing can pay me back because I only had one. Whenever I . see little girls run around, it breaks my heart.' Hser was killed on March 31, 2008 . after she wandered from her parents' home at the same complex, telling . an aunt she was going to play downstairs. But when she failed to return home, her parents grew anxious when they couldn't find her. The . couple, who only speak their native language of Karen, contacted their . case worker who in turn called police. The little girl's body was found . the following day. Met was arrested and charged with first-degree felony counts of child kidnapping and aggravated murder. Locked up: Met, who listened to the trial through an interpreter, faces life behind bars when he is sentenced . Emotional: South Salt Lake Police's Mikal Wersland became emotional as he spoke about the desperate search for Hser in March 2008 and how he and his colleagues feared she would be found dead . Painful memories: Carrie Pender, the family's caseworker, testified on Thursday and recalled the look of pain on Hser's mother's face as the family desperately searched for the missing girl in March 2008 . Defense lawyers had argued that no one saw Met . take or kill Hser and that DNA found from his jacket and from beneath . her fingernails were from games the two had shared in days before the . murder. Met, who had also been living in a . Burmese refugee camp in Thailand before moving to the U.S., moved to the . apartment about a month before the slaying. He . lived at the house with four roommates, but defense attorneys say they . shunned him because he was a Muslim man of Indian origin.

No the CIA does not know whether Tupac is alive or where he is, so stop asking. To mark its one month anniversary of joining Twitter Monday, the spy agency gave another display of its new-found humor by answering some of the more pressing questions its 668,000 followers have asked in the past 30 days. No these weren't about al Qaeda, or intelligence about iPhone bombs, the CIA dished the dirt on rappers, passwords and whether you could score a job at the sort-after Virginia headquarters. 'No we don't know where Tupac is,' one of a stream of Twitter posts read Monday. Another read: 'No, we don't know your password, so we can't send it to you. #sorrynotsorry' The CIA then apologized for not following back Ellen DeGeneres, but added to the talkshow star, 'If you visit us maybe we can take a selfie?' Another revealed that 'YES. We're hiring' for those keen to join the ranks. The CIA entered the Twittersphere last month in the tongue-in-cheek fashion that it has clearly upheld. Such an approach to public relations is rare for government departments or agencies, particularly the covert CIA. The spy agency's first foray took the social network by storm as it poked fun at its secrecy. 'We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet,' the CIA tweeted. The tweet was retweeted more than 300,000 times. The CIA also launched its official Facebook page, which is more akin to the sober outlets of other government agencies.

At the time Norwegians documented what they believed were alien spacecrafts soaring across the sky. But thanks to one tweet, the CIA have explained exactly what was happening.

Attached . to the tweet was a government writeup about the sightings, showing that . they were actually test flights of U2 reconnaissance planes.

The CIA tweets an explaination for some UFO sightings in the 1950s, complete with an official document . The planes flew above 60,000 feet, which wasn't thought possible at the time, so commercial pilots who saw something so far above them couldn't explain it. The effect was more pronounced at different times of the day and night, and if the U2 planes caught the rays of the sun, people on the ground were able to see silvery glints of light. The explanation was kept classified for decades to keep the spy programme a secret from the Soviets during the Cold War, according to the BBC.

Lee Radziwill, Jackie’s younger sister, has protected her privacy for years but the family name is being brought back into the public sphere by her now-dead son’s widow, Carole Radziwill, who is now in her second season on the reality show. Carole became a member of the Radziwill family- and the Kennedy clan by extension- when she married Lee’s son Anthony in 1994.

First ladies of style: Radziwill (left) and Kennedy-Onassis (right) were very close and became style icons . She and ‘Tony’ were extremely close with his cousin John F.

She achieved fame six years later with a best-selling memoir about her grief, called What Remains: A Memoir of Fate, Friendship and Love, but now has re-emerged- to the apparent dismay of her late husband’s mother. ‘It’s just tacky. Lee believes Tony never would have wanted Carole to be a part of reality television and she can’t quite grasp why anyone would want to be a on a television show with women fighting and getting drunk,’ an unidentified source close to the 80-year-old socialite told Radar. ‘Fortunately, she lives in Paris and that puts some distance between her and the sensational headlines.’ Carole . Radziwill, 50, has spoken about her on the show but has admitted in . previous interviews that they are not particularly close anymore. ‘I don’t see her as much as I’d like,’ Carole told The Daily Beast.

"By . Ray Massey . Suppressed: Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin told Parliament it is 'not in the public interest' to publish the official report that labelled HS2 in danger of failing . A key report into whether the HS2 rail line would give value for money is being kept secret by the Government. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told Parliament he is using emergency powers to veto publication of the report that says HS2 is in danger of failing. He said that protecting the impartiality of civil servants’ secret advice to ministers has to take priority over disclosure to the public. But HS2 protesters branded the gagging order an ‘absolutely ­disgraceful’ delaying tactic. Campaigners against the £50billion high-speed line between London, the Midlands and the North of England demanded publication of the Project Assessment Review and its cost-benefit analysis under Freedom of Information laws. Joe Rukin, of the Stop HS2 ­campaign, said yesterday’s decision was ‘absolutely disgraceful’ and a Government cover-up. He said: ‘This veto has only been used a handful of times, including the blocking of publication of Cabinet discussions on the Iraq War, the NHS risk register and ­letters from Prince Charles to Cabinet members. This is the first time the veto has been used in relation to a ruling made by the Information Commissioner on environmental grounds. ‘This just proves that there has been, and continues to be an agenda from Government to deceive MPs and the public with spin and dismiss any independent information showing just how bad the HS2 project is. ‘All they want is to make sure this report stays buried for a little longer so they can con MPs into voting for their white elephant vanity project.’ The Information Commissioner, rejecting ministers’ objections, ordered them to release the report. But now that has been overruled by the Government veto. In a written statement to MPs, Mr McLoughlin said: ‘The assurance of confidentiality is important in the conduct of the review. In my view, there is nothing in the nature or ­content of this particular report which outweighs that strong public interest against disclosure.’ High speed: The report about the proposed train line the warned there was a 'red or red/amber' risk of the project failing . Mr McLoughlin said he had given the . Information Commissioner a ‘certificate’ under section 53 of the Freedom . of Information Act 2000. This overrides the Commissioner’s decision to force the Government to reveal the Whitehall report. He . said: ‘My decision to exercise this power of veto in this case was not . taken lightly,’ adding that he decided it was an ­‘exceptional case’. Information . Commissioner ­Christopher Graham said: ‘This is a disappointing . decision and I’ll be studying the Secretary of State’s explanation to . understand why this has been ruled an exceptional case. ‘There . are important legal issues to be considered here, and I’ll be . ­highlighting our view of them in an open letter to the Justice . Committee in due course.’ The report, which included a cost-benefit analysis of the scheme, was given to ministers in November 2011 but never made public. It . is understood to warn of a risky timetable for HS2, poor management, . low delivery confidence and suggestions that the success of the scheme . is in doubt.

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . Johann 'Hans' Breyer, 89, is accused of aided and abetted in the deaths of 216,000 Jews while he was a guard at the Auschwitz death camp . An 89-year-old Philadelphia man has been ordered held without bail on a German arrest warrant charging that he aided and abetted in the deaths of 216,000 Jews while he was a guard at the Auschwitz death camp. U.S. authorities arrested retired toolmaker Johann 'Hans' Breyer on Tuesday. He spent the night in custody and appeared frail during a detention hearing in federal court on Wednesday, where he wore an . olive green prison jumpsuit and carrying a cane. A district court in . Weiden, Germany, issued a warrant for Breyer's arrest earlier this week, . charging him with 158 counts of complicity in the commission of murder. Each . count represents a trainload of Nazi prisoners from Hungary, Germany . and Czechoslovakia who were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau between May . 1944 and October 1944, the documents said. Breyer was born in 1925 in what was then . Czechoslovakia to an ethnic German father and an American mother, . Katharina, who was born in Philadelphia. Slovakia became a separate . state in 1939 under the influence of Nazi Germany. In 1942, the Waffen . SS embarked on a drive to recruit ethnic Germans there and Breyer . joined at age 17. The fact he was a minor at the time was critical in . the 2003 decision to allow him to stay in the United States. Scroll down for video . Johann 'Hans' Breyer's wife Shirley Breyer speaks to reporters outside her home in Philadelphia after her husband's arrest on Wednesday over his alleged role at Auschwitz during the Second World War . In . 1951, American military authorities in Germany carried out a background . check on Breyer when he first applied for a visa to the U.S. The file from that investigation lists . him as being with a SS Totenkopf, or Death's Head Guard Battalion in . Auschwitz as late as Dec. 29, 1944, four months after he said he . deserted. Breyer has admitted . he was a guard at Auschwitz in occupied Poland during World War II, but . has always claimed he was stationed outside of the . Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp part of the complex and had nothing to do . with the wholesale slaughter of about 1.5 million Jews and others behind . the gates. In a 2012 interview at his . modest row house in northeastern Philadelphia, Breyer acknowledged that . he was in the Waffen SS at Auschwitz but that he never served at the . part of the camp responsible for the extermination of Jews. Suspected Nazi prison guard Johann 'Hans' Breyer, lives at this Philadelphia home, pictured center, along with his wife. He moved to the U.S. in the 1950s . During the interview, Breyer said he had recently suffered three 'mini-strokes', but he was cogent and clear as he talked about his past for more than an hour. 'I . didn't kill anybody, I didn't rape anybody, and I don't even have a . traffic ticket here,' he said. 'I didn't do anything wrong.' He . said he was aware of what was going on inside the death camp, but did . not witness it himself. 'We could only see the outside, the gates,' he . said. But the U.S. District Court takes issue with Breyer's version of events and extradition papers state that Death Head Guards carried out 'rotating duties' focused on preventing the escape of predominantly Jewish prisoner-deportees. 'All Auschwitz II-Birkenau Death's Head Battalion guards had rotating duties, all of which were focused on preventing the escape of the predominantly Jewish prisoner-deportees: general guard duty, duty on the watchtowers, large and small chains of guards around the camp, supervision and guarding of the prisoners marched outside the camp for forced labor, and stand-by alert duty for the arrival of prisoners at the train ramp inside the Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp where the 'selection' process occurred,' states Breyer's extradition papers. This photo from January 1945 shows Jews at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, where Johann Breyer is said to have been a guard . Following his arrest, Breyer's attorney . Dennis Boyle argued his client is now too infirm to be detained pending a . hearing on his possible extradition to Germany. Breyer has mild dementia . and heart issues and has previously suffered strokes, Boyle said. 'Mr. Breyer is not a threat to anyone,' said Boyle. 'He's not a flight risk.' But . Magistrate Judge Timothy Rice ruled the detention center was equipped to . care for Breyer, who appeared to comprehend questions about the nature . of the hearing. A law enforcement officer also . testified Breyer and his elderly wife grasped what was happening during . his arrest on Tuesday outside their home in northeast Philadelphia. 'They both understood,' deputy marshal Daniel Donnelly said. 'It wasn't news to them.' This image obtained from the National Archives shows a U.S. Army intelligence card on Johann 'Hans' Breyer, indicating he served in Auschwitz as of Dec 29, 1944, four months after he says he deserted . This document provided by the U.S. Department of Justice shows a copy of a World War 2-era record of Breyer's employment as an Auschwitz camp guard in Birkenau . Breyer has been under investigation by prosecutors in the Bavarian town of Weiden, near where he last lived in Germany. The Army Investigative Records Repository file, obtained by the AP from the National Archives through a Freedom of Information Act request, is significant because judges in 2003 said Breyer's testimony on desertion was part of what convinced them that his service with the Waffen SS after turning 18 might not have been voluntary, further mitigating his wartime responsibility. Breyer testified in U.S. court that he served as a perimeter guard at Auschwitz I, which was largely for prisoners used as slave laborers, though it also had a makeshift gas chamber used early in the war; it was also the camp where SS doctor Josef Mengele carried out sadistic experiments on inmates. But he denied ever serving in Auschwitz II, better known as Auschwitz-Birkenau, the death camp area where the bulk of the people were killed. He also said he deserted in August, 1944 and never returned to the camp, though he eventually rejoined his unit fighting outside Berlin in the final weeks of the war. Also weighing in Breyer's favor with the judges was his testimony that he refused to have the SS tattoo; he does not have such a mark today or evidence that one was removed. This undated file image shows the main gate of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz I Poland, which was liberated by the Russians in January 1945 . Thomas Walther, a former federal prosecutor with the special office that investigates Nazi war crimes in Germany, now represents family members of some of Breyer's alleged victims as co-plaintiffs in the case. He called for a speedy extradition. 'The German court has to find late justice for the crimes of Breyer and for the victims and their sons and daughters as co-plaintiffs,' Walther wrote. 'It is late, but not too late.' The investigation comes after years of failed U.S. efforts to have Breyer stripped of his American citizenship and deported. A court ruling in 2003 allowed him to stay in the United States, mainly on the grounds that he had joined the SS as a minor and could therefore not be held legally responsible for participation in it. His American citizenship stems from the fact his mother was born in the U.S.; she later moved to Europe, where Breyer was born. Victims of the Auschwitz death camp stand on the platform at Birkenau Station during World War 2 . During . Breyer's arrest on Tuesday, he asked the marshals to retrieve papers in . his home that document his right to stay in the U.S., Donnelly . testified. Breyer's wife and two grandsons . attended the hour-long hearing in Philadelphia. His . extradition hearing is scheduled for August 21. Efraim . Zuroff, the head Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in . Jerusalem, said he hoped there would be no obstacles to Breyer's . extradition and trial overseas. 'Germany . deserves credit for doing this - for extending and expanding their . efforts and, in a sense, making a final attempt to maximize the . prosecution of Holocaust perpetrators,' he said in a telephone interview . from Jerusalem. Experts . estimated in 2012 that at least 80 former camp guards or others who . would fall into the same category are likely still alive today, almost . 70 years after the end of the war. Heinrich Himmler carries out an inspection of the Monowitz-Buna plant at Auschwitz in July 1942 . By treaty, the U.S. can extradite its citizens to Germany. But Breyer said in 2012 that he would fight any attempts to take him away from the U.S. and his wife and family. 'I'm an American citizen, just as if I had been born here,' he said at the time. 'They can't deport me.'","U.S. authorities arrested Johann 'Hans' Breyer, a retired toolmaker in Philadelphia on Tuesday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ryan Gorman . A Minnesota doctor may have been shot and killed last week by a man he helped deliver 30 years ago because of a birth defect. Ted Hoffstrom, 30, may have blamed Dr Stephen Larson, 74, of Orono, for a birth defect which motivated him to shoot the doctor dead. Mr Hoffstrom's former classmates at the University of St Thomas told Fox Twin Cities that he had 'limitations with his hands' he blamed on the now dead doctor. 'Had limitations with his hands': Minnesota doctor Stephen Larson (left) may have been shot dead by Ted Hoffstrom (right), a man he helped deliver 30 years ago, because of a birth defect . The long-time Minneapolis obstetrician and gynecologist had assisted in the birth of Mr Hoffstrom in 1983, and the recently-graduated law student had expressed growing disenchantment with him. 'The suspect had recently expressed hostility to his family members regarding Dr. Larson,' Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek said last week during a press briefing. Officers declined to comment on any possible motive, and, as Fox pointed out, HIPA privacy laws would likely prohibit them from discussing Mr Hoffstrom's medical history. A former professor of Mr Hoffstrom's was in disbelief over the reported murder. 'This is inexplicable to me,' he told Fox. 'I do not understand this. This is not the student I knew.' It may have been a birth defect: Former classmates of Mr Hoffman said a birth defect may have led him to kill the beloved doctor . He did treat the suspect's mother: Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek said the doctor did assist in Mr Hoffman's treatment, but would not comment on any possible birth defects . A letter on the door of the home Mr Hoffstrom shared with his parents offered condolences to Dr Larson's family. Officers responded just before 9pm on Friday to a report of an armed man outside Larson's home on the 1000 block of Heritage Lane. Shots were fired during a confrontation and the suspect was killed outside the home, the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office said. Larson was killed before police arrived on the scene and his body was found inside the home, authorities said. Scroll down for video... Murder: Dr. Larson of Orono, Minnesota, was found dead inside his home Friday night . Crime scene: It is alleged that Larson went to the doctor's house and shot him. The suspect was then shot dead by police outside the home in Orono, Minnesota . The doctor was home alone at the time of the shooting as his wife was out of town, according to the ABC. During his 33-year career, colleagues at OBGYN Specialists in Edina and Burnsville estimated he delivered thousands of babies and won numerous awards. ‘There is no way there is anyone who would have any ill will towards him,’ said one of Larson's partners at OBGYN Specialists, Dr Suzin Cho. Good man: One of Larson's partners at OBGYN Specialists, Dr Suzin Cho said there was 'no way' anyone would have bad intentions towards the deceased doctor . The alleged killer’s family posted a note on the front door of their home Sunday, asking people to respect their privacy as they grieve for their son. The aspiring lawyer had recently passed the Minnesota bar exam, according to St. Paul Pioneer Press. His family said the shooting was shocking and out of character. ‘It is with great sadness that we extend our heartfelt prayers and sympathy to the family of Dr. Stephen Larson. Our hearts are broken for all of those affected by this tragic event,' said the note. ‘We are shocked and saddened by this news, and many questions remain unanswered. We hope that the public will understand this is a very difficult time for our family,' it continued.

"By . David Mccormack . An ex-Goldman Sachs hotshot trader is suing the investment bank after his 2010 bonus was almost $5 million less than he had told his mom he was going to get, it was revealed today. Deeb Amin Salem, 35, was less than impressed when he received an annual bonus of ‘just’ $8.25m instead of the $13m he had been bragging about. Salem ran a massively successful mortgage-trading desk at Goldman and claims he helped the bank earn more than $7 billion, according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration documents. Hotshot trader Deed Amin Salem is suing the new York-based investment bank after his 2010 bonus was almost $5 million less than he had told his mom he was going to get . ‘Let’s be very clear: I was one of the most sought-after investment professionals in the mortgage industry,’ Salem said during the February 25 hearing, reports Bloomberg News. ‘I had the opportunity throughout the course of my career and throughout - from that day, from almost every month that I was at Goldman, to leave for other opportunities.’ In 2009, the cocksure trader had received a $15 million bonus – out-earning even Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein. When 2010 proved another bumper earner for Salem’s desk, he was confident his bonus would reflect the success and he was shocked when it didn’t. Salem, pictured with his wife Lauren, told the FINRA arbitration that he believes his bonus was unfairly docked because of a written warning he had received about his 2007 self-evaluation . Salem told the arbitration that he believes his bonus was unfairly docked because of a written warning he had received about his 2007 self-evaluation. The trader gained some notoriety after the financial crisis because a U.S. Senate panel made the performance review public in 2011. In the review, Salem detailed what he described as Goldman’s plan to put a 'short squeeze' on the mortgage market. He also described himself as an expert trader and said he deserved to be promoted to managing director. 'I am as competitive as Michael Jordan,' Salem wrote. 'I don’t just want to win – I want to win every time and I want to steamroll the opposition.'

She identifies as a new breed of worker, the 'digital nomad,' someone who works exclusively online and is not fixed to one location. To date, she’s traveled to 66 countries - visiting 15 in 2013 alone - with her longest stay in Berlin for two months. She plans to tick off ten more destinations - including Japan, Sweden and Spain - this year. On the money front, she says she has about eight different revenue streams and spends anything from 20 hours to 60 hours a week working.

"Shedding excess pounds is not only good for your health, but losing weight can help people get a better night's sleep and feel more alert, new research has found. Obese adults who lose at least 5 per cent of their body weight slept better and longer after six months of weight loss, the study revealed. The findings, published at a joint meeting of the International Society of Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society in Chicago, found weight loss improved sleep quality and mood regardless of how those taking part lost the weight. A new study carried out by experts in the U.S. has found that people who lose five per cent of their body weight enjoy a better night's sleep and are more likely to be in a good mood . Lead researcher Nasreen Alfaris from the University of Pennsylvannia in Philidelphia said: 'This study confirms several studies reporting that weight loss is associated with increased sleep duration.' The study examined 390 obese men and women over the course of two years. Those taking part were randomly assigned to one of three weight loss programmes. One group received printed educational material during visits four times a year, another group were given brief lifestyle counseling while the final group were given the counseling in addition to meal replacements or weight loss medication. Researchers then looked at the changes in weight, sleep duration and quality, and a participant's mood after six and 24 months of treatment. They compared those who lost 5 per cent more of their original body weight with those who lost less than 5 per cent, taking into account age and sex. At six months those people in both . groups receiving lifestyle counseling lost more weight on average than . those who were just given the relevant information. Across . all three groups, those participants who lost at least 5 per cent of . their body weight at the six-month mark reported they gained an average . of 21.6 minutes of sleep a night, compared with 1.2 minutes for those . who lost less than 5 per cent body weight. Those who lost more weight also reported better sleep quality and mood. Dr . Alfaris added: 'Further studies are needed to examine the potential . effects of weight regain in diminishing the short-term improvements of . weight loss on sleep duration and sleep quality.'

It came after she pleaded guilty to three felony counts of . oral copulation of a minor and two felony counts of unlawful sexual . intercourse, according to a release from the Orange County District Attorney's Office.

Locked up: Michelle Johnson, 46, has been jailed for 270 days for having sex with a 17-year-old student . The former Brea Olinda High math teacher, who was named 'teacher of the year' in 2009, met the teenager at the school and 'groomed' him, the DA's office said. They went on to have a sexual relationship between April and June 2013. Their trysts took place both at school and outside school, according to the DA's office. At the time, the beloved teacher, who had worked at the school for eight years, also privately tutored several students off campus during non-school hours. Following her arrest at her Anaheim home, she posted $20,000 bond and was put on paid administrative leave from the high school as investigations continued.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Sometimes you just have to go. And for a passenger on a recent Air Labrador flight in Canada, that meant urinating in a takeaway coffee cup. Johanna . Tuglavina was on a flight from Hopefale to Nain . when she discovered that the plane didn't have a toilet. She then found that the bathrooms at the two airstrips her flight stopped at weren't working. Last resort: Johanna Tuglavina was forced to urinate in a takeaway coffee cup . Keen to relieve herself, she went outside to urinate before leaving Hopedale because the bathroom was out of order and when she asked to use the restroom during a stop in Natuashish, she also found that it was out of order. 'I said [to the pilot], 'Gee, boy, I'm going to have to use that empty Tim Hortons cup back there because I really gotta use the washroom,' and he had a little smile on his face and he said, ""Well, there's a little bag out there too if you need to use it,"" so I used both,' Tuglavina said. 'It was a choice between peeing in my pants, or peeing in a Tim Hortons cup,' she said. Out of order: Passengers have been taking desperate measures when airport and aeroplane toilets are out of action . This comes a week after a passenger urinated in a plastic bag on an Air Canada Express flight to Labrador. Liberal MHA Randy Edmunds told CBC: 'In this day and age, it's not necessary and I don't think it's that hard with the technology these days to go and assess the situation and install a system.' 'I think it takes a story like the one about the passenger on the plane ... a lot of people just take it for granted the toilets are going to freeze up, it's a common thing, but people are just starting to realize that, ""Hey, this is not good enough,""' he said. 'We should be able to have the same as everyone else in the province in their airports.'","Johanna Tuglavina found there was no toilet on board an internal flight .

"By . John Stevens . A coroner has today condemned the 'chaotic response' of an ambulance service after a baby girl died when an emergency vehicle got lost and a second stopped for petrol. Three-month-old Bella Hellings died at hospital after she suffered a fit and stopped breathing at her home in Thetford, Norfolk. Paramedics took 26 minutes - more than three times longer than national targets dictate - to arrive and Norfolk Coroner's Court William Armstrong today said the delay was 'wholly indefensible'. 'Wholly indefensible': The coroner criticised the 'catalogue of catastrophes' in reaching Bella Hellings (pictured). Her mother Amy (left) is considering launching legal action against the ambulance service . He concluded the baby girl died from congenital heart disease after delays in medical assistance reduced her chances of survival. The inquest at Norfolk Coroner's Court heard how an emergency first response car struggled to find the new build house because its satnav was not up-to-date and 'there were too many blue doors'. An ambulance also diverted to the house following the emergency call at 11.09am on 3 March was delayed because it was low on fuel and stopped at a petrol station. Controllers failed to tell the paramedics that an air ambulance had also been dispatched - if they had known they would not have needed to refuel. Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Armstrong criticised the delays. He said: 'By anyone's standard this was a grave emergency - what happened here was a long, long way from the eight minute response target. 'It is a fact that the prospect of a . child surviving a cardiac arrest are low. Notwithstanding that the . chance of resuscitation are improved if attempted immediately. Parental grief: Amy Carter wipes the tears of her partner Scott Hellings as they left Bella's inquest . Distraught: The couple said they 'will always believe in our hearts' that she was let down by the health service . 'The . delay in giving Bella the care that she needed was wholly indefensible. There was a catalogue of catastrophes and a chaotic response.' Mr . Armstrong described Bella as a 'star which will always shine' adding: . 'She will never grow up, she will never lose her innocence, she will . always be loved.' After the . inquest the East of England Ambulance Trust apologised for the delays . and said steps had been taken to avoid future tragedies. But Bella's parents, Amy Carter and Scott Hellings, said they were considering civil action against the trust. They . said: 'We will always believe in our hearts that Bella was let down by . the health services when she was at her most vulnerable and when she . needed help the most.' Paramedic . Sharon Jaggard, who was travelling in the ambulance, said that she and . her colleague, Karen King, had not been told an air ambulance was also . on its way. Under fire: The East of England Ambulance Service has apologised to the Hellings family for the delays . Because of the . mistake, they believed they would be required to take Bella to hospital . rather than simply administer care at the scene. She added: 'If we had known the air ambulance had been sent, we would have got straight to the property.' The . inquest heard that because of the problem with the trust's mapping . system, crews were regularly forced to 'zone' to nearby areas and use . local knowledge to find exact addresses. John . Martin, interim director of clinical quality at the East of England . Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'I would like to express my . condolences to the family. The trust's response to Bella was delayed for . a number of factors, primarily the difficulty in locating the address . due to it being a new build. 'As . a result, a number of specific measures have now been put in place, and . the trust has raised the problems of the delay in new buildings and . developments appearing on maps and sat nav systems on a national level. 'In . addition, the trust is recruiting more frontline staff and getting more . ambulances on the road in order to improve our service for patients.'","Bella Hellings died after an ambulance took 26 minutes to arrive .

"By . Sean Poulter . Fury: Business leaders lambasted Jeremy Hunt, pictured, yesterday for dismissing their reports that the Olympics had savaged takings . Business leaders lambasted Jeremy Hunt yesterday for dismissing their reports that the Olympics had savaged takings. The Culture Secretary said their claims were ‘absolute nonsense’ and many restaurants, attractions and stores were ‘quids in’. The assessment, which led to him being called an idiot, is at odds with evidence from the British Hospitality Association. It found takings were down by an average of 40 per cent at central London restaurants. Theatres, attractions and West End retailers, who have taken on extra staff and extended opening hours for an anticipated Olympics rush, also say they are suffering. The situation is so serious that the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, held an emergency summit with tourism and retail chiefs in a bid to encourage shoppers into the capital. And last night David Cameron also urged people to come back into London, which Olympic travel warnings have helped turn into something of a ghost town. Rejecting the complaints of traders, Mr Hunt, who is Olympics minister, had said: ‘Some West End businesses have done extremely well because they’ve marketed on the back of the Olympics. ‘Some businesses have taken a hit, others are doing very well, but overall there is a big increase in business in the East of London.’ Asked about a fall in trade, he replied: ‘This is absolute nonsense and we have just got to knock this on the head. Anyone who has a business anywhere in London is frankly quids in.’ But Ufi Ibrahim of the BHA said: ‘He is wrong. The evidence shows a very different picture. Assessment: The Culture Secretary said their claims were 'absolute nonsense' and many restaurants, attractions and stores were 'quids in'. He is pictured at an event yesterday with Prince Harry . ‘Our postcode research shows an average decline in takings of 40 per cent in central London restaurants compared with a year ago. One is down by 61 per cent. ‘The problem is that the authorities were making so much noise about fears of gridlock. People were told not to drive into London and to work from home. ‘As a result, restaurants are really struggling. Demand has been slack for six weeks at the same time costs are rising. All of a sudden, we see a 40 per cent fall in takings. This is serious.’ She said the real concern was that there was no guarantee things would bounce back. Where are they all? Madame Tussauds in London was struggling to pull in visitors yesterday, despite Jeremy Hunt's claims . Spokesman for the Restaurant Association, Richard Bradford, who runs Porters in Covent Garden, described the Culture Secretary as ‘an idiot’. ‘This is total rubbish. There has been a serious fall in trade,’ he said.‘They encouraged the British to stay out of London, which removed the regular trade we rely on.’ The BHA and other organisations were called in by Mr Johnson’s office on Wednesday. Warnings not to go into central London will be dropped. UK Inbound, which speaks for tour operators bringing foreigners to the UK, said people had stayed away because Transport for London exaggerated the chaos. The Prime Minister said: ‘The messaging we gave to people about making sure London traffic jams weren’t too bad was very important but now frankly we’ve shown the capital isn’t in meltdown. ‘People can start coming back into the capital to spend money in shops, restaurants and the rest. Bare: Theatres, attractions and West End retailers, who have taken on extra staff for an anticipated Olympics rush, also say they are suffering. This was the scene in the normally thriving Covent Garden earlier this week . ‘People, and news organisations, were predicting there would be a meltdown, traffic wouldn’t cope, we’d have an absolute disaster. That hasn’t happened. ‘I don’t think they were overblown. We’re holding an Olympic Games in one of the most thriving and busiest cities in the world. ‘We had a responsibility to work with the public to make sure traffic didn’t grind to a halt. We’ve delivered that. ‘Now we can say to people it’s working well, London’s open for business, come back.’ Bizarre: London's Oxford Street was extremely quiet this week . Westfield shopping centre at Stratford will turn away shoppers without Games tickets between 9.30am and 4pm today and tomorrow. The decision has been presented as an effort to counter overcrowding but it will also drive trade to other parts of London that have suffered during the Games. As many as four million people in London will work from home for at least some days during the Olympics, it is claimed. The figure – based on a study by O2 – demonstrates that the dire warnings of commuter gridlock have had a profound effect on work patterns. It also explains the many scenes of quiet trains and streets.","His assessment is at odds with evidence which found takings were down by an average of 40 per cent at .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Drivers in the UK are being short changed when it comes to motoring, with the country being named as the most expensive place on earth to run a car. Soaring costs of fuel, insurance, road tax and repair bills mean that it now costs British drivers £3,453 every year to run their vehicles. The cost of running an average family car in the UK costs £1,000 more than in the USA and . Australia, £1,825 than Japan and a staggering £2,000 more than in . China. Cost of motoring: Comparing the cost of fuel, insurance, road tax and MOT, on average it costs the British drivers £3,453 a year to run their vehicles, which is £1,000 more than in the USA and Australia . The survey, carried out by . Webuyanycar.com, compared the cost of motoring, including the price of . fuel, insurance, road tax and MOT in 21 countries on five . continents. And the study and revealed that on many fronts the UK motorist is paying . more than anyone else, with only those in the Netherlands and Switzerland coming close. Dutch drivers pay out £3,370.42, the Swiss  £3,321.80, although in China this figure is just £1,315.12 and in Saudi Arabia just £237.22. While many drivers regularly complain . about the cost of re-filling their cars at the fuel pumps, it would . appear they have some justification, with the bulk of the cost of . running a car stemming from petrol or diesel. Based on an annual mileage of 12,500, the average UK driver will spend £2,256 a year on fuel. It means we shell out an average of 27p for every mile. However, just across the channel in France it would cost £2,078. Comparison: How do drivers in the UK fare when it comes to the cost of running a car? And it is little wonder that the great American road trip conjures up such warm feelings when you consider the cost of fuel for a year in the States is a measly £990, which works out at around 8p a mile. In oil-rich Saudi Arabia, where fuel can cost as little as 7p per litre, a year of filling up the tank could cost as little as £129. British drivers are also being hit hard when it comes to road tax, with the survey calculating that the average cost in this country is £225 a year. This is seven times the amount paid by . drivers in Switzerland, Spain and Russia, while those in Canada, South . Africa and New Zealand do not have to fork out for road tax at all. There is some good news for British drivers however; recent falls in the cost of car insurance mean that the UK average premium of £667 is on a par with countries such as the USA and Canada plus European nations like Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. That also puts UK drivers well ahead of Switzerland where the average premium is a massive £1,200, although more than France, Spain and Australia where drivers pay less than £400 a year. In Australia the average cost of insurance £383, in Spain, £350, while in France the average is just £286. Other expenses include maintenance and . repairs, the cost of which has crept up as many modern cars are too . complicated for DIY mechanics to fix on their own. Road to ruin: These drivers on the M1 will pay an average of £2,256 per year for fuel, which works out at around 27p per mile . Expense: With petrol prices rising it is no surprise that the bulk of the cost of running a car comes from fuel . Richard Evans, head of technical services for webuyanycar.com, said: 'Most of us don’t stop to think how much each journey in the car actually costs and as the price of fuel, insurance, road tax and MOTs have all crept up in recent years, the total is now a massive outlay for the average household.' The new figures have prompted calls for Chancellor George Osborne to cut the cost of fuel duty in next month's Autumn Statement. The FairFuelUK campaign co-founder Howard Cox said many drivers end up spending an incredible 15 per cent of their income on fuel, with the Treasury taking 60per cent of what drivers put into their tax on duty and VAT. 'In a recent FairFuelUK poll of 25,000 . supporters, more than 87 per cent said that their cost of living is . worse when compared to 12 months ago because of the high cost of petrol . and diesel,' he told the Daily Express. Where your money goes: The cost of running a car for UK motorists . Rising prices: British drivers spend £2,356 a year on fuel . UK Motorists spend £2,256 a year on fuel - an average of 27p for every mile. Here's how it compares to the cost in other countries. France £2,078 . Japan £1,542 . Australia £1,445 . USA £990 .

"By . Damien Gayle . A new encrypted social network aims to entice web users put off Facebook and Google Plus by revelations of NSA spying and fears of lack of privacy. Syme encrypts all user content - including status updates, messages and photos - allowing only those invited to a user's group to see it. Even Syme's admins claim they are unable read the content uploaded to the site unless they, too, are invited to. Like Facebook, but private: Syme's interface is similar to established social networks but it uses encryption to ensure that only those people users want to see their content are able to access it . The new privacy-focused service comes in the wake of a string of revelations about the behind-the-scenes access the U.S. National Security Agency has to online services like Google and Facebook. Documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have outlined how the NSA's Prism programme gives officials access to material including online messages, live chats and file transfers. The reporting of the top secret information proved to be a public relations disaster for a range of high-profile tech firms as it claimed the programme was run with the assistance of the companies involved. The companies have all emphatically denied colluding with the NSA. Syme is the creation of three students from McGill University in Montreal, Canada - a world leader in privacy legislation - where the service is also hosted. Co-founder Jonathan Hershon, a . psychology student, told IDG News Service that their aim was to 'make . encryption accessible and easy to use for people who aren't geeks or . aren't hackers'. The social . network, which is appropriately named after a character in Orwell's . dystopian - and increasingly prescient - classic 1984, uses a two-step, . hybrid encryption system to scramble users' communications. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden: Documents he leaked revealed how spies are able to access users' online messages, live chats and file transfers . Users logging into the social network are presented with a list of groups, which look and work in way similar to Facebook pages, the Tech. Australia blog reports. But in Syme, the groups are in fact encrypted conversations between their members that are unreadable to anyone who has not been invited - a process which provides users with the decryption key. Although Syme is similar in appearance to both Google Plus and Facebook, in effect it functions more like WhatsApp, a leaner mobile app that functions like a social network but dispenses with profile pages to focus of messaging. Rather than logging on to a website users access Syme through a browser extension, which encrypts the content before it leaves their computer making it incomprehensible to anyone trying to spy on it. However, Syme's creators - none of whom are computer science majors - say their social network is not a foolproof answer to state-sponsored digital spying. It would be possible for content destined for Syme to be uncovered if, for example, spies were able to hack a user's computer. And while they claim to be unable to read the content posted to the site, Syme's admins admit that they do store metadata - information describing who the message is from and to, for example - which could be useful to those conduction surveillance. It also does not mask users' IP addresses - the unique identifiers for all computers connected to the internet - so interactions with Syme are far from anonymous even if users sign up with an pseudonymous email address. Syme is currently available as an extension for Google's Chrome browser, and versions are planned for Firefox and Safari as well as iOS and Android apps. Currently still in beta testing phase, Syme is free and you can sign up by visiting getsyme.com.","Canada-based Syme aims to make encryption accessible to 'non-geeks'

Sykes was left waiting half an hour after the massage ended, only to be informed that Cara had fallen asleep. In her article about the episode, Sykes writes: 'Cara finally appears, looking refreshed after her rest. “I’m so sorry!!!” she exclaims, collapsing into a chair. “I fall asleep everywhere! Someone recently asked if they could publish a book of pictures of me sleeping, because there are so many.” Cara’s personal assistant then informed Sykes that Cara wasn't hanging around or going to Hackney City Farm with her as they had planned and was instead off to do some film recording, followed by hair and make-up, a fitting for her Met ball outfit with Stella McCartney, a Fendi-store launch party, all rounded off by dinner with Karl Lagerfeld. Sykes goes on to explain that she then called photographer Tim Walker, who has worked with Cara many times, only to be told by him that on every shoot he's done with her, Cara's fallen asleep (even snoozing for seven whole hours on a Mulberry shoot.) Speaking out: Cara took to Twitter to explain to her 1.7m followers that the fashion industry 'is not the most understanding or compassionate' of industries . Sykes discovers that Cara had been out partying with Lily Allen the night before their meeting and later calls Cara to ask about her love of a good night out and her resulting reputation.

Most of the pictures people see of me are me going to work events: a Fendi dinner one night, a Prada dinner the next, and working all day.

When asked what she’d do if her daughter . wanted to become a model, she replied: ‘I’d say no, if that’s all she . aspired to.

From comparatively humble . beginnings as a fashion intern at Asos, she is now one of the world's . most successful, and sought after young models . Cara’s ascent began in the offices of . fashion website Asos in 2012, where she was ‘discovered’ by Burberry’s . Christopher Bailey while working as an intern. ‘As . a model, I really stand for not being a model, if that makes sense,’ she said.  ‘When I started, the whole idea of the model was very . different, it was a bit stuck-up.

"By . Hugo Gye . and Peter Allen . and Anthony Bond . Horrific pictures today revealed the scale of the ongoing slaughter in Syria after government troops regained control of a strategic border town from rebel fighters. The graphic images purported to show the corpses of rebels killed during the three-week battle over the town of Qusair, which was captured by Bashar Al Assad's forces today. The news comes as a British official insisted there is a 'growing body of persuasive evidence' that the regime has been using chemical weapons against its rebel opponents. It is believed that Assad's government has acquired such weapons, including the deadly nerve gas sarin, from foreign allies such as Russia and Iran. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Horror: This image purports to show rebel fighters killed by the Syrian army during the battle for control of Qusair . State television reported this . morning that Assad's troops, backed by the Islamist militia Hezbollah, . had seized control of Qusair from the rebels who had held it for more . than two years. The government claimed to have 'restored security and peace' and defeated 'terrorist networks' in the town. The . loss of Qusair is likely to come as a major blow to the rebels, as the . town was crucial to its ability to smuggle supplies into Syria from . Lebanon. Images . broadcast by state-run TV channels appeared to show the bodies of rebels . lying around the city, and reporters claimed that the fighting had . stopped after the government's declaration of victory. Slaughter: The images from Syrian state television depict the aftermath of the three-week stand-off . Grim: Another image claiming to show the body of a rebel fighter killed by government troops . Yesterday . officials from both France and the UK said that tests had proven the . use of chemical weapons as part of the country's civil war. Foreign . Minister Laurent Fabius said the presence of sarin was detected by . researchers in Paris, adding that it had been used 'several times', . including at least once by the regime. France, . which is pushing to arm rebels fighting Assad's army, said the use of . the gas was in breach of all international protocols. The British Foreign Office said that its own tests had independently confirmed the use of sarin and other chemical agents. A spokesman for David Cameron today . called on an independent United Nations investigation to establish the . 'full facts' about the use of chemical weapons in the conflict, and . urged Assad to co-operate with the inspectors appointed by UN secretary . general Ban Ki-moon. 'There is a growing body of . persuasive evidence that the regime has used and continues to use . chemical weapons, but there is a need, through the UN, to establish the . full facts,' he said. 'The room for doubt continues to . diminish, but we remain very much of the view that what we need is for . this independent UN investigation to get to the full facts.' The Prime Minister's spokesman . refused to confirm that the findings were a 'game-changer', but he . added: 'We have been very clear that President Assad has no future. Assad must go.' Battle: A Syrian soldier patrols the streets of Qusair, which was crucial for rebel access to Lebanon . Civil war: The battle for Qusair comes after Western officials revealed chemical weapons had been used . Syria began building its chemical weapons programme after a series of military defeats by Israel, its fierce regional rival which has a stockpile of nuclear arms. Because the Damascus regime did not have the technological capability to make its own nerve agents, it turned to allies abroad for help. Iran, Russia and Egypt are believed to be among the countries which provided assistance with Syria's chemical weapons facilities. The government also imported chemicals which can be used for both civilian and military purposes from European manufacturers. To reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers, Damascus set up an agency for military research which is said to be far more advanced than any other scientific facility in the country. Photographs have already been produced of victims including young children dying from the chemicals. Sarin is odourless, and so hard to detect, often leaving people with no idea that they were have been exposed to the gas. Worrying: The aftermath of an air strike in Qusair after the announcement about chemical weapons . Within a few minutes, victims experience runny nose, tightness in the chest, and pupil constriction. Then they have difficulty breathing, . get sick, and start to drool before they lose control of all their . bodily functions, begin twitching and ultimately suffocate in a series . of convulsive spasms. 'It is a horrendous death, and one . that the international community cannot allow,' said a foreign ministry . source in the French capital. Both Assad and the Syrian rebels have . accused each other of using chemical weapons, but this is the first . solid evidence of 'localised use', said Mr Fabius. Barack Obama has previously warned that if Assad's forces are found to have deployed chemical weapons, they will cross a 'red line' and trigger a more robust response from the U.S. government, which has so far been reluctant to become too involved in the civil war. March was the bloodiest month of the . conflict so far, with more than 6,000 people killed, including more than . 500 women and children. Some 70,000 people are thought to have . died since the uprising began in March 2011 as part of the Arab Spring . revolution across the Middle East and North Africa. Hundreds of . thousands more have been wounded, imprisoned and made homeless. Allegations: This image shows forces loyal to Assad during an operation; they are accused of using sarin . Sarin was first developed in Nazi Germany in 1938 by two scientists who were trying to create a stronger pesticide. When its potential for chemical . warfare was realised during the Second World War, the Germans started . mass-producing it, but it was never used. NATO listed sarin as a standard . chemical weapon in the 1950s, but it was not used properly until 1988 . when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein used it to wipe out some 5000 people . in the Kurdish city of Haljaba, in northern Iraq. They all died over the course of two days when some 20 aircraft dropped the chemicals on the town. Sarin gas was also said to have been . used during the Gulf War in 2004, with the west using it as evidence of . the banned weapons of mass destruction the American and British . governments claimed Iraq possessed. Mr Fabius said: 'These tests show the . presence of sarin in various samples in our possession. France is . certain that sarin gas was used several times in Syria in limited . areas.' Mr Fabius said that the test results . had been handed to the United Nations because chemical weapons are . banned by international law. It came as a UN report stated that . there were 'reasonable grounds' to suggest that chemical weapons were . being used in Syria. Mr Fabius would not state whether the Sarin had . been used by the Syrian Army, or by the rebels.","Government troops regain control of strategic border town of Qusair .

"By . James  Nye . Caught in the act: This is Julio Mario Galeano, 31, - who has been identified by police in East Hampton as the officer caughter having sex with a meter maid inside an exclusive property in the town . The mother of the East Hampton police officer caught having sex with a meter maid inside a luxury village cottage has defended her 31-year-old son - calling him a 'good boy' who still lives at home with her. Authorities in the exclusive Hamptons vacation spot identified Julio Mario Galeano as the local cop facing disciplinary action and potential criminal charges for trespassing the property to conduct a tryst with the part-time traffic control officer. Galeano has had his badge and gun confiscated after three guests arrived at the home of Manhattan designer J. Arthur Dunnam on December 30 to find the East Hampton officer and the 20-year-old woman according to police called to the property. It is alleged that Jennifer Rosa, the part-time traffic cop had access to the house because she was also a part-time cleaner for Dunnam. However, while they are currently under investigation for trespassing, Dunnam has yet to file any charges according to a press release from the police put out on Friday and seen by the New York Post. His mother understandably said her son was not a bad egg and that he still lives with her around one mile from East Hampton police headquarters. Galeano immigrated with her mother to the United States from Colombia at the age of 12 and is East Hampton's only Hispanic cop. Scene: Shocked cops in tiny East Hampton Village caught two people having sex down the road from police headquarters in this house on the morning of December 30 . In fact he was named 2012 'Officer of the Year' after he heroically caught a man having sex with an underage girl after he saw a van rocking while he was parked. 'It’s a good job and a great way to help the community,' he told the East Hampton Patch Web site, adding that he hoped to serve 'as a role model.' Galeano is currently in Colombia and is due to return on Sunday. The maid was fired by the East Hampton police board on Friday and was identified by Patch as Jennifer Rosa, but efforts to reach her were unsuccessful. Police have confirmed are investigating the 'trespassing incident' on December 30 at the home in Talmage Lane, which is owned by Arthur Dunnam of design firm Jed Johnson Associates. The pair were allegedly caught when three guests arrived at the home from Georgia, having been invited by Dunnam to spend New Years weekend at his place. What do you mean there's two people in my house?: Police called Arthur Dunnam, 55, house owner and Manhattan interior decorate, and he told them not to press charges and not to use his name . The three startled visitors quietly left and called in a trespass complaint to police. The police that responded were said to be startled by who they found. 'Upon arrival, they located two suspects inside the residence that were not authorized to be there,' the East Hampton Village Police incident report said. Police called Dunnam, who said he did not wish to press charges. He did confirm the authorities that no one, other than the guests, were meant to be in the house. The cops are being investigated for trespassing in the home for a 'sexual encounter', the East Hampton Star reported. Sitting on a third of an acre, the two-story shingled cottage with bay windows and a semi-detached garage is secluded from the street by a substantial row of manicured privet. Dominy Lane, a dirt road by the police and firehouse complex on Cedar Street, leads nearly to the rear of the property.","East Hampton police officer Julio Mario Galeano, 31, has been identified as the man caught having sex during a trespassing incident at a luxury home in the town .

"By . Hugo Gye . Dozens of starlings have been found dead in the middle of a busy road in a bizarre incident which witnesses compared to The X-Files. Around 30 bird corpses appeared in the road outside Bolton on Sunday afternoon, prompting speculation as to the cause of the avian disaster. Locals reported hearing a loud bang shortly before the starlings were discovered, suggesting that they may have been hit by a truck while flying low over the road. Mass extinction: Dozens of starlings were found dead in the road outside Bolton this week . Mystery: It is not known how the starlings were killed all at the same time on Sunday afternoon . The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said that the birds - which usually travel in a tight flock - might have flown into a vehicle after becoming dazzled or confused. It is also possible that they were caught in a trail of toxic air, but the RSPB said that was less likely. A spokesman for the charity said: 'I have heard of a previous discovery of a group of dead starlings, and it was never really established how they got there. 'The most likely reason is that they confused and flew into something, or were dazzled. Or they may have been hit by a lorry at speed as they were cutting across the road. They do fly low enough for that.' Crash? One possibility is that the birds were hit by a lorry as they were flying low over the road . Starling (Sturnus vulgaris). Image shot 2006. Exact date unknown. One spring day in 2010, dozens of starlings started falling out of the sky and into the garden of nurse Jackie Wright in Coxley, Somerset. By the time she came home from work, there were 100 birds lying dead on the lawn after falling victim to a mystery ailment. Experts said that they had probably been startled by a bird of prey, prompting them to change direction suddenly. Craig Clarkson, who saw the birds shortly after the mass death, said he thought there could have been as many as 100 of them. 'A guy told us he had heard a loud bang and then found these birds outside,' he added. 'It was really weird, like something out of the X-Files.' Kayleigh Knott, who was visiting a friend in the area, said: 'I've heard of things like this happening elsewhere and they've never found an explanation. 'This is just so unusual and people need to know why this has happened.'","Locals baffled after 30 starlings are found lying dead in the road near Bolton .

"By . Wills Robinson . Governors in charge of the secondary school at the centre of the Trojan Horse scandal have been told they are not doing enough to combat extremism. The damning indictment of Park View Academy in Birmingham follows allegations that children are being taught lessons in holy war. A report set to be published by Ofsed next week has also accused the school of failing to warn its pupils about conservative ideals. Damning: Park View School in Birmingham has been condemned for not doing enough to combat extremism and will be condemned for not doing enough to protect pupils in a report set to be published next week . The school was previously rated as outstanding by the education watchdog, but will be downgraded to inadequate next week after a string of allegations condemning the way it is run. The publication, leaked to The Guardian, is set to be released on Monday and criticses the school of failing to train staff in anti-extremism. It is among six institutions in the area expected to be given the lowest possible rating next week when the findings of investigations into 21 Birmingham schools are published. One of the allegations is that external speakers, who are invited to run Islamic-themed assemblies, are not vetted properly. Another is that sex education classes are ineffective and do not do enough to tackle bullying. The report will recommend that the school's management must 'urgently improve systems for safeguarding students' through the use of the Home Office's anti-extremism policy, Prevent. Last night, it was revealed the school’s website describes how a . lesson is devoted to jihad under a section on ‘Living The Muslim Life’. Pupils study topics such as ‘what is a just war?’, ‘when can Muslims . take up arms?’ and ‘conditions of jihad’. Rules: Staff at the school have been accused of imposing strict policies on pupils such as segregated classrooms and strict dress codes . The Education Secretary, Michael Gove, will address the Commons on Monday – after Ofsted has released the results of its three-month probe. It follows an alleged row between Mr Gove and Theresa May following accusations the Home Office was not doing enough to combat extremism in schools. Last night, Governors at Saltley . School, another school embroiled in the plot, were accused of spending ‘substantial amounts . of money with no obvious benefit’ including on consultants and lawyers. In the report, they were also accused of paying private detectives to snoop on staff's private emails while other faculty members complained to inspectors they were ‘treated unequally because of their beliefs, religion or background.' Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, . will highlight a series of concerns about practices in some of the . schools, including unequal treatment of boys and girls, a narrow . curriculum that denies pupils a rounded education and governors intent . on changing the character of schools.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ryan Gorman . Authorities say a suburban Chicago teen confessed to stabbing her 11-year-old sister to death Tuesday morning because she is 'not thankful.' Dora Betancourt had as many as 40 stab wounds across her neck, chest and arms, as well as slashes to her face. Her 14-year-old sister reportedly shouted a separate reason at her for each stab wound. The teenage suspect initially claimed a Hispanic male had broken into their Mundelein, Illinois, home, but she allegedly confessed after police revealed they had found a strand of the killer's hair in the victim's hand. Scroll down for video . Brutally murdered: Authorities say Dora Betancourt's older sister confessed to her savage murder . Authorities told local media the older sister waited while young Dora slept before taking a kitchen knife and committing the grisly murder. The unidentified older sister stabbed and slashed the young girl in a frenzied attack, shouting a reason at her sister each time she plunged the knife into her body, police said. Stab wounds were found in the girl's neck, arms and torso, some of them defensive wounds. The Lake County Medical Examiner's Office told CBS Chicago 'the young girl's body had so many wounds they couldn't count them all... [and] were so deep they punctured her lung.' 'A struggle ensued,' Assistant State's Attorney Claudia Kasten told the courtroom, according to CBS Chicago. 'She kept stabbing.' The teen kept stabbing and slashing until Dora's body fell lifelessly off the bed and then called her mother claiming she had been woken by her . sister's screams, authorities said.

Cops said they discovered the girl's lifeless body in her room with the knife used in the attack still on the bed. The teenager continued to claim an intruder committed the crime until investigators told her they had recovered a strand of her hair on the victim's body, she then confessed to the crime, according to police. 'What could be so bad that she did something like that?' Neighbor Verona DeCosta told NBC Chicago. 'A 14-year-old doing that... that sounds demonic to me.' The . girls' mother wept during a Wednesday court hearing where prosecutors . claimed that the older girl had set her alarm early and made her attack . while her little sister was still in bed. 'With each stab wound, she said she was not thankful for what she had done,' Ms Kasten said, according to NBC Chicago. Shattered: The girls' devastated mother makes her way into court Wednesday for her teen daughter's murder trial hearing . The older girl told investigators she made dinner six times that week and that her sister made her mad after hitting her the night before, the Chicago Sun Times reported. Their mother was not home at the time of the attack, which happened just before 8:30 a.m. The girl wore gray prison scrubs, sat stone-faced during the hearing and left quickly when it was over, as her mother sat at the same table, but without looking at her, the Chicago Tribune reported. The sisters shared the same mother but have a different father. Neither the mother nor the daughter took their eyes off the judge for the duration of the hearing. 'There was evidence of trauma, and while multiple stab wounds were evident, I will defer to the coroner's office,' Mundelein police chief Eric Guenther told NBC Chicago. He added that officers had been called to the home before, 'but nothing pertains to an incident like this.' Authorities are currently mulling whether to charge the teen as an adult, reports said.

"By . Mark Prigg . A ‘baby’ star has been captured just before ‘birth’ by astronomers for the first time - a breakthrough being described as the potential 'holy grail' of stellar evolution. The discovery provides the missing link in understanding how giant gas clouds collapse to form fully fledged stars. The star’s swirling disk of dust and gas is the youngest still-forming planetary system yet found - and could provide vital clues as to how our own solar system formed. How a star is born: A young star pulls material from surroundings into rotating disk (right); . generating a huge flow of jets of material (left). Currently about one-fifth the mass of the Sun, the infant it is expected to pull in material from its surroundings to eventually match it. The . disk surrounding the young star contains at least enough ‘stuff’ to . make seven Jupiters - the largest planet in our solar system. The infant is just 300,000 years old at most - compared to the 4.6-billion-year age of our Sun and its planets - and is more than 450 light-years from Earth in the constellation Taurus. John Tobin, a Hubble Fellow student at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in West Virginia, said: 'It may be even younger, depending on how fast it accumulated mass in the past.' Currently about one-fifth the mass of the Sun, it is expected to pull in material from its surroundings to eventually match it. The disk surrounding the young star contains at least enough ‘stuff’ to make seven Jupiters - the largest planet in our solar system. Tobin, whose discovery is described in Nature, said: 'This very young object has all the elements of a solar system in the making.' Called L1527 IRS, the young star resides in a stellar nursery known as the Taurus Cloud and is one of the closest examples of the earliest stage of star formation. The astronomers used the state-of-the-art telescopes to detect both dust and carbon monoxide around the object. They were the first observers to conclusively show the young star is surrounded by a rotating disk of material and the first to be able to measure the mass of the protostar itself. By measuring radio waves coming from carbon monoxide in the disk they were able to show the rotation speed changes with the material’s distance from the star in the same fashion the orbital speeds of planets change with distance from the Sun. Hsin-Fang Chiang, a post-doctoral fellow at Illinois University, said this pattern called Keplerian rotation 'marks one of the first essential steps toward forming planets.' He said the disk is 'supported by its own rotation, will mediate the flow of material onto the protostar and allow the planet formation process to begin.' Tobin said: 'This is the youngest protostar found thus far to show that characteristic in a surrounding disk. 'In many ways, this system looks much like we think our own solar system looked when it was very young.' The measurements that revealed researchers had captured the 'birth' of a star, showing the dust disc (left), velocity inside it (middle) and rotation of the disc (right) Previous observations from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii suggested the presence of a large disk surrounding the protostar. This motivated the researchers to pursue high-resolution images confirming the presence of the disk and measuring its rotation. The astronomers have received approval to improve their understanding of L1527 IRS by making high-precision observations with the world’s most complex telescope system ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) nearing completion in the Chilean Andes. Tobin said: 'ALMA’s advanced capabilities will allow us to study more such objects at greater distances. 'With ALMA we will be able to learn more about how the disks form and how quickly the young stars grow to their full size and gain a much better understanding of how stars and their planetary systems begin their lives.' David Clarke, professor of astronomy at Saint Mary’s University in Nova Scotia, Canada, reviewed the study for the journal and said it could be the ‘holy grail’ of star evolution. He said: 'That nature has found a way to routinely bring together far-flung wisps of matter, condense it by 24 orders of magnitude, and form the nuclear engines responsible for illuminating the universe is at the same time astonishing and undeniable. 'Precisely what that mechanism is, however, is only now being understood by astronomers, and the paper by Tobin et al brings to bear a central and previously missing piece - the first detection and measurement of a truly embryonic star. 'Tobin and colleagues may not be the first to measure the mass of a protostar, but the protostar they have observed is by far the best example to date. 'With a mass 0.19 (10.04) that of the Sun its mass as a fraction of its surrounding envelope (0.2) is ten times smaller than the previous best example. 'Is L1527 IRS the holy grail of infrared astronomy and stellar evolution? That will be for historians of science to determine. In the meantime it is undoubtedly a major discovery and future studies of it will help to broaden our understanding of how stars form.'","The infant star is just 300,000 years old, and is more than 450 light years from Earth in the constellation Taurus .

Authorities investigating whether remains found washed up on a New York beach belong to missing autistic teenager Avonte Oquendo have also found a skull, according to reports. A decomposed torso, left arm, legs and a sneaker . were found on a northern Queens beach last Thursday and authorities said . the clothes were similar to those worn by the 14-year-old when he went . missing in October. Authorities told DNAinfo that searchers also found a head on Sunday and have now found most of the body. Ten teeth are missing, which could make it hard to identify the body through dental records. But Avonte's family said they fear foul play if the body is his - because it was wearing unfamiliar underwear. The family's lawyer, David Perecman, told the New York Post that he is concerned about the large Fruit of the Loom underwear found on the remains because Avonte didn't wear 'large' and wore only the Hanes brand. 'If it is him, what that indicates to me is that something happened,' Perecman said. 'Someone got a hold of him, moved him. I can't say they harmed him, but why would the underwear have gotten changed?' The . remains were taken to the Queens County Morgue to be positively . identified, and authorities are now awaiting the results of a DNA test. They could have an answer by Wednesday. A police source confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that the clothing matched what Avonte was wearing when he disappeared on October 4 from the Riverview School in Long Island City.

Hunt: An NYPD canine unit continues the search for human remains on Friday. Authorities said a DNA test this week will determine whether or not the remains belong to the missing teenager . Skeletal remains were found on a Queens beach on Thursday night and were removed by the medical examiner. There are fears that the body parts belong to missing teenager Avonte Oquendo . Perecman also confirmed the pant and shoes sizes match what the 14-year-old was wearing the day he went missing. The Oquendo family were notified by the NYPD and are awaiting further information. The remains were found at least nine miles from where the child was last seen. For months, the boy's family has . organized search parties to scour the city for him, placed missing . posters on the subway and in stores and raising a $95,000 reward. In . particular, subway tunnels were hunted as the teenager is fascinated . with the transit system. A recording of his mother's voice was even . played over tannoys in the hope of reaching the boy. The 14-year-old is particularly vulnerable because his type of autism leaves him unable to speak and in need of 24-hour care. There have been a few sightings of . teenage boys who closely resemble Avonte, raising the family's hopes - . but he remains missing.

"By . Martin Robinson . Notorious: Felix Dennis, with porn star Cathy Barry at a London party, spent $100million on 'sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll' and has died at 67 of throat cancer . Maverick publisher Felix Dennis, who said he spent $100million on 'sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll' in his riotous life, has died of throat cancer at 67. The businessman was one of the founders of 1960s counter-culture magazine Oz and was jailed for nine months after being found guilty of obscenity in 1971 before being cleared on appeal. He went on to make his £500million fortune through Dennis Publishing, the magazine stable behind Maxim and The Week and proudly admitted spending a huge chunk of his fortune on women and drugs. As a younger man he had a passion for 'five-in-a bed' romps with some of the '14 mistresses' kept on his company's payroll, as well as a crack cocaine habit that alone saw him squander £50million. He also described himself as a 'coked-up, overweight, cigarette- smoking, malt-whisky swilling idiot with too much money'. But after he was warned he faced 'a one way ticket to jail or the morgue' he gave up crack cocaine and became a poet. A statement released by his office today said: 'We are deeply saddened to announce that Felix Dennis passed away yesterday surrounded by his loved ones. After a long and painful battle with cancer, Felix died peacefully at his home in Dorsington, aged 67. 'Felix was a publishing legend, famed for his maverick and entrepreneurial style and, more lately, a successful and much-loved poet. He will be greatly missed. 'Thank you for the support and kindness of those who share our feelings for Felix, and we ask that you respect our privacy during our time of grief.' Dennis, who divided his time between homes in Warwickshire, London, New York, Connecticut and the Caribbean island of Mustique, claimed to have become rich by 'accident' and listed his other interests as 'planting trees, commissioning bronze sculpture, drinking French wine and avoiding business meetings'. Dennis's approach to life included spending an estimated $100 million on what he described as 'sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll' and becoming the first person to say c*** on British television. Fame: Mr Dennis, centre, with James Anderson, right, and Richard Neville, left, outside court at the obscenity trial of their magazine, Oz,  in 1971. Felix was jailed for nine months but then cleared on appeal . Outlandish: Mr Dennis was known for a love of swearing and listed his interests as 'planting trees and drinking wine' His foul-mouthed first came during an episode of The David Frost Programme which included a lengthy interview with a group of hippies. He later said his mother refused to speak to him for three years afterwards. Dennis grew up in the London suburbs and went to Harrow College of Art but left to play in a series of bands which flopped but served as his introduction to the capital's counter-culture. His involvement with Oz saw him stand trial charged with conspiracy to corrupt public morals after a special issue included a pornographic version of Rupert the Bear. Bon vivant:  The millionaire publisher and poet was forced to give up drugs because he faced 'jail or the morgue', he said . The trial was a sensation and make Dennis and his fellow defendants famous. They were defended by lawyer and novelist John Mortimer and eventually acquitted on appeal. The son of a part-time jazz pianist who ran a tobacconist's shop, his father abandoned the family when Dennis was barely two. For a time he, his mother and brother lived in his grandparents' tiny terrace house in Thames Ditton, not far from his birthplace in Kingston upon Thames in Surrey, a place with 'no electricity, no indoor lavatory or bathroom ... no electric light, but gas and candles'. In spite of this uncertain start, Dennis was determined to be rich. He admitted to being 'insolent, arrogant and frightening' in his pursuit of money, and in 1968 that led him to the door of Richard Neville and his fledgling magazine Oz. Then 21, Dennis started selling the magazine on the King's Road in West London, often with the help of pretty young girls in mini-skirts, and suddenly found himself making as much as £100 a day. 'Nobody I knew had ever earned £100 in a fortnight,' he said. But in 1971 came the obscenity trial, and with it notoriety and a prison sentence. After he was cleared he experimented with publishing comics, but that quickly gave way to selling posters and a magazine celebrating the martial-arts star Bruce Lee, which later became Kung Fu Monthly. Dennis and a friend also wrote a biography of Lee. Bruce Lee's sudden death in 1973 saw the magazine's circulation shoot up incredibly. It ran for nine years, was printed in 11 countries. By 1974 his company was making £5,000 a day - and he had £60,000 in the bank. Entrepreneur: Felix Dennis was brought up by a penniless single mother and went on to make £500million . High life: The man behind Maxim, pictured with Phil and Cathy Barrie and Felix Dennis,  proudly admitted spending a huge chunk of his fortune on women and drugs . Within two years he began producing magazines for personal computer users and bought the fledgling magazine Personal Computer Weekly. Just four years later, in 1982 - after selling his stable of IT magazines for 'a shed load of money', he was a multi-millionaire, at 35. Success went to his head. 'In a single decade I got through £50 million,' and described himself as a 'crack connoisseur' but after he was warned he faced a 'one way ticket to jail or the morgue' he gave up drugs. He said: 'It was probably the hardest thing I have ever done and I have been a far, far happier man ever since, and probably a nicer man'. After launching Maxim and making even more money he became a published poet following a life-threatening illness and embarked on a series of book tours and sponsored a prominent poetry prize. Controversy: Felix Dennis once said he pushed a man off a cliff before saying it was a 'load of hogwash' cooked up because he was 'drunk' Bon vivant Felix Dennis once said he killed a man by pushing him off the edge of a cliff only later to say he was 'completely drunk'when he made the claim. During a boozy lunch in 2008 he said the man, who he refused to name, was murdered by him 'about 25 years ago'. 'I killed him,' Mr Dennis told interviewer Ginny Dougary from The Times at his Warwickshire mansion, adding:  'That's all you need to know.' The victim had supposedly made the life of a woman Dennis knew 'a living misery... He beat her up, beat up her kids, wouldn't let her alone, kept on.' So the London-born Dennis, one of the 100 richest people in Britain, said he 'had a little meeting'' with the man. 'He hurt her and I told him to stop and he kept on,' the publisher of The Week, Maxim and Viz magazines went on. So what did he do? 'Pushed him over the edge of a cliff,' said Dennis. 'Don't matter where it was. He wouldn't let her alone. She told him to stop. I told him to stop. Many people told him to stop. Wouldn't stop.' When this tubby, belligerent man was asked by the interviewer: 'Does everyone know you've killed a man?' he replied: 'No, and they'll never find out, either.' 'Anybody who harms one of mine,' he went on, 'better know what they're doing. And they'd always be warned. I wouldn't attack anyone without reason. 'But if they keep harming one of mine, then I have no option,' he concluded, seemingly without a moment of remorse or contrition. Indeed, over the course of the five-hour interview, the flamboyant businessman repeated his admission. It was only the following day that Dennis sent Dougary an e-mail thanking her for an enjoyable afternoon but also suggesting that she, 'should forget one particular episode I recounted to you after the third or fourth bottle of wine in the conservatory'. He subsequently told Ms Dougary that the murder story had been 'a load of hogwash - I was drunk. I withdraw it unconditionally'. He later said he had been unwell and taking drugs which not have been mixed with alcohol and his spokesman said his story was untrue and 'absolutely ridiculous'. No victim was ever identified and now body found and .","Felix Dennis found fame after he was convicted of obscenity in 1971 .

Paul the octopus: Britta Osthaus was surprised to read that 'octopuses are intelligent because they have been found to be able to predict the winners of football matches during the World Cup' Dr Milliken said: ‘He probably meant aerosols, but then… maybe not.’ One topical blooper was entered by Verity Brack, information technology programme director at the University of Sheffield, after a student wrote that Google was ‘one of the two main suppositories of data in the world’. Meanwhile, Josephine Kelly, a lecturer in business and government at Aston University, was intrigued to read that the Coalition government had a ‘toff stance on tax avoidance’. She noted that the student actually meant to write ‘tuff’. There was also a new interpretation of London’s thriving social scene in the 18th century in a paper on the creation of the Spectator publication in 1711. Forgotten by history? Lecturer Alix Green was baffled to read that 'Hitler's role in the Second World War is often overlooked' ‘Within these coffeehouses, men from all different parts of the world could interfere with each other’, wrote a student in a paper marked by Andrew Rudd, lecturer in English literature at the University of Exeter. Modern history was equally troublesome for a first year at the University of Southampton. According to Suzanne Reimer, senior lecturer in geography, the student observed that ‘globalisation has led to a growing interconnectedness between small-scale people and larger-scale cities across the globe’. Britta Osthaus, senior lecturer in psychology at Canterbury Christ Church University, who teaches a course on the mental capacities of animals, was surprised to read that ‘octopuses are intelligent because they have been found to be able to predict the winners of football matches during the World Cup’. This was a reference to Paul the Octopus, the cephalopod that ‘predicted’ results in the 2010 tournament.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman has described the horrifying side effects she experienced after having black market butt injections. In ‘Buttloads of Pain’, a documentary produced by Vice, Oscarina Busse, 35, from Miami, Florida, admits that the illegal fillers made her skin crust, ‘peel like an onion,’ and droop. She was forced to undergo life-saving surgery that saw more than three pounds of rotted, rock-hard flesh removed from her derriere. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Forever changed: Oscarina Busse (pictured) received two butt-enhancing treatments that resulted in a near-death medical condition . Lethal behind: A majority of dancers at Miami's King of Diamonds strip club (including the one shown above) have received the same illegal injections that caused Oscarina Busse (not pictured above) serious medical issues . The hair salon owner had paid approximately $6,000 for her two augmenting treatments that cost nearly $70,000 to repair - with additional procedures still on the way. Ms Busse, a mother of one, chose the illegal injection rather than its legalized fat transfer or implant counterparts for its comparably cheaper cost ($3,000 versus up to $13,000 for the legal version) and short recovery time. The practice is becoming commonplace, even an epidemic, in Ms Busse’s native Miami - a location whose body-obsessed culture makes most women unhappy with their bodies, she says. ‘It wasn’t because I didn’t have it. I just wanted it to be better’ As a Dominican woman, Ms Busse says that she already had a curvy figure before the shots. ‘It wasn’t because I didn’t have it. I just wanted it to be better.’ she said of the reason behind receiving her butt enhancements. Ms Busse received her first round of shots in 2002 followed by another round in 2009, the latter of which turned out to be a nearly-fatal experience. Like many women, Ms Busse did not receive either treatment from a licensed medical professional. Instead, she received the injections at a ‘spa’ that she found through word-of-mouth. Under review: Dr Mendieta shows Vice a series of botched illegal butt-enhancing treatments which display symptoms similar to those experienced by Ms Busse . ‘I got the shots and six months later my butt turned purple, the product had eaten off my muscle, and my skin peeled like an onion,’ she said of her body’s reaction. According to Vice, those who receive illegal butt injections rarely know what substance is really being implanted into their bodies. The most typical materials used are mineral oil and non-medical-grade silicone, but there have been reports of Fix-A-Flat tire remedies or concrete being injected too. Some of the most notorious butt ‘doctors’ have even used Krazy Glue to help seal the syringe entry spot, to stop the caustic materials from leaking out, the film says. Ms Busse is not sure what caused her reaction, but it seems like hers occurred much sooner than the norm. Many women begin to experience something similar within five to ten years after their own procedures, as her plastic surgeon explained. Ms Busse kept her condition a secret for months before finally sharing her pain with a client, showing her the predicament in the privacy of a salon back room. Life-altering: Once symptoms such as these appear, it is nearly impossible for women to ever get back their natural butt . In an accompanying article, Vice writes, ‘her a** was rotting off.’ The client’s reaction prompted Ms Busse to seek out help. After consulting many doctors who would not treat her out of fear that she may eventually die anyway, Ms Busse found Dr Constantino Mendieta – a Miami-based plastic surgeon who specializes in butt surgeries. Dr Mendieta told Vice that while many women 'will turn to any measure' to achieve a more perfect butt, 'many of these patrients may die over time because of the injections that they are getting.'' Her savior: Plastic surgeon, Dr Medieta (pictured) helped piece Ms Busse back together and says that her case is one of the worst he has seen in his career . He says that the injections 'destroy' body tissue, and that receiving them is a 'lifetime event that you'll never be able to change back [completely].' By Ms Busse’s own accounts, Dr Mendieta saved her life. Her condition was one of the worst he had seen in his career, and required such extensive surgery that it was broken down into two rounds of procedures. 'I had to cut a great deal of flesh out with the silicone because it had impregnated her tissue,' he said of her first surgery. 'We pulled out a pound and a half of pure, rock-hard substance from each cheek,' he elaborated, of the $70,000 procedure. The silicone material allegedly used . in Ms Busse’s butt injections was first invented during the Second World . War as a transformer fluid. Prostitutes in Yokohama, Japan began to steal the solution from the docks of U.S. marine bases to inject it into their breasts. A trend began, landing inside the bodies of sex workers and First Ladies (like Nancy Reagan) alike. But in 1965, when it was discovered how silicone has a propensity to travel within the body, attach itself to organs, trigger strong autoimmune reactions, and potentially cause lethal septic shock, the solution was outlawed from medical use. It then became a strictly-underground pursuit, often favored by transsexuals, Vice says. Ms Busse is by no means the only woman to undergo illegal butt injections. In . its report, Vice visits a Miami strip club where it’s estimated that . 75 to 80per cent of the dancers have received such treatments. Worth the risk: Miami-based stripper, 'Seven', says that her injections are worth the risk because of the amount of money she now making because of them . While . these women’s backsides are culturally perceived as attractive thanks . to their treatments, it is likely that in five to ten years’ time they . could suffer a predicament similar to Ms Busse’s. But that risk is worthwhile, according to a dancer who goes by ‘Seven'. She said: 'I got my butt done on a Tuesday. I came back to work on a Friday and made triple the amount it cost in one night. My money went from regular stripper to superior stripper.' If Ms Busse’s surgeries are any indication, Seven should probably start saving, as Doctor Mendieta - one of Miami's few surgeons willing to repair the injections' destruction - does not come on the cheap.","Oscarina Busse had paid approximately $6,000 for her two augmenting treatments that cost nearly $70,000 to repair .

"By . Associated Press . A man under a deportation order for serving in a Nazi-controlled police force during World War II has died in Michigan at age 93 after years of denials that he shot at Jews. John Kalymon of Troy died at his suburban Detroit home on June 29. He had pneumonia, prostate cancer and dementia, son Alex Kalymon said. 'The last two years he had no idea about anything about his life,' the son said Wednesday. 'He was just struggling to live and his mind wasn't there.' Gone: John Kalymon of Troy, Michigan died at his home on June 29. He served in a Nazi-sponsored police force during World War II and allegedly shot dead one Jewish person. Pictured above in this 2009 file photo . A federal appeals court last year upheld a deportation order against Kalymon, but the U.S. couldn't find a country that would take him. In Munich, Germany, prosecutors this year filed an arrest warrant against him for being an accessory in war crimes. They planned to send a doctor to the U.S. to determine if Kalymon was fit to face trial, but the exam never happened. There is no dispute that Kalymon served in the Nazi-sponsored Ukrainian Auxiliary Police in Lviv, which was part of Poland at the time. He said he did nothing more than light guard duty and never shot Jews. 'I love this country because it's my country. I'm going to die here,' Kalymon, a retired auto engineer, told the AP during a tearful interview on his porch in 2009. 'They want to remove me, an old man. I never was arrested, pay my taxes. I don't know anyone as honest as me.' In 2007, after a civil trial, a federal judge in Detroit stripped Kalymon of his citizenship, saying his two years with the Ukrainian police resulted in the persecution of civilians. Kalymon was one of 10 suspected Nazis who were deported from the U.S., but never left because no other country could take them. Such is still the case for suspected Nazis Vladas Zajanckauskas (left), Theodor Szehinskyj and Jakiw Palij (right) The government produced a handwritten document in which 'Iv Kalymun' reported firing four shots, killing one Jew and injuring another. Kalymon admitted he spelled his last name both ways when he was a young man but said he did not go by 'Kalymun' when he was a Ukrainian officer. Alex Kalymon said his father didn't disclose his job as a police officer when he entered the U.S. after World War II because he feared he would be turned away. 'It would have meant going back to the Iron Curtain and a certain death,' the son said. John Kalymon had insisted that handwriting on documents used against him was forged and not his. His attorney, Elias Xenos, said Kalymon had no allegiance to Nazis. 'He was an 18 or 19-year-old boy caught in the crossfire of East versus West. He steadfastly denied committing any atrocities,' Xenos said. Kalymon was one of 10 suspected Nazis ordered to deport to the U.S., but never left the country. Only three of those men survive today. Vladas Zajanckauskas of Sutton, Massachusetts;Theodor Szehinskyj of West Chester, Pennsylvania; and Jakiw Palij in New York City are the remaining suspected Nazis still living in the country, in legal limbo. - Vladas Zajanckauskas, 97, remains in Massachusetts 11 years after authorities first began the denaturalization process. Zajanckauskas took part in the 'brutal liquidation' of the Warsaw Ghetto, according to authorities. - Theodor Szehinskyj, 89, remains in Pennsylvania nearly 14 years after DOJ began a case against him. Authorities say Szehinskyj was an armed guard at Nazi concentration camps in Germany and Poland, a claim he has denied. - Jakiw Palij, 89, remains in New York 11 years after the DOJ initiated a case against him and seven years after he exhausted appeals. Court records say Palij - born in a part of Poland that is now part of Ukraine - was an armed guard at an SS slave labor camp for Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland until at least the spring of 1943, and helped to keep prisoners from escaping.","John Kalymon of Troy, Michigan died at his home on June 29 .

"By . John Stevens . Updated: . 20:26 EST, 2 March 2012 . Tragedy: The death of Horatio Chapple could have been prevented, ruled Norwegian prosecutors . The parents of an Eton schoolboy mauled to death by a polar bear on an adventure holiday have launched a legal bid for the tour leaders to face criminal charges. Horatio Chapple, 17, was sleeping in a tent on a remote glacier near the Arctic Circle in August when the bear entered the tent, killing him and badly injuring four others. Norwegian authorities ruled his death was preventable but that leaders of the trip would not be prosecuted. His father David, a surgeon from Salisbury, Wiltshire, has now instructed lawyers in Oslo to try to get the prosecutors’ office in northern Norway to overturn the decision. Lars Erik Alfheim, deputy governor of Norway's Svalbard Archipelago, said: 'There are different measures that could have been taken that might have prevented the attack. 'But based on our investigation, it appears that they've done what was required of them. None of the measures were legally required under local laws governing tour operators.' Chapple's spinal surgeon father David, from Salisbury, is now appealing the decision not to prosecute to officials in Norway's far Northern Troms and Finnmark county. His son Horatio was part of the expedition organised by BSES to the island of Spitsbergen last August. The team had set up camp on the Von Postbreen glacier and were sleeping in five tents when the 39-stone bear struck. Aftermath: The bear that Mr Reid shot in the head as it attacked is dragged away . Off the hook: Guides Michael Reid (left) and Andy Ruck . (right) will not face criminal charges . Horatio was killed and four others were injured by the rampaging animal before team leader Michael Reid, 27, managed to shoot the animal in the head with a rifle. Students Patrick Flinders, 16, and Scott Smith, 17, who were sharing a tent with Horatio, were seriously injured in the attack. Autopsy: A pair of scientists examine the body of the polar bear that was shot dead after attacking Horatio Chapple . Reid and fellow leader Andy Ruck, 27, had faced charges of negligence after reports that the rifle fired only after several attempts and tripwires that triggered flares failed to go off. But Alfheim said the death was a result of 'a number of unfortunate circumstances'. He . said: 'Tripwire flares had been set up around the tent camp, and the . group had two signal pens and a rifle. The equipment had been tested . earlier, but the tripwire did not detonate when the bear entered the . camp. 'A leader tried to . fire a shot with the rifle, but did not succeed. When he managed to fire . the rifle, the bear had already killed the 17-year-old, and wounded . four others, amongst them himself. 'Technical studies have revealed that there were no malfunctions to the rifle, the cartridges or the tripwire flares. 'Instead, the accident was the result . of a number of unfortunate circumstances that lead us to conclude that . neither BSES nor any of the individuals involved should be charged with . criminal negligence.' An . earlier post-mortem examination on the dead bear found that several of . its teeth were 'very damaged', which would have caused the animal pain . and may have made it more aggressive. Edward . Watson, chairman of BSES, would not comment on the Governor's ruling . until the conclusion of its own inquiry into the incident, which is . being headed by Sir David Steel. But . he added: 'Those most closely affected, particularly the Chapple . family, remain uppermost in our thoughts at this especially difficult . time for them.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Third hand smoke, a sticky substance which stays on items in the home such as furniture and children's toys, may be more harmful to young people - research shows . Third hand smoke that clings to walls and furniture could pose a more serious health threat to young children than passive smoking, a new study warns. Researchers have found many of the 4,000 compounds in second hand smoke, which wafts through the air . as a cigarette is smoked, can linger indoors long after a cigarette is . stubbed out. These substances can react with indoor pollutants such as ozone and nitrous acid, creating . brand new compounds - some of which may be carcinogenic. One residue - known as 'noxious residue' - remains on virtually all surfaces, including toys and other items toddlers may put in their mouths. The substance - called NNA - sticks to human DNA and can cause uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of cancerous tumours. Dr Bo Hang, of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, found the residue NNA locks onto DNA to . form what is known as a 'bulky adduct' - which is a piece of DNA bound . to a cancer-causing chemical. Other large compounds that attach to DNA tend to cause genetic mutations. Dr Hang told an American Chemical Society meeting in Dallas: 'The best argument for instituting a ban on smoking indoors is actually third hand smoke.' The biggest potential health risk is for babies and toddlers. As they crawl and put their hands or toys in their mouths, they could touch, swallow or inhale compounds from third hand smoke. Their small size and early developmental stage make them more vulnerable than adults to the effects of environmental hazards. Although many public places prohibit smoking, Dr Hang said people can still smoke in most rental apartments and private residences, and smoking remains a huge public health issue. Children are at most risk from third hand smoke - which sticks to DNA and can cause cancerous tumours - as, due to their small size, are more vulnerable to effects of the substance . So far, the best way to get rid of third hand smoke is by removing affected items, such as sofas and carpeting, as well as sealing and repainting walls, and sometimes even replacing contaminated wallboard. Replacing furniture can be pricey, but Dr Hang said vacuuming and washing clothes, curtains and bedding can also help. However, just as it took years to establish the . cancer causing effects of first hand smoke, making the connection . between third hand smoke or NNA and cancer could take a long time. But . early research into its nature, exposure and health effects is . compelling enough a research consortium dedicated to investigating . third-hand smoke was formed in California in 2010. That helped fund Dr Hang's work on NNA induced DNA damage - which he said could eventually be used as biomarkers to identify people who have been exposed to third hand smoke.","Second-hand smoke reacts with indoor pollutants to create substance .

"By . Lydia Warren . Jerry Sandusky's adopted son will open up about the years of sexual abuse he endured at the hands of his pedophile father in an exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey. Matthew Sandusky's interview, which will air on OWN at 9pm on Thursday night, will be his first television since his father was convicted in 2012. 'At bedtime, his ritual began,' he says in a 30-second preview clip for the show. Ahead of the show's airing, OWN explained that Matthew would be sharing 'a deeply personal account of the grooming, methodical control and manipulation he faced as a child'. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Matthew Sandusky will detail his abuse at the hands of his father in an interview this week . Brave: He will speak to Oprah Winfrey, right, in his first television interview since the trial in 2012 . It adds that Matthew will respond 'to the accusations his adoptive mother, Dottie Sandusky, made on national television accusing him of lying and stealing from the family'. Sandusky, . who retired in June 30, 1999 as Penn State's defensive coordinator, was . convicted in 2012 of molesting 10 boys over 15 years, some in the . football team's showers on campus. The 70-year-old is now serving a 30- to 60-year state prison sentence. Matt Sandusky, one of six children adopted by Jerry and Dottie Sandusky, had been expected to be a defense witness for his father until the trial, when he told investigators that he also had been abused. His story first . became public when a secret tape of a 29-minute interview he did with police . during the middle of his father's trial was leaked to NBC. Pedophile: Jerry Sandusky, pictured in January 2013, was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison for his crimes . In the . tape, Matt said his father would enter his bedroom at night and 'blow . raspberries' on his stomach, then move his hand down his body, rubbing . up against his genitals. He said he would sometimes cower 'in a fetal position' in his bed trying to avoid his father. In total, he said he suffered seven years of molestation, between the ages of eight and 15, at the hands of his adoptive father. He initially denied there had been any abuse before speaking out. In an interview for a documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in January, he said that he felt 'betrayed' by the entire Sandusky family after he took the decision to speak out against his father. But he maintains that he refused to be a 'coward' and risked everything to turn against those who had adopted him from a deprived upbringing and brought him up in an affluent household. Last year he reached a settlement with Penn State and petitioned to legally change his . name, and that of his wife and four children. Hurtful: Matthew Sandusky said he felt betrayed by his adopted mother Dottie, right in 2011, after they failed to support him when he came forward with allegations about his father's abuse . The interview comes two weeks after Pennsylvania's attorney general released a review of the prosecution but found no evidence of political interference by then Governor Tom Corbett. The report, however, did reveal three years of 'inexplicable delays' to prosecute the former Penn State football coach on child abuse charges. The pedophile's home was not searched and the report notes that it took a full year, from March 2009 until March 2010, for the office to recommend charging Sandusky when 'Victim 1' came forward. It took more 18 months before Sandusky was arrested because the prosecutor's supervisors believed the testimony of one victim would be 'insufficient against a community icon like Sandusky'.

Vodka: One bottle didn't do the trick but two made the bull woozy enough to be caught by the farmer . But then one neighbouring farmer, Werner Dechant, came up with a plan after the bull wandered on to his farm. He tried to catch the animal with a rope while it was eating grain from a bucket first of all but the bull ran off whenever he got close to it. It was then he thought a bottle of vodka may slow the animal down enough to catch it. As he was happily eating grain from the farm, the farmer decided to spike it with vodka. He was too worried about the bull's health to try a tranquiliser but thought by pouring a bottle of vodka in with the food it would knock it out. When one bottle didn't have enough of an effect, Mr Dechant tried again a few nights later but this time poured two whole bottles in with the grain. After the bull became woozy, he looped a rope around its neck and managed to get him into a barn.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A U.S. Marine veteran jailed in Mexico on weapons charges for allegedly bringing guns across the border had his first court appearance on Wednesday after spending more than three months in a Mexican jail and a Mexican judge ordered that he remain behind bars as his case works its way through the Mexican legal system. The lawyer for Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, told reporters that it is unfortunate that his client has to remain behind bars, but that he feels the case is moving in the right direction. Attorney Fernando Benitez, told reporters that irregularities - specifically the fact that his client was not given consular services after his arrest for nearly eight hours - is grounds for a dismissal of the charges. Mistake: Marine Andrew Tahmooressi says he mistakenly entered Mexico with guns in his car in March while trying to meet friends for dinner . Border: Tahmooressi says he accidentally entered the wrong lane at the border, and had no option other than to cross into Mexico and turn around . Jail: Tahmooressi has been jailed in Mexico since his March 31, arrest near Tijuana . Additionally, Benitez says, Tahmooressi was not provided access to an adequate translator. The young Marine was headed to dinner in San Ysidro . on March 31 when he mistakenly wound up at a border crossing point in . Tijuana and accidentally traveled into Mexico. At . the time, Tahmooressi had firearms in his truck - the weapons were . purchased legally in the U.S., but it is illegal to cross into Mexico . with guns. Tahmooressi maintains that he never intended to leave the country but missed an exit when heading to meet friends in a border town. 'I was going to call them after I drove off the exit, but I never got . off the exit, I blew right past it,' he told UTSanDiego.com in May during an . interview from jail. 'I wasn't paying attention, thinking I had way . farther to go. I ended up in Mexico with no way to turn around.' Mexican authorities found three guns inside the truck he had recently . driven from Florida to make a new start in San Diego. He was jailed, and has been held in a Mexican jail without bail ever since. Wednesday's hearing will be Tahmooressi's first opportunity to tell his story to a judge. The delay has been caused by both Mexico's glacially paced judicial system and Tahmooressi's indecision in picking an attorney. After firing two of his lawyers - one of whom reportedly instructed him to commit purjury - Tahmooressi has settled on Fernando Benitez, who tells Fox News that he plans to press the prosecution's witnesses until he gets honest answers. Pressure: Senator Marco Rubio is one of several members of Congress to support Tahmooressi as critics fault the Obama administration for not doing more to get him released . 'I hope they tell the truth, because if not, I'm gonna make them tell . the truth and it's not gonna be pretty,' Benetiz told the network prior to the hearing. Tahmooressi's case has garnered significant media attention, as critics have blamed the Obama Administration for not doing more to get him released over what he maintains was just an honest mistake. In April, Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter wrote a letter asking Secretary of State John Kerry to secure Tahmooressi's release. State Department officials said they were aware of an arrest of a U.S. citizen in Mexico, but they do not comment on arrests of private individuals without the person's permission. On Tuesday, Hunter and Nebraska Congressman Lee Terry sent a letter Mexican federal Judge Victor Octavio Luna Escobedo asking that he consider the fact that Tahmooressi's entry into Mexico was accidental. 'We believe the evidence supports Andrew's claim that he mistakenly . entered into Mexico,' wrote the congressmen. 'One of the most compelling . pieces of evidence is a 911 call Andrew made at the border checkpoint, . where he stated he was unaware of his location.' Prison: If convicted, Tahmooressi faces anywhere from six to 21 years in a Mexican prison . Similar cases have occurred before. In 2008, an active-duty Army soldier was jailed in Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, for driving into Mexico with guns, knives and ammunition. In 1999, a Marine was detained in Tijuana for two weeks after driving into Mexico with guns. If Tahmooressi is convicted, he faces six to 21 years in a Mexican prison, his lawyers said, adding that alternatively the case could be dropped if the Mexican attorney general's office in Mexico City requests dismissal. Tahmooressi served four years in the Marines, including two tours in Afghanistan. He says he was honorably discharged in November 2012. After he was jailed, Tahmooressi tried to escape by climbing over a gate and heading up onto a roof, and then onto another one. He gave up when a guard opened fire, but the incident earned him the nickname ""Spider-Man."" Soldier: Tahmooressi served two tours in Afghanistan while a sergeant in the Marine Corps. He later grabbed a light bulb and stabbed himself in the neck. He was taken to the hospital and given stiches. He said he longs for his family and friends and has been receiving visits from an English-speaking Christian chaplain. 'I put my faith in God that he will take care of me,' he said. 'It was just a big mistake, and I hope that the people here will realize that and that the judge will realize that.'","Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi has been held in a Mexican jail since March 31 .

She allegedly admitted to the officer that she was the mother of the baby girl and was able to provide her name, age and medical history. Relatives said that Dabbs, who was homeless after arriving in New York from North Carolina on July 2, had been plagued with troubles, including possible mental health issues and witnessing the killing of her baby's father during a home invasion just months ago.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . For 9-1-1 dispatchers, keeping your cool in chaotic situations is part of the job description. But a dispatcher in California took keeping her cool to a whole other level when she received an emergency call earlier this year that hit close to home. Britney Melchor received a call on May 27, about a baby who was choking. When the caller provided the address, Melchor quickly realized that it wasn't just any baby who was choking, it was her baby. The caller, she quickly learned, was her fiance, Robert Kimball, the father of the couple's 14-month-old son, Maverick. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Mommy-mode': Britney Melchor says she slipped into 'mommy-mode' briefly before realizing that she needed to remain calm to help her son . Culprit: Melchor's 14-month-old son, Maverick, was choking on a metal washer he must have found while playing in his room . 'I heard him say an address and I perked up and then I heard him say it . again and I recognized that as my own home address,' she tells WSBTV. Once it became clear that the person in need of assistance was her own child, Melchor says she only briefly panicked before doing what she is trained to do: remain calm. 'Mommy mode kind of hit - like, ""That's my son,'"" she told KCRA. 'I . panicked. But then I was like, ""You know what? I got to get him to the . help he absolutely needs.'"" Happy family: With Melchor's help, her fiance, Robert Kimball, managed to dislodge the washer from the baby's airway . Kimball says he was moving furniture around in the family's living room as his young son was playing in his bedroom. When he went to check on Maverick, he realized something was wrong. 'I tried to see what's going on and I realize he was choking,' Kimball . told KCRA. 'When I first found him, his face was kind of like a . pink-red. As it progressed and he started having more trouble breathing, . it got to a bright red and then he just went pale in face.' Maverick, it turned out, was choking on a metal washer - and Kimball was frantically trying to dislodge it from the child's airway as Melchor listened in agony. Cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce: Melchor knew that she needed to remain calm or her son could die . After a few terrifying moments, Kimball, a former orderly at a hospital, managed to dislodge the washer and his son began to breathe. 'I’m very protective of him,' Kimball said. 'And it definitely hit me – knowing that it happened as I was watching him.' Luckily, mom was just a phone call away.","Britney Melchor is a 9-1-1 dispatcher in Marysville, California .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Americans went into hibernation during the bitter polar vortex winter this year - and the U.S. economy slumbered along with them, dropping a stunning 2.9percent in the first quarter of 2014. The sharp drop from January through March is the biggest dip since the Great Recession shaved 5.4percent off the Gross Domestic Product five years ago. It is one of the biggest contractions outside of a recession is recent history. Economists believe most of the contraction was the result of a short-lived slowdown in spending due to an abnormally long and and harsh winter that disrupted shipping, shut down factories and kept consumers away from shopping malls and auto dealerships. The first-quarter contraction reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department was even more severe than the 1 percent annual decline it had estimated a month ago. Besides the harsh winter, much of the downward revision reflected a drop in health care spending. Another factor was a bigger trade deficit than initially estimated. Drop: The economy shrank by a stunning 2.9percent in January through March of this year - thanks largely to a terrible winter . Most analysts also foresee the economy expanding at a healthy rate of around 3 percent in the second half of this year. Reports on consumer spending, manufacturing and business investment have shown a solid rebound this spring. Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods excluding military hardware and for core capital goods, a proxy for business investment, rose strongly in May, a report Wednesday showed. 'We have ample evidence that the first quarter was just a temporary setback for the economy, and we are climbing out of the hole in the current quarter,' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial. Last quarter's 2.9 percent annual decline in economic activity, as measured by the gross domestic product, followed a 2.6 percent gain in the fourth quarter. It was the weakest showing since the economy shrank at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2009 in the midst of the Great Recession. Most of the downward revision from the government's previous estimate of a 1 percent annual decline reflected a change in the estimate of spending on health care. The government had previously estimated a strong gain in this category reflecting implantation of provisions of the Affordable Care Act. But data derived from an actual survey showed the government's estimate was far too optimistic. Health care spending, instead of rising at a 1 percent rate, had fallen in the first quarter at a 0.2 percent rate. A long, nasty winter kept many shopper home, shut down factories and derailed deliveries in the first quarter of 2014 . Analysts say solid hiring, growth in manufacturing and surging auto sales are contributing to a stronger economy. A stumbling housing recovery has been a concern. But even there, recent data on home sales and construction have been encouraging. 'The larger contraction in GDP in the first quarter is not a sign that the US is suffering from a fundamental slowdown,' said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. If economists are correct that annual growth will reach around 3 percent in the second half of the year, it would be a sharp improvement from the 2 percent annual pace of the first five years of this subpar economic recovery. 'We should have a much better second half this year and a much better 2015 than 2014,' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Zandi said he's forecasting growth of 3.5 percent to 4 percent in 2015. If he's correct, that would be the strongest year since the economy grew 3.8 percent in 2004. 'In past recoveries, we have always gotten a year of very strong growth,' Zandi said. 'I think we will get that in 2015,' helped by a long-awaited improvement in wage growth. Of course, the optimistic projections could prove too rosy. Analysts see risks to their forecasts, primarily the possibility that tensions in the Middle East could cause oil prices to surge given the deteriorating crisis in Iraq. Surging energy prices have preceded earlier economic slowdowns, including the most recent recession.","Most economists aren't worried about the dip and see it as a temporary contraction because of the harsh weather .

Scroll down for video . The eye of the storm: Astronaut Alexander Gerst has captured stunning images of Supertyphoon Neoguri from the International Space Station. The storm has sustained winds of 108mph per hour and gusts up to 154mph, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. Neoguri, which means 'raccoon dog' in Korean, was moving northward at 25 kilometers an hour (15 miles an hour) packing sustained winds of 126 kilometers an hour (78 miles an hours) by midday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The German spaceman took the pictures between 7-8 July. Describing one close-up image, he said: 'Scary. The sunlight is far from reaching down the abyss of Neoguri's 65 km-wide eye.' The storm is so big it could not even be captured in a single image  using the astronauts fisheye lens on the ISS. 'Supertyphoon Neoguri did not even fit into our fisheye lens view. I have never seen anything like this,' said Gerst. The powerful storm slammed through the southwestern Japanese island of Okinawa, leaving at least 28 people injured and 63,000 homes without power before swerving toward the bigger island of Kyushu on Wednesday. Astronaut Alexander Gerst has captured stunning images of Supertyphoon Neoguri from the International Space Station. The Okinawan government raised the injury toll to 28 from 17 the day before, two of them seriously. Separately, a man has already been reported missing from a fishing boat in rough seas off Kyushu to the north. Typhoon Neoguri, one of the biggest storms to hit during Japan's summer, appeared to be headed toward Kyushu, where it could land Thursday. Then it could travel across the main island of Honshu.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Most parents these days are no strangers to snapping endless photos of their newborns but we'd hazard a guess that they'd love a few more snaps of them sleeping - not least because we all know a sleeping baby can be a rare thing. And of course a sleeping baby can also be a very cute thing, as these adorable pictures show, especially within the first two weeks of their life when they are at their most teeny and delicate. Because tiny babies have much more soft cartilage in their bones at first, they are still comfortable curling themselves into comfy, and very heart-string-pulling positions to be photographed while they have a little snooze.

"By . David Kent . Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has urged his players and his country to move on from their devastating World Cup semi-final defeat to Germany. The recriminations of the 7-1 thrashing are still being debated but Scolari insists they have to focus on what is to come - starting with Saturday's third place play-off against Holland. His own future is even less uncertain as it seems likely the 65-year-old coach who oversaw his country's biggest defeat since their 1920 6-0 loss to Uruguay will lose his job after the tournament. The aftermath: Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari speaks during a press conference in Terosopolis on Wednesday . 'I know my career will be marked by this defeat but we have an obligation to move on, thinking about the next goal, which in this case is the match for third place in Brasilia,' he told a press conference. 'I know it's a much smaller dream than we all wanted but we have to honour the shirt of the national team. 'The tournament was not all bad. We had a bad defeat.' On his own future Scolari added: 'We (coaching staff) have a deal with the CBF (Brazilian Football Confederation) until the game on Saturday and after that, probably, we will have a conversation to sort some things out. 'After the World Cup we will submit a report to the board of the CBF where you will see the good and the bad that we did and then it depends on the direction. 'There is nothing going through my head right now. Number crunching: Scolari displays a piece of paper with some statistics at the press conference . 'I will continue with my life, the players will also continue to be winners and we must continue - you cannot end the life of the players for it. 'History will have to record that Brazil, for the first time since 2002, reached the semi-finals.' Scolari's assistant Carlos Alberto Parreira said this was now a time to re-examine Brazilian football after admitting Germany were far more advanced in all aspects of the game. Debrief: Scolari talks to his team on the pitch after they were thrashed 7-1 by Germany on Tuesday . 'They have numerous training centres for athletes, for coaches too, and the result was seen here,' said the former national team boss. 'German football is the perfect base and we now have a chance to rethink, revise and invest in better training of athletes.

"By . Associated Press . and Ted Thornhill . The wreck of a U.S. Air Force twin-engine plane that crashed into eastern Lake Ontario more than 60 years ago has been found in deep water off Oswego, a team of underwater explorers said Tuesday. The Beach Aircraft C-45 flew for miles on its own after its three-man crew and two civilian passengers bailed out when one of the engines failed during a flight over central New York in 1952. The aircraft flew on automatic pilot for more than an hour before it crashed into the lake several miles northwest of Oswego, on the lake's southern shore 35 miles north of Syracuse. Remarkable: This underwater photo provided by Roger Pawlowski shows the wreck of a U.S. Air Force C-45  that crashed into Lake Ontario in deep water off the coast of Oswego  more than 60 years ago . The C-45 flew for miles on its own after its three-man crew and two civilian passengers bailed out when one of the engines failed during a flight over central New York in 1952 . A trio of explorers from the Rochester area said they located the nearly intact plane in more than 150 feet of water while searching for historic shipwrecks on the lake's eastern end on June 27. One of the searchers, Jim Kennard, said the C-45 was on a routine flight on September 11, 1952, from Bedford, Massachusetts, to Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, New York, when the left engine began failing about 50 miles from its destination. As the plane started to lose altitude, the pilot believed it would soon crash and ordered the other two Air Force officers on board and the two civilians to parachute from the aircraft at 2,500 feet. Before bailing out, the pilot set the auto pilot on a course that would steer the plane clear of inhabited areas. All five landed safely. Sunken treasure: A trio of explorers from the Rochester area said they located the nearly intact plane in more than 150 feet of water . Sonar images show the plane's nose and vertical stabilizers are missing, but otherwise the aircraft remains mostly intact . Airborne: This 1948 photo provided by Beechcraft shows a C-45 plane in flight . The lightened plane gained altitude and changed course, heading out over open water. Witnesses reported seeing it crash into the lake about a mile off Oswego. Two days of searches by Coast Guard ships and Air Force planes turned up no sign of wreckage. Kennard said he, Roger Pawlowski and Roland Stevens were using side-scan sonar to survey the lake bottom when they discovered the plane wreck on June 27. Sonar images show the plane's nose and vertical stabilizers are missing, but otherwise the aircraft remains mostly intact. The team was surprised when the sonar found the wreck farther from shore than what the witnesses indicated, Kennard said. 'All of sudden, ""ho, what's that?"" he said. 'Then you see the sonar image of the plane, then you say ""wow""'. The wreck still belongs to the Air Force, which didn't have an immediate comment on the discovery.","The Beach Aircraft C-45 flew for miles on its own after those on board bailed .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . The locks are being removed from thousands of supermarket trolleys in a move designed to take the fuss out of shopping. The security devices became part of the everyday experience of supermarket shopping more than 20 years ago, amid a rise in thefts because of their scrap value. However, Morrisons believes that the introduction of sophisticated CCTV systems, coupled with barriers and bollards designed to stop them being taken off site can provide sufficient protection. Soon to be a thing of the past: Morrisons are removing the locks from 150,000 of their trolleys to make shopping easier and quicker for their customers . Easier shopping: Morrison stores like this one in west London will become trolley deposit free . Currently, customers need a £1 coin or token to operate the locks, before wrestling the trolley free and then do a tour of the store. However, company bosses say that people find them difficult and inconvenient to use, while many do not have the right change, which is enormously frustrating. The locks will come off 150,000 trolleys at some 279 mainstream outlets, however they will remain at some 228 sites - either in city centre sites which are a particular crime risk or sites in hilly locations where there is a danger they will roll away. The supermarket’s research found that 43per cent of customers find trolley locks inconvenient, while more than one in four – 27per cent - do not always have the right change. Dalton Philips, the Chief executive, said: ‘Our nation is getting busier. We have less free time than previous generations and customers have told us that they want a quicker shop. ‘The removal of trolley locks is just one of the many improvements we are making to our store – to make for a faster and easier shopping trip.’ Soon shoppers won't have to fiddle in their pockets for a £1 coin before they can do their shopping at Morrisons . A spokesman added: ‘We are putting our trust in the public and hoping people will not take them. Where trolleys are abandoned, we are asking customers to let us know so that we can collect them.’ Shoppers have been turning away from the big box outlets of all the major supermarkets because the idea of spending precious hours at the weekend touring the soul-less aisles has become too much of a chore. The move by Morrisons is part of a scheme to make it a more pleasant experience, which also includes extending opening hours, redesigning 277 outlets, refurbishing store cafés, lavatories and baby changing areas, and building new petrol stations. Other stores are making the own efforts to improve the appeal of the bigger superstores. Tesco, for example, has introduced outlets of the family restaurant chain Giraffe and the Harris + Hoole coffee shops. The trolleys are expensive to buy because they contain aluminium, which means they also have a good scrap value for thieves. Twenty years ago, around 100,000 trolleys were stolen from supermarkets across the UK every year, however the figure has fallen sharply following the introduction of locks and other security measures. Apart from the cost and inconvenience of constantly needing to replace the trolleys, which can cost more than £80 each, stores can also be prosecuted for allowing them to be abandoned. A few years ago, Tesco ran a trial which involved placing a spy chip in the trolleys which meant that if a customer tried to take them off site, the rear wheels would be triggered to automatically lock.","Supermarket believes that CCTV will prevent theft of trolleys, which cost around £80 each .

Jean Camurat says his former headmistress left his professional reputation in tatters following the incident at a ‘challenging’ secondary school. The language teacher, 59, told the High Court that discipline had broken down to the extent that he had to take out a restraining order against one threatening pupil. Jean Camurat who is suing Thurrock Borough Council following his dismissal from Aveley School in Essex . However, the court heard headteacher Teresa Walker opposed Mr Camurat’s ‘traditional’ methods and he was suspended, and his contract subsequently terminated, after taking a pupil’s phone. ‘It was alleged that I had assaulted a pupil in the course of confiscating a mobile telephone during a lesson,’ Mr Camurat told Judge Sir Colin Mackay. ‘The school had a clear policy on confiscating mobiles. I had repeatedly warned that the class should not use mobile phones during a lesson and that I would confiscate them. ‘I saw this particular pupil using her mobile and reached to confiscate it. I did pull the phone when she did not let go [but] the girl was not hurt. ‘I was suspended from work two weeks later. Teresa Walker told me she was going to recommend dismissal for gross misconduct,’ he said. Mrs Walker who Mr Camurat clashed with over teaching methods, and who he claims 'maliciously' provided false information about him to the police which prevented him from getting a new job . Mr Camurat claims that Mrs Walker later breached the compromise agreement signed when he left the school and gave false information to the police,  which made it ‘impossible’ for him to get another permanent teaching post. He is now suing Mrs Walker and the local authority, Thurrock Borough Council, claiming malicious falsehood, breach of contract, misrepresentation and negligence. He is seeking £250,000 in damages. Both Mrs Walker and the council deny the accusations, saying they acted entirely properly and were obliged, when asked, to pass information about Mr Camurat to the police before it made its way on to his Criminal Record Bureau file. Mr Camurat’s barrister, Ed Williams, told the judge that the information ‘would cause the reasonable reader to form the view that Mr Camurat should never work with children’. The teacher was said to have taken part in a tug of war over a book, which hit a pupil in the face after Mr Camurat let go. He was also accused of grabbing a girl’s arm to stop her from leaving class to watch a fight in the corridor. Mr Camurat denied wrongdoing in relation to any of the incidents, and has successfully applied to have his CRB record wiped clean of the disputed claims. He told the judge: ‘When I started in the post I had five years’ teaching experience, good references and an unblemished disciplinary record at my previous schools.’ Aveley School in Essex was put in special measures in 2004, the year after Mr Camurat joined as head of languages. ‘It was a tough school and I found aspects of behaviour-management challenging,’ he said. When he arrived, a ‘more old-fashioned’ head was in charge, with whom he had a good relationship – but Mr Camurat said Mrs Walker ‘favoured introducing new educational techniques’. After she became headmistress, staff split into ‘two factions’.  Mr Camurat told the court: ‘I spoke up in favour of a more traditional approach.’ Explaining her attitude to physical discipline, Mrs Walker told the judge: ‘Physical contact is best avoided. I explained that at no time is it appropriate to touch a child except in self-defence.’ She admitted there were a lot of disruptive pupils at the school during Mr Camurat’s tenure, but said Ormiston Park was ‘now considered to be a good school’. She said she had not seen eye-to-eye with Mr Camurat over teaching techniques but denied having a grudge against him. ‘I bear him no ill will,’ she stressed. Jonathan Auburn, for Mrs Walker and the council, defended their actions, saying: ‘Following a series of incidents involving physical interactions with children and later issues relating to other staff, Mr Camurat left under a compromise agreement. ‘After he left, Mrs Walker and the council and responded to a request for information from police by providing them with a document. The document, viewed as a whole, was broadly accurate.’ Judgment was reserved.","Jean Camurat had to take a restraining order out against one of his pupils .

"By . Eoin Murphy . and Daily Mail Reporter . A massive political row has erupted in Ireland after the country singer Garth Brooks pulled out of a massive comeback special in Dublin this month. The top-selling U.S. singer cancelled a sold-out run at Dublin's Croke Park stadium after city chiefs granted permission for just three out of the five planned gigs. Taoiseach Enda Kenny described Brooks decision to pull out as a 'shock to the system' that will damage Ireland's slow economic recovery. Comeback: Garth Brooks, who quit touring 13 years ago, has pulled out of a massive comeback gig in Croke Park stadium in Dublin after the council refused to give for permission for two of the five planned dates . The gigs were expected to draw 400,000 . fans to the Irish capital and pump millions into the local economy, . which was plunged into a deep recession by the 2008 financial crisis. Brooks, who turned his back on touring to raise his family in Oklahoma 13 years ago, had issued an all-or-nothing ultimatum last week, saying he would play the five nights or none at all. The star said to choose one show over another 'would be like asking to choose one child over another'. Mr Kenny said a feud over the gigs, which pitted Government ministers, tourism chiefs, business leaders and city representatives against each other, was 'very badly handled all round'. 'But there is a planning process in place, which is the law, and that planning process allowed for three concerts,' he added. He said the pull-out would cost Dublin's economy in the region of a quarter of a billion euros. 'It's a shock to the system in terms of the economy of this city and the reputation of our country and I do hope that these kind of issues can be more efficiently handled on the next occasion that they arise,' he said. The political fall-out comes as the Irish Daily Mail revealed that Brooks would not have made a cent playing just three Croke Park gigs. The country music legend decided to pump the profits from the first three concerts into a spectacular production to ensure his Irish fans would experience a once-in-a-lifetime sensation. And when he was told last week - just three weeks before the date of the first concert - that Dublin City Manager Owen Keegan had scrapped two of the dates, it was too late to alter the show's dynamics which had been tailored to suit Croke Park. 'Shock to the system': The gigs were expected to draw 400,000 fans to the Irish capital and pump millions into the local economy, which was plunged into a deep recession by the 2008 financial crisis . Last night, while Ticketmaster was preparing for the nightmare scenario of refunding the ticket price to 400,000 fans, Fianna Fáil was still hopeful that the Government would adopt its Bill in a bid to save all five gigs. And as the bodies involved in the fiasco exchanged accusations, a wellplaced source explained that playing three dates was simply not 'financially viable', for the musician. 'When Garth was told that there was going to be five dates, he decided to pump money into the production for the live shows,' said the source. 'Every cent that he would have made from the first three nights was ploughed straight into the staging, the lighting and the rigging. He had ordered graphics and custom-built screens. It was going to be a show of a lifetime and all 400,000 fans were going to see something special. 'This would have really put Ireland . and Garth Brooks on the map but sadly now that won't happen. He is not a . charity and for these gigs to have made money, he would have had to . play the five dates' 'This has nothing to do with greed for Garth. This has to do with a decision he made to put on a series of concerts that would have been unrivalled in the history of country music. 'This would have really put Ireland and Garth Brooks on the map but sadly now that won't happen. He is not a charity and for these gigs to have made money, he would have had to play the five dates.' Dublin City Council blocked two of the concerts last week because of an agreement between the stadium owners, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), and local residents about how many major music events can take place a year. The resulting row - which has dominated the national airwaves - prompted frantic efforts by Lord Mayor Christy Burke to relocate the two gigs, while State arbitrators attempted to negotiate compromises between all sides. During the fiasco a split emerged among residents. A solicitor for some lodged papers in the High Court demanding the remaining shows be cancelled while at the same time another group from the neighbourhood handed a petition to the city manager appealing for all five shows to go ahead. A crisis meeting of the city council on Tuesday heard claims Brooks was preparing to divert a ship containing equipment for the stage, which former junior minister Ciaran Cuffe said was akin to 'putting a gun' to the Lord Mayor's head. According to another well-placed source, Garth Brooks was going to use Croke Park as a benchmark for a world tour: no dates have been planned for this, although Brooks planned to hold an online press conference tomorrow. There had been widespread speculation it would be a platform for the announcement. But the sources said: 'He will not be announcing a tour on Thursday. I can tell you that Garth is devastated by this decision. The show he was about to unveil in Dublin would have made music history and now it will never see the light of day. 'This is not a show that can simply be moved to another location. There are no more dates and the rig won't fit another stadium. I won't say that Garth Brooks will never come back to Dublin, he loves Ireland and loves the hundreds of thousands of his fans that bought tickets and fought for the gigs to go ahead. But it will take a long time for the wounds to heal.' Show promoter Peter Aiken has already described the scale of the production that was being created by Brooks's design team in America. He said they were scheduled to start work on the massive production in Croke Park next Saturday, for the first gig on July 25. They were putting 22 truckloads of equipment into the Cusack Stand, 'with lighting and sound effects to create this one-off show'. He added: 'All the customised pieces of video equipment that he's bringing in, we can't strip that down and then move to another venue.' 'Croke Park needs and wants Garth': During the fiasco a split emerged among residents living near the site . Meanwhile, chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission Kieran Mulvey, who was brought in to hammer out a deal between those residents who opposed the concerts and Croke Park, has revealed that he had been extremely close to finding a solution when Dublin City Council announced it was only allowing three concerts. He said: 'I thought I had got close enough to it, in terms of addressing 99 per cent of the concerns of everybody, including the residents. There was a small group of people I felt no matter what you did, weren't going to be satisfied. Not welcome: Publican Paddy McGowan was among the locals furious that Dublin City Council has refused permission for two of the gigs . 'But then the Dublin City Manager made his decision and, despite all the efforts afterwards, the prospect of getting Garth Brooks to the country wasn't going to materialise.' He added: 'I don't know if we will ever see Garth Brooks performing in the country again. The artist himself, from what I understand, is personally very upset. Fans will be upset. Some people may take joy in the fact that he's not coming but I don't think the country does. I think it's a problem for the country in terms of how we are seen in the tourist market and the concert market, nobody wins.' The GAA has said it was not given any indication that a licence was likely to be refused for any of the five concerts. Representatives said, in a statement, they had engaged fully with council officials and addressed every issue presented during the planning process. 'At no stage were we given any indication that a licence was likely to be refused for any of the five concerts,' it said. The GAA made clear that it accepted Mr Mulvey's report. It added: 'The GAA is very encouraged by the emergence in recent days of groups of residents in the Croke Park area who share our wish for a positive continuing engagement with the Croke Park stadium; we look forward to working with them.' Dublin City Council said it was 'very disappointed' at the decision by Aiken Promotions not to proceed with the three Garth Brooks concerts that had been licensed for Croke Park. 'The City Council has sympathy for ticket holders who purchased tickets for the performances. Dublin City Council hopes that Aiken Promotions will reconsider its decision. Once again, we would like to reiterate that Dublin City Council granted a licence for three concerts.' But Louis Walsh told the Mail last night that nobody would be more upset than Peter Aiken that the shows have been scrapped. And he called on Taoiseach Enda Kenny to rescue the situation. 'I know Peter Aiken and he's one of the best promoters in the business, and respected worldwide,' he said. 'He's best friends with Garth Brooks, and his manager. I've never seen him so excited as when he booked these gigs. This was very personal to him and his family.' Ticketmaster said that it is working on a plan to make the ticket return process as simple as possible, and it will be outlined today. Last night Mr Aiken defended the singer for 'sticking by his principles'. 'It's the right decision. We are devastated, it was going to be the biggest musical event, there will never be another artist in my lifetime that's going to do 400,000 tickets and I don't know where the position is with Garth Brooks coming back to Ireland. There will be flak, you'll take flak, I'll take the flak but it's the right decision. He is devastated, he's down for millions in this deal, if it was any other artist maybe they'd say let's play the three and recoup some money.'","Enda Kenny says cancellation will cost Ireland a quarter of a billion euros .

"A hero soldier who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War contemplated desertion after becoming sick of the hell and horror of the Western Front, a recently discovered letter reveals. Lance Corporal John Thomas wrote a dispirited letter home to his brother and sister months after displaying incredible bravery that won him the highest military decoration for valour. The 31-year-old snuck off with another soldier to spy on a German position ahead of an enemy counter-attack. Lance Corporal John Thomas, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for his valour in World War One, considered deserting the army after witnessing his comrades being 'blown to bits' Despite his colleague being shot and killed, Lance Corporal Thomas carried on by himself and shot three snipers on the way. He spent an hour observing the enemy preparations and returned to provide vital information that gave the British the upper hand. But within months the inspiration that won him the VC had disappeared after witnessing dozens of comrades ‘blown to pieces’ by shelling. The letter penned by Corporal Thomas in 1918 describes the heavy losses his battalion suffered. He was among just 35 out of 950 who survived the horror . The shattered soldier told his siblings they had no idea of the terrible things the men endured in the trenches. Near to breaking point, he went on to write how he considered walking off towards the German lines to be taken prisoner just so the war would be over for him. The remarkably frank letter has surfaced nearly 100 years later after it was put up for sale at auction. Lance Corporal Thomas, of the North Staffordshire Regiment, penned the five page letter home in 1918 following a battle that decimated his 950 strong battalion to just 35 men. The North Staffordshire Battalion which fought in World War One . He said: ‘You people at home don’t realise the terrible things we have to go through. What, with liquid fire, boiling oil, gas, rifle and machine guns and shells bursting around us and blowing poor men to pieces. ‘I have just come out of action, after some very hard fighting. There was only 35 left out of 950 men. So I have been lucky to pull through. ‘It was terrible fighting. It’s as hard a fighting as I have seen. I am fighting for your safety and them children at home. Corporal Thomas writes to his family back home about wanting to 'forget the troubles' of the war . ‘I am not the same as some men out here who are fighting for their wives and family. ‘Can you tell me, why, I should be so loyal when I have no friends? ‘It’s just as easy for me to walk to the German lines and be taken prisoner and then, I should be sure of being out of the terrible ordeal of this warfare.’ Lance Corporal Thomas wrote about his hatred of the enemy, who he described as swine. He said: ‘The Huns are making their final blow to smash the British Army from the French. ‘But they will never manage it, if they couldn’t do it in 1914 when we only had a handfull (sic) of men, I am dam (sic) sure they can’t do it now. I’ll stake my life that this war is over within 6 months. ‘Two more pushes and then the Huns are beat. We simply cut them up in thousands although we have to loose men to do it, but he looses a dam (sic) sight more than we do. ‘So dear Brother and Sister...think of a lonely soldier out here fighting for civilisation and humanity, we have enough to do to fight the dirty hun, the lowest of the low. They are worse than swine.’ The letter was acquired direct from the Thomas family by a well-known autograph hunter called Bill Dean. After he died his collection went to the unnamed man who is now selling it. Soldiers occupying a German trench on the first day of the Battle of Cambrai during which Corporal Thomas fought and was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery . Richard Davie, of International Autograph Auctions, said: ‘Most letters I have read from soldiers fighting on the Western front convey a stiff-upper lip attitude. ‘But this letter is completely different in its tone. You sense that the author is near to the end of their tether having witnessed and endured such awful tragedies of war. ‘I guess that after three years of hard fighting he was entitled to feel that way. ‘Yet it was only a few months before that he showed such gallantry to risk his own life in order to give his side the upper hand in a battle. ‘It’s hard to believe that it is the same man in the letter.’Lance Corporal John Thomas survived the war and died in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in 1954 aged 67. The letter is being sold this Saturday at the Radisson Edwardian Hotel at Heathrow, London, with a pre-sale estimate of £600.","Lance Corporal John Thomas risked his life to get key battle information .

"By . Sean Poulter . Stringent: The tough line on punishing parents who take their children out of school during term time has been championed by Michael Gove . Parents are being turned into cheats, liars and criminals because they are taking children out of school during term time to try to cut the cost of a family holiday. More than one in three are risking fines and prosecution because they will not or cannot afford to pay the inflated holiday prices that kick in the day that the schools break-up. At the same time, some one in five of these parents are telling lies and trying to hide what they are doing by putting their child’s absence down to an invented illness. The vast majority of people breaking the rules -72 per cent – say the sole reason is because of the high cost of holidays during the official school summer break. The figures come from research by the Nationwide building society, which also found the current system means a family can expect to pay an extra £1,347 for a foreign break in Spain. This compares to the current penalty of £60 for an unauthorised absence which can be increased to £2,500 if the case ends up in the courts. The tough line on punishing parents who take children out of school has been championed by the Education Secretary, Michael Gove, who said they could not afford to miss lessons if they were to achieve the results expected. He has turned the screw on parents and schools by ending a policy that allowed schools to grant up to 10 days holiday a year to families in ‘special circumstances’. The policy has caused enormous anger among parents, while a London banker has recently lodged a legal test case to challenge the law. James Haymore was summonsed to court after he refused to pay a £120 fine for taking his children to America for six days at the start of the spring term for a memorial service for their great-grandfather. Mr Haymore, who works for JP Morgan, will argue that the decision to prosecute him for taking his three children out of school is a breach of the Human Rights Act. A spokesman for the Nationwide said: ‘Given the fact that the premium for a typical holiday in Spain for a family of four could be as much as £1,347 more during school holidays compared with term-time, it’s no wonder that parents are still tempted to face the ire of their children’s head teacher, plus the threat of a fine, in order to save some significant cash.’ It looked at the cost of a holiday for a family of four with two children aged seven and nine for the first week in July, which is in term time, versus the first week in August. The cost of the same one week holiday in Spain rose from £1,508 to £2,855, which is an increase of £1,347. The price of a holiday at CenterParc in Wiltshire rose by £860 to £2,448, while the figure for Disneyland Paris went up by £369 to £2,827. Price hike: A survey by Nationwide found that a holiday to Disneyland Paris for a family of four, with two children aged seven and nine, went from £369 in July to £2,827 in August . The research suggests that parents try to take children out of school at a time when it least affects their education. Some 57 per cent took them out at the end of term, compared with 18 per cent who chose the start of term and 17 per cent who went for a mid-term break. The vast majority of parents – 72per cent – said the sole reason for doing so was because of the cost. Some 62per cent of the children taken out of lessons were at primary school, compared to 32per cent at secondary school. Nationwide’s Director of Banking, Graham Pilkington, said: ‘People are used to tightening their belts now, so even though the economic recovery is well underway, families baulk at paying a premium for vacationing during school holidays. 'However, schools and local authorities are getting tougher on parents who take their children away during school time, with the threats of fines and even prosecution.’","One in five are telling lies by saying their child's absence is due to illness .

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . The report found that one in five workers, who took part in the research check their work emails more than ten times a day outside office hours . One in two managers do so much over-time in the office, typically unpaid, that it adds up to ‘at least’ one extra day per week, a survey revealed today. The report, from the Institute of Leadership and Management, lays bare the devastating impact on workers’ lives of Britain’s tradition of gruellingly long hours. When asked about their working week, 47 per cent said they do ‘at least one additional day of 7.5 hours’ per week and 13 per cent doing over 15 hours extra per week. Just one in eight workers said they feel they have ‘a good work/life balance’, with many complaining of rarely seeing their children, socialising with friends or enjoying their hobbies. Nearly 90 per cent of workers, who took part in the research, said they ‘regularly’ check their emails at night or over the weekends. One in five said they typically check their work emails ‘more than ten times per day outside of office hours.’ Charles Elvin, chief executive of the ILM, which did the research, said many workers are so addicted to their mobile phones that it leads to ‘some rather unhealthy behaviour.’ He said: ‘Smartphones are a fantastic enabler of flexible working, but we see here that they can also lead to some rather unhealthy behaviours. ‘These include the obsessive checking and sending of out-of-hour emails. ‘We all know how stressful it can be to receive an urgent late night email when you feel compelled to respond immediately.’ The poll, based on the views of 1,000 members of the ILM who are all managers, both junior and senior, revealed how people’s working lives dominate their day-to-day existence. Eight in ten ‘routinely’ work late in the office or at home, half ‘regularly work through their lunch break’ and over a third work over the weekend. Mr Elvin said: ‘When you add up all the skipped lunch breaks, early morning conference calls and after hours emails, you see just how widespread the extra hours culture is within UK business.’ Half of business managers say they regularly work through their lunch break and over a third say they work over the weekends . Yesterday Professor Cary Cooper, from Lancaster University Management School, said technology, such as mobile phones which also have an email facility, are ‘a curse’ in many ways. He said: ‘Technology means that people are so over-loaded electronically with emails and everything else. They are accessible seven days a week, 24 hours a day.’ Professor Cooper said millions of people work during their holidays, over their lunch breaks and on the train while they commute into the office. He said: ‘The hours that people are putting into work are astronomical.’ Mr Elvin added: ‘Excessive hours are not sustainable. There are only so many times you can burn the midnight oil before your performance, decision-making and well-begin begin to suffer.’ The Trades Union Congress said recently it calculates around 5.4million workers put in an estimated £640million of unpaid over-time every week. A typical worker does 7 hours and 48 minutes of unpaid over-time every week, it said.","Nearly half of all managers work an additional 7.5 hours a week unpaid .

Mountain climbers discovered the body of Patrice Hyvert, a trainee mountain guide, as they scaled the western side of the Aguille Verte mountain, part of the Mont Blanc massif. The 23-year-old was last seen alive on the morning of March 1, 1982, when he took off on a solitary climb up the range which straddles the French-Italian border.

Local police confirmed to newspaper Dauphine Libere and other media that the frozen body was that of the missing climber after finding his identity card still in his wallet. The discovery last Thursday came as a shock to Mr Hyvert's 82-year-old father, Gerard. 'I'm a mountain man, and I would have preferred him to stay up there,' he told RTL radio. 'He was better on a mountain than in a coffin. He was in his element.'

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Appeals against parking tickets on private land have soared 12-fold in just two years to more than 600 a week, an official watchdog has revealed. The Parking on Private Land Appeals service (POPLA) deals with contested tickets from car parks in places such as supermarkets, service stations and sports centres. The service assessed 23,500 appeals in the year ending March 2014, and decided to quash more than 10,000 tickets. People tended to complain after receiving an invalid ticket, or buying the right ticket but being accused of not properly displaying it on their windscreens . The British Parking Association welcomed the findings, but warned that motorists are still at the mercy of firms who are able to exploit legal loopholes to charge inflated prices for parking . However they upheld around 55 per cent of the tickets, rejecting a total of 12,839 appeal cases over the course of the year. POPLA was established in October 2012 to hear appeals against parking charge notices which have been issued on private land in England and Wales. The organisation mirrors the work of the Parking and Traffic Appeals Service, which hears complaints from motorists issued with parking penalties on public roads. POPLA’s 2014 annual report said there had been a ‘sudden growth’ in penalty charge notice appeals. It revealed that they are now dealing with more than 600 appeals a week – with a total of 25,214 registered in 2013-2014. The report said one of the main reasons people contested their parking tickets was when they felt that car park signs were ‘unclear, missing or confusing’. And people also tended to complain after receiving an invalid ticket, or buying the right ticket but being accused of not properly displaying it on their windscreens. POPLA spokesman Henry Michael Greenslade said: ‘Since my last report the number of cases being decided has grown substantially. The workload has increased some 12-fold. This sudden growth brought its own challenges.’ He added: ‘We are now receiving 600 or more appeals each week, and this number is currently increasing. ‘We are probably receiving as many appeals as, if not more, as the Road User Charging Appeals Tribunal, the England and Wales Traffic Penalty Tribunal, the Scottish Parking Appeals Service and the Northern Ireland Traffic Penalty Tribunal combined.’ The Parking on Private Land Appeals service deals with contested tickets from car parks in places such as supermarkets, service stations and sports centres . The AA said the boom in the number of appeals lodged with POPLA proved that parking regulations on private property had descended into a ‘lottery’. AA spokesman Paul Watters called for the Government to regulate the private parking industry, and said loopholes which allow ‘rogue’ firms to overcharge motorists should be dealt with. Speaking about the number of appeals that were rejected, he said: ‘It is a bit disappointing that 55 per cent were refused. Drivers will feel slightly grudging about that.’ He added: ‘Motorists still feel the lack of regulation means that it is a lottery. The Government needs to do more to regulate it. ‘Operators are going overboard on number plate recognition cameras and heavy-handed ticketing. I hope the appeal system is leading them to pull their socks up. The writing is on the wall for operators that blitz tickets.’ The British Parking Association welcomed the POPLA findings, but warned that motorists are still at the mercy of firms who are  able to exploit legal loopholes to charge inflated prices for parking.","Parking on Private Land Appeals service deals with contested tickets from car parks in supermarkets, service stations and sports centres .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Former Chancellor Alistair Darling warned the risks of independence are 'bigger' than the banking crash . Scottish independence would cause more damage to the UK than the banking crash in 2008, Alistair Darling has warned. The former Chancellor said the risks of Scotland going it alone ‘are colossal’ and there will be no going back. And he warned allegations that Alex Salmond’s pro-independence campaign is intimidating business from speaking out brings ‘shame on our country’. Voters in Scotland will decide whether Scotland should become an independent country in an historic referendum on September 18. With less than three months to go, the battle between the two camps has become increasingly bitter. Support for independence has remained flat, or fallen, despite Mr Salmond’s team stepping the push for breaking up the Union. In an interview with The Independent, Mr Darling said voters’ minds are starting to focus on the idea of Scotland leaking the UK, and they do not like it. ‘People can now see the finishing post,’ he said. ‘In 2012 and 2013, the referendum wasn't really real. It was like asking someone the day after a general election, how they would vote at the next election - it was a completely free hit.’ He said the ‘sheer magnitude of the decision’ is looming large in people's minds. ‘It's not like a general or Euro election, when you can vote for somebody else next time around. This is probably the biggest political decision they will ever take in their lives. ‘More and more people are saying the risks are colossal and there is no guarantee whatsoever that there would be anything to gain from it. That's why people are saying: 'I am not buying this'.’ Mr Darling, who was Chancellor in the Labour government when the banking crisis hit in 2008, said the ramifications of independence would be even greater. The UK taxpayer spent £66billion bailing out failing banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds. ‘Being told the world's largest bank has three hours before it collapses does provide a shock to the system,’ Mr Darling. ‘But the decision on Scotland is forever. It's irrevocable, irreversible. If we get it wrong, it will have a profound effect, not just on Scotland, but the rest of the UK. 'The stakes in the banking crisis were big; this is so much bigger.’ Voters in Scotland will decide whether Scotland should become an independent country in an historic referendum on September 18 . Tensions have been rising in the campaign over allegations the Scottish government has sought to silence business who support the Union. Five company bosses told the Channel 4 Dispatches show they were contacted by the Scottish Government and ‘felt pressurised to stay quiet about their views’, while the former chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association said SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson had tried to ‘neuter business comment’. Last week, Prime Minister David Cameron also accused the Nationalists of making ‘threats and warnings’ to businesses. Mr Darling added: ‘It is shining a light on Scotland that frankly brings shame on our country. When I first heard about it over two years ago, I did not believe it. Now people are speaking out because it is happening to so many people. ‘What worries me is that, if Scotland became independent, the same people doing these things would be in government. It strikes at the heart of the campaign and the conduct of public life. It should not be tolerated.’ Alex Salmond has been accused of trying to 'intimidate' one of Scotland's most senior industry leaders as the SNP 'bullying' scandal deepened last night. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, claimed the First Minister made a 'wholly unacceptable' attempt to silence him when he posed questions about independence. Mr Armstrong described a personal letter from Mr Salmond as an 'attempt to snarl hard enough at us to intimidate us from asking further questions'. First Minister Alex Salmond has faced claims his party has put pressure on businesses to speak out against independence . The accusation, which has been strenuously denied by the Scottish Government, comes after a TV documentary last night highlighted similar claims of threatening behaviour by ministers. Five company bosses told the Channel 4 Dispatches show they were contacted by the Scottish Government and 'felt pressurised to stay quiet about their views', while the former chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association said SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson had tried to 'neuter business comment'. Last week, Prime Minister David Cameron also accused the Nationalists of making 'threats and warnings' to businesses. Mr Armstrong wrote to Mr Salmond in May after the SNP leader used a speech in Belgium to suggest that foreign fishermen would be banned from an independent Scotland's waters unless European governments met his demands on EU membership. The head of Britain's diplomatic service has warned that Scots may have to pay for emergency help abroad ifthe country becomes independent. Simon Fraser, the top official at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said the scale of the UK's embassy network would dwarf the set-up for a separate Scotland. At present, UK consular staff around the world deal with hundreds of thousands of inquiries from members of thepublic every year. The cost of maintaining the global consular operation is largely met from a small charge added to the cost ofevery new British passport. But if there is a Yes vote, a Scottish passport will be created. Should Scotland become an EU member, European rules mean citizens would be entitled to assistance from any member state in a country where Scotland was unrepresented. However, the level of aid offered by EU countries varies and citizens of the country in question receive priority treatment. Mr Fraser, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said there could also be costs attached. He added: 'We have 216 consular posts in 144 countries. They offer assistance to all UK citizens. Last year, we helped 400,000 people. 'The Scottish Government is planning a network of 70-90 diplomatic posts, plus a network of honorary consuls. Where a country has any form of representation, including an honorary consul, it must look after its own citizens.' 'The alternative - the fishing fleets of 12 countries being denied any access to Scottish waters and as a consequence, their access to Norwegian waters... is clearly absurd,' Mr Salmond said at the time. On behalf of the country's fishermen, Mr Armstrong wrote to the First Minister: 'That would be contrary to the principle of innocent passage laid down in the law of the sea - will you explain what you meant by this?' Mr Salmond's response, which came to light yesterday, states: 'I thought such a ridiculous interpretation would be confined to [Scotland's only Tory MP] David Mundell... I find it astonishing that anyone else would follow this interpretation.' Mr Armstrong told the Scottish Daily Mail yesterday the response was 'unacceptably dismissive' and he added: 'This looks to me to be an attempt to intimidate.' He also told the BBC: 'Rough treatment doesn't bother me in the slightest but it just didn't answer the questions. 'It therefore seemed like something of a warning or something of an attempt at intimidation about asking questions, pursufeatured ing the questions that we asked or asking any further ones.' But a spokesman for Mr Salmond said: 'Mr Armstrong wrote to the First Minister, who responded with a detailed, factual letter on EU fishing rights. 'That letter has been in the public domain for weeks - nothing in it could remotely be described as intimidating and we urge people to read it for themselves to see that.' The row comes amid ongoing claims of intimidation, which heavily in the Dispatches programme. Gavin Hewitt, former chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said he or senior members of his staff met Angus Robertson on at least six occasions over the past two years. 'He was, I think, trying to neuter business comment,' Mr Hewitt told the programme. 'There was a genuine fear that if we were seen to scupper by coming out publicly against independence, there would be retribution down the track.' But Mr Robertson said last night: 'I totally refute the allegations, especially given that both Gavin Hewitt and his successor [David] Frost have both said to me they don't take a position on constitutional issues. 'Mr Hewitt publicly endorsed the case for a No vote last month, which he is perfectly entitled to do. What is a matter for me, and what I am very clear about, is that there is nothing in my conduct which answers to Mr Hewitt's description.'","Former Chancellor says risks are bigger than £66billion bank bailout .

"A man is fighting for his life in hospital after plunging from a hotel penthouse onto iron railings 60ft below. The 19-year-old barman at the hotel is said to have suffered 'horrendous injuries' after he fell from a roof terrace at Glasgow's Blythswood Square hotel early this morning. He was discovered bleeding and badly injured on the pavement below, near a foot long spike that had apparently broken off a row of metal railings on West George Street, Glasgow. Scroll down for video . Scene: An unnamed 19-year-old fell 60ft from the top of the Blythswood Square hotel onto railings below . The man is fighting for his life in hospital after suffering 'horrendous' injuries when he fell onto iron railings . Two metal railings appeared to be broken after the man was discovered with 'horrendous' injuries early today . Broken off: A section of metal railings outside the Glasgow hotel was clearly missing a black iron spike . The man was attending a private party on the rooftop terrace of the five star hotel's penthouse suite, which costs £1,500 per night, when the incident happened. Inspector Kenny Darroch, of Police Scotland, said: 'There was a small group who appeared to have been at a party in the penthouse and the man has fallen. 'He is now at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. He's alive but he has horrendous injuries.' A colleague who wished to remain anonymous said: 'I have been told that it was a barman working at the hotel. 'I think the party was hosted by a former head barman at the hotel who was coming back to spend all his money. 'It is an absolutely horrible thing to happen.' Police officers cordoned off Blythswood Square and stopped traffic for several hours while officers took photographs and statements at the scene. A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said: 'We got a call at 4.55am about a 35-year-old male lying in the street. 'There is suggestion that he's fallen off the roof. We've taken him to Glasgow Royal Infirmary.' Police Scotland detectives, who say they are not looking for anyone, inspect the pavement the man hit . Cordoned off scene: The man, who police say is in a 'serious condition' in hospital, has not yet been named . Hotel: The man had been at a party at the five star hotel and spa in an historic building in the city centre . A police officer at the scene, who asked not to be named, said: 'There is no investigation - we're not looking for anyone - but there's obviously protocol to follow.' Described as 'magnificent' on the Blythswood Square hotel website, the penthouse suite has a rooftop terrace, private bar and dining room with views over the city which 'will quite literally take your breath away'. Guests are treated to a bottle of Dom Perignon 2003 Epernay Champagne, on arrival and can enjoy a well-stocked complimentary mini bar. This morning, the hotel's managing director Hans Rissmann declined to comment on the incident. A spokeswoman for Police Scotland confirmed the man was in a 'serious' condition and said: 'Around 5am a report was received of a man having fallen from the roof of a building in the centre of Glasgow. 'We're still trying to piece together the circumstances.'","The 19-year-old man was at a party at Glasgow's Blythswood Square hotel .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Justice minister Simon Hughes said there is not 'right to be forgotten', only a right to request that information be deleted . There is no such thing as a right to ‘be forgotten’ online, the Government insisted today. Justice minister Simon Hughes argued that people do not have an ‘unfettered’ right to demand the removal of links to internet articles containing information about them. It follows a controversial ruling from the European Court of Justice that search engines like Google have to consider requests to wipe links to news stories. Mr Hughes likened the ruling to Communist China which has been criticised for 'closing down people's right to information'. The purge of search results applies to Google's local search pages covering the EU's 28 member nations and four other European countries, encompassing more than 500 million people. But users in Europe who switch to the firm's American domain, Google.com, will find unaltered search results. The 'right to be forgotten' is based on the premise that outdated information about people should be removed from the internet after a certain time. But after links to stories started disappearing, Google last week performed a u-turn began reinstating some of them. Mr Hughes told members of the House of Lords Home Affairs Committee that to suggest there is a right to be forgotten is not 'accurate or helpful. He added: 'Clearly in the modern world that we live in there are many challenges about how you balance data protection and freedom. ‘In many ways you could say we are at a crossroads and the very fact that this get to the European Court shows that. 'Under the present law individuals clearly do have the right to request deletion of their personal data where it is irrelevant, outdated or inappropriate. 'But it is also clear in the legislation that there will also sometimes be a public interest in retaining the information. 'There is no right given by the judgement for people to have there personal data deleted from the search engine results. There is no unfettered right. 'There is no right to be forgotten. Not in the law of the UK, not in directives, not in the judgements of the court.' He said it was 'unacceptable' for people to try to have criminal convictions deleted. He added: ‘We have criticised the government of China... for closing down people's right to information. There are other countries with strict information access. ‘It is not a good position for the EU to be in to look as if it is countenancing restrictions in the access of the citizen to access to information because it could be a very bad precedent.’ Earlier this month the BBC’s economics editor Robert Peston asked why he was being 'cast into oblivion' by Google after the BBC received an alert saying a 2007 blog about a chief executive leaving investment bank Merrill Lynch would no longer appear in Google searches in Europe. The company was accused of over-zealously tearing down links to webpages following demands from people claiming their so-called 'right to be forgotten'. But links to articles which had previously been deleted have now re-appeared on the website after public outcry at what many viewed as unacceptable censorship of the internet. Google is thought to have a backlog of more than 250,000 censorship requests to deal with . A MailOnline article about a Scottish referee found to have lied about his reasons for giving a penalty during a top flight football match was among those re-instated. The webpage had been among the first removed from Google after the new rules came into force. Head of communications Peter Barron said last week: 'We have to balance a whole range of things - free expression, privacy and the public's right to know. 'This is new territory for us all. We opposed the ruling. There's no right of appeal in the ECJ but we think it's important to have a public debate about this. This is a very, very important issue for the future of privacy, free expression and journalism.' Google is thought to have a backlog of more than 250,000 censorship requests to deal with and is deleting links purely because people did not want their comments on news stories to be viewed online. Mr Barron said: 'The European Court of Justice ruling was not something that we welcomed or wanted, but it is now the law in Europe and we are obliged to comply with that law.'","Controversial European court ruling gave people 'right to be forgotten'

"By . Julian Robinson . The youngest person in Britain to survive a liver transplant has just celebrated her third birthday. Lottie Bryon-Edmond, from Torquay in Devon, was just five weeks old when she had the groundbreaking surgery. And now, during national transplant week, the toddler’s parents have found an unusual way to commemorate the heart-wrenching 15 days that they waited for an organ. Lottie Bryon-Edmond, pictured left in 2011 shortly after being born, had a life-saving liver transplant at just five-weeks-old. She is pictured right playing in a garden ahead of her third birthday . For the last two weeks, hundreds of green stars have been popping up all over the family’s hometown of Torquay in Devon, leaving residents bewildered. Today, Lottie’s parents Chris, 50, and Julie, 43, lifted the lid on the mysterious appearances and urged local people to sign the organ donation register. Mr Bryon-Edmond said: 'The colour represents the ""I live I give"" organisation which supports organ donation and the stars are symbolic of organ donors and their families. 'A man in a green star suit went around sticking them on houses, businesses and the Torquay model village to get people talking before the big reveal. 'The interest has been surreal and people have been desperate to get the stars - despite not knowing what they were. Happier times: Julie Bryon-Edmond and Chris Bryon-Edmond are pictured with their daughter Lottie almost three years on from her liver transplant . 'Businesses and individuals have offered to pay for them and the desperation has been a real throwback to the 15 days we waited for Lottie’s liver transplant. 'It’s on a totally different scale but the fervour seems to be the same.' Within days the stars had generated thousands of interested followers and many theories. 'Some people thought it was to do with the Fringe festival and others thought it was to raise money for cancer,' said Mr Bryon-Edmond. 'Other people just think the star man is a loony and they are the ones that are closest to the truth.' But despite the couple's unusual methods for raising awareness, their message is a very serious one. Their daughter was given just hours to live after being born with toxic levels of iron in her liver and endured an eight-hour operation with a 50/50 chance of survival. Lottie Bryon-Edmond was given just hours to live after being born with toxic levels of iron in her liver. She is pictured right wearing a t-shirt with the charity logo, 'I Live, I Give' 'We used to go back to our room and be panic-stricken because we didn’t know whether the next day Lottie would be dead or whether someone would say we have a liver,' Mr Bryon-Edmond added. 'You go in the next day and the little child in the next bed is dead. You have life and death thrust at you in the most horrendous fashion. 'Three people die every day because there aren’t enough organs to go around. 'Lottie came within inches of death but from looking at her you would never know in a month of Wednesdays.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Flying into an airport is most people’s first glimpse of their holiday or business destination. After being inspired by these views as she travelled the world, art director Lauren O’Neill has collected satellite shots of global airports from London's Heathrow to New York's John F. Kennedy airport. The images reveal the complex beauty of these sprawling behemoths, and in the same way flights keep cities connected, the airports resemble connections in the human body - from muscles to nerves. Brooklyn-based art director Lauren O'Neill collected satellite shots of global airports after she was inspired by the 'systems of design at play' spotted as she travelled the world. The images reveal the complex beauty of these sprawling behemoths and as flights keep cities connected, the airports resemble connections in the human body. For example, this aerial shot of Zurich airport looks like muscles stretched over a skeleton . O’Neill wrote on her blog: ‘I’ve been fascinated by airports for as long as I can remember - there’s something about the comings and goings, the organisation and operation that’s so intriguing to me. ‘I’ve always lived in a direct flight pattern of an airport. Day-to-day, I glance out my window and watch planes circle about waiting to land.’ Among her collection is an aerial shot of Zurich airport. Its runways and buildings, interspersed with green patches, look like muscles stretched over a skeleton. The airport is divided in three, with Terminal A, B, and E connected to central building via an automated track, known as the Skymetro. Terminal A is used by domestic flights in the Schengen Area, Terminal E is entirely used by international flights. While Terminal B is designed to handle both Schengen and some non-Schengen flights, keeping the two sets of passenger flows separate. Elsewhere, the clinical look of Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport and planes, captured from above, resembles strips of veins and nerves. It is located seven miles (11 km) south of the central business district of Atlanta, Georgia and has been one of the world's busiest airports since 1998. Many of the one million flights that take off and land are domestic flights . The markings painted onto the runways of Wellington International Airport (pictured) resemble the lines drawn on cosmetic surgery patient's skin. Dotted white lines are cut through with solid yellow markings that show where planes park, turn around and take off from. Its close proximity to one of its car parks is visible in the top right-hand corner . Elsewhere, the clinical look of Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and planes, captured from above resembles strips of veins and nerves. It is located seven miles (11 km) south of the central business district of Atlanta, Georgia and has been one of the world's busiest airports since 1998. Many of the one million flights that take off and land are domestic flights, and Atlanta serves as a major hub for travel throughout the Southeastern U.S. It has 207 domestic and international gates served over seven terminals. The markings painted onto the runways of Wellington International Airport resemble the lines drawn on cosmetic surgery patients' skin. Dotted white lines are cut through with solid yellow markings that show where planes park, turn around and take off. Its close proximity to one of its car parks is visible in the top right-hand corner. Although many airports in the collection feature parallel and straight lines, Newark Liberty International Airport stands out because of its curved design. It straddles the municipal boundary between Newark and Elizabeth in New Jersey. As a result, the airport is owned by the city of Newark but operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . The Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport features a mixture of curves and straight lines and looks like a graphic created using a Spirograph. It is the main hub and maintenance base for the Iberia airline, which is responsible for more than 60 percent of Barajas' traffic. Following the death of former Spanish Prime Minister, Adolfo Suárez in March, Madrid-Barajas was renamed Aeropuerto Adolfo Suárez, Madrid-Barajas . Wellington has a reputation for rough and turbulent landings due to the channelling effect of Cook Strait creating strong and gusty winds. ‘During layovers, I often find myself observing the activity on the runway and thinking that I’d love to see this from above,’ continued O’Neill. ‘With a creative block on a project, I took to Google mapping airports and was enamoured by the beautiful satellite shots on my screen. Since then, wanderlust has often inspired me to get lost in the satellite imagery of various destinations even when I’m glued to my desk.’ Although many airports in the collection feature parallel and straight lines, Newark Liberty International Airport stands out because of its curved design. The sparse nature of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is revealed in one image, where the shape of the runway and the airport resembles an elephant and its trunk. It covers only 6.6 square miles (17 sq km) and has just two runways and three helipads . John F. Kennedy International Airport (pictured) was originally called Idlewild Airport after the golf course it was built on. It was designed to relieve LaGuardia Airport in Queens, which was crowded soon after opening in 1939. Over seventy airlines operate out of JFK and it is the base for JetBlue Airways . It straddles the municipal boundary between Newark and Elizabeth in New Jersey. As a result, the airport is owned by the city of Newark, but operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport features a mixture of curves and straight lines, and consequently looks like a graphic created using a Spirograph. It is the main hub and maintenance base for the Iberia airline, which is responsible for more than 60 percent of Barajas' traffic. Following the death of former Spanish Prime Minister, Adolfo Suárez in March, Madrid-Barajas was renamed Aeropuerto Adolfo Suárez, Madrid–Barajas. The sparse nature and stark contrast of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is revealed in one image, where the shape of the runway and the airport resembles an elephant and its trunk. It covers only 6.6 square miles (17 sq km) and has just two runways and three helipads. Aerial shots of Logan International Airport (pictured) make it look more like an intersection on a road, than an airport. Its parallel runways resemble arm and leg bones, and the airport is situated next to the port in Boston, Massachusetts . While many of the airports are a wash of oranges, blacks and greens, London Heathrow (pictured) looks almost clinical with its solid white and grey hues. The planes appear to camouflage into the runways, and even the terminal buildings are a discreet silver colour. The uniform positioning of the planes resemble teeth. Heathrow is the fifth busiest airport in the world, in terms of passenger traffic, handling more international passengers than any other airport around the globe . The airport is named after Captain John August Earl Bergstrom, an officer who served for the 19th Bombardment Group of the U.S. Air Force.

The planes appear to camouflage into the runways, and even the terminal buildings are a discreet silver colour. And the uniform positioning of the planes in O’Neill’s image resembles teeth. The shape of the terminals at Denver airport look like planes themselves, with long stretching buildings, resembling the wings, and centre foyers that look like the cockpit. At 54 square miles (139 sq km), it is the largest airport in the U.S by total area, and runway 16R/34L is the longest public use runway in the country . Heathrow is the busiest airport in the UK, and the fifth busiest airport in the world, in terms of passenger traffic, handling more international passengers than any other airport around the globe. It began in 1929 as a small airfield called Great West Aerodrome on land near the hamlet of Heathrow, from which the airport takes its name. Meanwhile, the shape of the terminals at Denver airport look like planes themselves, with long stretching buildings, resembling the wings, and centre foyers resembling cockpits. At 54 square miles (139 sq km), it is the largest airport in the U.S by total area, and its runway 16R/34L is the longest public use runway in the country. O’Neill continued: ‘I love the idea of circling above an airport waiting to land. I feel like that mirrors my process of searching for and cropping the right shot. 'Plus, I love the fact that a lot of the taxiway markings and linework are patterned across an airport’s tarmac.’ O’Neill is senior associate art director at Martha Stewart Weddings magazine, she has also freelanced as a graphic designer and taught graphic design to sophomores and juniors at Virginia Commonwealth University arts. O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg (pictured) is one of the darkest images in O'Neill's collection. It is also the only one to show clouds above the runways. The airport is one of the few in the world that has non-stop flights to six inhabited continents, others include Dubai International Airport, Abu Dhabi International Airport and Doha International Airport .","The images were taken from Google Maps by art director Lauren O’Neill for her blog Holding Pattern .

"By . Corey Charlton . More than 260 aircraft have been involved in 'near misses' in the skies above Britain in recent months, it can be revealed. Of these, 32 incidents involved airliners, including eight cases when both aircraft were commercial passenger planes. The 'scheduled passenger' flights included 'jumbo' jet B747s, Airbus A320s and a Boeing 737 - some of the most common planes used by holidaymakers. Details of the near misses have emerged following the terrifying near miss between two passenger planes at Barcelona Airport. 'Worst experience ever': The Boeing 767 comes into land at the airport as the Airbus taxis across the runway . The aircraft was forced to abort its landing after the first plane pulled out onto its landing tarmac . 'Go-around': The Boeing pilot is forced to pull up and go around the other plane crossing its landing runway . One of the 32 near misses fell into the most serious risk category - defined as 'aircraft proximity in which serious risk of collision has existed'. The 'A' rated near miss involved an Airbus A319 and powered hang-glider and happened just after 8.30am on July 18, last year around 2,000ft above London. When a 'near miss' is being assessed, investigators distinguish its seriousness based not on the distance between the two aircraft, but the level of risk involved. This judgement is made based on actual events - not on what could or could not have happened had the aircraft collided. There are five categories of descending seriousness. 1. Risk of Collision: Aircraft proximity where there has been a serious risk of collision. 2. Safety not assured: Aircraft proximity in which the aircraft may have been unsafe. 3. No risk of collision: Aircraft proximity in which there was no risk of collision. 4. Risk not determined: Aircraft proximity in which insufficient information was available to determine the risk, or there was inconclusive or conflicting evidence preventing a risk assessment. 5. Met the criteria for reporting but it was decided that normal procedures, safety standards and parameters were used. The figures can be revealed following video footage emerging of a near miss between two planes at Barcelona airport. The terrifying footage shows a plane pulling out to 'taxi' across a runway while another plane, still airborne, descends towards the tarmac. Footage shows the plane which had been cleared to land pulling off an emergency 'go-around procedure' to avoid what could have been a fatal collision. Near misses - known as Air Proximity Hazards or Airprox - are recorded in British airspace by the UK Airprox Board, a body funded by the Civil and Military aviation authorities. Analysis of its data reveals that between January 2013 and May this year, there were 262 Airprox. More than 80 of these incidents involved military aircraft, while at least five police helicopters had near misses. Other aircraft involved in Airprox over the period include private jets, cargo planes and gliders as well as some being used for training flights. Incidents have also been recorded by the board over the 17 months at altitudes of up to 34,000ft. An Airprox is a situation where a pilot or air traffic services deem the distance between aircraft, as well as their relative positions and speed, may have compromised their safety.","More than 260 aircraft involved in near misses above Britain in recent months, including passenger planes, military aircraft and helicopters .

"By . Chris  Brooke . Jailed: Family doctor Andrew Johnson, 61, was sentenced to 11 years and eight months in prison for sex offences against nine women . Family doctor Andrew Johnson was known for greeting attractive women patients with comments such as ‘eh up sexy’ and ‘hello gorgeous.’ In the privacy of his consulting room his remarks were even more inappropriate, telling one woman who was reluctant to undress ‘I’m a doctor and if I want to look at your boobs and bum I will do so’ and another ‘Oh very nice, you should keep wearing those sort of things’ when he noticed she was in stockings. But the GP’s over familiarity also crossed the boundaries into sexual assault, a court heard. Johnson squeezed the breasts of his patients and touched them inappropriately while carrying out examinations for his own sexual gratification, Sheffield Crown Court heard. A patient with tonsillitis was given a breast examination and another was given an internal check for a chest infection. Johnson, 61, was convicted of sex offences against nine women patients over a 28-year period and also admitted indecently assaulting the teenage daughter of a family friend away from his surgery. The father-of-three was jailed for a total of 11 years and eight months. Passing sentence Judge Simon Lawler told Johnson: ‘They trusted you as their doctor with their bodies. You breached that contract between doctor and patient in the worst possible way. ‘Your sexualised behaviour was something which no-one should have to endure in a consultation with their doctor.’ The judge said he left his victims in a state of shock and praised their courage in giving evidence against him. Johnson was found guilty of 14 offences of indecent assault and one of sexual assault in April. The case could not be reported for legal reasons until yesterday. His victims were aged between 16 and 46 and were assaulted in his surgeries at Bawtry, near Doncaster, and Blyth, near Worksop, between 1978 and 2006, when he stopped practising because a complaint was made. One of the women said she had not come forward until years later because ‘it was my word against his and I didn’t think anyone would believe me.’ The court heard Johnson was struck off ‘in disgrace’ by the General Medical Council in 2010. He began groping patients almost immediately after taking over the practice from his father. A 22-year-old woman claimed the GP gave her regular internal examinations although she was suffering from depression. He quizzed her about her sex life and suggested she buy a sex toy to relieve stress. Johnson told a 32-year-old woman with stomach pains that she should spice up her sex life by saying ‘no knickers on’ when her husband phoned. He also rubbed and stroked her bottom when he had no reason to, the court heard. A woman of 30 with chest pains was touched inappropriately and told: ‘I need to know if you orgasm.’ She later went back with sleeplessness and depression. He said she should take a less stressful job like a ‘checkout chick at Tesco.’ Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell, QC, said: ‘It seemed to her that Dr Johnson wanted her to take off her clothes a lot of the time.’ Attacks: Sheffield Crown Court heard Johnson would squeeze his patients' breasts and touched them inappropriately while carrying out examinations for his own sexual gratification in practices around Yorkshire . Another patient thought the doctor was ‘a bit of a pervert’ after he made a comment about her having a ‘very nice cervix.’ While a 46-year-old, who had a tan after returning from a holiday in the Seychelles, was touched as if he was ‘trying to stimulate her sexually.’ Johnson said he had no recollection of any of the consultations as they were so long ago and he had 3,000 patients. The GP admitted he could have touched the women’s private parts accidentally but ‘not as a deliberate act.’ In victim impact statements several of the women told how Johnson’s perverted behaviour had ruined their lives. One woman is now petrified if she has to sit next to men on planes. Another said: ‘He abused his position as a doctor. I placed my trust in him. He had access to me as a patient, not as a woman. 'He chose to abuse that trust which will stay with me for the rest of my life.’ A complainant groped as a teenager said Johnson was the first man ‘to place his hands on her in a sexual manner’ and she had ‘lost the right to choose who that person should be.’ Johnson was initially only jailed for five years but his sentence was increased to nine years by the Appeal Court because he had been treated too leniently. Yesterday the jail term was increased by a further 32 months after he admitted 12 indecent assaults on a girl aged between 14 and 16 at his home and a Christian Fellowship camp during the 1990s. After the hearing Detective Chief Inspector Steve Whittaker of South Yorkshire Police said: ‘These crimes are inexcusable. 'He abused his position as a doctor by taking advantage of the trust his patients had given him. In my opinion this is the ultimate betrayal of trust by an extremely manipulative man.’","Andrew Johnson, 61, was convicted of sex offences against nine women .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A wave of sheep mutilations in Port Lavaca, TX over the past . few months lead some residents and UFO groups to believe the killers may be . from another planet. Wayne and Karen Daggs lost 21 of their Barbados Sheep since July . and lost their last two less than a week ago. At first Daggs thought that . people were stealing the sheep for food, but the surgical precision and the graphic . nature of the mutilations led him to believe otherwise. The mutilations piqued the curiosity of Charles Stansburge, . a popular member of the Mutual UFO Network, after he’d read an article about the . killings in an Advocate article published in the Houston Chronicle. WARNING: GRAPHIC PHOTOS . A dead female mutilated Barbados sheep shown here is one of the 21 missing or killed sheep on the Daggs farm . Stansburge, the organization’s section director, traveled . from Rosenberg to Daggs' residence to launch an investigation on Tuesday. He . plans to help the Calhoun County Sheriff’s department solve the puzzle. Fletcher Grey, a senior field investigator of the Mutual UFO . Network planned to arrive on Wednesday to help Stansburge with the . investigation. Police investigators believe the incidents may be related to . satanic worship. ‘I can't think of a reason aside from rituals or malicious . mischievousness for the mutilations,’ Calhoun County investigator Bobbie . Vickery told the Victoria Advocate. Recently, Daggs has been losing an animal every five days . and usually a few at a time.  ‘At first I . lost four little ones,’ said Daggs. A little over a week ago a male sheep was found by the pond . castrated. His cause of death is unknown. Precisely removed sheep testicles are found laying in the grass at the Dagg's farm . After three female sheep went missing, Daggs found two of . them. ‘One of them was found in the pond, stabbed behind the ear. Another had . had its female sexual organs removed.’ The organs sat next to the dead sheep. The removal of the organs looked very surgical to Daggs and . it was curious to him as to why no trace of evidence was found next to any of . the sheep. ‘It doesn't look like a coyote got at them,’ he says. ‘I think that . a person is doing this.’ Also, as to how someone stole the sheep from the property . was perplexing. Barbados sheep weigh 60 to 75 pounds, not an easy weight to stealthily . carry off property, Daggs says. ‘It's not just kids. Whoever is doing this knows what they . are doing,’ Daggs continued. laser-like incisions, no traces of blood, and absence of tracks are characteristics of . the mutilations that Stansburge has investigated. Stansburge has not . commented on what he believes is killing and stealing the sheep. His findings . are confidential. Charles Stansburge, a member of the Mutual UFO Network, is helping the police department investigate the mutilation . ‘It's an ongoing . investigation so I can't talk too much about it,’ said Stansburge. ‘We need to . find out what is getting in the property.’ ‘It could be a man, a wolf, an E.T. or anything,’ he continued. ‘We're trying to lean towards earthly things.’ In the early 1900s a similar mutilation was discovered. A . horse was found dead with no traces of blood and nothing but the bone above the . neck, Stansburge said. An examination of the horse showed that its nervous system . had been removed with what looked like a laser. A bag with unknown metal tools that could have been a ‘laser . gun’ was found 50 feet away from the horse. WARNING: GRAPHIC PHOTO . A castrated male sheep is mysteriously dead with no trace of evidence as to how it was killed . According to Stransburge, Alien races have inhabited or . visited the Earth for hundreds of thousands of years. Calhoun County Sherriff George Aleman believes a human is . behind the killings. ‘It wasn't a wild animal, which would tear the meat,’ Aleman says. ‘This was too clean to be an animal. Whoever did this knew what . they were doing.’ Wayne Daggs worked in law enforcement for 23 years,18 . of those years as a constable with Calhoun County Precicnt 4. Since retiring, . he has tended to his animals. He is starting to believe he may have offended someone and that . someone is seeking revenge by stealing his animals. ‘I worked hard to not make enemies . while I was on the job,’ Daggs said. He had an emotional connection to the animals and deeply . mourns their loss. ‘It hurts me severely,’ he said. Daggs puts the cost of the animals he has lost at around . $1,250, and the investigation is being treated by the county as a case of theft . of livestock and mutilation. Aleman mentioned that there was a group of self-proclaimed . satanic worshipers in the area in the late 70’s who were responsible for . cattle mutilations. However, Aleman doesn’t think that group is linked to these killings. ‘This could be someone who has nothing else to do but hurt animals for kicks,’ he says. The Calhoun County Sheriff's Department is offering $2,500 . for information regarding the sheep mutilations. They are asking that anyone in . the area who has had animals go missing or killed should contact law enforcement officials as soon . as possible. Barbados Sheep, like the one's pictured here, weigh 60 to 70 pounds and would be difficult to forcibly remove from the Daggs' property .","Mutual UFO Network helps law enforcement investigate the precise mutilations of 21 sheep .

"By . Neil Ashton In Sao Paulo . On Wednesday Robin van Persie, spearheading Holland’s forward line, ran out of ideas. This was not his night. At the end, after 120 desperate minutes here in Sao Paulo, they couldn’t even turn to him from the penalty spot in the shootout. He had been taken off in extra-time, replaced by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar at a time when Holland coach Louis van Gaal desperately needed a goal. One chance was all Van Persie wanted, one opportunity to seal Holland’s place in the World Cup final against Germany on Sunday.  It felt like it would never come and it never did. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Robin van Persie  play beach tennis with Patrick Kluivert . Frustration: Robin van Persie could not produce a one of his trademark displays in semi-final with Argentina .

Stretching for it: Van Persie was trying to find his best form but he was unable to breakdown Argentina . VIDEO Argentina scrape through to final . No matter where he went, his path to glory was blocked by the bruising presence of Martin Demichelis and Ezequiel Garay. The Argentina defence was on to the striker him, fully focused on keeping Van Persie quiet. They did a decent job of it. Demichelis was eventually booked, cautioned for tripping Arjen Robben at the start of the second half. Well, it was always going to happen. The City defender has a decent game in him at times and this, despite the caution, had the makings of one of them. Van Persie is Van Gaal’s man, the striker who can turn games with those clinical finishes from his left boot. Rare sight: Holland's star man of the World Cup Arjen Robben touched the ball just seven times in the first half . Nowhere to go: Robben, like Van Persie, found himself hassled and hurried when he was on the ball . There were times when he perked up, but Argentina’s central defensive pairing kept him quiet for some long and lonely periods. He got going midway through the first half when Robben set him free down the right but he couldn’t return the pass into his team-mate. There is a menacing air to him and he always comes alive when there is a sniff of a scoring chance. He just didn’t get that chance here. When he was replaced by Huntelaar he had taken just 23 touches of the ball and failed to have a single shot on goal.  He had got off to a brilliant start at the tournament, scoring twice - one of them a magnificent diving header - in the 5-1 thumping of Spain in the opening group game.  Here he lacked intensity, bouncing off defenders in the first half and struggling to find some friends up front in this Holland team. Wesley Sneijder, the man cast in the supporting role in the No10 shirt, touched the ball a dozen times in the first half; Arjen Robben just seven. Not good enough. Van Persie has been desperate to make up for the heartbreak of 2010, when he was in the Holland team beaten in extra-time by the brilliance of Spain. Not this time: Louis van Gaal looks to Van Persie as his matchwinner but the striker could not deliver on Wednesday . Frustration: Wesley Sneijder dominated the 2010 World Cup but he could not shine against Argentina . In 2010 it was Sneijder’s year, guiding Inter Milan to Champions League glory and scoring five on the way to the World Cup final against Spain in Johannesburg. Four years on and the main man is Robin van Persie, the man handed the captaincy when Sneijder wasn’t sure whether he would make Louis van Gaal’s tournament weigh-in. Van Persie was part of the Holland team in Soccer City, a beaten finalist under Bert van Marwijk after Andres Iniesta settled it for Spain in the 116th minute. Here in Brazil he has been a positive influence within the Dutch camp, taking his responsibilities of leading the country at a World Cup with dignity and a great degree of professionalism. On the pitch he went on to score in the penalty shootout against Costa Rica, setting the tone for Holland’s dramatic victory with a ruthless finish from the spot. Pointing the way: Van Gaal tried to get the most he could out of his players . Failing to meet expectation: Van Persie (centre) did not light up this match for Holland . Here, one of the grandest stages of all, more is expected of a player with his pedigree. This guy is a matchwinner, made for occasions like this and his subdued first half performance in Sao Paulo was a huge disappointment. He was alone for long periods, unable to muster a single shot in a fruitless first half. To his credit, he never gave up. There was always the temptation to throw on Huntelaar, an obvious threat to Argentina’s tiring legs as this tournament enters its final few days. Something had to change in a game that was off the pace. We were spoiled by Germany’s extraordinary 7-1 victory over Germany. These two were tighter, savvy in defence and unwilling to let anything get beyond Argentina keeper Sergio Romero or Holland’s first choice Jasper Cillessen. In the end, they had to settle for the shootout. Taken off: Van Persie was substituted for Klaas-Jan Huntelaar during extra-time in Sao Paulo .

"By . Martha De Lacey . Most of us hit our thirties and begin to fret about the onset of the signs of aging: the wrinkles, the greying hair, the cellulite, the saggy bottoms. But grandmother Anne Bolton is already 47 and none of these predictable side effects have happened. And she really wishes they would. The mother-of-four says she is constantly being mistaken for a woman half her age, and Anne, a market stall worker from Bristol, says looking like a 20-year-old is actually ruining her life - and now she's thinking about having cosmetic surgery to make herself look older. Anne Bolton, 47, hates being mistaken for a woman half her age and wishes she looked the same age as her friends . 'Everyone wants to look younger but I'm not joking or exaggerating when I say looking young is ruining my life' Anne says that her youthful looks have ruined a marriage and two long-term relationships, as younger . men constantly chat her up. She also believes jealous friends have abandoned her because she makes them look older. Her eldest son, who has recently become a father, hates being seen with her . after being mistaken for her boyfriend. Now size eight Anne fears her youthful looks will mean a lifetime of loneliness . because she only ever gets chatted up by toyboys she has nothing in common . with. She says: 'Everyone wants to look younger but I'm not joking or exaggerating . when I say looking young is ruining my life. I would do anything for a few wrinkles to look my age. 'Why I have none is a mystery to me but the older I get, the bigger the problem . becomes for me. I need someone to invent the reverse of Botox because I'm . desperate to look older.' Anne married her first husband at the age of 24, but within a few years . they were bickering over her looks. She said: 'I was in my late twenties but my . husband noticed much younger men looking at me and he started to get jealous. 'I wasn't interested, but as the years passed I remained looking the same age . and he looked older, which led to even more rows. 'We were the same age but he hated people thinking he'd married a younger . woman so I did my best to dress older.' Anne - second from right, on a night out with friends - says she is forced to socialise with people in their twenties so she looks the same age as them . Anne used to enjoy shopping trips with eldest son Arthur, left with his baby, but he got fed up of . his mum being mistaken for his girlfriend . Eventually it drove them apart. And despite having two sons together - Arthur, . now 25, and 19-year-old Kevin - they got divorced when Anne, who also does some . work as a TV extra, was 32. Four years later, she embarked on a long-term relationship with her second . partner, who worked for the Royal Mail. He was just two years older than Anne who, at 36, was often taken for a . twenty-something. She says: 'At first he loved it and complimented me on my appearance. He said . he was proud to be with me. 'But soon the looks from younger guys triggered arguments. But what could I do . about it?' The couple had two sons - Joshua, now 13, and seven-year-old Jacob - yet even . being a busy mother-of-four took no toll on Anne's looks. She reveals: 'When he . was 42 I still looked 22. People didn't believe I had four children. 'He hated people asking if he was my dad or brother. I could see the way things . were going again. I would have changed it if I could, only there is no operation to make you look . older.' After five years together, the couple split up and Anne feared she would never . find love again. Anne with her son Jacob, who is now seven, when he was a baby . She says: 'I was only chatted up by young guys. At first it was flattering but . then it got boring. 'They want to talk about cars and nightclubs but I needed something more. There's no way I would date someone the same age as my son. Toyboys do not . interest me at all.' Eventually, aged 42, Anne met a 32-year-old. He was mature enough for her yet, she hoped, young enough not to be concerned . over her looks. But she soon faced exactly the same problems. She said: 'People would stare at us as if we shouldn’t be together. He even got . called a dirty old man. Nobody would believe I was a decade older than him and men would approach me . to chat me up when I was with him because they thought he couldn't possibly be . my partner. 'It became a nightmare. I was even accused of being a gold-digger because it looked like I was with a . much older man. It was driving us both mad. It led to rows. It was like history repeating . itself.' 'I was even accused of being a gold-digger because it looked like I was with a much older man. It was driving us both mad' Earlier this year, after five years together, they split up. Anne revealed: 'Once . again I found myself alone. I was heartbroken that my life was being so badly . affected by the way I looked.' She has since struggled to meet any men her own age but has no shortage of . offers from men 20 years younger. She says 'People think that must be great but I am a grown woman with four . sons. I don't want to date a kid. I want a real man, but men my age don't want to . date me because it makes them look like perverts. I feel caught in a trap and I don’t know what to do.' It's not just her love life that has suffered because of her youthful . appearance. Anne used to enjoy shopping trips with eldest son Arthur, but he got fed up of . his mum being mistaken for his girlfriend - making it impossible for him to . meet anyone either. Anne says: 'Girls just assumed he was taken. He found it embarrassing to have . to explain to them I was his mother. 'I couldn’t believe that me looking young was stopping both me and my son from . meeting anyone.' Friendships have . also been wrecked by jealousy over her looks. She says: 'As they started . to look older and I just looked younger, my friends saw me as . a threat to them. 'Their husbands would tell me how young I looked and it annoyed them so they . stopped inviting me out. It wasn't my fault but what could I do? 'Women my own age think standing next to me makes them look old. I can see them . looking me up and down - I've even been called a bitch. 'So I have to hang . around with much younger women. They are good fun but deep down we're not into . the same things. Some are younger than my son but what choice do I have? 'Because of the way I look I don’t feel I fit in anywhere - with young people, . or those my own age. I bring out the bitchy side in women so I'm scared to try to make new . friends.' Anne, who uses just soap and water and Palmer's face cream, has even started . examining her face in the mirror in the hope of finding a wrinkle. She admits: 'Most women dread them while I am desperate to find just one. But . my face and body are totally smooth. 'I’ve lost count of the times people have asked me if I could bottle my secret . and sell it - I'd be a millionaire if I could.'","Anne Bolton is a market stall worker from Bristol with four children .

"By . Daniel Mills . If this isn't the world's most intimidating looking sea creature, then we are yet to see what is. Hauled from a depth of close to 800m below sea, this Megamouth shark was given a very public reception recently when it was shown to more than 1,500  onlookers in the Japanese city of Shizuoka. A crowd of happy-snapping Japanese spectators witnessed the four-metre monster undergo a public autopsy when it was cut open outside the city's Marine Science Museum recently. Scroll down for video . Careful, it bites: This Megamouth Shark which measured in at close to four metres was captured in Japan, drawing a crowd of 1500 onlookers . It was a chance to give scientists a greater understanding of the biology of the shark, which even marine biology experts know very little about. However - despite the mysteries of its anatomy, there is certainly no denying its size and grotesque appearance. It is believed the Megamouth shark can can reach a maximum length of five metres. The animal spends most of its life swimming at great depths only rising to the surface at night to feed. How is it real? A public autopsy was conducted to reveal more about the biology behind Megamouth Shark . Look, but don't touch: A piece of the shark was shown to the eager onlookers gathered to see what the commotion was about . Careful: The Megashark has been seen only 57 other times and was first caught at a depth of 165 metres off the coast of Hawaii . And there are certainly no prizes for guessing how this marvel of the sea got it's name with a mouth like this one's. According to a website on the animal's biology, its chief prey is shrimp-like krill. It also feeds on planktonic animals, including euphausiid shrimps, copepods, and the Pancake Jellyfish. It devours its prey by filtering the small fish through the inner lining of its gills. This sighting - the 58th ever - is the 13th time that a Meagmouth has been caught in Japan. The first was caught at a depth of 165m off the coast of Hawaii, when its teeth became caught in the anchor of a large research vessel, according to the The Museum of Western Australia. The museum even houses a specimen of its own, which was found washed up on the coast of Western Australia back in August 1988. There are several other sharks which have been found washed ashore either dead or dying, and around one quarter of the 58 sighted were caught by fishermen for human consumption. In a recent tribute to the Megashark, The Discovery Channel even gave prominence to the animal during one of its acclaimed Shark Week features, calling it an 'alien shark.'","It is just the 58th sighting ever recorded of the Megamouth shark .

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . As Toni Kroos produced yet another performance of midfield mastery, this time in a World Cup semi-final, thoughts turned to the Old Trafford boardroom and Manchester United’s peculiar pursuit of the German. Under David Moyes, Kroos had emerged as United’s principal summer target, viewed by the Glaswegian as someone that could fill the vacuum vacated by Paul Scholes and restore order and authority to the central acres. Moyes recognised that United’s midfield has been missing in action too often in recent times. In the hunger games, United were often found wanting, overpowered and overwhelmed in the central positions. VIDEO Scroll down for Kroos, you CAN defend! Pep makes fun of Chelsea target in training . Setting the World alight: Kroos (top) celebrates scoring Germany's fourth in the 7-1 semi-final win over Brazil . Kroos control: The 24-year-old has emerged as one of the best midfielders on the planet . Liverpool and Manchester City, in . particular, brutally exposed United’s lightweight midfield as short of . the required standard last season, with Michael Carrick’s powers waning . and Tom Cleverley and Marouane Fellaini failing to impress. Following one Old Trafford defeat last season, one source close to the United squad joked that Moyes was having to play the ‘polo mint formation – with nothing in the middle.’ Moyes identified Kroos as the starting pistol for a United revolution this summer - one, of course, that he was fated to never oversee - and he worked long and hard in his attempts to cut a deal for the Germany star, whose contract with Bayern Munich will expire in 12 months’ time. Against Brazil on Tuesday evening, Kroos demonstrated the qualities that so appealed to Moyes. Kroos is the player that represents, more than any other, the technical precision and control that defines this German side. His long passes are on a sixpence, his short game equally accurate and inventive. Kroos is wonderfully minimalist in his movement, always available, always showing for the ball, as he drops deep, receives, lays it off, and moves the ball on with purpose. He barely wastes a pass, his immense intellect for football dictating the tempo of this game on his terms, like so many others for Bayern Munich. He completed 93 per cent of his attempted passes and a 91.5 per cent success rate in the opposition’s half. Statistics can sometimes skew perceptions but these figures underline his immense talent. Scouting mission: Moyes (left) is pictured watching Bayern play Borussia Monchengladbach in January . Moyes flew to Germany to watch Kroos in action on several occasions, . intensifying his interest around January and instructing his scouts to . provide the extensive reports that he requires before committing to any . major signing. In March, Moyes ran the rule over Kroos’ performances in Bayern Munich’s 5-1 victory over Schalke and he then was at the Emirates Stadium to witness the German’s outstanding performance as Bayern beat Arsenal, with Kroos curling a beautiful effort to open the scoring. On that spring evening, he completed 147 passes, just 11 less than the entire Arsenal team managed over the 90 minutes. Moyes ordered executive vice-chairman Edward Woodward to accelerate United’s pursuit. The United manager himself was reported to have held talks and entertained Kroos’ representatives as the club launched a charm offensive. A salary approaching £240,000-a-week was mooted. Despite the absence of Champions League football next season, the noises United received were encouraging and there was a growing confidence the player would swap the Bundesliga for the Premier League next season. Masterclass: Kroos is mobbed after scoring a long-range effort against Arsenal back in February . When United faced Bayern in the Champions League quarter-final, Woodward spoke privately to supporters in Germany and is understood to have assured them that big plans were in place for this summer and that the club were hopeful over deals for Kroos and Marco Reus of Borussia Dortmund. As the manager changed, so too did the targets. Louis van Gaal’s aversion to signing Kroos was greeted with surprise in the corridors of power at Old Trafford, particularly as the Dutchman was in charge at Bayern when the player emerged as a youngster of supreme talent in Germany. His stance, however, was firm and United abandoned their extensive attempts to secure Kroos’ signature, instead focusing on Athletic Bilbao’s Ander Herrera, who was signed in a £28.4million deal in June. United answered to Van Gaal’s demands, with Woodward overseeing a new structure in the scouting department as Moyes’ men, Robbie Cooke and James Smith, who had joined from Everton, swiftly being released. Preferred choice: Ander Herrera is unveiled by Sir Bobby Charlton last month . VIDEO Herrera completes United transfer . The priorities changed but the decision to pass up on Kroos remains a chin-stroker. Paul Scholes admitted as much last week, stating: ‘It is good to see United bringing in new players, but they haven't signed anything like the quality of Kroos.’ The Herrera transfer fee exceeds the suggested cost for Kroos, who is now likely to move to Real Madrid for less than £25m, although United would rightly retort that the Spaniard’s wage package is almost four times less than what Kroos would have commanded. One theory, as bizarre as it may sound, is that Van Gaal considers the German a little slow for the English game and that he lacks the athleticism to compete physically. Another suggestion is that United became aware of Real’s interest and withdrew before they were seen off by the greater financial and romantic pull of the Spanish side. As Kroos continues to shine, the conjecture will continue but the feeling lingers that United have missed out on an extraordinary talent, and their loss will likely be Madrid’s gain.

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Nigeria has been suspended from all international football amid allegations of government interference in its football federation. FIFA announced the ban, which means no Nigerian team - including club sides - can play internationally, on Wednesday evening. It was the world governing body’s response to a court order which compelled the Nigerian Minister of Sports to appoint a senior member of the civil service to take over the running of the Nigeria Football Federation. Suspended: Nigeria performed above expectations at the World Cup but are now banned from internationals . Waving goodbye: The super eagles went out of the tournament after defeat to France in the last 16 . A statement from FIFA’s emergency committee said: 'The FIFA Emergency Committee has decided today, 9 July 2014, to suspend the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) with immediate effect, on account of government interference.' The statement continued: 'The decision follows a letter sent by FIFA to the NFF on 4 July 2014, in which it expressed its great concern after the NFF was served with court proceedings and consequently an order preventing the president of the NFF, the NFF Executive Committee members and the NFF Congress from running the affairs of Nigerian football was granted by a High Court of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. 'The said court order compelled the Nigerian Minister of Sports to appoint a senior member of the civil service to manage the NFF until the matter was heard in court, without giving any date for such a hearing. Missing out: Nigeria have been suspended over claims that the government is interfering in football . 'The authorities then appointed a person who decided to convene an extraordinary general assembly on 5 July 2014. This extraordinary general assembly was convened in violation of the NFF statutes. 'Originally, an elective congress had been planned by the NFF to take place on 26 August 2014. 'The suspension will be lifted once the court actions have been withdrawn and the properly elected NFF Executive Committee, the NFF general assembly and the NFF administration are able to work without any interference in their affairs.' The first impact of FIFA’s move will be felt by Nigeria’s women, who will be prevented from taking part in the FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup in Canada next month - should the suspension not be lifted by July 15. temporary: FIFA are particularly harsh on any interference but Nigeria will return if the situation changes . The statement added: 'As a result of this decision, no team from Nigeria of any sort (including clubs) can have any international sporting contact (art. 14 par. 3 of the FIFA Statutes). 'During the period of suspension, the NFF may not be represented in any regional, continental or international competitions, including at club level, or in friendly matches. 'In addition, neither the NFF nor any of its members or officials may benefit from any FIFA or CAF development programmes, courses or training during the suspension period.'

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Former IRS official Lois Lerner refused for a second time on Wednesday to testify about her role in a scheme to target conservative organizations that applied for tax-exempt status during President Barack Obama's first term in office. Lerner risks arrest if she is found in contempt of Congress. The House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee ruled on June 21, 2013 that Lerner, formerly in charge of the IRS's Exempt Organizations office, waived her right to invoke the Fifth Amendment during a May 22 hearing when she insisted in a lengthy opening statement that she had done nothing wrong. Wednesday's continuation of that hearing was a brief affair, with Oversight Committee Chairman Republican Rep. Darrell Issa adjourning it after Lerner cited the Fifth amendment again and refused to answer questions. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lois Lerner, former director of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division at the Internal Revenue Service, claimed the protections of the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify Wednesday about an alleged years-long tea party targeting scheme . House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa quickly closed down the hearing after Lerner refused to answer questions . 'I am a member of the Congress of the United States of America! I'm tired of this!' Democratic Rep. Elijah Cumming shouted after the Republican chairman adjourned Wednesday's committee hearing without listening to his statement . 'Seeking the truth is the obligation of this committee. I can see no point in going further.' Issa said. 'I have no expectation that Mrs. Lerner will cooperate with this committee, and therefore we stand adjourned.' After angry objections from ranking Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, Issa cut off his microphone, told Lerner, 'You're released,' and said, 'We're adjourned. Close it down.' Cummings continued to complain loudly without the aid of a microphone. The Daily Caller published video of the exchange, titled 'Cummings goes ballistic.' The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees that Lerner can't be compelled to testify against herself. But with the committee ruling that Lerner's statements in May disqualified her from leaning on that right, she becomes subject to arrest if she continues to refuse to answer questions – either as leverage to force her to comply, or simply as punishment for thumbing her nose at Congress. House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, seemed to support a contempt cititation as a last resort, telling reporters Wednesday that he would 'wait for a report from Chairman Issa about what happened or what will happen. But at some point I believe that she has to testify, or she should be held in contempt.' Tea party activists have insisted that during the 2010 election year, the IRS placed some of their nonprofit groups on hold for more than three years while liberal organizations were quickly given tax-exempt status . Four separate Supreme Court rulings . have confirmed the right of Congress to incarcerate Americans for . contempt, although it hasn't been done in more than 75 years. A . July 2007 Congressional Research Service Report spells out the process: . 'The individual is brought before the House or Senate by the sergeant . at arms, tried at the bar of the body, and can be imprisoned in the . Capitol jail.' In June . 2012 the full House of Representatives voted to hold Attorney General . Eric Holder in contempt after he refused to hand over documents relating . to the botched Operation Fast and Furious gun-running sting. Holder . wasn't arrested, largely because he heads the federal law enforcement . agency that would be responsible for taking him into custody. Lerner's . lawyer William Taylor has played a cat-and mouse game with committee . Republicans for the past week, at first saying she faced death threats . and wouldn't appear, then offering to produce her at a sworn deposition, . and at one point saying she would only answer questions if she were . immune from prosecution. Catherine . Engelbrech, national coordinator of True the Vote, a conservative group . that claims it was targeted by the IRS, the ATF and other agencies, . said Wednesday that 'when an alphabet soup of government agencies . descended on and investigated me and my family, I didn't have the option . of doing what Lerner did today. I had to submit to invasive and . aggressive investigations despite the fact that I had done absolutely . nothing wrong.' The sideline spat between Issa and Cummings quickly became the talk of Washington on Wednesday. Lerner refused to testify for the second time, opening her up to the possibility of a contempt charge from Congress . Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, tried to prolong the hearing with what he said was a 'procedural question' – but then proceeded to make a statement. Issa, the Republican firebrand from California, cut off his microphone. 'Mr. Chairman, you cannot run a committee like this,' Cummings shouted as Issa stood to walk out of the hearing room. 'If you will sit down and allow me to ask a question – I am a member of a Congress of the United States of America! I am tired of this!' 'You cannot just have a one-sided investigation,' Cummings continued while Republican staffers left. 'There is absolutely something wrong with that, and it is absolutely un-American.' Issa returned to tell Cummings, 'We had a hearing. It was adjourned. I gave you an opportunity to ask your questions. You had no questions.' 'I do have questions,' the Democrat said, raising his voice again as Issa left to address a waiting phalanx of reporters. 'Chairman, what are you hiding?'","The one-time head of the U.S. tax authority's branch overseeing nonprofits won't testify about a years-long scheme to target conservative groups .

"By . Paul Collins . South Korea football coach Hong Myung-Bo resigned on Thursday as he took responsibility for his team's disappointing performance at the World Cup in Brazil. Hong has faced mounting criticism after South Korea were eliminated from the World Cup by finishing last in the four-team Group H. South Korea were defeated 1-0 by Belgium, 4-2 by Algeria and drew 1-1 with Russia. Final call: South Korea coach Hong Myung-Bo announces his resignation in Seoul on Thursday . Hong told a televised news conference that he feels 'deeply sorry' for the results. 'We talked about giving hopes to our people. But we eventually failed to give hopes and only gave disappointment,' Hong said. 'I'm leaving from the post today.' Hong said he first thought about quitting after his team's loss to Algeria. His resignation comes as something of a surprise after South Korea's football association said last week it would retain him as the national team coach. Leaving: Hong speaks at a press conference as he decides to resign following a disappointing World Cup . After Hong's resignation announcement, Korea Football Association President Chung Mong-Gyu told the same news conference that his association will try to find a new coach as soon as possible.

"By . John Mcgarry . The thought of it has never been far from Scottish minds since the draw was made in Nice in February. Facing Germany at any stage of a qualifying campaign is always a cause for concern but on the  evidence of what transpired in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday, our date with Joachim Low’s side in  Dortmund on September 7 suddenly has all the appeal of being tied to a railway track. Scotland still has good reason for approaching the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign with a degree of cautious optimism, however. Formidable: The Germany starting XI line up ahead of their World Cup semi-final against Brazil on Tuesday . The Scottish FA tweeted: Just a quick reminder that our first Euro 2016 qualifier is Germany in Dortmund in September. Good. #naeborra . The past year under Gordon  Strachan has been characterised by markedly better organisation, spirit and results. Defeating Croatia home and away is the hallmark of a side on the rise. In a section also containing  Ireland, Poland, Georgia and Gibraltar, there are sound grounds for believing that our soon-to-be  18-year exile from international competition may soon be over. Yet ensuring the outlook remains as positive by the time we exit the Westfalenstadion in just eight weeks’ time is a tall order. Whether Germany have claimed a fourth World Cup by then or not, the ruthless manner of their  historic 7-1 win over Brazil was enough to send a shiver down the neck of every Scot. Here Sportsmail takes an in-depth look at the formidable barrier facing Strachan’s side when our campaign gets underway. On their way: The Tartan Army will head to Dortmund in September for the opening Euro 2016 qualifier . THE GOALKEEPER . Manuel Neuer’s displays for both club and country over the past five seasons have instigated a  moratorium on the debate over the greatest goalkeeper on the planet. There is simply none to be had. He would probably be out on his own were his talents to stretch no further than his shot-stopping  ability — as evidenced by the  concrete fist that repelled France’s Karim Benzema in the quarter-final. That’s only one of the strings on his bow, however. Neuer’s ability to turn defence into attack with his precision kicks and throws is one of Germany’s most potent weapons. Just look at the way the likes of Andre Schurrle glides on to his heat-seeking missiles. Safe hands: Gemany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer makes a save from a shot at goal by Brazil's Oscar . Yet Neuer isn’t one to wait patiently in his goalmouth for the ball to come to him. The ‘Sweeper Keeper’, as he’s become known, is happy with the ball at his feet  outside his box, thus letting his defence play a high line. A high-risk — but highly productive — strategy. He’s a fearsome character, too. Note his disgust when Oscar scored the most meaningless consolation in history or how his enormous frame fills the goal before a penalty kick. THE BACK FOUR . Low has played either 4-3-3 or  4-2-3-1 throughout the competition, with only the personnel in the  rearguard changing. Philipp Lahm started in the holding midfield role but has reverted to right-back. That has allowed Jerome Boateng to step inside one position to  partner Mats Hummels, meaning there’s been no need to expose Per Mertesacker’s lack of pace. Benedict Howedes, the Schalke left-back, has been a constant. Irrespective of who is playing ahead of them, the defensive unit have no requirement to force the game. There’s enough flare and invention in the six men further up the field to win the game.Neuer’s uncanny ability to play effectively as an 11th outfield player at times — Low stated last week that he could comfortably play in midfield — naturally pushes his defenders higher up the pitch. Making his point: Germany defender Jerome Boateng (left) has a few words with Brazil's Marcelo . THE MIDFIELD . Low normally operates with one holding player, so take your pick between multiple Champions League winners Lahm or Schweinsteiger. And, were his squad to be floored by some kind of plague, he could always turn to one of the Bender twins, Sven or Lars, who ply their trades for Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen respectively. And, for the record, neither made the cut for Brazil. Just ahead of the ‘pivot’, Low deploys two narrow attacking  midfielders, Bastian Schweinsteiger — if he’s not required to hold — Toni Kroos and/or Sami Khedira. Touch: Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger (right) controls the ball under pressure from Oscar . The three are almost joined at the hip at times, tag-teaming whenever there’s a growing crisis, but largely dominating possession, pressing and feeding the front three. As Brazil found to their cost, it’s all one and two touch, the ball being flashed around like it’s  following a laser. Just try to  disrupt that rhythm. In the air: Germany midfielder Sami Khedira kicks the ball during the semi-final in Belo Horizonte . THE STRIKEFORCE . So much for the death of the  traditional No 9. Low is still a big believer in having a penalty-box striker at the arrow’s head and there are few better in world  football than record-breaking  Miroslav Klose. At 36, the Scots might just have seen the back of the Lazio man. He’ll take 71 goals with him into international retirement, even if he doesn’t score in Sunday’s final. Thomas Muller led the front line pretty well earlier in the campaign and is likely to revert there come September. On form: Germany's Thomas Muller (right) looks to take the ball round Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar . The supporting cast isn’t too bad either. Mesut Ozil may have faded badly for Arsenal after a great start but his ability either coming in off the right or in the traditional No 10 role is beyond question. His team-mate Lukas Podolski, a veteran of six tournaments at just 29, remains both a prolific  provider and scorer of goals, while Bayern Munich’s Mario Gotze and  Chelsea’s Schurrle are indicative of a squad with seemingly  boundless depth. The fact Germany have got this far without the injured Marco Reus — Germany’s best attacking player according to Dietmar Hamann — is ominous. Strike: Germany and Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil has a shot on goal during the 7-1 win over hosts Brazil . REALISTICALLY, WHAT CHANCE DO SCOTLAND HAVE? Pretty slim, but then that’s how we felt when the draw was made. It’s a shot to nothing. A point on the opening night would be a godsend but, if that’s beyond us, a positive performance against a nation that’s truly arrived would be the next best thing. No one should lose sight of the bigger picture. The Germans were always going to be white-hot favourites to win the group, with Scotland, Ireland and Poland scrapping for the other automatic spot behind them — and if that’s not to be, then third, which goes into a play-off. Irrespective of whether Germany win the World Cup or not on  Sunday, they’ll be expected to go through the section with ease. As when we had Spain for  company in the 2012 qualifiers, it won’t be our two games with them that will shape our qualification fate. It will be four matches with our direct rivals and any slip-ups against Georgia or, heaven forbid, Gibraltar. On the beach: Scotland manager Gordon Strachan is working at the World Cup for ITV as a pundit . If we need inspiration, cite the case of Lithuania, who travelled to Italy in 2006 supposedly as lambs to the slaughter as the recently crowned world champions paraded the trophy. The result? A score draw. Strachan has also shown himself to be a shrewd tactician. You don’t win in Croatia, Macedonia and Poland unless you can contain opponents without loading the sandbags. Yet, even before Scott Brown sustained an injury that’s likely to rule him out, September 7 was always likely to prove the toughest test of Strachan’s credentials. Come what may, we will surely be able to reflect that we did better than the Brazilians. That’s a given, right?","Gordon Strachan's side open their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign against Germany .

"By . Paul Collins . Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has claimed he was forced into the sale of leading goalscorer Ross McCormack to Fulham because the Scotland international had 'disrespected' him. Fulham completed the deal for an undisclosed fee, understood to be £11million, for the Leeds captain late on Monday night and confirmed the deal on Tuesday morning, less than a week after Cellino had insisted the striker was not for sale. McCormack, 27, signed a new four-year deal with Leeds last summer, but following a fall-out with Cellino did not to travel with Leeds last week to their summer training camp in Italy. He has signed a four-year contract at Leeds' Sky Bet Championship rivals Fulham with the option of a further year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Top 10 Ross McCormack transfer memes . Big money move: Ross McCormack, 27, has cost Fulham a whopping £11million . 'I like to be in control of situations but it felt like he wasn't my player,' Cellino told the Yorkshire Evening Post. 'I was disrespected, he was aggressive with me. Claims: McCormack has been accused of being 'aggressive' by Leeds owner Massimo Cellino . 'He didn't turn up for the tour and all the time he wanted to go from here. It wasn't in my mind to sell McCormack, it wasn't my plan, but I had no choice. 'He's a bloody good player and I'm not going to pretend that he isn't but he didn't respect me and it wasn't possible to keep him.' The transfer fee is more than had been expected for a player unproven in the top flight, but the deal may still anger some Leeds fans who had been hoping McCormack would spearhead their club's promotion challenge next season. McCormack, the Championship's leading scorer last season with 28 goals, told BBC Radio Leeds that he had been 'hung out to dry' and that the club was 'no longer the Leeds United I fell in love with'. Cellino has made wholesale changes at the club since completing his takeover on April 7. Former manager Brian McDermott has been replaced by a new head coach, former Forest Green Rovers boss David Hockaday, and Junior Lewis has also been added to the coaching staff. Benito Carbone, the former Bradford and Sheffield Wednesday striker, was appointed as a consultant responsible for first-team and academy affairs in May. Holding out: Leeds ensured they got a large fee for the Championship's top goalscorer last season . VIDEO Relegated clubs eye McCormack . Cellino temporarily closed down the club's Thorp Arch training ground as a cost-cutting measure - the Italian has since confirmed he wants to move away from the multi-million complex permanently - while a raft of redundancies among non-playing staff have been made. A Leeds statement released on the club's official website read: 'Striker Ross McCormack has completed his transfer to Fulham for an undisclosed fee. 'The Scotland international was the Championship's top goalscorer last season with 28 league goals and he has signed a four-year deal, with an option of a further year with the London side. Controversial: Cellino bought Leeds earlier this year . 'It is with regret that this decision was reached but the player no longer wanted play for Leeds United. 'McCormack made a total of 158 appearances for the club and scored 58 goals for United. 'The club would like to wish Ross all the best for the future.' Fulham have paid a record fee for a Scotland international, while McCormack becomes the second most expensive Scottish-born player in history. Everton paid Wigan £13million for Glasgow-born Republic of Ireland international James McCarthy in September last year. Cellino had said he would only sell McCormack to a Barclays Premier League club when he unveiled Hockaday as head coach on June 19. The Italian claimed he had blocked the Scot's proposed move to Fulham's London rivals West Ham in January and rejected an approach from Newcastle in May. Meanwhile, Cellino is understood to have confirmed the signings of Chievo goalkeeper Marco Silvestri and Sassuolo midfielder Tommaso Bianchi.

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Police were called to Swansea City’s training ground after defender Chico Flores allegedly picked up a brick in a furious row with team-mate Garry Monk. The incident happened on Friday when an altercation on the pitch between the two players escalated dramatically. A member of the public — believed to be the mother of a youth-team player — phoned police after claiming to have spotted a screaming Flores brandishing the brick. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Michael Laudrup admit the club are facing tough times . Flashpoint: Laudrup said he has spoken with both Flores (above) and Monk . Escalation: Garry Monk was involved in a training ground row with Flores . Officers took no action against the volatile Spaniard, leaving the matter in the club’s hands. A statement from South Wales Police confirmed: ‘Police were called to the training ground at around 1.30pm on Friday 17 January. Club officials were spoken to and no police action was required.’ A Swansea spokesperson said: ‘Chico Flores and Garry Monk had an exchange of words, which is not uncommon between players in training grounds across the country, but no threats or altercations took place between the players in question. ‘It’s understood a member of the public phoned the police, who felt no action was required. The matter has been dealt with and is concluded.’ Low moment: Flores scored an own goal for Swansea in their 3-1 loss to Spurs on Sunday, just two days after the row with Monk . Selection decision: Swansea boss Michael Laudrup included Flores in his team to face Spurs on Sunday . It followed another incident earlier in the week when Flores is understood to have stormed out of a team meeting. The  26-year-old centre back was still included in Michael Laudrup’s line-up at home to Tottenham on Sunday and scored an own goal in Swansea’s 3-1 defeat, a result that left them without a win in eight Barclays Premier League games and three points off the relegation zone. Monk, 34, has made only one appearance for the club this season, in the Capital One Cup. Look of despair: Swansea defender Flores reflects after scoring an own goal against Spurs on Sunday . Concerns have been growing about the attitude of Swansea’s squad towards their eight Spanish players, with an ‘us and them’ culture developing. The British players feel Flores, once a popular figure, has become egotistical and they are growing tired of his histrionics. Flores quickly became known as a . flamboyant character after moving to the Liberty Stadium from Genoa in a . £2million deal in July 2012 following a spell on loan with Laudrup at . Mallorca. Character: Flores is known as a flamboyant character for Swansea . Flores is known to have a short fuse and his team-mates sometimes enjoy trying to provoke a reaction. In recent weeks, Swansea have been running a crossbar competition with the worst-performing player forced to drive around in a pink Suzuki Vitara. Under the rules of the competition, the car — labelled the Pink Ferrari — must be parked in the space designated for Flores’s red Ferrari at the Liberty Stadium. Defensive option from the past: Flores, seen here in action for Swansea last season playing Arsenal in a FA Cup replay, has worked with Laudrup at Mallorca .","Flores spotted by member of public screaming and brandishing brick .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Standing in a beautiful 365-acre forest, with birds chirping and a massive, shimmering lake, it's hard to believe I'm less than an hour outside of London. This is Woburn Forest, Center Parcs' latest holiday park – just 45 minutes from St Pancras by train; the perfect playground for those living in the capital. MailOnline Travel is one of the first in the country to stay at the new complex, nestled in the heart of Bedfordshire, which opens to the public on June 6. Subtropical: Woburn's new swimming pool, which is 5,200sq metres in size and cost £28m to build . Out of London: The stunning lake, surrounded by 365-acres of forest at the new Center Parcs complex . It is the brand's fifth park in the UK joining Sherwood, Longleat, Whinfell and Elveden - and this is the closest one to London. For Center Parcs aficionados, there’s all the usual trimmings you would expect to find; the vast, family-friendly complex boasting pretty much every outdoor – and indoor - activity you could want. There are also a few surprises and twists in store to keep this new site, which cost £250m to build, fresh and exciting; including £12m spa, Center Parcs’ largest Subtropical Swimming Paradise, and a gift shop selling £2,000 watches! As well as 625 self-catering lodges in the traditional Center Parcs style, there’s also a new, 75-room luxury hotel, for those who prefer someone else to do the cooking. Grand tour: There are more than 100 activities available at the new park - including Segway rides . Luxury accommodation: Inside one of the self-catering lodges at the new holiday park in Bedfordshire . Shooting range: Glyn and Callum trying their hand at clay pigeon shooting . With my husband Glyn and son Callum, we check-in to our New Style Exclusive cabin, which has three bedrooms, an open-plan kitchen, and a lounge as well as a Jacuzzi in the ensuite. It even boasts a traditional wood sauna, a rainforest shower in the garden, and daily maid service. 'This is the life,' my eight-year-old says cheekily as he packs his bag ready for the day's first activity. The park is perfect for kids, with non-stop activities – from archery, canoeing and laser combat, to falconry, pottery painting and tennis. We’re packing him off for a three-hour slot of Princesses and Pirates - an afternoon of dressing up, songs and crafts with other children. My husband and I opt to check out the Aqua Sana Spa – we’ll get our fill of the great outdoors afterwards. And relax... The infinity pool at Aqua Sana spa, which cost £12m to build . Open plan dining: The lounge area inside an Executive Lodge at the new £250m holiday park . Dining out: A nighttime view of some of the 13 restaurants and cafes on offer at the new park . Inside is a range of hot to ice-cold rain rooms, saunas, steam rooms, relaxation areas and sensory rooms, where we spend two hours relaxing, inhaling wonderful fragrances from herbs and essential oils. Fully pampered, and Callum still racing with energy, the three of us hire bikes and cycle carefree around the park, safe in the knowledge that cars are banned other than on Mondays and Fridays – guest change-over days. The 5,200sq-metre Subtropical Swimming Paradise - which cost £28m - is our next stop. Inside there is a wave pool, flumes, slides, Wild Water Rapids, Lazy River, Wild Water Rapids and three water rides – as well as nearly 5,000 stunning tropical plants that were rescued from areas threatened by deforestation in South East Asia. With snorkel in hand and flip flops on our feet we set about deciding what to go on first. Water activities: The boating lake surrounded by the 365-acre Woburn forest . Water slides: The new £28m subtropical swimming pool boasts tubes, rapids and waves . I find myself lining up for the Tornado – the ‘family’ raft ride. The life guard assures me it’s fine and not too scary. After what feels like a sheer drop at high speed, my legs go to jelly and I decide that I may well just stick to swimming for the rest of the day. Callum’s happy floating around the rapids, and my courage builds enough to try the Twister and Tornado rides on a double inflatable ring – embarrassingly, I end up screaming louder than the children. As the Tarzan call sounds, signalling the start of the waves, everyone rushes into the pool to be thrashed about. I find a quiet corner to recover and relax. In the evening, there are a range of 13 restaurants and cafes to choose from, serving cuisine from around the world including high-street chains such as Strada, Cafe Rouge, and Starbucks. Also on offer is the chance to have a meal prepared for you and delivered to your cabin, giving guests the opportunity to put their feet up after a hard day on the rapids. Non-stop activity: Bikes are the best way to get around the new Center Parcs in Woburn . There’s also evening entertainment suitable for young ones, and I find myself being wrapped up in tissue paper for the ‘Mummy’ game – and that was before the cocktails. The following morning there’s still lots of activities - 100 in total - on offer. Callum and I find ourselves on a spontaneous roller skating session – but he fares better than I do. Then we jump on our bikes again, overtaking a group of Sedway riders who are exploring the vast park as well. Our last stop is the Outdoor Activity Centre for a spot of Laser Clay Pigeon Shooting. Glyn and Callum are excited at playing a real-life PlayStation game, while I laze in the sun, safe in the knowledge that the drive home is only going to take us an hour. Our first family stay at Center Parcs has been a whirlwind experience – and I know my son is going to be begging me to come back again. And when it's a £250m playground that's right on your doorstep, it's that much easier to say yes. A stay at the new Woburn Forest Center Parcs (08448 266266; centerparcs.co.uk/woburn) costs from £399 for a four-night midweek break in a two-bedroom Woodland Lodge, from £799 for a four-bedroom Executive Lodge, or £1,399 for a top-of-the-range four-bedroom new-style Exclusive Lodge.","Bedfordshire holiday park is 50 minutes by train from St Pancras .

"By . Hannah Roberts In Rome . One of the Vatican’s . most senior money-men has been arrested in an alleged plot to smuggle . 20 million Euros into Italy from Switzerland aboard a government plane. Monsignor . Nunzio Scarano, the bishop of Salerno, and the chief accountant for the . Vatican’s vast property portfolio, has been taken into custody along . with an Italian secret agent Mario Zito and broker Giovanni Carenzio. Scarano, . 61, who worked at Deutsche bank before taking ecclesiastical vows, is . accused of fraud, corruption, and other charges, as part of a wider . investigation into the IOR Vatican Bank. Arrest: Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, the bishop of Salerno, the chief accountant for the Vatican's vast property portfolio, has been taken into custody . His nickname in Vatican circles . was reportedly ‘Don 500 Euros’ thanks to his habit of showing people . that he had only the largest bank note in his wallet. According to attorney Silverio Sica, Scarano was a middleman in the Swiss operation. Friends had asked him to intervene with Carenzio to return 20 million euros they had given him to invest. Sica said Scarano persuaded Carenzio to return the money, and an Italian secret service agent, Giovanni Maria Zito, went to Switzerland to bring the cash back aboard an Italian government aircraft. Such a move would presumably prevent any reporting of the money coming into Italy. The operation failed because Carenzio reneged on the deal, Sica said. Zito, nevertheless, demanded his 400,000 Euros commission. Scarano paid him an initial 200,000 Euros by check, Sica said. The Vatican bank, formerly known as the Institute for Religious Operas, IOR, inside the Vatican and Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, the chief accountant for the Vatican's property portfolio . But in a bid to not have the second installment of the commission deposited, Scarano filed a report for a missing 200,000 check, even though he knew Zito had it, Sica said. Carenzio and Zito also were arrested Wednesday along with Scarano, Sica said. When asked how Scarano responded to the accusations, Sica said 'I think that Don Nunzio will respond to the questions.' It . is not the only troubles Scarano is facing.  Prosecutors in Salerno . have placed him under investigation for alleged money-laundering . stemming from his account at the Vatican's bank, called the Institute . for Religious Works, or IOR. The investigation concerns transactions . Scarano, then an official at the Administration for the Patrimony of the . Apostolic See, made in 2009 in which he took 560,000 euros ($729,000) in cash out of his personal IOR bank account and carried it out of the . Vatican and into Italy to help pay off a mortgage on his Salerno home. The high profile arrests come just 48 hours after Pope Francis announced the line up for his commission into the Vatican Bank . To deposit the money into an Italian bank account - and to prevent family members from finding out he had such a large chunk of cash - he asked 56 close friends to accept 10,000 euros apiece in cash in exchange for a check or money transfer in the same amount, Sica said earlier this week. Scarano was then able to deposit the amounts in his Italian account. The original money came into Scarano's IOR account from donors who gave it to the prelate thinking they were funding a home for the terminally ill in Salerno, Sica said. He said the donors had 'enormous' wealth and could offer such donations for his charitable efforts. He said Scarano had given the names of the donors to prosecutors and insisted the origin of the money was clean, that the transactions didn't constitute money-laundering, and that he only took the money ""temporarily"" for his personal use. The home for terminally ill hasn't been built, though the property has been identified, Sica said. 'He declares himself absolutely innocent,' Sica said of the Salerno investigation. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, told the AP earlier this week that the Vatican is taking the appropriate measures to deal with Scarano's case. There was no further comment Friday from the Vatican about Scarano's arrest. The high profile arrests come just 48 hours after Pope Francis announced the line up for his commission into the Vatican Bank. The so-called ‘Bank of God ‘ has been tarnished by scandal and suspicion for 30 years. Any attempt to investigate by Italian authorities was viewed as an attack on the sovereignty of the Vatican state . Francis said he needed to ensure the . bank was running ‘in harmony’ with the church. According to a writ no . one is allowed to refuse the commissioners information.","Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, the bishop of Salerno, taken into custody .

"By . Australian Associated Press . Manly Sea Eagle David Williams has been banned for the rest of 2014 over an NRL betting scandal . Sea Eagle David Williams has been suspended for the rest of the NRL season for betting on games including several he played in. He's among five players to receive bans for betting on NRL games following an investigation by the league's integrity unit. Another player slapped with a ban was Ethan Lowe from North Queensland, who has played 10 first grade games for the side since 2013, and is now out for two games. Lower graders Gold Coast player Cody Nelson and Melbourne's Hymel Hunt and Slade Griffin also copped two games suspensions. In addition, three casual game day officials have been sacked and nine others suspended for the rest of the season for betting breaches. The NRL's warned even tougher penalties will apply in the future as part of a zero tolerance package of reforms. The Sea Eagles winger was named on Wednesday as one of those understood to have broken the code's strict gambling guidelines. The report by The Daily Telegraph also claimed a big-name player from a Sydney club will be banned for six weeks for breaking the gambling guidelines. The NRL was expected to sanction a number of other players on Thursday for placing small bets on matches - often as little as $5 - following an audit by its Integrity Unit. There is no suggestion Williams, or any other player, was involved in match fixing. Late last month, the NRL said it had found no evidence of widespread involvement of players in betting on matches, with initial inquiries indicating there were less than eight players who might face penalties for breaches. NRL rules forbid any player, manager, club employee or game official taking part in gambling in relation to rugby league. The latest scandal to hit the game - which comes just a week after the Todd Carney 'bubbler' furore - has broken on the morning of State of Origin III. Williams is said to have placed a series of small $5 bets on games. There is no suggestion he was involved in match fixing .","Williams banned for the remainder of the season after breaking NRL's gambling guidelines .

One million women worldwide will show their support for a brutally murdered Iraqi immigrant by posting pictures of themselves wearing hijab headscarves as part of a global campaign. Muslim mother-of-five Shaima Alawadi was found beaten and unconscious in her San Diego home last month in an apparent killing which officials described as a 'hate crime'. Now as a show of solidarity towards the female Islamic community, one million women - many of whom are non-Muslim - have posted photos of themselves wearing the traditional headscarf. Show of unity: Lore, left, a Romanian Christian from France and Buddhist Tess Murray, right, were just two of the one million women who wore hijabs in support of Shaima Alawadi . Solidarity: These students were just a few who participated in the hijab day to show support for the family and friends of Alawadi . Two more supporters of the One Million Hijabs campaign show their unity for murdered Muslim Shaima Alawadi . The campaign, 'One Million Hijabs for Shaima Alawadi', has seen women worldwide wear the Islamic headscarf to show support for the family and friends of Alawadi, who was found dead on March 21. Alawadi's husband had made an emotional plea to catch her 'racist' killer, after she was found in a pool of blood next to a note which read, 'go back to your country, you terrorist'. On a Facebook group created for 'One Million Hijabs', women have also sent their messages of support while posting their photos.

'The support and love from my students and community has been almost overwhelming.' Alawadi was found unconscious by her teenage daughter in the dining room of the family home in El Cajon, one of the nation's largest enclaves of Iraqi immigrants. Speaking in the days after her killing, Kassim Alhimidi, the mother-of-five's husband, said: 'The main question we would like to ask is what are you getting out of this and why did you do it?'

"By . Freya Noble And Aap . A Perth man has escaped the death penalty for a second time after a Malaysian court rejected an appeal against his acquittal on drugs charges. Dominic Bird, 34, was accused of supplying 167 grams of methamphetamine to an undercover police officer in March 2012 . He was acquitted on September 4 last year, but was re-arrested minutes before he was about to board a flight home to Australia from Kuala Lumpur airport after prosecutors launched an 11th hour appeal. Scroll down for video . Dominic Bird has escaped the death penalty for the second time since 2012, over drug charges in Malaysia . Possessing more than 50 grams carries a mandatory death penalty in Malaysia. Mr Bird was freed on Wednesday afternoon as he fronted the Malaysian Court of Appeal. He claimed he was set up by a police officer who planted the substance on him, drug squad detective Luther Nurjib. There is still a chance prosecutors may launch one more appeal. Mr Bird said earlier on Wednesday he was prepared for that prospect. 'I'm remaining optimistic about the result, I think we'll do well,' he told AAP. Mr Bird (right) leaving the Malaysia High Court a free man for the second time with his lawyer Muhammed Shafee Abdullah (left) 'I've prepared myself for the DPP (Department of Public Prosecutions) appealing again, so that's still an option they can exercise.' Before the court's decision, Mr Bird said he would try to leave for Australian immediately if the prosecution's appeal was rejected. His lawyer, Muhammed Shafee Abdullah, in earlier hearings had argued that the arrest at the boarding gate at Malaysia's international airport was unconstitutional on the grounds his client had been declared by the Kuala Lumpur High Court to be a free man. But Court of Appeal Justice Azahar Mohamed rejected that argument, and ruled the arrest was lawful, and that the appeal was simply a continuation of the trial. Mr Bird, having already spent more than 18 months behind bars, was granted bail pending the outcome of the appeal. He was accused of possessing 167 grams of the illegal substance while at a cafe near his home in Kualar Lumpur. The prosecution have one more chance to appeal against the Perth man's sentence, pictured here with his father Clayton Bird (right) Prosecutor Awang Armadajaya told AAP he would consult with his superiors at the Attorney-General's office about whether or not to pursue Mr Bird. The prosecution has 14 days to appeal, and Mr Awang said he may seek an injunction to prevent Mr Bird from leaving Malaysia while the Attorney-General's office considers its options. In a unanimous decision, the panel of three judges ruled that the trial judge had not erred in throwing out the testimony of Inspector Luther, and that the defence had presented enough reasonable doubt to warrant acquittal. Justice Aziah Ali, the chairwoman of the panel of three judges, said that it was clear from the High Court judge's earlier ruling that he had found Inspector Luther to be completely unreliable as a witness. 'That's the difficulty for you because your witness on whose evidence the case of the prosecution lies has been found to be not credible - a liar,' Justice Aziah said in an address to the prosecutor. Also at question was whether it was Inspector Luther or Mr Bird who had arrived at the cafe carrying a bag that contained the drugs, after two witnesses at trial gave contradictory testimony.","Dominic Bird was arrested in March 2012 accused of possessing 167 grams of methamphetamine .

"By . James Rush . Arrest: A 75-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of planting a home-made bomb which exploded outside the Aisha Mosque and Islamic Centre (pictured) in Walsall . Counter-terrorism detectives have arrested a 75-year-old pensioner in connection with planting a home-made bomb which exploded outside a mosque. The elderly man was detained by West Midlands Police yesterday afternoon on suspicion of causing an explosion likely to endanger life or damage property. Officers were called to reports of a suspicious item at the Aisha Mosque and Islamic Centre in Walsall, West Midlands, last Saturday. Army personnel ordered the evacuation of 150 people from almost 40 homes in the vicinity of the place of worship after bomb disposal experts were called to the scene. Despite the device exploding outside the perimeter building on Friday night witnesses did not realise the significance of the 'loud bang' and failed to report the incident. The following morning a member of the public found the device in the mosque grounds before taking it inside the building. Nobody was injured in the attack and the DIY explosive caused minimal damage. Detectives are treating the incident as a hate crime and were today continuing to question the man as well as searching his home address in Walsall. A police spokesman said: 'The arrest comes as part of a major investigation by specialist detectives and experts from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. 'He has been taken to a police station in the West Midlands where he is being questioned by detectives. 'His home address is being searched as part of the investigation. 'Witnesses say that the device exploded outside the perimeter building on Friday night but not realising the significance of the 'loud bang', they did not report the matter to police. 'It was only when a well-meaning member . of the public recovered the debris and brought it inside the mosque the . following day that police were contacted. A significant investigation was immediately launched.' Forensics: Officers were called to reports of a suspicious item at the mosque last Saturday . Concern: About 150 people had be evacuated from almost 40 homes following the discovery of the item . Speaking at the time of the attack Zia Ul-Haq, a committee member and spokesman for the mosque, said: 'It (the bomb) was found by one of our worshippers who after midday prayer was going home, and he had a look and it looked suspicious, so he picked it up and took it home. 'He showed it his wife and his wife said, ""Well, it looks like something suspicious so you should take it to the mosque"". 'So he brought it to the mosque but unfortunately there was nobody responsible in the mosque so he took it back home. 'Then he brought it back in the evening . and then our imam had a look at it, and he took it home because nobody . thought it was that serious. Investigation: Police near the mosque in Walsall after the discovery of a suspicious item . 'I said it looks suspicious and we decided to call the police. As soon as the police came they said we should not have handled it.' The incident comes after a number of recent events at mosques following the death of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich, London. Two men were charged in relation to an alleged arson at a mosque in Gloucester, and an Islamic cultural centre in Grimsby was hit by petrol bombs last month. Earlier this week a mosque in Redditch, Worcestershire, was targetted by racist thugs who scrawled racist graffiti on the walls and windows.

"Australian airline passengers will be affected by tightened airport anti-terror checks on electronic gadgets, the government has confirmed. Tests on mobile phones, laptops and tablets that had been limited to passengers flying from the UK to the US will now be massively expanded to cover destinations around the world. Although the extra measures will not be in place at Australian airports, passengers travelling through affected terminals will have their devices tested, creating possible delays. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A dramatic escalation of airport anti-terror checks on electronic gadgets was announced by ministers . The new measures are understood to affect hundreds more flights to and from the Middle East and volatile parts of Africa and Asia, including popular summer holiday destinations such as Egypt. Qantas code-shares with Dubai-based Emirates, meaning flights from Australia could be affected. 'The extra measures have been implemented due to concerns around a heightened terrorist threat to aviation for direct flights to the US and UK and mean that travellers departing these locations on US and UK-bound flights may experience additional security screening either at the main security checkpoint or at their boarding gate,' a spokesman for Federal Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said. 'These measures may apply to passengers departing and transiting through affected airports, including Australian carriers – Qantas and Virgin Australia and their code-share airlines. 'At this stage, the Australian Government is not requiring additional security measures for any international inbound or outbound flights to Australia and the National Public Terrorism Alert Level remains unchanged at MEDIUM.' Under the measures, travellers will have to prove their electronic devices – some with a notoriously short battery life – are working normally, following fears that terrorists could pack the battery compartments with explosives. The development, which comes at the start of the European summer holiday season, is based on US intelligence amid fears of an attack by Islamist extremists. Security officials are concerned that a booby-trapped electronic device could be smuggled onto a plane and used as a bomb by Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or the Islamist Nusra Front, Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria. In 2009, Yemen-linked explosives expert Ibrahim al-Asiri was behind a similar plot and built an ‘underwear bomb’, used in a failed attempt to bring down a plane from Amsterdam bound for Detroit. Tests on mobile phones, laptops and tablets will now be expanded to cover destinations around the world . Passengers were first warned last week . of extra checks on phones, and on Monday British Airways said it would . ban travellers from boarding US-bound flights if their electronic . devices were not charged. It . performed a partial U-turn yesterday, announcing that anyone whose . devices had a flat battery could still fly – but they would have to . leave their gadgets behind, and pay for them to be sent to their home . address. Official advice to . travellers from the UK's Department for Transport had previously been limited . to those ‘flying to the USA’. It now affects those ‘flying to and from . the UK’, and states: ‘Make sure your electronic devices are charged . before you travel. If your device doesn’t switch on, you won’t be . allowed to bring it on to the aircraft.’ Gadgets packed in checked luggage will . continue to be scanned as normal. Passengers whose devices are deemed . to be suspicious could be prevented from leaving them in the hold – and . could be barred from getting on flights altogether. UK Transport . Secretary Patrick McLoughlin  said yesterday that ‘passengers may . notice additional security measures on some routes both to and from the . UK’. A DfT spokesman added: . ‘In line with the US advice, passengers on some routes into and out of . the UK may now also be required to show that electronic devices in their . hand luggage are powered up or face not being allowed to bring the . device onto the aircraft.’ Mr . McLoughlin told the House of Commons that the new advice ‘is in line . with that issued by the US, and we have updated our official advice to . passengers accordingly’.

"By . Harriet Arkell . and Rebecca English . Prince William envies his younger brother flying helicopters on the frontline while Prince Harry envies William his satisfying job and cosy family set-up, the younger Prince revealed today. In an honest interview conducted before the 28-year-old Prince Harry flew back to Britain after a 20-week tour of Afghanistan, he shed light on his relationship with his brother. And he revealed that Prince William is privately frustrated at not being able to serve on the frontline because of his future role. Prince William, left, works as a Search and Rescue pilot while Harry, right, is a co-pilot gunner in Helmand . Prince Harry, who has just finished his second deployment in Afghanistan, where he was a co-pilot gunner in Apache helicopters, said: 'I think there is a bit of jealousy, not just the fact that I get to fly this, but obviously he'd love to be out here. 'And to be honest with you, I don't see why he couldn't. 'His job out here would be flying the IRT [Immediate Response Team], or whatever, doing Chinook missions.  Just the same as us - no-one knows who's in the cockpit. 'Yes you get shot at, but if the guys who are doing the same job as us are being shot at on the ground, I don't think there's anything wrong with us being shot at as well. 'People back home will have issues with that, but we're not special. The guys out there are, simple as that.' William, 30, the future Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, is an RAF Flight Lieutenant and works as a Search and Rescue Force pilot on Sea King helicopters. Daring job: Harry's Apache helicopter work in the Afghan desert is envied by his older brother William . Based at RAF Valley on Anglesey in North Wales, he commands missions to help stranded climbers and stricken vessels in the area. Prince Harry revealed there is envy on both sides. 'Before coming out here I was very jealous of my brother,' he said. 'It's operational flying back home. You get all the luxuries of operational flying - the pride, as you call it - and the reward of basically saving people's lives, which is exactly what we try and do as well. 'And back home he gets to go home to his wife and dog, whereas out here we don't. We're stuck playing PlayStation in a tent full of men.' While Harry flies an Apache helicopter, his older brother flies a completely different Sea King helicopter. 'He could fly this. I'd like to think I could fly his,' he said. William's bedroom is probably nicer than this sleeping area that Prince Harry called home for 20 weeks . Captain Wales, as Harry is known in the army, added with a brotherly dig: ‘His job's very cool, and I think he's doing a wonderful job. Even though he's in the RAF.’ Harry is the latest in a long line of royals who have served in the Armed Forces, particularly flying helicopters. The Prince of Wales and Duke of York both trained as helicopter pilots, with Andrew taking part in missions in the Falklands War. But Harry revealed it is not just the family association with rotary aircraft that intrigued him and his brother. ‘Probably the fact that you can only fit a certain amount of people in a helicopter, therefore no one can follow us - like you guys,’ he joked with the press. ‘Our father flew, our uncle's flown, all sorts of people have flown in my family. Top Gun: Prince Harry enjoyed his work escorting Chinook helicopters on daring missions in Helmand . ‘And I wouldn't suggest that's where it's come from, but it is great fun, and I was given the opportunity in the end, and I couldn't say no to it.’ In the interview Prince Harry, who is '100 per cent single', also spoke of his happiness about becoming an uncle this summer. 'Obviously I'm thrilled for both of them,' he said in Helmand shortly after news of the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy came out. 'It's about time,' he joked.  'I can't wait to be an uncle.' He said he had telephoned the future parents to congratulate them, adding: 'Of course I have - I had a chat to them.' Asked if there was pressure on him to settle down, he said: 'I don't think you can ever be urged to settle down. 'If you find the right person and everything feels right, then it takes time, especially for myself and my brother. 'You ain't ever going to find someone who's going to jump into the position that it would hold, simple as that.'","Prince Harry says William envied him his daring job in Afghanistan .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Despite all the hype surrounding this year’s high-brow best-seller, Capital In The 21st Century by Left-wing French economist Thomas Piketty, a survey has revealed that more than a quarter of those who picked up the 685-page tome never got past page 26, and only just over  2 per cent of readers finished it. Hillary Clinton’s memoir scored even lower, according to U.S. Professor Jordan Ellenberg, who conducted an analysis of Kindle ebooks using a method of calculation he called The Hawking Index — named after Stephen Hawking, author of A Brief History Of Time, which has been called the most unread book of all time. Here, we asked five writers to confess to the books they have failed to finish . . . Amanda Craig feels guilty about not finishing Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall, which won the Man Booker Prize . Amanda Craig, Novelist . The book I feel guiltiest about not finishing is Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall, which began her phenomenal success in winning the Man Booker Prize for two novels in succession. As a big fan of her early work and her doughty yet kindly personality, I was hoping it would be her breakthrough. To my horror, though, I found it to be a novel I had a kind of allergic reaction to. I admit to having difficulties with serious historical fiction set beyond living memory anyway. (Like everyone, I adore the toshy sort when on holiday.) Unless they genuinely break new ground, my view is that it’s better to read a biography or the literature of the time. At least you’d be closer to the truth — as far as we can ever know it. Mantel’s hero is Thomas Cromwell, whose rise from blacksmith’s son to the second most powerful man in the court of Henry VIII is largely unexplained. Again and again, I kept trying to read the novel, which most of my friends were raving about, but kept foundering on its jarring use of the historic present. The emotions were muted; the dialogue unconvincingly modern and I couldn’t care less about any of the characters. Friends and fellow authors seemed hypnotised by Mantel’s own life-story, and accused me of being envious. Far from it — I longed to join the happy throng, but I wasn’t prepared to lie about having got beyond page 56. I tried every technique: dipping in and out, skipping to the end, on four-hour train journeys, 12-hour aeroplane journeys. The only thing worse was Eleanor Catton’s monumentally pretentious The Luminaries. However, The Luminaries reduces me to quivering rage rather than the baffled state of wistful somnolence brought on by Wolf Hall. It remains a sovereign cure for insomnia. War and Peace and Love In The Time Of Cholera are among the books that Jeremy Vine faltered with . Jeremy Vine, Radio 2 presenter . My father has only one vice. A non-smoking, non-drinking squash player who got an enviable degree from Cambridge University and preaches occasionally at the local church, Dad does not appear at first glance to lead a dissolute life. But look more closely at the books on his shelves and you will notice a disturbing thing. Each of them has a bookmark in. Each has been abandoned at roughly the same point. As a young boy, I saw my father get into terrible trouble with The History Of The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire, the colossal work by Edward Gibbon which famously has 71 chapters and footnotes in Latin. An ardent reader, Dad had completed all three volumes of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago, and now ambitiously set about tackling Gibbon. He began when I was 11. By the time I went to university, he was on chapter three. He then surrendered. As a result, I made myself the quiet promise that I would never give up on a book, no matter how tiresome it became. Books must be finished. My rule held for 20 years. But then Italian show-off Umberto Eco’s The Name Of The Rose did to me what the Roman Empire did to my dad. The book expected me to care about a murdering monk — all the while throwing gratuitous literary references at me. Since then I have faltered with others: David Mitchell’s time-travelling romp Cloud Atlas; Tolstoy’s War And Peace (has anyone read that?); Love In The Time Of Cholera (the novel by the Nobel Prize-winning Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Márquez; and Hitler & Stalin: Parallel Lives, by Alan Bullock (the cover frightened people on a family holiday). Tolstoy's classic Anna Karenina left Griff Rhys Jones feeling cold. He's resolved to read it now . Griff Rhys Jones, Comedian . I am stuck on Anna Karenina. I managed quite a lot of the close print and descriptions of horse-races. It wasn’t the long silly names or the trains that defeated me, it was time itself. The failure to persevere past Tolstoy’s first 400 pages was a combination of circumstances, whimsicality and bulk. The circumstances have to do with a slight lax period about three years ago, when I had a summer gap between two of my TV projects — Tribal Art and A Great Welsh Adventure — a hot day, a hammock, time on my hands. I decided that a big book with big themes could be my summer companion. And I reached for the great looming brick of words. Apparently, as the introduction told me, everyone can remember when they first surrendered to the power of the hypnotic Russian romance, and the long days that it took them over and changed their attitudes. Except in my case, the book is still in the pile by my bed and, clue here, it has dust on it. That’s a bad sign. It has been there some time, with a dog-ear on a page about half-way through. Frankly, the thing is the size of a loaf of bread. It is not something you can stuff down your trousers in meetings. Or carry about on the Tube. That’s the trouble with it. I have got a Kindle now. Indeed, it’s amazing the number of unfinished books you can put on your Kindle. And I have downloaded Anna Karenina in a different translation. I remember that, at first, I loved the idea of Anna: her passion and high-necked blouses and the dashing cavalry stuff and the worthy farmer and all. But one of the problems with reading the book at 60 years of age is that I now have too much sympathy with the supposedly dull husband and the children — and not the beautiful, heavy-breathing woman. Mind you, writing this, I’ve resolved to finish it. In fact, I think I will go and get it from my bedside table. First though, I just have to read these six or seven books about Zambia, where I am headed next. Jenni Murray hated Marcel Proust's A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu, which she had to read in university . Jenni Murray, Woman’s Hour presenter . Marcel Proust’s A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu (In Search Of Lost Time) — all 3,000 pages of it — was on my reading list at university as part of my degree in French and Drama. I wasn’t sure I’d even be able to carry it home. It’s what’s known, literally and metaphorically, as a weighty tome. It’s made up of seven volumes and is loved and hated in equal measure. I hated it. I began it in French, quickly bought an English translation, but soon found the long, tortuous sentences just as difficult to get a grip on in my mother tongue. And then, on and on Proust went about the making of a cup of tea and the scent of the madeleine (a little French cake) as he dipped it into the tea. (‘A disgusting habit,’ my mother would have said.) I got to around page 70 before abandoning the task and took the advice of a fellow student who’d found a Bluffer’s Guide To Proust and assured me: ‘All you need to know is he was closet gay, adored his mother, suffered from asthma and is obsessed with how smells and stuff evoke memory.’ I took him at his word and got through the exam without too much disgrace. I was only 19 and it’s no wonder that I told myself life was too short to be bothered with a book that totally failed to inspire me. For years after, it winked at me from the bookshelf — challenging me to have another go. Indeed, I tried it again soon after my 60th birthday, but didn’t get as far as I had first time around. Life now was definitely too short. Roger Lewis can't stand celebrity memoirs, including those by Alan Carr and Simon Pegg . Roger Lewis, Daily Mail book critic . The shelves in Oxfam shops are clogged with books that people have given up on. They include ‘humorous’ books by Dawn French and Jeremy Clarkson, and all those paperbacks purchased at the airport before the annual fortnight on the beach, or hardbacks exchanged by relatives at Christmas and discarded by New Year’s Day. Among them are the ghosted memoirs of so-called celebrities such as Alan Carr, Simon Pegg, Paul O’Grady and Michael McIntyre. These are the books, too, that I’ve never managed to finish. I’ve read James Joyce. I know my way round Ezra Pound. But celebrity memoirs are anathema. I throw them away in exasperation. The annoying thing about the autobiographies of, say, comedians Rob Brydon or Johnny Vegas, is that they come packaged as confessional and candid, but tell us nothing. Entire marriages are often edited out. The boring descriptions of Sixties or Seventies childhoods are interchangeable. There are always lame stories about eccentric school dinner-ladies, watching Morecambe & Wise on the box, appearances in school plays, stints at provincial universities, early auditions. Above all, money is unmentioned. I’d love to know what the sods earn and who they are really having sex with. Stephen Fry told me that in the early volumes of his memoirs, when discussing his childhood, he would change names, improve events, operate as a novelist. But now that his life-story has reached more or less the present-day, he is inhibited. He has to be nice to fellow luvvies. Unless a person is conveniently dead, such as the comedians Mel Smith or Rik Mayall, celebrities can’t be completely honest about other celebrities in case they sue. Which makes publishing an autobiography absolutely pointless, and in my view they aren’t books but press releases. Against my better judgment, I start them — but never finish a single one.","Only 2% of readers finish Piketty's best-seller Capital In The 21st Century .

"By . Roger Dobson . Jabs of anti-wrinkle drug Botox can ease severe nerve pain triggered by shingles, according to new research. It was found to be more effective than the anaesthetic lidocaine in treating postherpetic neuralgia – a condition in which extreme nerve pain continues for months or even years after a shingles rash has healed. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which lies dormant in the nerves following a chickenpox infection. Shingle treatment: Botox found to be effective in treating postherpetic neuralgia which sees nerve pain continue after a shingles rash has healed . In most cases, the rash and pain lasts two to four weeks, but up to one person in five develops postherpetic neuralgia. The pain can be intense and has been described as a burning or stabbing sensation, in some cases feeling like an electric shock. Occasionally there may be the most severe and continuous itching. Many people with postherpetic neuralgia make a full recovery within a year, but in some cases the nerves do not heal completely and symptoms last for several years or permanently. While most people respond to medication, including tricyclic antidepressants, anti-epileptic drugs or  opioids to reduce the pain,  40 to 50 per cent do not completely respond. Better with botox: The nerve drug has been found to be 'more effective than lidocaine' in treating the condition, which effects one in five shingles patients . A review of evidence by neurologists at Mount Sinai Medical Center in the US concluded botulinum toxin can be highly effective. It is thought to work by blocking the release of chemicals which are involved in the nerve transmission of pain. In a study at the Guangdong Medical School in China, 60 patients were injected with either Botox, lidocaine or a dummy saline solution. In the next few days, pain dropped more significantly in the Botox group compared with the others. ‘The long-lasting effects were accompanied by a low incidence of side effects.  The only significant side effect was the pain of the injections in a few people,’ said the researchers. Dr Nicholas Silver, consultant neurologist at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, said: ‘These studies are highly promising.’","Botox found to be effective in treating postherpetic neuralgia .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Throughout history, fireworks have been used to celebrate historic moments in time - from the dominance of the Tang Dynasty to the declaration of independence and the intervention of the gunpowder plot. Popularity for the explosive displays rose during the 18th century and an archived manuscript has revealed how amateur makers would have created their own fireworks at home. The 232-page book, titled Artificial Fireworks, was produced in 1785 and features step-by-step instructions, tables of work and diagrams. Explore the book below . The 232-page book, (pictured) titled Artificial Fireworks, was produced in 1785 and later archived by California-based Getty Institute. It was handwritten by John Maskell and each chapter details how to create different types of fireworks . Each chapter details how to create different types of fireworks, including the Fruiloni and Vertical Wheels, and Sky and Caduceus Rockets. For example, the Friulion Wheel is made of beech wood using two, 2oz (56g) cases made from clay, joined together with 12 spokes; six on the top and six on the bottom. The common 'fire' used in the cases consists of 1lb (453g) of 'Healed Powder', 4oz (113g) of saltpetre, 2oz (56g) of sulphur and 4oz (113g) of charcoal. Iron filings were also added to the cases, which had to be ‘very clean and bright.’ The book also advises sifting the powders through a hair sieve.

The common 'fire' used in the cases consists of 1lb (453g) of 'Healed Powder', 4oz (113g) of saltpetre, 2oz (56g) of sulphur and 4oz (113g) of charcoal . One Vertical Wheel is designed to celebrate the marriage of King George III and the teenage Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1761, and features a tin crown (pictured) on top . According to the manual, Vertical Wheels are ‘likewise calculated for 2oz cases’, and are ‘nearly the same size as Fruiloni, but the block is not so long and the spokes are only turned so as just to clear the cases and give room for communicating, typing and pasting.’ One Vertical Wheel in the book has even been  designed to celebrate the marriage of King George III and the teenage Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1761, and features a tin crown on top of the structure. Maskell also reveals the best way to create Sky Rockets and states that although military moulds are made of brass, wooden moulds ‘answer very well.’ Paper and powder are then rolled and placed inside circular tubes to form the finished rocket. Maskell also advises against cutting shapes on a table, so not to ‘spoil’ the surfaces. Fireworks can be traced back to ancient China, around the time of the Han Dynasty between 206 and 220 BC. During that period, it was discovered that when rods of bamboo were lit on fire, they began to crackle and eventually exploded. People . were said to have found the noise so terrifying, they would use 'pao . chuk', or ‘bursting bamboo’, to frighten away evil spirits.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Every living thing on Earth depends on a mysterious tangle of molecules called ribosomes. These are the cell’s protein factories, translating the genetic information in DNA into an amino acid sequence to create proteins. Scientists believe that the ribosome - whose history is difficult to track - holds clues to how the first molecules of life came together around four billion years ago. Scroll down for video . In a new study, scientists compared three-dimensional structures of ribosomes from a variety of species of varying biological complexity, including humans, yeast, bacteria and archaea. The researchers found distinct fingerprints in the ribosomes where new structures were added to its surface . Now researchers are a step closer to uncovering these clues after modelling the evolution of these biological factories in unprecedented detail. Ribosomes are the biological superstructures that translate genetic information into proteins. These small biosynthetic factories convert the DNA genetic information into an amino acid sequence – which is the primary structure of proteins that make up our body. In each living cell, the information contained in the nucleus of a cell is 'transferred' to a messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to something known as the endoplasmic reticulum where two ribosome subunits assemble around it and start synthesising proteins. Hundreds of thousands of ribosomes work in each living cell. For example, quickly replicating cells, such as liver cells, may contain a few million ribosomes. Even bacterial cells may contain up to 100,000 ribosomes. The core of the ribosome is essentially the same in all living systems, while the outer regions expand and become complicated as species gain complexity. By digitally peeling back the layers of modern ribosomes, scientists at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta were able to model the structures of the very first of these biological factories. 'The history of the ribosome tells us about the origin of life,' said Loren Williams, a professor in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 'We have worked out on a fine level of detail how the ribosome originated and evolved.' Humans have the largest and most complex ribosomes. 'But the changes are on the surface – researchers found the heart of a human ribosome is the same as in a mould ribosome. Pictured are ribosomes from the salivary gland of an insect. Ribosomes are the biological superstructures that translate genetic information into proteins.These small biosynthetic factories convert the DNA genetic information into an amino acid sequence – which is the primary structure of proteins that make up our body . 'The translation system is the operating system of life,' Professor Williams said. 'At its core the ribosome is the same everywhere. The ribosome is universal biology.' The study compared three-dimensional structures of ribosomes from a variety of species of varying biological complexity, including humans, yeast, bacteria and archaea. The researchers found distinct fingerprints in the ribosomes where new structures were added to the ribosomal surface without altering the core. The research team worked the process backwards in time to generate models of simple, primordial ribosomes. 'We learned some of the rules of the ribosome, that evolution can change the ribosome as long as it does not mess with its core,' Professor Williams said. 'Evolution can add things on, but it can’t change what was already there.' Hundreds of thousands of ribosomes work in each living cell. For example, quickly replicating cells, such as liver cells, may contain a few million ribosomes. Even bacterial cells may contain up to 100,000 ribosomes.

"By . Mark Prigg . They are a marvel of modern engineering - thin, virtually invisible, yet containing a computer and video camera. Yet these tiny gadgets are causing major problems for banks - by 'skimming' credit card numbers and even recording PIN numbers. The latest devices were revealed today as part of a new report from the European ATM Security Team (EAST), which warns they are already in use across Europe - with many of the fraudulent numbers being shipped to the US. A mini-skimmer designed to slip inside of an NCR ATM's card acceptance slot: Experts warn they are becoming more advanced and commonplace across the world . The miniaturized insert skimmer above was used in tandem with a tiny spy camera to record each customer¿s PIN. The image on the left shows the hidden camera situated just to the left of the large square battery; the photo on the right shows the false ATM fascia that obscures the hidden camera as it was found attached to the compromised ATM (notice the tiny pinhole at the top left edge of the device). Pictured below is a device designed to capture the data stored on an ATM card’s magnetic stripe as the card is inserted into the machine. While most card skimmers are made to sit directly on top of the existing card slot, these newer mini-skimmers fit snugly inside the card reader throat, obscuring most of the device. This card skimmer was made to fit inside certain kinds of cash machines made by NCR. According to a new report from the European ATM Security Team (EAST), a novel form of mini-skimmer was reported by one country. While most card skimmers are made to sit directly on top of the existing card slot, these newer mini-skimmers fit snugly inside the card reader throat, obscuring most of the device. This card skimmer was made to fit inside certain kinds of cash machines made by NCR. 'New versions of insert skimmers (skimmers placed inside the card reader throat) are getting harder to detect,' the EAST report concludes. The miniaturized insert skimmer was used in tandem with a tiny spy camera to record each customer’s PIN. The image on the left shows the hidden camera situated just to the left of the large square battery; the photo on the right shows the false ATM fascia that obscures the hidden camera as it was found attached to the compromised ATM (notice the tiny pinhole at the top left edge of the device). Researchers say many of the fraudulent details are sent to the US where they are used to withdraw money . The report also warns that the United States is the last of the G-20 nations that has yet to transition to chip & PIN. 'Card skimming at ATMs was reported by eighteen countries, with increases reported by six countries and decreases by four countries,' the organisation said. 'A new form of mini-skimmer was seen in one country and another reported that skimming devices are being left in place for longer periods (4-5 days on average).' 'Most ATM cards issued in Europe have a magnetic stripe on them for backwards compatibility when customers travel to this country,' said Brian Krebs, a security researcher. 'Naturally, ATM hackers in Europe will ship the stolen card data over to thieves here in the U.S., who then can encode the stolen card data onto fresh (chipless) cards and pull cash out of the machines here and in Latin America.' 'In countries where the ATM EMV rollout has been completed most losses have migrated away from Europe and are mainly seen in the USA, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America,” the EAST report said.","Latest devices small enough to fit inside card slots .

"By . Bianca London . Men start becoming ‘invisible’ sexually to younger women at 39 - the same age as David Beckham and Russell Brand, according to new research. They begin turning into ‘The Invisible Man’ from the end of their 30s onwards - and are viewed more as father figures than sex symbols. The most obvious sign of the change is when a man is no longer eyed up by women when he goes out. Scroll down for video . Has he lost his Becks appeal? At 39, David Beckham is at the age when men apparently become 'invisible' sexually to younger women, right, and, left, back in 2005 when he was 30 . Other ways to work out if you have turned into The Invisible Man are the first flecks of grey hair and the emergence of a double chin.

Russell Brand, left, and Bradley Cooper are also at the age where women believe the first flecks of grey hair and the emergence of a double chin make them unattractive . Other famous 39-year-olds include the comedian Russell Brand and Hollywood stars Bradley Cooper and Leonardo DiCaprio. In the survey, 52 per cent of respondents said that men start to lose their allure to opposite sex as they are about to turn 40. This was due to a number of factors - not all concerned with ageing. 1. Women no longer eye you up in a bar2. Greying hair 3. Double chin4. Thinning hair5. Bad teeth . Six out of ten women (62 per cent) assume that most men in their late 30s are attached by that age and are not worth approaching. No longer being chatted up or eyed up on a night out was the clearest sign for both sexes that a man had become invisible - chosen by 54 per cent of respondents. The second most popular sign was greying hair - picked by 37 per cent of those surveyed. Other signs included a double chin, thinning hair and having bad teeth. A spokesperson from the Crown Clinic Manchester, who commissioned the survey, said: 'Turning 40 is key turning point and it is the most popular age for men to seek a hair transplant. 'You only have to look at Robbie Williams to see how true that is. He turned 40 in February and admitted having a transplant to fill out his temples where he had started to lose his hair. He clearly didn’t want to become ""The Invisible Man"".' Has Leo lost it? Six out of ten women assume that most men in their late 30s, like Leonardo DiCaprio, pictured, left, this year and, right, aged 25 in The Beach in 2000, are attached by that age and are not worth approaching .","Men begin turning into 'The Invisible Man' from the end of their 30s onwards .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . The U.S. men’s soccer team regained its swagger against Ghana just in time to face a Portugal team limping into Sunday’s match with stars missing from injury or suspension. Portugal’s two best defenders, a striker and their starting goalkeeper will not play. Another defender will be a game time decision and best player in the world Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to play despite reportedly suffering a career-threatening knee injury. The U.S. side has lost striker Jozy Altidore to injury and team captain Clint Dempsey has a broken nose but will play. Both teams are licking their wounds after only one match, but the Portuguese are a lot more vulnerable. Man down: Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo has ice put on his left knee after a Wednesday training session . The U.S. lost its best player: Striker Jozy Altidore (at right) screams while grabbing his left leg as Ghana's John Boye jogs past - Altidore is not expected to recover until after the World Cup . Broken nose: Clint Dempsey of the U.S. lies on the pitch injured after being kicked in the face by Boye (not pictured) during their 2014 World Cup Group G soccer match earlier this week . Reports out of Brazil earlier this week painted a dire picture for Portugal as it was revealed a team doctor told Ronaldo to pull out of the World Cup over fears a knee injury he has been suffering from for months could ruin the rest of his career. The Ballon d’or winner as world player of the year has been battling tendinitis in his left knee and thigh injuries, and doctors have warned continuing to sprint up and down the pitch could result in him tearing the patellar tendon, according to a Spanish newspaper. Ronaldo was then seen limping away from a practice field Thursday while icing his ailing knee, but several teammates have since insisted that he is fit and ready to go. ‘Cristiano is 100 percent fit to play,’ backup Portugal goalkeeper Beto said Friday. ‘Every match, if he starts to play, it is because he is fit to play.’ Midfielder Raul Meireles said he expects Ronaldo by his side when the whistle blows. ‘Cristiano played the last game,’ Meireles said during a Saturday news conference. ‘He trains every day with all of us. Cristiano is fit to play, that's all I can say.’ Injured: Portugal defender Fabio Coentrao, pictured playing against Germany, will miss Sunday's game . Out: Portugal forward Hugo Almeida (R) will also miss Sunday's match after suffering an injury versus Germany . Huge loss: Portuguese goalkeeper Rui Patricio will not play, Beto will take his place . The U.S. is taking no chances and expects Ronaldo to be at full strength. ‘We have to be ready for him,’ United States defender Fabian Johnson said. ‘If he's going to play or not, we have to be ready for him.’ Other starting players out with injuries include defender Fabio Coentrao, forward Hugo Almeida and goalkeeper Rui Patricio. ‘At the moment, we have four players who . will not be playing [on Sunday],’ Portugal manager Paulo Bento said, according to ESPN. ‘Secondly there is a possibility of having another absence, and I'm . talking about Bruno [Alves] who will not train today. We will only . decide today if he will play.’ Defender Pepe, widely considered the team’s best, is missing the game due to suspension. He was sent off with a red card during the match against Germany. Another defender, Bruno Alves, is working his way back from a serious thigh injury, it is not known if he will be in the starting 11. Escaping the ‘group of death’ the U.S. was slotted looks much more likely despite the Americans’ best striker, Altidore, possibly being out for the duration of the tournament with a strained right hamstring. On the fence: Defender Bruno Alves, of Portugal, may or may not play, according to the team's manager . Banned: Portugal's defender Pepe gestures during a training session at the team's base camp in Campinas, he will miss the match versus the U.S. after being sent off with a red card against Germany . In the middle of a rainforest: The US Men's National Team stretches Saturday prior to training at Arena Amazonia . Looking for more of this: John Brooks (center bottom face down) of USA is celebrated by his teammates after scoring the winning goal during the FIFA World Cup 2014 group G preliminary round match between Ghana - keeping the ball away from Ronaldo could lead to more celebrations for the U.S. like this one . Another challenge facing both teams is the game’s venue – a city in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest. Manaus is considered one of the hottest cities in the world, but Arena del Amazonia is expected to be inundated with torrential rains for the majority of the match. Portugal is desperate for a win – losing to the U.S. would eliminate the team from advancing to the knockout stage of the tournament – but faces a tough challenge with many players out and their biggest star limping to the finish. A win means the U.S. would advance to the knockout stage for second World Cup in a row, something it has never done. The U.S. beat Portugal during the 2002 World Cup and hopes to repeat the feat Sunday, but it will need to improve upon its ghastly passing during the match against Ghana. The . ‘That was a problem against Ghana, but I think it was the first game so you’re going to be a little bit nervous,’ midfielder Jermaine Jones said. ‘We have a win, so we can go win the next game with more trust in ourselves… take the ball and try to hold the ball better.’ Star midfielder Michael Bradley, perhaps the best player on the team with Altidore out, agreed, but also said the best teams win games in different ways. Keeping the ball away from Ronaldo is the only way the U.S. can hope to win this match and make it to the next round.","Portugal has four starters out of the match including their best defender and star goalkeeper .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . 'Scandal': Ben Stein, 69, penned a column describing beautiful women he met during a tour . Former Nixon speechwriter Ben Stein, best known for his role on 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', has penned a bizarre essay about his 'crushes' on beautiful women he meets as he travels. In a column for The American Spectator, the former New York Times writer, who has been married to attorney Alexandra Denman for 45 years, wrote about women he met on a recent speaking tour in California. Among them were an 'absolute knockout young Eurasian woman', three adorable coeds', a 'beautiful cocktail party girl' and a 'breathtakingly beautiful middle-aged woman'. After the column was published, the National Enquirer accused him of being in a 'sexting scandal' with one of the women - saying he asked her to be his secret girlfriend and sent her money - but he said she had gone to the tabloid simply because he refused to pay for an expensive hotel for her. He insisted that his wife knew about the women he met. In the column, he wrote about a never-ending string of beautiful women he met as he traveled. 'My main obsessions in my life are my . wife, my dog, my son and his family, my secret GF from Mississippi, and . any beautiful girl I meet,' he wrote. 'I am like a teenager. I get mad . crushes.' He . wrote that he had met an 'absolute . knockout young Eurasian woman', who he learned was a former call girl. She asked him to help her become a writer - but he said there was little . he could do. After meeting, they texted daily before she revealed that she was . pregnant by a man she'd had a brief relationship with. Married: He has been married to attorney Alexandra Denman for 45 years and insisted that she always knows about the women he meets and speaks to. He said there was no sexting scandal . 'I'll just be a single mom,' she texted him. 'Will you help me out?' He wrote: 'I am so pro-life that I can never say no in these cases but I am worried about it.' That same weekend, he went on to meet 'three adorable coeds', a 'beautiful cocktail party girl' and a 'breathtakingly beautiful middle-aged woman... with a figure that is close to unbelievable'. It is this woman who is the subject of the 'sexting scandal' accusations, he said. 'I'm like a teenager. I get mad crushes' Ben Stein . He wrote that he considered flying her to . his hometown of Los Angeles to go out for 'a lovely dinner' with him . and his wife - until she insisted on staying at the expensive Beverly . Wilshire. After they met she sent him photos of herself having root canal surgery and then a . screen shot of her bill, which was $2,300, he said. The Enquirer claimed Stein had texted, emailed and sent the woman flowers - and had even given her $900. But he told the Enquirer: 'I didn't have sex with her! At my age, I don’t even know if that’s possible.' Speaking to Business Insider, he added that the story had only surfaced because he made 'the unfortunate mistake of meeting a very . vengeful human being who’s very angry that she did not get to stay at . the Beverly Wilshire'. Well known: He famously appeared in the 1986 movie, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, as Bueller's teacher . He added . that he has been writing 'or at least 40 years about the interesting . people I meet' and that his 'secret gf' line had simply been a joke. But he admitted that he had communicated with the women after meeting them and did sometimes send them money. 'They don't even remotely have to be romantically involved with me for me to help them or communicate with them,' he said. Still, he claimed that his wife knew everything about his flirtations and found the latest press coverage funny. 'We were joking that I'm probably the . only person who's ever read 'A Monetary History of the United States' who ended up in the National Enquirer,' he said.","Ben Stein wrote a bizarre American Spectator column in June describing the beautiful women he met while on a speaking tour .

"By . Ruth Styles . For years women have had the monopoly on skin-smoothing products such as Crease Release or 'botox in a jar'. But not anymore. Men's grooming is one of the fastest . growing sectors in the beauty business with men now spending an . estimated £6.2 billion on grooming products and beauty treatments every . year. And now they have their own anti-ageing arsenal on the high street thanks to popular brands like Dermalogica, Yves Saint Laurent, Nip+Fab and L'Oreal developing men-only beauty ranges. One such product is the Manotox from Nip+Fab's Nip+Man range, a plumping, firming moisturiser that claims to give 'amazing anti-ageing results without surgery'. Anti-ageing: Manotox claims to be the non-surgical solution for deep wrinkles, fine lines and uneven skin . According to the company, the secret of . the new product's success is an ingredient called 'liftonin', which is . believed to minimise the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Also in the mix is another new substance called gransil, which claims to help to smoothe the skin, and includes a cocktail of sea minerals to give the complexion a fresher look. According to a survey . conducted by OnePoll, 25 per cent of men now have beauty treatments . such as facials, massages and manicures more than once a fortnight, . while the average man now spends between 40 and 60 minutes getting ready . to go out. The phenomenon has also led to a rise in waxing, with a third of men admitting to 'manscaping' - removing hair from their groin area. Grooming: Men feel under pressure to look like A-listers such as Josh Hartnett (left) and Michael Fassbender . Nip+Man Manotox, £19.95, nipandfab.com . Escentual founder and male grooming expert, Rakesh Aggarwal, said: 'Men are definitely more aware of how to look after their skin and appearance than they were even five years ago. 'Women aren’t the only ones that want to copy their favourite celebrities - with men like Matthew McConaughey, Josh Hartnett and Justin Timberlake having fronted male beauty campaigns, men are feeling the pressure to look groomed and it is now acceptable to admit to making an effort to look good.' The male beauty boom has also spread into the surgery sector, with more men than ever now willing to go under the knife in a quest for the perfect face and body. According to the American Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, men had almost 800,000 cosmetic procedures in 2012, or nine per cent of the total. Particularly popular among male clients are procedures to provide them with the square jaws seen on macho A-listers such as Jon Hamm, Michal Fassbender and Daniel Craig. 'There's less of a desire now for a conventionally beautiful white-bread face,' Dr. Steven Teitelbaum, an associate professor of plastic surgery at UCLA School of Medicine, told Details magazine. 'People are embracing strong features like ethnic, nontraditional noses'.","Manotox claims to reduce wrinkles and fine lines without surgery .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A New Jersey judge on Wednesday put an end to the drawn-out legal battle between Samantha Perelman, the daughter a cosmetics mogul, and her uncle, ruling that the 24-year-old was not cheated out of a share of her grandfather's fortune. Ms Perelman, the daughter of billionaire investor Ronald Perelman and the late gossip columnist Claudia Cohen, has accused her uncle of pressuring and manipulating her palsy-stricken grandfather, Robert Cohen, into denying her a portion of his inheritance. Mr Cohen, the former head of the Hudson News empire, passed away in 2012 leaving a $700million estate, much of which went to his son, James. 'Poor' rich girl: Samantha Perelman, seen here at the 2013 Costume Institute Gala with her billionaire father Ron Perelman, has failed to convince a judge that her uncle had pressured her grandfather to disinherit her . In a 93-page opinion, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Estela M. De La Cruz wrote that James Cohen, Robert's heir who took over the family business after his death, did not exert 'undue influence' over his ailing father to get him to cut his granddaughter out of his will. The decision came after a contentious six-month trial during which Samantha Perelman’s legal team called 20 witnesses to the stand in an attempt to prove that her uncle had plotted to disinherit her. On his part, James Cohen told the court how towards the end of his life, his father suffering from a degenerative nerve and brain disorder that had rendered him speechless was only able to communicate through blinking. According to Mr Cohen, Robert was angry that his son-in-law, the Revlon tycoon Ronald Perelman, was grasping for his fortune even as he lay dying. Wednesday's court ruling cost Samantha Perelman about $30million, a corporate jet, a stake in a Palm Beach mansion and her late grandfather's home in New Jersey, the New York Post reported. ‘We are disappointed with the decision, and believe it is not consistent with the intention and wishes of Robert Cohen with respect to his daughter Claudia and his granddaughter Samantha,’ Perelman family spokeswoman Christine Taylor said in a statement to the New York Times. However, it was not a complete loss for Ms Perelman since Judge De La Cruz ruled that her lawsuit was not frivolous and ordered her uncle to pay her legal fees. The 24-year-old still has the $67million she inherited from her Page Six columnist mother after her death in 2007. Samantha also stands to receive a portion of her father's $14million estate in the future. Mr Perelman, 71, has been married five times, most recently in 2010, and has seven children. Heiresses: Miss Perelman with her late mother, gossip columnist Claudia Cohen, in 2005. She claimed that her mother's brother schemed to exclude her from her grandfather's will as he suffered from Parkinson's . And as far as the Perelman camp is . concerned, it may only be a temporary setback: Samantha’s . spokesperson stated after the verdict that they are now 'evaluating' their . legal options. On his . part, James Cohen expressed hope that the ruling would end the war . within his extended family, which he said made his father's final years . 'a misery.' Throughout the trial, Mr Cohen's team insisted that the son was always respectful of his father and never tried to sway him. The . elder . Cohen, who died aged 86 after a 13-year battle with a Parkinson's-like . condition built Hudson News into a retail empire starting with a . Newark, New Jersey news stand. After his death two years ago, he left the company to his son James, who then sold it and collected $600million from the deal. Miss . Perelman is the daughter of former New York Post's Page Six columnist . Claudia Cohen, James Cohen's sister, who died in 2007 leaving her child . a $67million fortune. Meanwhile, . her father, Ron Perelman, is worth an estimated $14billion, made . through leveraged buyouts of companies and his stake in Revlon . cosmetics. Robert . Cohen's decline began in 1999, when the tycoon was . diagnosed with Parkinson's. In 2004 he was battling liver cancer and . that year also lost control of his limbs and bodily functions. By . 2009, the year he wrote his last will naming his son James as sole . beneficiary, the businessman was so incapacitated that he was unable . even to blink, Samantha Perelman's lawyer had argued. A spokesman . for Miss Perelman previously claimed that she was prevented from seeing her . ailing grandfather in the final years of his life. To the victor go the spoils: James Cohen, seen here with his . wife, spent years battling niece Miss Perelman over millions she accused him of cheated her out of by coercing his late father to change his will . Her lawyer had asked the court to throw out that will and reinstate one . written in 2004, which had left Claudia Perelman, Miss Perelman's late . mother, valuables including a 30-carat diamond ring worth $10million and . his private jet, as well as $25million in cash. Since Miss Perelman was the main beneficiary of her mother's estate, she had stood to inherit most of that fortune.","A New Jersey judge sided with Samantha Perelman's uncle, James Cohen, ruling that he did nothing to coerce his father into changing his will .

"By . Tara Brady . More than 13,500 youngsters under the age of 18 and addicted to cannabis were sent for medical treatment last year (picture posed by model) A record number of children are now being treated for cannabis addiction, according to latest figures. More than 13,500 youngsters under the age of 18 were sent for medical treatment last year. That is a 50 per cent rise in seven years and includes 200 children aged 12 or below. Experts are blaming the popularity of a new super-strength skunk which is several times more potent than regular pot. It has also be linked to an increase in mental illness. Treatment for the 13,581 young addicts averaged 150 days and focuses on counselling and support. Andrew Brown, director of policy at drug information charity DrugScope, said: 'Of course it’s worrying when a child or young adult is using any drug, including cannabis. 'But government research shows that getting young people the help they need early brings benefits to both the individual and the community. 'Every pound spent on treatment for under-18s saves two, reducing the costs of crime and health problems within just two years. 'Unfortunately, drug and alcohol services for young people have seen funding reductions of up to 20 per cent over the last few years – which DrugScope fears is a false economy.' The statistics have been compiled by Public Health England. Cannabis is the most widely-used illegal drug in Britain although the numbers of people using it are falling, according to the charity FRANK. The main active chemical in it is tetrahydrocannabinol (or THC for short). THC is the ingredient in cannabis that can make you feel very chilled out, happy and relaxed. Last month Nick Clegg backed a report which suggests governments should consider the legalisation of cannabis. The Deputy Prime Minister signed a foreword to a study which backs a programme of ‘rigorously monitored’ regulation of illegal drugs. Cannabis is the most widely-used illegal drug in Britain although the numbers of people using it are falling . He endorsed the paper, which condemned the war on drugs as a costly failure and recommended ‘smarter’ drug laws.It said countries should be encouraged to conduct experiments in legalising cannabis, as long as they kept the price of the drug high and controlled its use by rationing. The Home Office has protested that over the past decade cannabis use has been sharply down, indicating that the drug laws and official disapproval of cannabis are working. In the US, the state of Colorado allowed cannabis to go on sale at the start of the year at two dozen shops. State residents aged 21 and over are permitted to buy an ounce, and visitors a quarter ounce.","More than 13,500 youngsters under the age of 18 sent for treatment last year .

"By . Michael Zennie . President Barack Obama voiced support for gay marriage in an interview with ABC News today, the third time he has changed his stance on the issue in his political career. Obama's announcement is a political calculation for his reelection campaign, an attempt to draw a sharp line between himself and Republican Mitt Romney, who opposes gay marriage. The president appears to be banking on the issue, which is heavily supported by younger Americans, to mobilize the youth vote, which has become disaffected during his term in office. Obama had long been suspected of holding this view, but was thought to be afraid to make it public because of the political backlash. The revelation comes the day after voters in the key battleground state of North Carolina approved a strict new ban on same-sex marriage. The measure, which prohibits any civil or domestic benefits for gay couples, passed by a landslide with 61 percent of the vote. Scroll down for video of the interview . Forced: President Barack Obama had to bring forward his announcement in support of gay marriage after Biden's comments . Historic: President Barack Obama is the first sitting US President to publicly support gay marriage. President George W Bush opposed it and President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage act into law . 'At a certain point I’ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married,' the president said. Obama claims the change is a personal one only, and that he he still believes the issue of gay marriage should be left up to the states. Currently, six states allow gay couples to wed and 30 states have constitutional amendments explicitly banning it. Obama said his daughters and their friends were a major reason he changed his mind about gay marriage. 1996, running for Illinois State Senate: 'I favor legalizing same-sex marriages,and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.' 2004, running for US Senate in Illinois: 'My religious faith dictates marriage is between a man and a woman, gay marriage is not a civil right.' 2008, running for US President: 'I believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman. As a Christian it's also a sacred union.' 2010, after Republican wave election: 'My feelings with this are constantly evolving, I struggle with this.' 2012, running for reelection: 'I think same sex couples should be able to get married.' 'You know, Malia and Sasha, they have . friends whose parents are same-sex couples. There have been times where . Michelle and I have been sitting around the dinner table and we’re . talking about their friends and their parents and Malia and Sasha, it . wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be . treated differently,' he said. 'It doesn’t make sense to them and frankly, that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.' Obama had been under intense pressure . to clarify his view toward gay marriage after Vice President Joe Biden . publicly supported it on Sunday. The White House sought out the interview with Robins Roberts, the 'Good Morning America' host, to explain himself. Parts of the interview will air tonight on 'World News Tonight' and also Thursday morning on 'Good Morning America.' Roberts, herself, has never married. Obama seems to be making an election-year political gamble by directly challenging Mitt Romney, his Republican opponent in November. Before the president's remarks today, Romney re-affirmed his opposition to gay marriage. Family affair: Obama said talking to his daughters, Sasha and Malia, about their friends who have gay parents made him believe gays should be allowed to get married . 'When these issues were raised in my state of Massachusetts I indicated my view, which is I do not favor marriage between people of the same gender and I don't favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name,' he told KDVR-TV in Denver. 'My view is that domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate but the others are not.' It could be that Obama is hoping to use the issue to energize young voters, who support gay marriage by way margins. The president, himself, acknowledged the issue is a generational one. 'You know when I go to college campuses, sometimes I talk to college Republicans who think that I have terrible policies on the economy, on foreign policy, but are very clear that when it comes to same sex equality or, you know,  believe in equality. They are much more comfortable with it,' he said in the interview. Last week, Romney's spokesman for foreign policy, Richard Grenel, quit the campaign after he came under fire from some conservatives for being openly gay. Recent . polls show 50 percent of Americans support gay marriage, but also . reveal that the 45 percent who oppose it have strong convictions. This . could explain plain why North Carolina's Amendment 1, which changes the . state constitution to prohibit gay marriage and partnership benefits to . gay couples, won by such a wide margin among voters. Biden's remarks on Sunday set the stage for Obama's announcement. 'I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual – men and women marrying – are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And quite frankly, I don’t see much of a distinction beyond that,' Biden said on Meet the Press.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A U.S. filmmaker has emulated the ageing process by 'creating a person' called Danielle, who subtly changes in front of viewers' eyes from childhood into old age. The five minute video was created by Anthony Cerniello and is a refinement of the 'photo-a-day' concept that was popular a few years ago. Mr Cerniello's 'Danielle' project was not shot over a lifetime, but is made up of photographs of family members of different generations who were photographed in similar conditions at roughly the same time.

The filmmaker, who usually edits commercials and music videos for bands like the Kings of Leon, said: 'The idea was that something was happening but you can't see it but you can feel it' Now clearly older: The filmmaker went to a friend's family reunion and with photographer Keith Scirchio took photos of her youngest cousins through to her oldest relatives . This is the latest and most sophisticated project that fits in a body of photographic and video work by artists to track the ageing process, including the 'portrait-a-day' idea made famous by Noah Kalina's 'Everyday' time lapse project. According to Colossal, Mr Cerniello went to his friend Danielle's family reunion and together with photographer Keith Scirchio, took photos of her youngest cousins through to her oldest relatives. In New York, the duo scanned each photo with a drum scanner and painstakingly edited the photos to select family members with the most similar facial features, including bone structure. Still photos were blended into one another in the most lifelike way possible, smoothing out details like the eyes to make it seem like a seamless ageing process . Now an older version of 'Danielle': the pictures were of select family members with the most similar facial features and bone structure . Old...'Danielle' has finally morphed into an old woman in five minutes . A pair of animators then morphed and animated the still photos to blend them into one another in the most lifelike way possible, smoothing out details like the eyes and hair to make it look like a seamless ageing process. He told the design website: 'I wanted to make a person, I felt like I could tell a story with that, but it ended up feeling slightly robotic, like an android.' He also said that he imagined the accompanying music would tell the story of Danielle's life with 'events speeding up as she aged' but he then decided to opt for abstract sounds.","A U.S. filmmaker has emulated the ageing process by 'creating a person' called Danielle .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Bob the security robot moves around at the G4S Technology offices in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire . It may look more like the robot from 'Lost in Space' than the terrifying droids in 'Terminator', but this machine could be the future of fighting crime. Bob, the first robotic security guard in the UK, is the latest recruit employed by G4S to help secure its headquarters in Gloucestershire. When the metal minder spots something out of place, he stores the information on his internal hard-drive and quickly reports it to his human counterparts. The autonomous android can even speak to his colleagues, ask for help when he gets stuck, and plug himself in to charge when his battery runs low. The blue machine is part of a £7.2 million ($12.2 million) robot pilot project by the University of Birmingham to get robots in offices around the world. ‘Bob is not about replacing our security officers; the security officers are at the point of use,’ said G4S spokesman Stewart Angell. ‘They are able to make incisive, very, very quick decisions about changes in the environment. ‘Bob is a complimentary activity that can do guard tours over a period of time overnight or during the day, but also pick up on some of the low level activities that the guard doesn't necessary need to be involved in.’ Scroll down for video .

It may look like the robot (left) from 'Lost in Space' than a terrifying droid, but Bob (right) could be the future of fight crime, according to scientists at the University of Birmingham . Bob knows the floor plan of the office in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, and rolls from room to room, scanning and filming in 3D. If he spots something has changed since his last visit, he analyses it and sends the information to a real security guard. Using cameras and scanners he is able to create a map of his surrounding area, plotting the location of desks and chairs, as well as detecting people moving, and learning how the environment changes.

It is hoped the pilot project will help Bob (pictured) learn more about coping with other people - and machines - in the workplace . Security robot Bob's ID card at the G4S Technology offices in Tewkesbury is pictured on the left, while the right image shows the control screen used to control Bob's actions . It is hoped the pilot project will help Bob learn more about coping with other people - and machines - in the workplace. Dr Nick Hawes, from the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, said: ‘Current robots aren't very good with their hands, or able to manipulate objects, however Bob is good at driving around and monitoring objects, so is perfect for a job in security as a night or day watchman where he can monitor what is going on in his immediate surroundings. ‘We want to see Bob survive on his own for up to 15 days, doing jobs that are useful for security, for example, checking whether fire doors are obstructed, whether there is paper on desks.’ The project is being led by the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. A similar robot called Werner is currently being tested in a care home in Vienna, Austria, as part of the same project. Werner will carry out similar security duties to Bob, but he is also able to play simple games with residents in the home. In a country dominated by 'kawaii' - or cute culture - Japan has embraced the rise of cuddly robots. Now, one Tokyo-based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world's first droid that can read human emotions. Mobile carrier Softbank said its robot, named Pepper, will go on sale in Japan in February for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900). The machine, which has no legs, but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a Tokyo suburb, cooing and humming. Pepper uses an 'emotional engine' and a cloud-based artificial intelligence to study gestures, expressions and human speech tones. The 48-inch (121 cm) tall, 62 lb (28 kg) white Pepper has no hair, but two large doll-like eyes and a flat-panel display stuck on its chest. It was developed jointly with Aldebaran Robotics, which designs, produces and sells autonomous humanoid robots.","Bob rolls from room to room at G4S offices in Gloucestershire .

"By . Darren Boyle . A Portuguese wildlife photographer captured the dramatic moment a plague of LOCUSTS swarmed across the countryside . Ana Filipa Scarpa was in Vila Franca de Xira, north of Lisbon when she spotted what she initially thought was a dust storm. However, within moments, Ms Filipa Scarpa realised that the 1,000 foot high column was alive and made of insects. Wildlife photographer Ana Filipa Scarpa spotted the bizarre tower of bugs while driving along the road north of Lisbon in Portugal . Ms Filipa Scarpa had initially thought the column was made of dust created by dangerously high winds and initially sought somewhere to shelter . According to Ms Filipa Scarpa, animals including horses seemed disturbed as the column of locusts formed around a quarter of a mile away . The large group of locusts disappeared before they approached Ms Filipa Scara's position . The phenomena - dubbed a Bugnado - was made of red locusts who scour the farmland looking for food. She said: 'At first I believed it was a wind twister, the animals around me were very nervous. 'I stayed in my place and looked for a safe place, but there was none, and at the same time the twister was never reaching me. 'So I entered my car and drove towards it. After same metres I realised that an enormous amount of insects were in fact the tornado. 'I suppose it would be better a wind twister, than a bug twister,' she said. The locusts disappeared before arriving at Ms Filipa Scarpa's position on the roadway. 'I cannot imagine what could happen to me if they had caught me. 'It's not known for sure what kind of bugs make up this swarm, but they may be red locusts. 'The swarm extended perhaps 1,000 ft. It was nearly a quarter of a mile away from my position and I took the picture with a 200 mm lens. 'Perspective makes the leading edge of the swarm appear smaller and thus tapered.' The red locust can have a devastating impact on the developing world where outbreaks can threaten 15 million people with starvation. A special United Nations team has been established to counter the menace presented by red locusts in southern and eastern Africa. The voracious bugs can travel more than 20 miles in a day, devouring crops. A locust will eat its own two gram bodyweight in fresh food each day. UN figures suggest that one tonne of red locusts will eat enough food to nourish 2,500 people for a day. The United Nations runs special eradication schemes across large areas of Africa to keep red locust numbers down. According to the United Nationas a red locust can eat its own bodyweight in food each day while traveling between 20-30 kilometres .","Photographer spotted the 1,000 foot column of bugs just outside Lisbon .

"By . Mark Prigg . Doctors, nurses and other health care workers could be ordered to return the their traditional uniform of a white coat under new guidelines designed to stop the spread of infection. Researchers say short sleeves, bare hand and regular laundering are key to stopping bugs spreading between patients. They say ties, watches and rings should be banned. The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America claims say short sleeves, bare hand and regular laundering are key to stopping bugs spreading between patients. They say ties, watches and rings should be banned. The modern white coat was introduced to medicine in the late 1800s as a symbol of cleanliness. To emphasize the transition to the more scientific approach to modern medicine, physicians sought to represent themselves as scientist. 'From Hippocrates’s admonition that physicians’ dress is essential to their dignity, to the advent of nurses’ uniforms under the leadership of Florence Nightingale, to the white coat ceremonies that continue to this day in medical schools, HCP apparel and appearance is associated with significant symbolism and professionalism,' said the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. The new guidance on hospital attire released by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, or SHEA, recommends major changes. 'Although the optimal choice of Healthcare personnel (HCP) attire for inpatient care remains undefined, we provide recommendations on the use of white coats, neckties, footwear, the bare-below-the-elbows strategy, and laundering,' the report says. 'Recent years have seen a rising awareness of the potential role of fomites in the hospital environment in the transmission of healthcare-associated microorganisms. 'Although studies have demonstrated contamination of HCP apparel with potential pathogens, the role of clothing in transmission of these microorganisms to patients has not been established. 'The paucity of evidence has stymied efforts to produce generalizable, evidence-based recommendations, resulting in widely disparate practices and requirements that vary by country, region, culture, facility, and discipline.' The report also claims patients are more likely to trust a doctor in a white coat. 'Overall, patients express preferences for certain types of attire, with most surveys indicating a preference for formal attire, including a preference for a white coat,' the report said. 'Healthcare personnel (HCP) attire is an aspect of the medical profession steeped in culture and tradition. 'From Hippocrates’s admonition that physicians’ dress is essential to their dignity, to the advent of nurses’ uniforms under the leadership of Florence Nightingale, to the white coat ceremonies that continue to this day in medical schools, HCP apparel and appearance is associated with significant symbolism and professionalism.' If comes after a 2011 study found more than 60 percent of health workers’ uniforms sampled by researchers tested positive for pathogens, including the germs that can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections and drug-resistant infections such as MRSA. Researchers say short sleeves, bare hand and regular laundering are key to stopping bugs spreading between patients. They say ties, watches and rings should be banned. But, he said, it makes sense that there would be a connection. 'There's a theoretical basis that if you have clean clothes, you have less chance of transmitting apathogen,' he told NBC News. SHEA members looked at studies that have found a range of worrisome bugs, from Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas to Clostridium difficile, detected on the sleeves, pockets and other sites of health care workers' coats and scrubs. One study found that a third of doctors’ neckties grew Staph aureus in the lab; several found that the germs were often resistant to the top drugs used to treat them.","New guidelines from the  Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America .

"By . Sean O'hare . Paranormal investigators say they have proof that a U.S Navy aircraft carrier is haunted. The Californian ghostbusters, who call themselves the 'Chill Seekers', recorded a 12-minute video of their investigation last month aboard the USS Hornet, birthed in Alameda, California. The video appears to show spirit voices communicating with them and at one point telling them 'We are under attack' and to 'Get off the ship'. Scroll down for video . Hair designer Ashley, the Chill Seeker's researcher and investigator, introduces the 12-minute clip from outside the USS Hornet in Alameda. The clip goes on to offer 'proof' of the group's paranormal findings . The ship's decks are explored by flashlight as the group retells ghost stories and puts questions to the spirits who are said to reside aboard the vessel on which 300 people died over the years . The group spends a large portion of the film sat in the ship's briefing room where they announce to any listening spirits: 'We are not here to disrespect anyone or anything on this ship' USS HORNET (CV-12) The eighth ship to bear the name . Cost: $69 million . Length: 856 feet . Draft: 27 feet . Flight deck width: 120 feet . Propulsion: 150,000 horsepower. Displacement: 27,000 tons . CV-12 Combat Score (War in the Pacific) 1,420 aircraft destroyed . 42 cargo ships sunk . 10 destroyers sunk . 1 cruiser sunk . 1 carrier sunk . 1 assist on super battle ship YAMATO . In one scene they say that an audible tapping sound is Morse Code, translated to read 'Hi, I.T', which they suggest is a message from the I.T technicians who used to work aboard the ship on which more than 300 people died. The group from Modesto visited the ship last month on its 70th anniversary last month and toured it in darkness, with the aid of torches. The ship, no longer in service, saw action in World war Two and the Apollo 11 manned space mission. Introducing the investigation, researcher Ashley said the USS Hornet 'is responsible for destroying 1,400 enemy planes, sinking one million tonnes of enemy ships and more suicides onboard than any other ship in the Navy.' Equipped with digital recording equipment, static cameras and their 'spirit box,' which scans through radio frequencies, the group of four 20-somethings patrol the ship's decks in darkness, relaying ghost stories and stopping to ask questions to 'the spirits'. Carissa, the lead investigator can be heard asking the question: 'Are you happy to see women aboard? 'To which comes the faint reply picked up on the camera's microphone: 'It's good.' The ship's museum looks decidedly spooky in the video clip . A tapping sound that can be heard in the film is said by the group to be attempts by spirit Morse Code workers who used to work onboard, to make contact. The tapping sound is translated and said to read: 'Hi I.T . Keith, the group's audio/visual specialist and keen Hip Hop musician seen here with his voice recorder, asks the spirits: Who am I? A voice can be heard responding: 'You are Keith'. Just as well someone is on the ball! Andrew, a chef by trade, works as the group's technician, and can be seen here listening and looking out for paranormal activity onboard the ship . A static camera is placed on the steps seen here. The group is convinced that the camera's microphone picks up the sound of movement, despite nothing appearing to pass up or down . The same voice can be heard saying the words: 'U.S. Navy', in response to Carissa asking what the name of the ship is, before appearing to say the words 'comfortable' and 'Gordon.' Later she can be seen sitting down, . convinced she has been touched by a spirit. She says she feels 'cold and . tingly' and asks: 'Are you touching me right now'. Although physical contact is not confirmed, the camera's microphone appears to pick up the response: 'Get out.' Keith looks surprised when he hears his name in response to his question: Who am I? It's a pity the ChillSeekers are not as hot on English as they are on the heels of ghosts. 'Your' should read 'You're' Carissa was convinced she'd been touched by a spirit in the film. She said she felt 'tingly and cold' As well as being 'touched', she also appears to be given her marching orders as a voice can be heard saying 'Get Out' despite her invitation to the spirits to come out and tell them their stories . When Keith, the group's audio visual specialist and part-time Hip Hop artist asks 'who am I?'  A voice can be heard responding: 'You are Keith.' Keith also places a a static camera on the ship's stairs and is convinced it recorded the sound of movement. The group believes spirits communicate using white noise and by manipulating transmissions and investigate paranormal activities in various locations following tip offs from members of the public. Their catchline is: 'If you don't believe it, join us on our hunts, see things you've never seen before'. Meet the team: Carissa and Ashley are the two female investigators as ChillSeekers . Andrew and Keith complete the fearless foursome. As a group they invite the public to tip them off about suspected ghost haunts so that they can turn up and investigate .","ChillSeekers investigate aboard USS Hornet CV-12, docked in Alameda .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Aap . Melbourne has proven it's not just about coffee and cricket after it was named Monocle Magazine's third most liveable city, drawing praise for its public transport and low crime rates. The Victorian capital was knocked off its 2013 second-place perch by Tokyo, Japan - which climbed two spots from last year. Sydney trailed behind in 11th place and Brisbane made its debut at spot number 25. Melbourne came in third place on Monocle magazine's 25 most livable cities . Known for its coffee and cricket, Monocle cited Melbourne's public transport, low crime rates and 'compelling' weekend paper as big pluses . Denmark's Copenhagen held onto its top spot for a second year in a row. The London-based magazine cited Melbourne's recent upgrades to its public transport system, its low crime rate and even its inclusion of 'a compelling new weekend paper' as reasons why it made the top-three cut. But according to Monocle, Melbourne had the highest murder rate on its index of 25 cities. Just over half way down the list, Sydney - which held ninth place last year - took a tumble for its public transport woes and bar lockouts introduced in early 2014 in parts of the city after the 'king hit' death of Thomas Kelly. But the Harbour city still held a special place in Monocle's heart. 'Sydney remains Australia's face to the world - and a pretty one at that,' it said. 'Architectural breakthroughs such as the North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club and One Central Park are welcome additions.' Brisbane came to the attention of the international list maker after it was named as the host city of November's G20 summit. 'Arriving delegates will discover a sun-drenched destination with a flourishing start-up scene,' Monocle said of the Queensland capital. But despite the comprehensive criteria used to assess the cities from mobile phone charging points to the number of fast food chains to the amount of rubbish recycled, there is some data that can be called into question. Sydney fell two places from last year because of its poor public transport and bar lockouts . Brisbane (left) made its debut on the list at 25, mainly oweing to its famously good weather, while Melbourne's public transport (right) was listed as one of its biggest selling points . The publication claims Sydney enjoys 2592 'sunshine hours', not offering a timeframe. But according to the Bureau of Meteorology, Sydney Airport recorded an average of 7.8 hours of sun a day in 2013, which works out to be 2847 hours a year. Monocle also listed Sydney had only 42 book shops but a directory search reveals there are at least 188 listed in the Sydney CBD alone. The number of daily newspapers in a city is also taken into account - four in Sydney and three in Melbourne - but the magazine ignores that millions get their news fix online. Denmark's Copenhagen clenched top spot with its easy lifestyle and peaceful surroundings . It was followed closely by Tokyo, Japan in second place with its arts and foodie scenes . Surprisingly old favourites London and New York were a no-show on the Monocle rankings, with the magazine cheekly writing London police 'can't always be trusted' and did not elaborate. Topping the list was Copenhagen for its easy living and cosmopolitan, but down-to-earth, atmosphere. 'Living in Copenhagen is easy. It’s pretty safe, it’s simple to get around whether you walk or ride your bicycle and you have a lot of good restaurants, bars, cinemas, museums, parks, canals and beaches,' Monocle said. 'It has an international – though local – feel to it; living there you consider yourself a part of the world but still very Danish.' Second place getter, Tokyo, secured its spot with a great food, arts and shopping scene.","Melbourne takes third place, Sydney 11th and Brisbane makes debut at 25 .

"By . Associated Press . Many new revelations about J.D. Salinger have come out of a new documentary and biography about the author . J.D. Salinger's relationship with a teenage girl has been revealed as one of the key moments which led to the author's eventual retreat from public life. On Tuesday night, PBS will air the documentary Salinger, the 200th installment of the station's American Masters series. Director Shane Salerno's documentary, which he worked on for a decade, contains the first-ever interviews with a woman, . Jean Miller, with whom Salinger formed an intense bond while she was a . teen and he in his early 30s. The author drew upon their relationship . for his short story, For Esme - With Love and Squalor. Mr Salerno told the AP: 'There are a few surprises I want to keep under wraps but here are some major changes. 'There . is important new World War II material, including an extended version . of Salinger's first day of combat, which was D-Day, and other brutal . battles that forged him. World War II is critical to understanding . Salinger. It was the transformative trauma of his life and is the ghost . in the machine of all of Salinger's stories. 'There . is a pivotal new relationship with a 16-year-old girl, which was a . consistent pattern in Salinger's life, and viewers will learn how a . betrayal in that relationship served as the first brick in the wall of . silence Salinger built. One of the key participants speaks for the first . time. 'The changes run throughout the film and provide a deeper understanding of Salinger.' Scroll down for video . Jean Miller discussed her relationship with reclusive author JD Salinger after keeping silent for 60 years . Jean Miller had a five-year relationship with J.D. Salinger starting in 1949 and waited 60 years to discuss her time with the reclusive author. After the author's death in 2010, Ms Miller finally opened up about the relationship to filmmaker  Salerno. Miller was just 14 when she began the relationship with the secretive Salinger. According to CBS, Miller’s silence was a sort prerequisite to being a friend of Salinger’s. ‘I didn't want to talk about it because I knew [Salinger] didn't want me to talk about it,’ she said in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning last September. Miller opened up about Salinger, for the first time since she last saw him 60 years before, to Salerno after the author’s death. Among the intimate revelations - descriptions of Salinger’s spiritual nature and how deeply affected he was by WWII - was the disclosure that Miller had been just 14 when she met Salinger. Miller says the two met at a Daytona Beach, Florida Sheraton hotel. Salinger was 30. ‘I was sitting at a pool, I was reading Wuthering Heights. And he said, “How is Heathcliff?""’ Despite warnings from her mother, Miller continued the relationship, which consisted of long walks on the beach and the exchange of many letters. For five years, the friendship blossomed. Then, the two had sex for the first time and Miller would only see Salinger once more for the rest of her life. Jean Miller was just 14 when she began her relationship with the secretive Salinger after they met in Florida . Letters: Pictured is an excerpt from one of dozens of letters Salinger exchanged with Miller, a woman who would  a model for the title character in his story For Esme With Love and Squalor . ‘I saw this glass curtain come down, and I just knew it was all over,’ she said. But she still remembers him fondly. ‘He . wanted to go below the surface of your life,’ Miller said. ‘Jerry . Salinger would say to me, a young girl, “Do you believe in God?” No . adult had ever talked to me [like that]. Not only that, no adult had . ever listened to me. 'He once said to me, ''If you ever lose track of me, just read my stories.''' JD Salinger's seminal work The Catcher In The Rye . No Salinger book came out after the early 1960s, as the author increasingly withdrew from public life. The . documentary is the third piece of the deal Salerno reached last year . for a feature documentary, book and TV documentary about the late author . of The Catcher in the Rye. The PBS edition of Salinger runs 135 minutes, 15 minutes longer than the film released in theaters in September. Salerno's movie and book, co-authored by David Shields, caught the attention of the literary world by providing extensive details of at least five possible new Salinger works, from more stories about the fictional Glass family to further reports on 'Catcher' narrator Holden Caulfield. (Salinger's publisher, Little, Brown and Company, has declined comment). Mr Salerno told the Associated Press: 'There was universal agreement that the . material I found was unprecedented, exhaustively documented and answered . questions people have wanted to know for 50 years. 'As for Salinger, it's not the . documentarian's responsibility to consider whether his subject would . approve or disapprove of the work. I spent 10 years of my life on this . because I was committed to getting it right and we did get it right, the . truth is some people just didn't like what we found. 'I . have enormous respect for Salinger as an artist but I reject the idea . that he deserves an entirely different standard for biography than . Martin Luther King, John F. Kennedy, Thomas Jefferson or Oskar . Schindler. 'If you . were making a film about any of those men you would tell the great . accomplishments of their life as well as personal failures, and that's . what I did with Salinger.' He added: 'Some film critics . criticized us for not examining Salinger's work in greater detail but . there were strict legal restrictions that prevented that. The 700-page . book I wrote with David Shields is filled with literary analysis, while . the film evokes viscerally for the viewer what it felt like to be J.D. Salinger during the most critical moments of his life. 'The goal of both . projects was to separate the man and artist from the myths about him, to . tell the real story of his life and to explore the cost of producing . the kind of art that he did. I'm grateful that those who knew Salinger . closely have said publicly that the film captured his extraordinarily . complex personality.' Besides Salinger, Mr Salerno has been busy working with James Cameron on the screenplay for the next Avatar movie .","Director Shane Salerno worked on documentary Salinger for a decade .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . New reports have revealed that the FBI had suspicions about Adam Lanza eight years before he committed the second-deadliest mass shooting in American history. The FBI reportedly went to the Newtown, Connecticut home that he shared with his mother Nancy in 2004 and asked about his computer activity but left before even sitting down with the then-12-year-old. Newsweek reports that FBI agents went to the family's Yogananda Street home because they had tracked Adam online after he hacked through two layers of government security. Under suspicion: FBI agents went to the Lanza house in 2004 to question then-12-year-old Adam about how he had been able to hack through two layers of a government website's security . Nancy Lanza, who would later be killed at the hands of her son, spoke to the officers and convinced them that there was no need  for further questioning. 'He's a computer whiz,' she told the agents, according to Newsweek. 'Adam was just testing himself.' The newly released report about the home visit is just one in a growing number of missed clues in the lead up to the December 14, 2012 shooting that left 26 students and his mother dead before he turned the gun on himself. Author Matthew Lysiak thoroughly researched the December 2012 shooting and wrote a book called 'Newtown: An American Tragedy'. First part of the murder scene: FBI officials questioned Nancy at her Newtown home in 2004, and that is the same home where Adam shot and killed her eight years later before going to the elementary school . In it, he discusses a previously undiscovered writing of Lanza's where he rails against 'the system' and talks about how he felt students were being brainwashed. 'It goes without saying that an AK-47 and . enough ammunition could do more good than a thousand ‘teachers,‘ if one . is truly interested in reforming the system,' Adam wrote a year before . the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. 'In short time the children will be brainwashed, pumped full of Xanax and told to conform, until they have been turned into the oppressors. 'They (the children) are already dead.' In the weeks after the first anniversary of the shooting, Connecticut state investigators released their findings on the tragedy, showing what warning signs the 20-year-old shooter left behind in his wake before killing himself as emergency responders arrived on the scene. Covering? Nancy Lanza (left) told the officers that her son (right) was very bright and just challenging himself with the hacking, and the officers apparently found that sufficient enough that they didn't need to talk to him . In fifth grade, Lanza wrote The Big Book of Granny, in which the main character has a gun in her cane and shoots people, and another character talks of liking to hurt people, especially children. The book was among items seized from Lanza's home, but there was no indication he ever handed in the book at school. Lanza became obsessed with the 1999 bloodbath at Columbine High in Colorado and other mass killings, the report said. He also kept a spreadsheet ranking mass murders. The report also said that in 2005, Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger's disorder - an autism-like condition that is not associated with violence - and that he lacked empathy for others and behaved strangely.","FBI officers became suspicious of Adam Lanza when hew as only 12 because he had been able to hack past a government website's security .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . They were never likely to have a whirlwind romance, but these two appear to be taking their relationship at snail's pace. The molluscs were captured kissing while perched precariously on top of cherry stems in woodland near Berdichev in Ukraine. They could be seen leaning towards each other in a desperate bid to kiss - before finally locking lips.

The amazing moment was caught on camera by photographer, Vyacheslav Mischenko, near his hometown in the Zhytomyr Oblast region. Footage shows the snails balancing carefully atop the cherry stems, which are floating in a stream. They then slowly stretch towards each other - while trying to stay upright - before eventually locking lips.

"By . Jack Doyle . Joland Giwa is back on Britain's streets after attempts by the government to have him deported floundered amid failures to decide which country should take him . A violent gangster who was due to have been deported is back on the streets of Britain because officials cannot work out where to send him. Joland Giwa had been kept locked up for more than four years after finishing a jail sentence for a string of street robberies. But immigration officials have been unable to determine his nationality, with both Nigeria and Sierra Leone refusing to accept him. They cannot even be sure he gave the correct name and age when he sought asylum in Britain. However, a judge ruled it was unfair to keep Giwa locked up if there was no prospect of him being deported – even though he presents a ‘serious risk of violence’ and there is ‘a very significant risk both of absconding and reoffending’. Giwa – the ‘general’ of an 80-strong gang behind a spate of stabbings, shootings and killings on the streets of Croydon, South London, in 2007 – was freed last month. He must wear an electronic tag to monitor his movements, has been told he must live in Cardiff and is banned from returning to London. Last night the farce was condemned by Tory MPs. James Clappison, a member of the Commons home affairs committee said: ‘The public would expect us to be able to protect them from this kind of person in these circumstances. He obviously came here some time ago, but that shouldn’t stop us sending him back. We need to be able to deport somebody whenever it’s necessary to protect the public.’ Giwa, who is thought to be 24, arrived at Heathrow with his twin brother in 1999 on a flight from Nigeria. He had no parent or guardian and no passport or identity documents. He claimed asylum, telling officials he was a ten-year-old from Sierra Leone whose parents were killed in its civil war. His asylum claim was refused but he was given permission to stay for four years, before being given a permanent right to stay in 2005. A High Court judge in October said there was a 'significant risk' of Giwa reoffending, but he ruled he should go free if the Home Office could not deport him within three months . He soon became involved in crime, running Croydon’s notorious Don’t Say Nothing gang and using the street name Dexter. Giwa has been linked to at least 99 incidents of criminal or anti-social behaviour. In February 2009 he was jailed for 27 months for a series of robberies and thefts, and ordered to be deported afterwards. In . court, police said Giwa was ready ‘at any time to use knives and . weapons’ and in a YouTube video he boasted of stabbing a man in the . head. Giwa’s appeals against deportation were dismissed, so there is no legal bar to him being removed. One former police officer told an immigration hearing that Giwa posed a ‘serious threat to the public’. At . the end of his sentence he was held at an immigration centre but in . 2011 he was transferred to Belmarsh prison after intelligence suggested . he was involved in smuggling in drugs. Most of his visitors in Belmarsh were known criminals, a court document said. His . brother Make was jailed for trying to smuggle heroin and phone Sim . cards into Belmarsh last year. In an effort to discover where Giwa is . from, a linguist analysed his speech but was unable to confirm his . nationality, saying that he had a strong London accent. He concluded there was evidence of Nigerian English rather than the accents used in Sierra Leone. Peter . Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘It . says it all that the authorities are willing to release hardened . criminals.’ The Home Office . said: ‘We are very disappointed by the court’s decision. We are . continuing to fight for his removal from the UK.’","Joland Giwa is self-proclaimed 'general' of Don't Say Nothing gang .

"By . Ruth Styles . From getting rid of wrinkles within 30 days to firming up your jawline in just two weeks, beauty companies are famous for their bold claims. But while such bold claims may have made it into the 21st century, thankfully, some of the more outlandish methods to prove them did not. Among the more bizarre - and terrifying - is the 'atomic test' devised by one beauty company, which involved slathering a model's face with radioactive dust and using a Geiger counter to see how much of it cleansing removed. Scroll down for video . Radioactive: The hapless model's face is checked for atomic dust using a 1950's Geiger counter . The makers of Dorothy Grey Cold Cream used four different products to remove the dangerous dust - including their own. Using a Geiger counter, a device used by scientists to measure the amount of radiation in a given location, the company was able to prove that their cold cream removed more atomic dust than the three nameless products also used. Those tempted to buy the cold cream could then write to Dorothy Grey for a free 'atomic test booklet', outlining the details of the experiment. Although the advertisement claimed that most of the dust had been removed from the hapless model's face, the truth remains that even small amounts are enough to lead to serious health problems. Most experts agree even low doses of radiation can dramatically increase the risk of cancer and the risk of cancer increases as the dose of radiation increases. Exposure to radiation over time is estimated to increase the lifetime risk of fatal cancer by around five per cent on average. Testing: Dorothy Grey pitted its cold cream against competitors and found it was best at removing atomic dust . The shocking clip isn't the only bizarre retro beauty ad to make a resurgence. Another unusual film is a tutorial which explains how to straighten the hair in an age before GHD hair straighteners existed. The Pathe clip, filmed in the British Colonies Club in London, shows an African woman having her naturally curly hair straightened - accompanied by commentary that sounds jarringly old fashioned to modern ears. 'Now for an eye opener on women's top question: hair,' the commentary begins. 'Most hairdressers spend their time putting curls into women's hair and keeping them there long enough to justify all the talk about permanent waves. 'Here at the British Colonies Club, we met a hair expert who does permanent waving in reverse. Her clients are Africans and they are all born with a permanent wave but do they like it? They're women, aren't they? 'Round they come to the club in England to be un-permed. The idea is to take out all the kinks in the hair and give it a permanent straight look.' The advice includes soaking the hair with a selection of 'secret oils' before splitting it into six and straightening it with combs heated on a stove. Unknown: The advice calls for a 'secret blend' of hair straightening oils to be slathered over the scalp . Sleek: Combs heated on a brazier were used to get rid of natural curls in a process that took two hours . Complete: The finished look was typical of the post-war period with smooth waves and elaborate fringe . Errol Douglas, a London-based Afro hair specialist, comments: 'What an amazing film, I love the 40s and 50s as an era. 'The negatives about the film are firstly how we take care of clients. Service levels have changed immeasurably too. 'In the film the stylist pulls the client’s head forward – this would never ever happen today. 'Whether washing, styling or putting any products in the hair, you always pull back to avoid anything going in the client's eyes. 'I think in this day and age Trading Standards would have a lot to say about putting ‘secret oils’ in a client’s hair. 'With all hair products, you must give the client all the information and be completely transparent regarding the product’s content. Despite the downsides, says Douglas, the neatly waved result is surprisingly up to date and on trend for 2013. 'This look however works really well for young, on-trend women in the same way that Adele rocked a beehive early in her career. 'For those who don’t fall into that category, it's better to go for a look that suits you rather than listening to fashion. 'It’s interesting and influential but it should help you shape your own sense of style.'

"By . Ted Thornhill . Conjoined twins Shivanath and Shivram Sahu caused quite a stir when they were born in India, with some people in their village worshipping them as divine incarnations. And while one doctor has said that it would be possible to separate the 12-year-olds, who were born joined at the waist, the duo are determined to remain together. Shivram said: ‘We don't wish to get separated. We will stay like this even when we grow old. We want to live as we are.’ Scroll down for video . Shivnath and Shivram pose for a photograph before getting ready for school in Chhattisgarh, India . Shivram and Shivnath descend the stairs with their schoolbag . The pair, who were born in a tiny village near Raipur in central India, share two legs and four arms and work in tandem to get around. They have stunned doctors with their ability to wash, dress and feed themselves. A local doctor told the family they were both healthy but he could not separate them. They are believed to share the same stomach but have independent lungs, hearts and brains. Shivram and Shivnath eat together as both enjoy plates full of rice . Shivnath and Shivram laugh with neighbourhood friends . With practice they have learned to do all their basic daily chores with minimal fuss, including showering, eating, getting dressed and combing each other's hair. They are able to walk down the stairs of their simple split-level home and even run on all six limbs to play cricket and other games with neighbouring children. Shivanath, who appears to be the weaker of the two twins, said: ‘We have taught ourselves everything. We ride to school on a bicycle and playing cricket is no problem.’ They are also talented academics and considered among the top students at their local school, much to the pride of their doting father, Raj Kumar, 45. The labourer, who is married to Srimati and has five daughters, is very protective of his two sons and will not allow them to leave the village. The duo getting ready to go to school - at which they're two of the best pupils . He said: ‘For everyone it is good fun to watch my children, but only I understand all the problems they have. ‘During rainy season it becomes difficult for them to walk and when one wants to sit the other has to lie down. ‘But they don't fight. They have similar opinions and if one says he wants to play the other one agrees.’ The father-of-seven says he would not let a doctor separate them, even if he had the money and the operation was viable. Srimati Sahu, mother of the twins, and father Raj Kumar Sahu, at their family home in Balodabazar Lavan, about 100 miles from Raipur . The twins' mother, Srimati, and her two daughters, in their family home . He added: ‘God has created them like this so they have to walk like they do. They will remain like this. I don't want anything else. ‘Even if doctors say so, I won't get my children separated. I have no interest in money. I'm the one who will work hard to nourish them. I don't need any help.’ Conjoined twins occur when the zygote, the initial cell formed by sexual reproduction, fails to completely separate. It is thought to occur in roughly one in every 50,000 births, but just one per cent make it to their first birthday and two-thirds are stillborn. Photographs of the twins have been shown to Dr Krishan Chugh, head of paediatrics at the Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurgaon, near Delhi. He believes it possible to separate the twins - but with drastic consequences for Shivanath. While Shivram would likely keep both legs and could start living a more normal life - Shivanath would be left with no legs and needing full-time care. The twins use their hands to walk on the village road . The operation would also be very expensive and require long-term rehabilitation, both physically and psychologically. ‘This operation is possible,’ he said. ‘But there are questions whether we should. ‘What would we gain and what we will lose? What does the family want, how will society take it and, most importantly, how will these two kids take it? ‘They appear to be fairly well-adjusted from the photographs and it seems the organs are working really well. ‘They have two different brains, two different hearts and two different lungs. So as far as physically living is concerned, they can go on like this. ‘They appear bright enough to start thinking of becoming financially, economically and physically independent. Keen learners: The twins studying on a mat at their home . ‘They may even be able to get married. There are cases on record where such a thing has happened where conjoined twins have had two different wives and 21 children.’ While the twins and their father are adamant they will not be parted, Dr Chugh believes their will may change over time. He added: ‘They are 12 years old now and they must see others running around as individuals and being separate mentally and physically. ‘How much they are motivated to be like the others is what we would have to try and assist.’ Shivanath and Shivram's case bares hallmarks to the famous conjoined twins Ganga and Jamuna Mondal from West Bengal, India. Ganga and Jamuna made a living performing as The Spider Sisters in the Dreamland Circus, earning £26 a night. The pair are believed to now be in their mid-40s and are both married to a carnival worker named Gadadhar.","Shivanath and Shivram Sahu were born in India joined at the waist .

"By . Aime Keeley . A bookmaker suspended betting on the Queen stepping down after a large wager was placed in Windsor. The development follows reports that the 87-year-old monarch is handing over key responsibilities to Prince Charles. Bookmaker Coral had slashed the odds of Her Majesty stepping down before the end of the year from 3-1 to 1-2, before suspending the market yesterday. Stepping down? The Queen, left, is handing over key responsibilities to Prince Charles, right . A spokesman said: ‘The significant gamble suggests that the Queen could hand over the reins sooner rather than later. ‘With her 88th birthday approaching, the Queen has started to relinquish a number of duties to Prince Charles, leading to major speculation about the monarch’s future.’ She said bets about members of the royal family which were placed in the Windsor area were usually ‘spot on’, suggesting there may be some insider knowledge circulating. The bookmaker’s odds were 1-20 that Prince Charles would be next on the throne while Prince William was being backed at 8-1. The Queen is due to visit the Normandy beaches later this year to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, along with Prince Charles, in what some claim will be her final overseas engagement. Slashed odds: Coral changed its payouts for the Queen's potential abdication, before suspending the market . A French government official was reported as saying: ‘We have been told this will probably be the Queen’s last official foreign visit.’ But royal aides have been quick to dismiss the claims and have stressed that the monarch is far from retiring and will continue to focus instead on ‘behind the scenes’ duties. The movement of Charles to a more central role will allow the Queen to concentrate on her role as head of state – including hosting foreign ambassadors and state visits. The Queen has already handed a number of responsibilities to younger members of the royal family in the last few months, including Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment.","Coral slashed its odds on her stepping down, then closed the market .

Similar to the Google Now system, it shows nearby locations as well as information gleaned from apps about what the user is doing. Scroll down for video . Leaks of Samsung's new menu system show a series of 'smart cards' showing information to users than can change depending on where they are or what they are doing. This is similar to how Google Now works . The handset is expected to be announced in February, and go on sale worldwide in April . Source: Sammmobile . For example, it shows details of their latest run, a flight they plan to catch and text messages from friends. The image could reveal a major look for Samsung's flagship handset if it is legitimate. The specs for Samsung's new Galaxy S5 have already leaked online, amid claims the handset will come in both metal and plastic versions. The handset, which is is expected to have a 5.25inch screen and iris scanning to recognise users without a password, will also have a new superfast Snapdragon processor. There will also be a mini version of the S5, and a camera version called the Zoom, according to the Sammobile web site. First, let’s get the most mysterious thing about the Galaxy S5 out of the way: Yes, it will come in both metal and plastic versions as has been rumored, with the metal version costing around 800 Euros ($1080) and the plastic model coming in at around 650 Euros ($880),' the site says. The move is identical to Apple's decision to launch a plastic iPhone 5C alongside its flagship 5S model last year. The site also claims to have an almost complete set of specs for the handset. 'As expected, the Galaxy S5 will sport an AMOLED display of 2,560×1,440 resolution; we were unable to confirm the size, though it should be around 5.25-inches as has been rumored often.' It is also expected to be the first mass market mobile to use a new super-fast Exynos 6 Snapdragon 805 processor, which could give the handset a major speed boost. It could also allow the handset to run in 64bit mode - although the site believes that, again like Apple, only the metal version will do this. Recent reports also claimed the handset could feature an iris scanning system designed to recognise users without the need for a password. It will also boost a 16MP rear camera, and run KitKat, the latest version of Google's Android software. Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas last week, Lee Young Hee announced that the firm is looking to release its next flagship phone between March and April - and admitted it will be called the Galaxy S5. Seeing double: Two version of the S5 are expected to go on sale in April, a metal and a plastic version . Lee also discussed the possibility a future model of the phone could feature iris recognition technology, yet did not confirm if it would be added to S5 or not. Rumours have suggested Samsung is working on a follow-up to its Galaxy Gear smartwatch since last year, too, and this could be unveiled at the same time as the S5. Lee told Bloomberg: We’ve been announcing our first flagship model in the first half of each year, around March and April, and we are still targeting for release around that time. ‘When we release our S5 device, you can also expect a Gear successor with more advanced functions, and the bulky design will also be improved.’ Lee is referring to the criticism the watch received when it went on sale in September last year. Biometric experts at New York-based firm EyeLock have created a dongle fitted with an iris scanner. The Myris device can register up to five different users. Each user begins by scanning their eyes to take an image of their respective irises. These unique images are then translated into an encrypted code. The scan takes between 10 and 20 seconds and the authentication code is created immediately. Once registered, each user can add various online passwords to their Myris profile. Next time the user visits one of these accounts, instead of entering a password, they can scan their eyes for immediate and secure access. According to EyeLock, the False Acceptance Rate of the average fingerprint sensor, in which the system is hacked by an unknown print, is one in every 10,000 scans.  For iris scans, this increases to one 1 in 2.25 trillion scans. Myris is set to go on sale before the summer and will cost around $250 (£150) although an exact date and price is yet to be announced. Some analysts claimed the Korean firm had rushed the production of the gadget in order to beat Apple to releasing a smartwatch, and the design suffered. However, Apple has still not announced its rumoured iWatch. Regarding the iris recognition technology, Lee said during Samsung’s press event at the Consumer Electronics Show: ‘Many people are fanatical about iris recognition technology and we are studying the possibility but can’t really say whether we will have it or not on the S5.’ Samsung is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on Apple’s iPhone 5S. Samsung is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model in its Galaxy range of smartphones and tablets to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on Apple's iPhone 5S, pictured . Samsung is also set to unveil a second-generation Galaxy Gear, original model is pictured, along with the S5 at Mobile World Congress in February . Iris scanning is more secure than fingerprint scanning, and the technology involved is cheaper, making it a more obvious choice to add to future models. Iris scanning involves a simple charge-coupled device digital camera that uses visible and near-infrared light to take a clear, high-contrast image of a person’s iris. When the camera takes the image, a scanner plots the centre of the pupil, edge of the pupil, edge of the iris, eyelids and eyelashes. It then analyses the unique patterns in the iris and translates this pattern into a code. Next time the eye is scanned, this code is compared to the pattern to authenticate a match. The iris scanner would not be the first time Samsung has introduced eye-tracking technology. Its Galaxy S4 includes a feature that locks onto the movement and position of a user’s eyes. The phone can analyse where the user is looking and will automatically scroll a web page when the eyes reach the bottom of the screen, for example, or lock the screen when the user looks away. Both of Samsung's new devices are expected to be unveiled during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. They will likely then go on sale in Korea in March, before being rolled out worldwide in April. Samsung is set to release its next flagship phone - the Galaxy S5 - between March and April. The Korean firm also hinted that either the S5, or a future model, could be fitted with an iris scanner, stock photo of an iris is pictured, that would be used to unlock the device .","S5 is expected to be unveiled during Mobile World Congress in February .

"By . Christopher Stevens . Almost everything you could wish for from a new sitcom is crammed into Family Tree (BBC2). It’s co-written by Christopher Guest, who pioneered comedy mock-umentaries with This Is Spinal Tap, hailed by many film-lovers as the funniest movie ever made. Co-produced by the U.S. cable channel HBO (home of The Sopranos), Family Tree features a zany cast of characters, a coherent storyline and, in Chris O’Dowd, a rising Hollywood star in the main role. No laughs: Family Tree features rising Hollywood star Chris O'Dowd (left) as Tom Chadwick and ventriloquist Nina Conti (right), as the hero's sister Bea, who is obsessed with a glove puppet called Monkey . This surgically engineered sitcom made just one slip in its pilot episode. It forgot to leave room for the jokes. The script is mainly improvised, in the style of Outnumbered or the American comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm. But in the flurry of expositions and introductions last night, laying out the plotlines, the actors had no time to make us laugh. A sizeable slice of the episode was devoted to explaining why O’Dowd — born in the Emerald Isle — has a rural Irish accent when his sister, father and best mate were all  patently Londoners. Instead of boring us with a laboured story of the character’s single-parent upbringing in Ireland, Guest should have shrugged off the anomaly and left us to invent our own explanations. In an interview to promote the show, he was much wittier. Announcing that he was ‘delighted to welcome myself to BBC Television’, Guest added that ‘Chris O’Dowd has been on my radar since he was a child actor in Wales’. It’s always a worry when the  publicity material is funnier than the show itself. Family Tree does have potential. Ventriloquist Nina Conti, as the hero’s sister Bea, is obsessed with a glove puppet called Monkey, who delivers a tart commentary on the other characters. Their father, Keith, has remarried, to an East European peasant called Luba. Keith is obsessed with forgotten Seventies sitcoms, with titles like There Goes The Neighbourhood, which Guest carefully invents and shoots, so that clips can be dropped into the show. That’s a painstaking approach to comedy which isn’t actually funny. A bit like this whole show, in fact. Painstaking is an inadequate word to describe the care that went into designing Princess Diana’s wardrobe. She expressed her whole life through the medium of her clothes. Princess Diana’s Dresses: The Auction . (C4) was a brilliant way to retell her biography. Taking ten dresses . recently put up for sale with a guide price of £1 million, this . absorbing documentary followed her evolution from gauche, 19-year-old . nanny to landmine campaigner and people’s princess. Famous: In Channel 4's Princess Diana's Dresses: The Auction, there was the dress from that night at the White House in 1985 when Diana danced with John Travolta . It revealed the fascinating story behind that frumpy blue suit she wore for her engagement photos and the notorious interview where her fiance, Charles, harrumphed about ‘whatever “in love” means’. Announcing herself simply as Diana Spencer, she had paid a call in her Marks & Sparks daywear to leading designer David Sassoon, whose formidable shop assistant had taken one look and sent her packing. ‘If you must have something special,’ the dragon snarled, ‘go to Harrods!’ So Diana did, and the result was an outfit that was more Mrs Thatcher than fairytale princess. Just as intriguing was the tale of the little black dress that, weeks later, announced her to the world as a fashion icon. ‘Diana the  Dazzler’ gasped the tabloids, as she was photographed with her cleavage spilling out of the low-cut cups, designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel. Diana’s image-maker was Anna Harvey of Vogue. ‘If Elizabeth Emanuel will forgive me, that dress may not have fitted perfectly,’ sniffed Harvey. ‘Nobody allowed that to happen a second time.’ There was the dress, too, from that night at the White House when Diana danced with John Travolta. But who remembers that she also waltzed with Clint Eastwood, Tom Selleck and Neil Diamond? As one acid-tongued politico commented, no one even noticed that President Ronald Reagan was there . . . or Prince Charles. Charles showed a flash of his nasty side at the next day’s press conference. Asked if his wife had enjoyed the ball, he seethed: ‘I’m not a glove puppet! She’d be an idiot if she didn’t enjoy dancing with John Travolta.’ Who would have thought a few yards of taffeta, silk and satin could reveal so much?","Family Tree (BBC2)

"By . Wills Robinson . Malicious: Chantelle McCluney, 23, laughed as the helpless victim was tortured in her Manchester flat . A mother-of-three lured a man to her home for a threesome, only to watch and laugh as he was  tortured by her boyfriend and another man. Chantelle McCluney, 23, laid a honeytrap by inviting the victim to her flat in Harpurhey, Manchester, for a liaison with her boyfriend, Craig Hogan. But when they arrived, the man was tied to a chair before being kicked, . punched and forced to drink bleach. They then burnt the man with an improvised flamethrower, created by spraying a can of deodorant at a cigarette lighter. During the terrifying ordeal, he was also dunked in a . urine-filled mop bucket, struck with a chair, robbed and forced to pose . naked on a balcony for half-an-hour. At one point McCluney had sex with another of her lovers, Andrew Doyle, as the humiliated man lay covered in blood on the floor – with Doyle kicking him throughout. When detectives asked McCluney why she had sex while the helpless victim was still in the room, she said: 'I’ll admit it – I felt horny.' Despite subjecting the man to 'inhuman' torture,  she was spared jail after admitting false imprisonment at Manchester Crown Court. Judge Richard Mansell QC, gave her an 18-month, suspended for two years. He concluded she had been under the influence of Hogan, after an ‘abusive’ relationship during her teens, and was in fear of Doyle. The court heard that the victim, now 42, was so traumatised he did not speak about the ordeal for four years. It was only when he went to counselling after a suicide attempt that he revealed the details of his horrifying experience and the group was arrested. On the night of the attack, the victim, . who says he has by flashbacks and ‘can still taste bleach’, was found . wandering in the city centre in a ‘stupor’  with severe facial injuries. At the time, he told police he had been robbed by strangers. Weeks before the attack in October 2008, the man had been invited to a threesome with McCluney and Hogan, who he had met in jail. During that encounter, Doyle turned up at McCluney’s flat. It emerged that McCluney and Hogan had been involved in a sex session earlier that day with him as well.

The victim thought that Doyle ‘looked like a drug addict’, and told McCluney in a text that she should get tested for sexually transmitted diseases. McCluney told Doyle, who was enraged, and recruited her and Hogan to get revenge. The man, who begged for mercy, was pelted with eggs by the trio before being released with a warning from Doyle that his family would be shot if he spoke out. Convicted robber Doyle, 24, was jailed for five years for false imprisonment, and convicted arsonist Hogan, 28, was jailed for four years. Both pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing.","Chantelle McCluney laughed as the man was tied to a chair and tortured .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Carl Lewis, the nine-time Olympic gold medal winner in track and field who once set world records for sprinting, said Monday that New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie tripped him up in 2011 he tried a run of a different kind – for political office. Current Lieutenant Gov. Kim Guadagno, then the state's attorney general, ruled that Lewis hadn't lived in the Garden State long enough to run for a seat in the state senate. He was preparing to run as a Democrat against Republican state Sen. Dawn Addiego, a Christie friend and ally. The story of Lewis' frustrating political hurdle is well-known in New Jersey, but he claimed Monday that Christie tried to force him out of the race by threatening to scuttle his role as the state's first physical fitness ambassador – a move he later made when Lewis took Guadagno to court. 'I felt like he was trying to intimidate me, absolutely,' the legendary athlete told the Star-Ledger in Newark. 'But I definitely didn’t feel intimidated.' Carl Lewis won 9 gold medals as a track and field athlete, and was best-known as a sprinter and long-jumper, but he allegedly found his political aspirations squashed when he tried to unseat a Christie chum . Man of the people: Lewis celebrated after winning the Olympic long jump competition during the 1996 Atlanta games . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has faced complaints about his bullying government style as the 2016 presidential circus approaches . 'It's interesting, everyone calling him a bully,' Lewis said. 'I don't really see him as a bully. I see it more as someone who's insecure, and he's governor now and has got the power.' An administrative law judge originally sided with Lewis, saying he met the requirements for putting his name on the ballot since he grew up in the new Jersey township of Willingboro. But Guadagno personally overturned that ruling, based on the fact that he had voted in California two years earlier. Christie and Guadagno have both attracted new claims of partisan bullying in recent weeks from adversaries. Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee, has speculated that Christie presided over a politically motivated closure of highway lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge as part of a retribution scheme against him after he declined to endorse Christie's re-election. That scandal has already led to the resignation of two Christie appointees at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the firing of two Christie aides. And Dawn Zimmer, the mayor of Hoboken, claims Guadagno carried a message to her from Christie, saying he would hold her city's Hurricane Sandy relief money hostage unless she approved a commercial development plan he favored. Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno was the New Jersey attorney general when Lewis tried to run for the state senate, and overruled a judge in disqualifying him from the ballot . Christie has looked haggard in recent days, as pressure mounts over his administration's handling of several new scandals . Lewis won the 100 meter sprint at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo, but couldn't get anywhere near a political finish line, he says, after Christie and Kim Guadagno intervened . Guadagno has categorically denied the allegation, but Zimmer has shared notes from her journal with a federal prosecutor who is already investigating Christie over what has become known as 'Bridgegate.' Lewis' almost-appointment as New Jersey's youth fitness czar, he said at the time, turned sour after he pressed forward with his bid to unseat Addiego, the governor's friend. 'I thought it was going just fine,' as Lewis  recalled for the Star-Ledger. 'And when I started to run, when he talked to me on the phone that night, he said ""If you run, we're going to have to cancel the program"".' The Christie administration ultimately spent $78,000 in attorney staffers' time to remove Lewis from the ballot, according to public records. But at the time, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak insisted that the governor never triedto step between Lewis and any political finish line. 'Absolutely, positively not. And anybody who says otherwise is lying,' he said then, although he did say Christie told Lewis that he needed to support his long-time friend. Drewniak, like 17 other officials, is under subpoena in connection with Bridgegate. Carl Lewis (L) took a rare silver medal in the 100-meter sprint at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, but earned the gold after apparent winner Ben Johnson (R) was later disqualified for failing a drug test .","Lewis, the 9-time Olympic gold medalist, says the guv muscled him off the ballot when he tried to run for state Senate after a longtime Christie chum .
Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, then the attorney general, overruled a judge in 2011 who decided Lewis had lived in the state long enough to get on the ballot .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Will Rory McIlroy be playing for Team GB or Ireland at the 2016 Olympics in Rio? Will the British elite like Ian Poulter be happy sharing rooms in the Olympic Village? Will players wear the Adidas Team GB cap when so many have lucrative deals in place with other manufacturers? Will all the caddies turn up for nothing? Just some of the questions that are now the responsibility of the man who beat more than 40 other applicants to be named manager of Team GB when golf re-enters the Olympic fold in two years’ time. And so when he wasn’t overseeing the startling short game improvements he’s instilled in Tommy Fleetwood, or practising his own game for the European Senior Tour, Jamie Spence was wandering up and down the driving range in Abu Dhabi last week and making people aware of his new posting. Rio, here we come: Jamie Spence has landed the plum job of Team GB's golf manager for the 2016 Olympics . Lean on me: Rory McIlroy talks to his fiance, Caroline Wozniacki, after losing out in Abu Dhabi on Sunday . Big decision: McIlroy must choose whether to represent Britain or Ireland at the Olympics in two years . We may as well start with the toughest question of all. How well does he know Rory and is he intent on a bit of arm-wrestling? ‘Who wouldn’t love to have Rory in his team?’ he said, smiling. ‘I will certainly be talking to him, that is for sure. But I think we all respect the incredibly difficult position he is in, and that this is a decision that has to come from him. As I said, I’d be the first to welcome him if he does decide to play for us, but I’ll also be the first to wish him all the best if he plays for Ireland.’ The 50-year-old Englishman confesses to being a little nervous as to the reaction of players used to all possible creature comforts being asked to ‘rough’ it in the Olympic Village. ‘There is some talk of a hotel, to be honest, but if I was a player who had made this team I’d want to embrace the whole experience,’ he said. ‘But will our top players feel the same way? In fact, are they interested in playing in the Olympics at all, with everything else going on in the crowded golf calendar? Those are the sort of conversations I will be having over the next few months.’ Heard the one about staying in a shared room, Ian? English star Poulter could be in line for the Games . Party time: The Olympics is heading to Rio de Janeiro in 2016 when golf will be played at the Games . One good thing about golf being back in the Olympics is the welcome boost it will surely give the women's game. ‘I think that’s going to be one of the really nice things about the job,’ said Spence. ‘It’s a real chance for the leading British women to put themselves on the wider sporting map and I’m looking forward to doing what I can to help.’ The selection criteria has yet to be finalised but is expected to be based on the world rankings, with Spence likely to be in charge of an eight-strong team of four men and four women, competing in two 72 hole events. He has been encouraged by the initial reaction. ‘The caddies have been telling me how much they’re looking forward to it, even though they won’t be paid, and I have had a good response from the players I have spoken to so far,’ he said. As an ex-chairman of the tournament players’ committee, and a former tour winner in his own right, Spence is certainly amply qualified. Let’s hope the stars give him the support he deserves. Great Scott . A villa on the market for £4million in Abu Dhabi comes with one unique selling point: a round of golf with the owner. Given the seller just happens to be the current Masters champion, it’s not a bad marketing ploy. The villa next to Saadiyat golf course was bought by Adam Scott in 2008, and comes with all the luxury items you would expect plus two maid’s rooms and, naturally enough, ‘a room for the driver.’ That’s the human variety, presumably. Despite owning it for six years, Scott has never lived in it. Who has a house worth £4m and never uses it?  Peter Alliss once said the top golfers are now so rich they live like movie stars and here’s another example. C'mon Aussie: Adam Scott is the reigning Masters champion following his unforgettable triumph last April . Room with a view: Scott's Saadiyat Beach villa is up for sale for a cool £4m... but includes a round of golf . It's a hard knock life: The Masters champion has never actually lived in his Abu Dhabi mansion . Casey's girl set to make a Splash . Paul Casey is giving the Qatar Masters a miss this week in order to attend the latest edition of the less than highbrow television show Splash on ITV on Saturday night. Casey’s glamorous fiancée, television presenter Pollyanna Woodward, is among the contestants. ‘I’m not allowed to talk about what dive she is going to do but I can promise it will be spectacular,’ says Casey, whose own career has come out of a rather spectacular nose dive since hooking up with fearless Polly. Driver and diver: Paul Casey (left) and his glamourous TV presenter girlfriend, Pollyanna Woodward (right) Sorry Henrik, but yours was NOT the shot of the yearYou hate to be so arrogant as to tell 63 per cent of voters they went for the wrong man, but let’s have a bash, shall we? In a recent poll on the European Tour’s website, that many people declared Henrik Stenson’s prodigious blow on the 18th hole in the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai last November as their shot of the year for 2013 (CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE SHOT). True, it was a real crowd-pleaser, finishing inches from the hole for a tap-in eagle. But shot of the year? Stenson was so far ahead he had already won the tournament. He admitted afterwards he actually pulled the shot, which is why it flirted with danger before finishing so close. Poll-winner: Henrik Stenson was back in action at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship last week . A far better blow was surely Justin Rose’s on the 18th at the United States Open. Not only was the tournament on the line, his whole career had practically been preparation for the four iron he simply had to pull off. So much at stake then, but the ball never left the flag for a second. Ok, it finished 30ft away. But the only reason it didn’t finish as close as Stenson’s shot in Dubai is they don’t have soft greens at the US Open. The Swedish gent was a deserved winner of many awards last year. But he shouldn’t have won this one. Moment of a lifetime: Justin Rose hits his laser-guided four iron from the 18th fairway at Merion . Final series solution is no closer . No 1: Henrik Stenson claimed glory in the European Tour's Race to Dubai last year but not everybody was happy with the Final Series schedule . Members of the European Tour’s players committee were specifically told not to comment on matters that went on during their meeting in Abu Dhabi last week. But my sources tell me a good deal of the meeting was spent talking about what changes, if any, to make to the structure of the tour’s Final Series. This, you will recall, was the four event series that closed out the season, comprising two events in China, one in Turkey and the last one in Dubai. Many of the top players were unhappy at being made to play in two of the first three at the end of a long season in order to qualify for the grand finale. Rebels like Sergio Garcia, Ernie Els and Charl Schwartzel simply downed tools, and so didn’t make it to the grand climax in the Middle East which, in turn, left the sponsors of the DP World Tour Championship feeling slightly short-changed. So what’s the solution? Is it right the . top players should call all the shots and be free to play where they . choose? Or do you protect the interests of four big-money sponsors by . insisting the superstars show some commitment and responsibility? It’s easy to see the argument from both sides and so not surprisingly, after much debate, the matter went unresolved, with officials left to go away and try to come up with a halfway house that keeps everyone happy. Quote of the week . ‘It’s . still Team Reed, and he proved the perfect replacement. They’re brother . and sister and their demeanour is the same. They don’t get too high and . never get too low.’ As . far as American Patrick Reed is concerned, there’s nothing like keeping . it in the family. When his wife, who caddies for him, became pregnant, . Reed turned to his brother-in-law Kessler to carry the bag – and you . could say it worked, as he completed a comfortable victory in the Humana . Challenge on the PGA Tour on Sunday. Two years ago Reed was outside the . world’s top 1,200. Now the 23-year-old rising star is inside the . all-important top 50.

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Ravel Morrison is set to return to the starting XI for West Ham’s Capital One Cup semi-final on Tuesday, despite Sam Allardyce saying he may have had his ‘head turned’ by relegation rivals Fulham. West Ham rejected a bid for the 20-year-old, thought to be £4million, but Allardyce suggested the promise of money and agents’ advice had affected Morrison’s mindset. Morrison came off the bench in the defeat by Newcastle on Saturday but has not started a match since the 5-0 FA Cup defeat by Nottingham Forest on January 5, when Allardyce used several of his youngsters. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Allardyce preview the Capital One Cup semi-final, second leg . Prize asset: West Ham manager Sam Allardyce admits midfielder Ravel Morrision's head may have been turned by interest from Fulham . Problems mounting: Allardyce has had to deal with Fulham's interest in Morrison and also trying to arrest the poor form of his West Ham side . Watching on: Morrison started on the bench for the Hammers' match with Newcastle at Upton Park on Saturday . On the scoresheet: Morrison celebrates a goal against Cardiff in the Capital One Cup third third win . Tuesday evening's match with Manchester City will be his first in a strong line-up since the game at Manchester United on December 21, when a groin injury began hampering his progress. Morrison is said to be keen on a move to Craven Cottage, even though Fulham are only one place and one point above West Ham in the Barclays Premier League. Contract talks have stalled to extend his £15,000-a-week deal, which has 18 months left. Asked why a switch to Fulham would appeal to Morrison, Allardyce said: ‘It’s like everything. This window creates a hysteria. Manchester trip to forget: Allardyce watched his West Ham side lose 6-0 to Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City in the Capital One Cup semi-final, first leg . 'People will tell you somebody is going to come and get you. ‘That could then turn your head, probably based on the money that people say you’re going to make. ‘I would probably think that at every club there is a player unsettled because of mad January, this lunatic transfer window that creates havoc throughout the game. Making a breakthrough: Morrison has hit form this season for West Ham, left, and has been rewarded with playing for the England U21s . Tale of the tape: How the teams might line up . ‘You can offer the advice but whether . they take it or not, they’re going to listen to the advice of agents . more than they are to the manager.’ Allardyce railed: ‘Some players will act and react in a different way, to whatever they feel is best for them. 'Sometimes it’s the wrong thing to do but that’s the way they go about it. ‘Sometimes it gets handled quietly and it’s done; sometimes a player will not turn up; sometimes a player will refuse to play; sometimes a player will accept that he’s got to continue to play well for the football club if it hasn’t happened. ‘He’s a young man and a young man with not much experience. You have to give a bit of leeway for that scenario.’ ‘It’s difficult for a manager to give . advice to a young player about that as they see you probably working for . the club rather than working for them. He added: ‘He’s not an experienced man . in life, never mind in football. 'And inexperienced young players can . react in many different ways.’ Not impressed: Allardyce branded Fulham's bid for Morrison as derisory . Allardyce labelled Fulham’s bid for Morrison, West Ham’s top scorer with five goals this season, as ‘derisory’ but stopped short of declaring him ‘not for sale’, adding he had yet to achieve ‘consistency’ in his standard of play.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Older people's brains are slower as they have more stored information, scientists have found . Elderly people's brains are slower because they have stored up more information, researchers have said today. Scientists from Tübingen University in Germany believe the human brain works slower in old age as it has to process a lifetime of stored-up information to recall simple facts. They say their research proves instead of being weak - older brains are in fact more powerful. The team used computers to study cognitive development in age. They programmed a computer to learn new words and commands on a daily basis by 'reading' - much like a human would learn. The researchers said cognitive tests  conducted on a computers which hadn't read much were comparable to the brains of a young adult - but those that read more were more like an elderly person's. The 'older' computer was certainly slower, researchers said, but only because its database had grown and it was having to process more information. They said their findings also explain why older people are often more forgetful. Dr. Michael Ramscar from the university said: 'The human brain works slower in old age but only because we have stored more information over time . 'The brains of older people do not get weak. On the contrary, they simply know more.' Speaking with the Telegraph, the scientist added: 'Imagine someone who knows two people’s birthdays and can recall them almost perfectly. 'Would you really want to say that person has a better memory than a person who knows the birthdays of 2000 people, but can ‘only’ match the right person to the right birthday nine times out of ten?' The study was published in the Journal of Topics in Cognitive Science. In the study, the team remarked that certain tests used to determine older people's mentality regularity favour the young. Certain cognitive tests favour young people who do not have so much 'stored' information, the study found . In one particular test, called 'paired associated learning', people are asked to remember pairs of random objects. The scientists say this test is more difficult for older people - as, over their lifetime, they have learned the two objects never go together and so struggle to remember them as a couple. Prof. Harald Baayen, who heads group who conducted the research added: 'The fact that older adults find nonsense pairs harder to learn than young adults simply demonstrates older adults’ much better understanding of language. 'They have to make more of an effort to learn unrelated word pairs because, unlike the youngsters, they know a lot about which words don’t belong together.'","Scientists at Tübingen University, Germany say, older brains aren't weaker .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The FBI is attempting to find missing Wall Street Journal reporter David Bird who mysteriously disappeared from his home in New Jersey on Saturday January 11.The FBI is helping the Long Hill Township Police Department find David Bird,55, who told his wife he was going to go on a short walk--without his cell phone and daily medication, reports Fox News. He was recovering from a gastrointestinal virus when he disappeared, leaving vital medication he has to take twice a day for a liver transplant. Bird was an avid hiker and his decision to go on a 'short walk' the day of his disappearance was not uncommon . Police searched the woods and river near . his home, but there had been no sign of the 55-year-old until his . credit card was reportedly used on Wednesday night. According to NBC News, the card was used for a purchase in Mexico, and the family believe Mr Bird's disappearance may be connected to his coverage of Opec. Mr Bird, a father-of-two, covered energy markets for the Wall Street Journal, and works for the Dow Jones. Mr Bird's reports on the organization tended to be straightforward news pieces, leading others to also dismiss the connection between his disappearance and the group as nothing more than rumors. A call to the Morris County Prosecutor's Officer to confirm reports of the card being used has not yet been returned. Police Chief Michael Mazzeo told the Echoes-Sentinel on Thursday morning that the 'only thing to report is that he is still missing'. The FBI has conducted searches in the . surrounding land including swamps, the nearby Passaic River, and the . railroad tracks but there is still no sign of the missing reporter. David Bird's credit card was allegedly used in Mexico but police have not been able to track the person who used his card . Fox news reports that a source told them there has been no evidence to suggest foul play but that 't hasn't been ruled out' and that 'anything is possible' The Newark Star Ledger reports that police are investigating his phone and computer to look for any clues that may lead them to him but there is nothing so far. Bird was last seen wearing a distinct bright red jacket with two yellow zippers. He is white, 6 feet tall, i inch tall and weighs around 200 pounds. Anyone with information about his disappearance are asked to call The Long Hill Township Police Department at 908-647-1800.

"By . Steve Doughty . Families will be given a say over the treatment of patients who are thought to be near death, ministers promised yesterday (stock picture) Families will be given a say over the treatment of patients who are thought to be near death, ministers promised yesterday. They said loved ones must be ‘involved in decisions’ in NHS hospitals to ensure the ‘horrific’ abuses and ‘tick-box’ culture created by the discredited Liverpool Care Pathway never happen again. And hospital managers or doctors who try to cover up the circumstances of a patient’s death will be subject to criminal prosecutions and heavy fines in court. The radical rights for families are part of a new protection package for the dying that ministers say will mean an end to the ‘protocols and processes’ that led to the Liverpool Care Pathway scandal. They acted after the Daily Mail told how families were kept in the dark about the fact that their loved ones had been put on the Pathway and revealed that hospitals had been paid millions to reach targets for numbers of patients dying on it. The LCP, originally designed to ensure dignified and pain-free dying, was scrapped last year after a scathing independent inquiry found that it had meant ‘uncaring, rushed and ignorant’ treatment of the most vulnerable hospital patients. In some cases, patients were denied water as they died. Under the Pathway, doctors and nurses decided when a patient was about to die. Commonly, a syringe driver would pump them with sedatives, while tubes giving food and water were detached. Death would follow, typically within 36 hours. The inquiry was called after leading medical figures condemned the system as a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’, and thousands of families of patients who had died complained. New rules for the care of patients thought to be near the end of their lives will forbid hospitals from deciding that someone is dying and then speeding their end by drugging them and removing tubes giving them food and water. The . radical rights for families are part of a new protection package for . the dying that ministers say will mean an end to the ‘protocols and . processes’ that led to the Liverpool Care Pathway scandal (stock picture) Instead, there must be regular reviews of treatment in all cases, dying patients and their families must be kept informed and involved in decisions, and treatment will be ‘tailored to the individual’. Hospitals will be told to appoint independent assessors to decide on complaints in ‘serious or untoward incidents’. Under new laws now coming into operation managers or doctors who try to prevent investigations or organise cover-ups of deaths or serious cases of error or malpractice can be brought to court by the hospital regulator, the Care Quality Commission. Courts will be able to levy fines on a scale yet to be decided. The new rules on care for the dying, labelled Priorities for Care, were announced yesterday by Care Minister Norman Lamb. ‘The Liverpool Care Pathway became a tick-box process and we lost sight of the crucial importance of compassionate care,’ he said. ‘In future, there will be an absolute focus on the individual and the family. There will be no process or protocol. Under the Pathway, doctors and nurses decided when a patient was about to die. Commonly, a syringe driver would pump them with sedatives, while tubes giving food and water were detached. Death would follow, typically within 36 hours (stock picture) 'There will be no assumption of an inevitable path towards death, which became so horrific in many places.’ He added: ‘The new priorities will mean that care is focused on dying people’s wishes. This will make sure their voices, and those of their families, are heard at all times.’ Baroness Neuberger, who headed the inquiry into the Pathway last year, will continue to monitor the way dying patients are treated until next summer. She warned yesterday that public worries will not ease until everyone knows the firm details of how the families of the dying will have a say. Professor Patrick Pullicino, the first senior medical figure to criticise the Pathway, welcomed the decision to put patients and their families ‘at the centre of decisions about treatment’. But he warned: ‘The central flaw of the LCP and what made it dangerous was the inability to diagnose, with any accuracy, that someone is going to die within days or hours. ‘This remains a central problem with Priorities for Care. Calling someone a dying person, as this new approach does, means that anyone so labelled will be at risk of dying inappropriately, as occurred with the LCP.’","LCP, designed for dignified and pain-free dying, was scrapped last year .

"By . Sara Nathan . Nigella Lawson was seen at Heathrow airport last night before the decree nisi was granted today . Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi will divorce tomorrow - just weeks after the multi-millionaire was pictured choking his estranged wife. Nigella, 53, is the applicant in the case at London's High Court to be heard before District Judge Aitken, MailOnline can reveal. The 'quickie divorce' will be heard at 10.30am - and means the couple's 10-year-marriage could be over in a matter of minutes. The pair, who are said to be worth an estimated $228 million and shared an $18 million home in Chelsea, are believed to have agreed never to publicly disclose the terms of the divorce or financial settlements. They are also understood to have signed a pre-nuptial agreement when they wed in 2003. It is understood Mr Saatchi dispensed with lawyers to deal directly with Nigella's high profile lawyer Fiona Shackleton in an attempt to keep his multi-million-dollar art collection intact. The couple are not required to attend . the hearing and Nigella is expected to seek the divorce on the . grounds of her husband's unreasonable behaviour. They will have to wait for at least six weeks after the decree nisi is pronounced before their divorce can be legally finalised with a decree absolute. Their marriage ended after Mr Saatchi, 70, was pictured choking his wife, who has made her fortune as TV's Domestic Goddess, at their favourite London haunt, Scott's restaurant, last month. Nigella was then left reeling by Mr Saatchi’s ‘cruelty’ after he announced in The Mail on Sunday that he would be seeking a divorce. In a final, crushing act of emotional control, he released an extraordinary statement to say that the marriage was over — without giving her any warning of his intentions. Nigella has now moved out of their home and has rented an apartment with her son Bruno. She is soon planning to head to Los Angeles where she is filming the new season of her ABC show The Taste. Earlier this month, friends of Mr Saatchi told the Mail:‘He and Nigella agreed – via Fiona Shackleton – to a speedy divorce. Fiona Shackleton is Nigella’s first cousin and Charles highly respects her. ‘He did not hire a lawyer himself and he has not even spoken to Helen Ward, whom a Sunday paper claimed he has hired. ‘Fiona prepared a full court document, every detail of every asset was listed, and an agreement was reached with no dispute. ‘They have agreed never to make public the terms of the divorce or financial settlements. Fiona lodged the divorce document with the court last Friday.’ Proceedings: After the decree nisi is announced today Nigella and soon-to-be-ex-husband Charles Saatchi will be formally divorced in six weeks . The end of a marriage: The photo of Charles Saatchi with his hands round the throat of his wife Nigella Lawson led to their divorce . 'Heartbroken': Although Charles Saatchi announced he was divorcing Nigella Lawson - it was the TV star who was in the fact the applicant for the divorce . Baroness Shackleton, who advised the Prince of Wales in his divorce and represented Sir Paul McCartney, has been nicknamed the Steel Magnolia for her charm and determination. The former advertising tycoon initially brushed off the incident as nothing more than a ‘playful tiff’, but further images revealed Miss Lawson suffered 27 minutes of anguish and had her nose repeatedly tweaked and twisted by Mr Saatchi. At one point he even put his finger up her nose as they dined outside Scott’s restaurant in London. Distraught: Nigella Lawson has now moved out of her marital home and into a rented apartment with her children Cosima and Bruno . Mr Saatchi later accepted a police caution for assault. Friends say Nigella was willing right up until the end to give their marriage another chance and was left ‘floored’ and ‘blindsided’ by his decision to begin divorce proceedings against her. They were reportedly arguing over Miss Lawson’s son Bruno, 17, and daughter Cosima, 19, from her marriage to journalist John Diamond, who died in 2001 from throat cancer. Both children have been seen comforting their mother during the past few tense weeks at her new rented home and will join her in Los Angeles this summer. Nigella is also said by friends to have invited Phoebe Saatchi, 19, Mr Saatchi's daughter from his second marriage to Kay Hartenstein , to stay at her rented home, although it is unclear as of yet whether she take her step-mother up on her offer. Mr Saatchi appeared to blame Nigella for the end of the marriage, claiming he decided to divorce her after she refused to defend him in public. He also alleged that she had held him by the throat during arguments at home. Mr Saatchi said in his statement he had ‘clearly been a disappointment’ to his wife over the past year, and that they had been drifting apart.

Saatchi announced he was divorcing Nigella in a lengthy statement - . although her friends said she had hoped to repair their marriage . He has traded art over the years, making large profits on works by Damien Hirst and other British artists. His collection is reported to be worth £200million. The Saatchi Gallery, which Mr Saatchi opened in 1985, has included some of the UK’s most controversial and talked-about artworks. The current exhibition includes work from Jessica Jackson Hutchins, who makes papier-maché sculptures of household objects, and a piece by Jose Lerma and Hector Madera of a giant bust of a man made from paper. Mr Saatchi also famously bought Tracey Emin’s work My Bed for £150,000, for which he got an unmade bed littered with condoms, cigarette packets and underwear. It was later installed in a dedicated room in his own home.","Charles Saatchi announced he was to divorce Nigella Lawson in statement .

"By . Sam Webb . Enemy of the state: Chippenham Mayor John Scragg, who was arrested in Russia for taking pictures of the public transport system . An elderly mayor from a quiet market town in Wiltshire was arrested on a trip to Russia because they suspected he was a terrorist - after he took pictures of trams and trolley buses. John Scraggs, the 69-year-old first citizen of Chippenham, was led to the cells and interrogated after they found photos of him standing next to the vehicles. Despite his protests, Mr Scraggs and another man from a 20-strong party of tourists were held for five hours and faced tough questioning from interrogators. The white-faced pair feared they’d be deported from Russia or even worse, sent to do hard labour in Siberia. But the authorities finally accepted they were innocent trippers on an organised visit to Samara in south-east Russia and let them go. The public transport enthusiast couldn’t wait to make the trip to Russia with fellow enthusiasts to see the buses and trains. 'They couldn’t work out why all our photos were of trams and trolley buses rather than the usual cathedrals,' said the mayor today. 'They must have thought we were terrorists and we’d taken photos of each other standing next to likely targets like the transport system. 'I feared we were going to get thrown out of Russia, or worse. 'It was quite grim - they questioned us separately but finally believed our story and let us go at 11.30 at night.' He added: 'Being the mayor is great - you get to meet all sorts of people!' Suspicious? The mayor next to a tram in the south-eastern city of Samara in Russia . Hobby: Mr Scraggs is a huge public transport enthusiast and a keen photographer . The mayor and another man in the tour group were held for five hours by the Russian authorities . Mr Scraggs is currently serving his third term as mayor. He was also voted in as first citizen in 1992 and 2005 and serves as a Liberal Democrat member of the town council. Had the Russian authorities taken the time to check his online profile, they’d have seen he doesn’t really offer much in the way of a hardened terrorist. High-profile suspect: Mr Scraggs is currently serving his third term as mayor . 'They couldn¿t work out why all our photos were of trams and trolley buses rather than the usual cathedrals,' said the mayor . Eventually the authorities accepted they were innocent holidaymakers on an organised visit . After leaving school in Sidcup, Kent, he studied at the London School of Economics and had a career as a senior internal auditor and project finance officer. He lists his hobbies as ‘overseas tramways, London and provincial buses, military history (air and land warfare) from 1939’. On his council website profile he says: 'My interests include photography and transport. I represent the council on the local Wiltshire County Council parish transport group so am particularly keen to ensure that our bus and train services, including Chippenham’s bus and railway stations, serve the requirements of local people.' As well as buses and military vehicles, Mr Scraggs is fascinated by overseas tramways .","John Scraggs, mayor of Chippenham, was collared by Russian authorities .

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . French security agents regularly spy illegally on phone calls, according to reports, which will embarrass President Francois Hollande, who has vocally criticsied the U.S. French security agents regularly spy illegally on people's phone calls, emails, and social media activity, intelligence sources confirmed today. Revelations about the covert activities follow President Francois Hollande attacking America for its own espionage activities, and saying they should stop 'immediately'. Le Monde, the most famous and best respected newspaper in France, today carries a detailed report outlining the behaviour of the DGSE, the country's notoriously ruthless external intelligence agency. It says the DGSE intercepts signals from computers and telephones - including foreign ones - to work out 'who is talking to whom'. Such activity boils down to wiretapping, even though this is officially strictly forbidden following a number of scandals in the past. 'All of our communications are spied on,' says Le Monde's report, quoting unnamed intelligence sources, as well as remarks made publicly by intelligence officials. 'Emails, text messages, telephone records, access to Facebook and Twitter are then stored for years,' it says. Such activities are just like those carried out by the U.S. National Security Agency, as described in documents leaked by former NSA worker Edward Snowden. He confirmed that the NSA keeps vast amounts of Internet data under a programme called Prism. It includes emails, chat room conversations and videos taken from sites run by giants like Facebook and Google. The U.S. government also gathers so-called 'metadata', noting the time, duration and numbers called - all listed by service providers like Verizon. The revelations will be an embarrassment to France, which has vocally criticised the U.S. after the Snowden leaks. French Interior Minister Manuel Valls today publicly dressed down the United States at the American ambassador's . July 4 garden party, denouncing alleged U.S. 'espionage' of France and . other countries. Tensions between France and the U.S. have been strained since former NSA worker Edward Snowden leaked documents suggesting America regularly spied on its European allies . Valls was guest of honor at the fete hosted by Ambassador Charles Rivkin . Thursday. In a speech before hundreds of guests, he said that 'in the . name of our friendship, we owe each other honesty. We must say things . clearly, directly, frankly.' He said that President Francois Hollande's demand for clear and precise . explanations about reports of U.S. spying are justified because 'such . practices, if proven, do not have their place between allies and . partners.' European countries agreed Wednesday that planned talks on free trade . with the U.S. must start in parallel with discussions on National . Security Agency surveillance. France's DGSE has publicly always insisted that it works within the law, but its past activities have included the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior ecological protest boat in 1985. The operation against the Greenpeace craft - which caused the death of a Dutch activist - violated New Zealand neutrality and caused international outrage. French Interior Minister Manuel Valls publically dressed down U.S. Ambassador Charles Rivkin during a July 4 garden party . It was ordered by former Socialist president Francois Mitterand, who was himself linked with an illegal wiretapping cell within France itself. But France's national security commission has challenged Le Monde's report, saying that the only body that collects communications information was a security agency controlled by the prime minister's office. Earlier this week, President Hollande threatened to block negotiations on transatlantic trade following revelations that the US spied on its allies. 'We cannot accept this kind of behaviour between partners and allies,' Mr Hollande said. 'We ask that this immediately stop. There can be no negotiations or transactions in all areas until we have obtained these guarantees, for France but also for all of the European Union, for all partners of the United States.' The DGSE revelations will now leave Mr Hollande looking, at best, incredibly naieve, and at worst extremely hypocritical. France's seven other intelligence services, including domestic secret services and customs and money-laundering watchdogs, have access to the DGSE data, writes Le Monde . Britain is said to have a similar spying programme on international phone and Internet traffic, and is said to share personal information with the American NSA. A spokesman for the DGSE in Paris refused to comment directly on Le Monde's report.","Revelations that security agents illegally spy on residents and foreigners .

"By . Valerie Elliott . To millions of her subjects she is the ultimate Queen Bee. Now Her Majesty is turning her attention to the plight of Britain’s honey bees, and funding grants from £500 to £1,000 to encourage people to set up beehives on Duchy of Lancaster land. One condition for the grants is learning to distinguish queen bees from workers. Funding: The Queen will offer out grants of up to £1,000 for those willing to keep bees on her estate . The Queen is apparently concerned by the rapid decline in Britain’s bee colonies linked to the varroa mite which has also devastated honeybees in the United States and mainland Europe. Other causes include poor weather, pesticides and pollution. Without pollination by bees, Britain’s crops will suffer. Beekeeping enthusiasts include  TV celebrities Kate Humble and Bill Turnbull, but many are put off by the cost. So the Duchy, which provides a personal income to the Sovereign, has launched the start-up grants for tenant farmers or anyone else willing to keep hives on its 46,000 acres in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire. The cash will be used for people to attend a training course, which costs about £60 for six three-hour sessions; to purchase a hive, which varies from £250 to £350; to buy a swarm of bees for about £150, and a protective suit with veiled helmet and gloves at £70 to £120. Recipients will also have to join a local beekeepers’ association which costs about £30 a year. There is no limited cash pot for the grants, and each application  will be decided on merit. Nathan Thompson, the Duchy’s chief executive, said: ‘As a responsible landlord, the Duchy is acutely aware of the need to protect the natural environment and supporting the bee population is an intrinsic part of that.’ Beekeepers will be encouraged to keep the British native dark bee, or black bee, which is more resistant to British weather.","Queen will offer grants of up to £1,000 to encourage beekeepers .

"By . James Tozer . A Christian family threatened with legal action for refusing to bake a cake in support of gay rights yesterday hit back, saying they should be able to run their business in line with their religious beliefs. Ashers Baking Company – named after a verse in the Bible – turned down an order for a cake featuring Sesame Street puppets Bert and Ernie and the slogan ‘Support gay marriage’. They were threatened with legal action after the gay rights activist who placed the order complained that equality laws had been breached. But yesterday general manager Daniel McArthur said he was determined to make a stand. Scroll down for video . Ashers Baking Company - named after a verse in the Bible - turned down an order for a cake featuring Sesame Street puppets Bert and Ernie and the slogan 'Support gay marriage' ‘I would like the outcome of this to be that any Christians running a business could be allowed to follow their Christian beliefs and principles in the day-to-day running of the business and that they are allowed to make decisions based on that,’ he said. ‘I feel if we don’t take our stand with this case then how can we stand up against it further down the line, certainly from an equality point of view?’ Gareth Lee placed the order  several weeks ago at a branch  of Ashers in Belfast, one of six shops run by the Northern Ireland-based business. It is named after one of the 12 tribes of Israel. According to the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, ‘Bread from Asher shall be rich and he shall yield royal dainties.’ Campaign: Andrew Muir cuts the cake, produced by another bakery, with the Sesame Street puppets and 'Support gay marriage' slogan . Mr . Lee wanted a ‘celebration cake’ decorated with an image of Sesame . Street puppets Bert and Ernie, who have been adopted as unofficial . mascots by same-sex marriage campaigners in the US based on an urban . myth that they are gay couple. It . was to have featured the slogan ‘Support gay marriage’ – Northern . Ireland is the only part of the UK where it has not been made legal – . and the logo of Mr Lee’s campaign group, QueerSpace. The . request was passed to 24-year-old Mr McArthur’s parents, Colin and . Karen, the firm’s founders, who declined to fulfil the order as it went . against their religious beliefs, offering a refund instead. ‘It . was in contradiction with what the Bible teaches and on the following . Monday we rang up the customer to let him know that we could not take . his order,’ he said. It was to have featured the slogan 'Support gay marriage' - Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where it has not been made legal - and the logo of campaign group, QueerSpace. The request was refused by the firm's founders, who said it went against their religious beliefs, offering a refund instead . Mr Lee is understood to have complained to the Equality Commission of Northern Ireland, which wrote to Ashers warning of legal action in the county court for breaching the law by discriminating against the customer on the grounds of his sexual orientation. Mr McArthur said the commission had asked how it proposed to ‘recompense’ Mr Lee, but he pledged to resist its demand. ‘Although we have found this experience unsettling and disruptive to our business we are convinced that we have made the right decision,’ he said. ‘We continue to take the stand and stance that we take. Marriage in Northern Ireland has not been redefined. It still is defined as being a union between one man and one woman.’ Sesame Street viewers have long speculated lovable roomates Bert and Ernie are gay, although creators have never confirmed it. In 2011, an online campaign was launched to make the rumoured relationship official. 'Let Bert & Ernie Get Married On Sesame Street', a petition at change.org as started by Illinois resident Lair Scott. Responding to pressure at the time, a spokesman for Sesame Workshop wrote in a statement: '(Bert and Ernie) were created to teach preschoolers that people can be good friends with those who are very different from themselves. 'Even though the Sesame Street Muppets… possess many human traits and characteristics, they have no sexual orientation.' Gay marriage is a highly divisive issue in Northern Ireland where the devolved assembly at Stormont has rejected several attempts to change the law on the issue. The cake had been ordered for an event at the town hall in Bangor, County Down, hosted by the mayor, Alliance Party member Andrew Muir, to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia on May 17. Another bakery ended up making the cake. Yesterday Mr Muir said: ‘I fully support the action taken against this bakery. Businesses should not be able to pick and choose who they serve. There would not be any debate if the cake had depicted an anti-racism or anti-ageism slogan.’ But Colin Hart, of the Christian Institute, which is backing Ashers, said: ‘All the McArthurs want is to run their bakery according to their Christian beliefs. ‘Imbalanced equality laws are making it increasingly hard for people, especially Christians.’ The case is the latest in which Christians have faced the threat of court over their beliefs. Judges have ruled that it is wrong for businesses to refuse to serve gay people on grounds of religious conviction. The Equality Commission said it would consider Ashers’ response ‘before taking further action’.","Ashers Baking Company turned down order for cake featuring Sesame .

"By . Wills Robinson . Schoolchildren are boosting their exam grades by saying they have a headache or hayfever before sitting the paper. An increasing number of GCSEs and A-Level students are applying for 'special consideration' and receiving an additional one or two per cent on their total mark by claiming to have an injury or illness. More than 374,000 requests for extra marks were granted this summer, or nine in every 10 papers put forward, an increase of 13 per cent on last year. Abuse of the system? Nine out of 10 pupils who asked for 'special consideration' were granted it this summer (posed) Pupils can claim up to five per cent more more on their grade for issues including a concussion, 'minor upset' or by claiming a noise disturbed them during the exam. Under current rules, pupils can be given an extra one per cent for a headache or 'minor upset', two per cent for hay fever, but just five per cent for the recent death of a close family member or if their parents are terminally ill. One per cent - Noise during the exam, illness suffered by another candidate causing a disruption, minor ailments, headaches or 'minor upset arising from administrative problems'. Two per cent - Recovering from a broken limb, concussion, hay fever on the day of the exam and extreme stress. Three per cent - Recent death of a close friend or distant relative, flare-up of congenital conditions such as epilepsy, physical trauma before an exam, domestic crisis and witnessing a 'distressing event' on the day of the exam. Four per cent - Life-threatening illness, car accident, major surgery near the exam date and death of an extended family member. Five per cent - Terminal illness of the pupil or parent, recent death in the close family and a 'serious domestic crisis'. According to the figures released by exam regulator Ofqual, the number of children receiving extra marks has increased by 20 per cent in five years, despite a drop in the number of exams being taken. Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education told The Daily Telegraph there will be some children with genuine reasons for receiving the extra marks, but others will be abusing the system, and fears a 'racket' will be created as a result. He said: 'I think we have to have a thorough investigation into this because exams need to be fair to all children and you can't have a situation where a few benefit and others don't.' The figures show 415,200 requests were made and 90 per cent were approved, accounting to three per cent of all exams taken in schools across the country. It was also revealed that 135 schools were issued with penalties for giving candidates extra . time, inappropriate invigilation or bungling the handling of test . papers in exams over the summer. This was an almost . fourfold increase on 2011 and a four per cent increase on last year - . although exam watchdog Ofqual, which released the figures, admitted many . cases went unreported. The conduct of one test centre was considered so serious that it was stripped of the right to offer public exams. The vast majority - 128 - were given written warnings. Malpractice also soared among individual members of staff, from 60 instances last year to 97 this year. A quarter were banned from taking part in future exams or assessments and a similar proportion were issued with special conditions. Action was taken in nearly two-thirds of cases for giving ‘inappropriate assistance to candidates’, such as translating questions on a foreign language paper. Malpractice also soared among individual members of staff, from 60 instances last year to 97 this year (posed) Other reasons include coaching or prompting candidates in the exam room or allowing them extra time to finish a paper. The . rise in cheating in the 6,000 schools and colleges where exams are sat . occurred despite a seven per cent decrease in the number of papers . marked. They are under increasing pressure to perform well, amid a crackdown on grade inflation and demands for a higher proportion of pupils to achieve at least five good GCSEs to avoid possible closure or being converted into an academy. Teachers have also been entering teenagers early and on multiple occasions for GCSEs to maximise their chances of scraping a C grade or higher. The government has now cracked down on this practice by saying only the first attempt will count towards school league tables. The way schools performance is measured is also being changed. Cheating and other inappropriate behaviour by pupils also rose slightly by 1.6 per cent on last year to 2,590 cases. This ranged from attempting to pass or receive information in the exam room to bringing in a mobile phone or other electronic device and causing disruption. Just over half were docked marks and one in five were told they would not be awarded a qualification. The statistics also revealed a slight drop in the number of candidates given official permission to have more time to complete exams, known as access arrangements. Ofqual demanded a crackdown last year which saw applications fall around 5,000 to 123,248 this year. Approvals were also down, from 96 per cent to 95 per cent. Chief regulator Glenys Stacey said she would be ‘looking in more detail at those significant differences in access arrangements and special considerations’. She added: ‘Malpractice remains a big concern. It is not always identified and identified malpractice is not always reported, so the figures cannot ever present a complete picture.’","GCSE and A-Level students can gain up to five per cent on their paper .

"By . Becky Evans . Panama has detained a North Korean-flagged ship after it was found to be carrying undeclared weapons hidden underneath sugar containers, the country's president said. President Ricardo Martinelli said the ship, the Chong Chon Gang, was intercepted as it approached the Panama Canal from Cuba and as it was stopped the 35-man crew rioted and the captain tried to kill himself. The 'sophisticated missile equipment', hidden in containers of brown sugar, was detected after Panamanian authorities stopped the ship, suspecting it was carrying drugs. Martinelli said the undeclared military cargo appeared to include missiles and non-conventional arms and the ship was violating United Nations resolutions against arms trafficking. Scroll down for video . Panama President Ricardo Martinelli tweeted this picture of what he said were undeclared weapons and later identified as outdated, Soviet-era arms . Panama's president Ricardo Martinelli announced the ship had been detained through Twitter . Panamanian authorities have only . searched one of the ship's five cargo holds so far, said Luis Eduardo . Camacho, a spokesman for the president. 'This material not being declared and Panama being a neutral country, a . country in peace, that doesn't like war, we feel very worried about this . war material and we don't know what else will have... passed through . the Panama Canal,' Martinelli said. The governments of North Korea and Cuba have so far not commented on Martinelli's remarks. Hugh Griffiths, an arms trafficking expert at the Stockholm . International Peace Research Institute, said the seized ship is called . Chong Chon Gang and has been on the institute's suspect list for some . time. He said the ship had been caught before for trafficking narcotics and . small arms ammunition. It was stopped in 2010 in the Ukraine and was . attacked by pirates 400 miles off the coast of Somalia in 2009. Griffiths' institute has also been interested in the ship because of a . stop it made in 2009 in Tartus - a Syrian port city hosting a Russian . naval base. The vessel was pulled over near the port of Manzanillo on the Atlantic side of the canal. The 35-man crew on board the Chong Chon Gang (pictured at the Panama port) rioted and the captain tried to kill himself when Panamanian authorities intercepted it . The crew have been arrested and the ship has been detained at the Manzanillo International terminal . The ship was stopped on the way to the Panama Canal (file picture) on suspicion it was carrying drugs . 'We're going to keep unloading the . ship and figure out exactly what was inside,' Martinelli told Panamanian . television late on Monday, without giving further details. 'The world needs to sit up and take note: You cannot go around shipping undeclared weapons of war through the Panama Canal.' Griffiths also said the institute earlier this year reported to the U.N. a discovery it made of a flight from Cuba to North Korea that travelled . via central Africa. 'Given the history of North Korea, . Cuban military cooperation and now . this latest seizure, we find this flight more interesting,' he said. 'After this incident there should be renewed focus on North Korean-Cuban . links.' Martinelli said the captain had a heart attack and also tried to commit suicide during the operation. He said authorities had been tipped off some days ago that the ship might be carrying drugs. Undercover? The bags were labeled Cuban Raw Sugar . Speaking out: The Caribbean nation admitted last night that it owned the military equipment and said it was due to be returned to the island once repairs had been completed .

He posted a picture of what appeared to be a green tubular object sitting inside a cargo container or the ship's hold. A spokeswoman for the canal said she did not have any more information and referred questions to the attorney general and the office did not immediately return requests for comment. Javier Caraballo, Panama's top anti-drugs prosecutor, told local television the ship was en route to North Korea. The Communist country is barred from importing large weapons under United Nations sanctions. The UN strengthened sanctions against the country in March following it nuclear tests that set tensions rising in the area.

"By . Mark Prigg . and Daily Mail Reporter . Though a lifetime trip to a Mars may not be a typical life plan, that hasn't stopped more than 78,000 people from applying to sign up for the chance to be one of the select to see the Red Planet up close. A Dutch company called Mars One began accepting applications just over two weeks ago for volunteers who want to be trained as astronauts. Departure for the Red Planet is scheduled for . 2022, landing seven months later in 2023 - and they will never return. Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, has announced that it will document the progress of a group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the red planet. This illustration shows what the settlement on Mars would look like . The Dutch-based project wants to launch a supply mission to land on Mars by October 2016. The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips 'much safer than moon missions' 'With 78,000 applications in two weeks, this is turning out to be the most desired job in history,' said Bas Lansdorp, co-founder of Mars . One. 'These numbers put us right on track for our goal of half a million applicants.' They have been inundated with . applications from all over the globe, and now must start sifting through . the files in order to figure out who will be among in the group of . candidates who proceed to the reality show round of the competition, . where they will be whittled down to an even-smaller group of four . finalists. Anyone 18 or older may apply via . video but there is an application fee that ranges depending on the . wealth of the applicant's home country - $38 for U.S. applicants. Mars One says it is not necessary to have military training nor experience in flying aircraft nor even a science degree. Candidates must: . To apply, click here . The . money from the application fees will fund the mission, and given the . number that have already applied, they could have raised anywhere . between $390,000 and $5,850,000 already. In the last stage when 24-40 candidates . have been fully trained and qualified, the final decision of choosing . the first settlers will be decided by an audience vote. 'This is an international mission and . it is very important for the project that anyone anywhere can ask . themselves: Do I want this? Am I ready for this? If the answer is yes . then we want to hear from you,' said Lansdorp. The time . commitment to the project- successful candidates will have to undergo . eight years of training before blast-off in 2023- has clearly not been . an inhibiting factor so far. Former NASA researcher Norbert Kraft, . Mars One’s medical director, said: ‘Gone are the days when bravery and . the number of hours flying a supersonic jet were the top criteria for . selection. 'Now, we are more concerned with how . well each astronaut works and lives with the others – and for a lifetime . of challenges ahead.’ Mars One aims to raise money to help . fund the project through a long-running, global, reality TV show, which . will select the first 24 candidates and follow their training. Viewers would vote for who should be . on the first team of four to leave Earth in ten years time. By 2033 the . colony would reach 20 settlers. Applicants for the mission are being shown on the Mars One website. Users will eventually be able to vote for who they want . Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. Settlers would encounter a barren, . cratered landscape, an unbreathable atmosphere made up of 95 per cent . carbon dioxide and temperatures ranging from 35C to minus 135C. This online application will be the first of the four rounds that together make the Mars One selection procedure.

"By . Fiona Macrae . If you are struggling to cope with the pressures of another Monday morning, blame your mother. Researchers claim to have discovered why some people are more prone to suffering from stress and anxiety than others – they shared their mother’s stress while still in the womb. Normally, the placenta, the baby’s lifeline as it grows in the womb, protects it from hormones that build up in the mother’s blood when she is stressed. In some women, however, the protection is weak and the harmful hormones cross from mother to baby. Pregnancy: Research suggests that women who lack a protective enzyme in the womb affect their unborn children with their stresses . Edinburgh University researcher . Professor Jonathan Seckl said: ‘There is an enzyme found in high levels . in the placenta and the baby’s brain. It seems to be a natural barrier . to stress hormones and it deactivates them. ‘If you inhibit this barrier then you . start to get children with a low birth weight who have altered stress . responses and depression. ‘This may be what underpins the variation you get from one individual to another.’ The research suggests that babies exposed tot their mother's stress later in pregnancy are more likely to develop depression or be susceptible to PTSD . It is thought that the protective . barrier can be overwhelmed by high levels of stress in pregnancy. In . other cases, some women may not make enough of the barrier enzyme to . begin with. Once the stress hormones have breached . the barrier, they can affect the delicate developing brain and trigger . changes that leave the child prone to anxiety and behavioural problems . as he or she grows up. Curiously, eating large amounts of . liquorice in pregnancy may have the same effect. Professor Seckl has . shown that mothers-to-be who gorge on the sweet treat seem to raise the . odds of their unborn child becoming anxious and badly behaved. He said: ‘When we looked at Finnish . women – who tend to eat a lot of liquorice – those who ate a bag a day . compared with those who did not tended to have babies born a couple of . days earlier. ‘By the age of eight, we saw a two-thirds increase in the rates of attention deficits and anxiety behaviours.’ It is thought that a compound in . liquorice helps break down the protective barrier, allowing stress . hormones to pass from mother to child. Stress in the womb may also have long-term effects on the unborn child’s physical health. A recent study of English . mothers-to-be found that going through a major upheaval, such as a . bereavement or separation, dramatically raised the odds of their baby . suffering ill-health by the age of four.","Researchers at the University of Edinburgh found mothers' wombs and babies' brains contain a chemical protecting them from a mother's stress .

"By . Richard Spillett . A ship's precious cargo of 2,800 bars of silver has finally reached the Royal Mint to be made into coins - more than 70 years after it was sunk by a German U-boat. The shipment of silver worth £38million was bound for Britain at the height of the Second World Two, but it was lost at sea after the merchant ship was torpedoed. The SS Gairsoppa was sunk off the Irish coast in 1941 carrying solid silver bullion from India to bolster the Britain's dwindling war chest. Scroll down for video . The SS Gairsoppa was sunk by a U-boat in 1941 carrying 2,800 bars of solid silver to bolster the Britain's war chest . After the silver was salvaged in a record-breaking rescue operation, the Royal Mint has turned the bars into coins, which will now be sold to collectors . The deepest rescue operation in maritime history has since seen the silver bullion brought up from the seabed after spending seven decades at the bottom of the Atlantic. The Royal Mint today began striking silver coins from the bullion cargo of the SS Gairsoppa to be sold in its memory. Royal Mint historian Dr Kevin Clancy said: 'This shipment of silver bullion should have got here 72 years ago and now it has finally come home. 'I don't think anything like this has happened before - bullion destined for us which didn't make now finding it's way here. It's a very romantic and evocative story.' An image of the ship on the bed of the Atlantic Ocean, where it has rested for the last 70 years . Andrew Craig, project manager of the rescue operation, which recovered 2,792 silver bars totaling more than 3million troy ounces of silver. The haul would be worth around £38,272,000 at today's prices . A German U-boat like that pictured sunk the merchant ship after it left its naval convoy in bad weather . In December 1940, the Royal Mint was . running dangerously low in stocks of silver due to the war and called in . emergency supplies from India. A . large shipment of silver was sent from Calcutta aboard the British . merchant ship SS Gairsoppa - which sailed under the protection of a . naval convoy. Second Officer Richard Ayres was the sole survivor of the sinking of the SS Gairsoppa . But after battling a heavy storm it . began running short of coal off the coast of Southern Ireland and was . forced to break free and head for the safety of Galway Harbour. The . slow merchant ship was spotted by a German U-boat patrolling the . British waters and was torpedoed at 12.08am on 17 February 1941. The stricken ship sank within 20 minutes - 300 miles off the south west coast of Ireland. Three lifeboats were launched but only Second Officer Richard Ayres made it to land and survived to report what had happened. His lifeboat started with 31 men but after spending 13 days at sea he was the only sailor to make it to dry land alive. He was awarded an MBE in recognition of his heroic efforts to keep fellow survivors alive, as well as a War Medal for bravery at sea, and amazingly returned to sea nine months later. The 412ft ship was eventually found sitting on the seabed 300 miles off the Irish coast in September 2011 by US marine exploration company Odyssey. And after a five-year rescue operation on behalf of the Treasury they recovered the silver bullion from SS Gairsoppa at an astonishing depth of three miles. Half a mile deeper than the Titanic - it is the largest and deepest recovery of precious metal from a shipwreck in maritime history. Andrew Craig, who project managed the five-year rescue operation, said: 'Nobody has ever done anything like this before at this depth. The SS Gairsoppa was eventually found on the seabed in September 2011 by US marine exploration company Odyssey . A remotely-operated submarine took three and a half hours to get down to the sea bed to view the sunken ship . 'There were so many unknowns and when . you took a step back it looked incredibly daunting - but we just took . each challenge as it came. 'Finally . bringing the silver bullion back to the Royal Mint, 72 years after it . should have arrived, will bring the incredible story of the ship and its . crew to light. The British Empire helped raise funds for the Allied war effort, sending £23.3 million in gifts and £10.7 million in interest-free loans. India also paid for its two and a half million citizens who joined the armed forces and the Fifth Indian Division went on to fight in the Sudan against the Italians and then in Libya against the Germans. Even the 250,000 Bechuana people in southern Africa sent £10,400 to purchase two Spitfires for the RAF and paid extra taxes so their government could send £50,000 as a gift to Britain. 'Not . many people have heard about the SS Gairsoppa since it sank but now it . will be one of the most famous wrecks to be worked on and those sailors . will never be forgotten.' The . rescue operation recovered 2,792 silver bars totaling approximately 3.2 . million troy ounces of silver - worth around £38,272,000 at current . prices. Mr . Craig said the record-breaking depth of the salvage operation left them . with unique challenges to overcome and some eye-watering operational . costs. He . said: 'For the final stage of the project to retrieve the silver . bullion we chartered a boat at a cost of £100,000-a-day - and were there . for two seasons for around 180 days. 'It took three and a half hours to send out remotely operated submersible down to the sea bed and then we had to work our way through the boat to find where the silver was stored. 'Up until the last 10 years the technology hasn't been there to do anything like this. At one point in the salvage operation, a £100,000-a-day specialist boat needed to be chartered while the silver was from brought up from the depths . Mr Craig spearheaded the operation to recover the silver from a depth of three miles . 'But after silver prices rocketed it became financially worthwhile to give it a go and we believed we had the technology and skill to do it. 'This has been a great challenge for us but now we know we can work any depth of water. 'Coming to The Royal Mint and seeing the silver bullion coins struck was quite emotional - now after 72 years we have seen the story come full circle.' Odyssey kept 80 per cent of the silver bullion they recovered and the Treasury were given 20 per cent. Some of this bullion has now been passed to The Royal Mint for the striking of the 99.9 pure 1/4oz silver Britannia bullion coins. Each of the 20,000 solid silver coins will be edged with the name SS Gairsoppa and available to purchase in the UK for the first time at the end of the month. He said: 'Not many people have heard about the SS Gairsoppa since it sank but now it will be one of the most famous wrecks to be worked on and those sailors will never be forgotten' The coins made from the silver recovered will be edged with the name SS Gairsoppa and will go on sale at the end of the month .","Merchant ship carrying silver from India for the war effort was sunk in 1941 .

"By . Rob Cooper . A mother who accidentally locked her toddler in her car was told by the AA they couldn't help unless she took out a £150 membership on the spot. Nicola Millar, 36, was left stranded because her purse was inside the Ford Focus C-Max so she was unable to pay the money up front. She flagged down a van driver who is a member of the AA - who describe themselves as 'the fourth emergency service' - but they told him they couldn't help. Stranded: Nicola Millar, whose daughter Violet was trapped inside the car, was told by the AA they couldn't help unless she paid £150 for a membership . Mrs Millar, whose 17-month-old toddler daughter Violet was inside the car, burst into tears in Chingford, north-east London. She said: 'I was told I needed to make the payment first over the phone. I told them I couldn’t as my purse and was in the car. 'They then asked me to ring someone I knew to make the payment, again I told them I couldn’t because I didn’t know any numbers off by heart and my phone was locked in the car. Refusal: AA - who describe themselves as the fourth emergency service - said if it was an actual emergency people should call the fire brigade . 'At this point, they said they couldn’t help me. I was disgusted by their response, it’s not as if I was going to knock them, I was desperate.' After 45 minutes van driver James King decided to smash the back passenger seat window to retrieve the keys. He also smashed a very small front window as well in an attempt to get into the car. AA insisted today that they would normally help someone who was not one of their members and charge them a membership fee later. However, they said a new member of staff took the call from Mrs Millar who did not know the correct way to handle the situation. By way of apology, they have offered to give her a one-year membership for free. Mother-of-one Mrs Millar had been shopping at Morrisons when she shut the boot as she tried to fold up a pram without realising she had accidentally locked her car. Mr King, 57, phoned the AA for help as he has full membership - but they said they couldn't help unless Mrs Millar signed up herself. Mr King says he has been let down by the AA. 'It is absolutely disgusting,' he said. 'If anything, they should have come out and done something using my membership but they totally refused. Anger: After a 45 minute impasse, a van driver smashed the rear window of Mrs Millar's car for her . 'This poor woman was really upset and it was out-of-order for them to leave her in tears whilst her 17-month-old girl is crying in the back seat.' A spokesman for the AA apologised for the ‘unfortunate’ incident. 'We would like to apologise to Nicola Millar for the distress caused,' he said. 'We would normally send a patrol and sort the paperwork afterwards. Unfortunately, the call handler she spoke to was new to the team and didn’t flag it up to a manager, as should have happened. 'Every year we rescue thousands of children and animals locked in cars and our patrols regularly go way beyond the call of duty.'

"By . Ian Drury . Thieves, burglars and violent thugs will be free to work in schools, hospitals and care homes after a ruling by judges. The Supreme Court said thousands of criminals should be allowed to wipe their record clean so they are not haunted forever by past offences. The change means people will not be forced to disclose some convictions to prospective employers – because this breaches their human rights. Those affected by the ruling include people applying for certain kinds of jobs involving work with children or vulnerable adults. A man who was forced to reveal two cautions for bike theft aged 11 to his new employers has won his case the the Supreme Court (pictured) after arguing it breached his human rights . Up to now, anyone wanting to work in these areas has had to disclose any . previous convictions or cautions, which stayed on their records . indefinitely. But a panel of five Supreme Court judges yesterday upheld a . Court of Appeal judgment that blanket checks could breach a person’s . right to a private or family life. The Home Office challenged that judgment, saying it compromised the . protection of children and  vulnerable groups, but in the meantime . introduced a system to filter out single minor convictions or  cautions . during an enhanced criminal records check. This meant that offences including burglary, common assault, shoplifting . and trespassing would eventually be expunged from a person’s record as . long as they were not jailed or committed any further crimes. Under new guidelines from the Government's Disclosure and Barring Service employers will not be able to see or ask about certain old or minor cautions and convictions. They will still be able to see convictions relating to violent or sexual offences, or certain offences relation to children or vulnerable people. They will also be able to see offences that resulted in a conviction, whether or not the sentence was suspended. Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, said . the Supreme Court ruling was ‘dangerous’. He added: ‘With huge numbers . of serious, repeat offenders avoiding prison it is time for courts to be . tougher on criminals, not recommending that criminal records can be . wiped clean.’ Certain offences for which people are convicted or . cautioned will still stay on the record indefinitely, including all . serious sexual and violent crimes and all terrorism offences. However, under the new rules, adult offenders will see convictions for . burglary, shoplifting or common assault, for instance, cleared from . their record after 11 years, and cautions after six years, as long as . they were not jailed and have not reoffended. Young offenders will have no visible conviction record after five-and-a-half years, and no caution record after two years. This will mean employers will not be able to learn about these offences unless the applicant tells them. The case before the Supreme  Court involved two people who had jobs . jeopardised because they  had been reprimanded for  minor crimes. Lawyers for Theresa May and Chris Grayling warned that the ruling could affect hundreds of thousands of job applications where convictions were 'plainly relevant' One man, known only as T, had been forced to disclose police warnings he . received aged 11 in 2002 in connection with the alleged theft of two . bicycles when he applied for a job aged 17 which could have involved . working with children. A woman, identified as JB, was refused a job in a care home eight years . after receiving a caution for stealing a packet of false fingernails . from a shop. The Supreme Court said the disclosures the pair had been . forced to make were not based on any rational assessment of risk. Rebecca Hilsenrath, of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: . ‘This judgment sensibly  recognises that people should not  be haunted . forever by minor childhood offences.’ Meanwhile, a parliamentary inquiry led by Lib Dem peer Lord Carlile has . said children who commit minor offences should have their record wiped . clean when they turn 18.","Man complained after being forced to reveal cautions to new employers .

"By . Harriet Arkell . and Richard  Shears . The young couple feared to have plunged to their deaths from a luxury cruise liner off the coast of Australia may have died in a tragic accident, a source said today. Paul Rossington, 30, and Kristen Schroder, 27, were discovered missing when the Carnival Spirit liner docked in Sydney yesterday. As a massive sea and air search for the pair was called off today, authorities were said to be looking at the theory that Miss Schroder fell first and her panic-stricken boyfriend then jumped in to try to save her. Scroll down for video . Paul Rossington, 30, and Kristen Schroder, 27, have been missing since Wednesday from the Carnival Spirit . 'Paul was trying to save her,' a source who asked not to be identified told the Australian Associated Press. Security footage on the boat is said to show the pair falling overboard from the mid-deck of the boat as it travelled down the New South Wales' mid-north coast just before 9pm local time on Wednesday. Initially police were unable to determine who had fallen into the sea first, but after the footage had been enhanced, they could see that it was estate agent Miss Schroder who plunged first from the 65ft-high deck, followed about 20 seconds later by her boyfriend. They were reported missing 12 hours later after the boat had docked at Sydney's Circular Quay at the end of its 10-day cruise.  Staff noticed the couple had failed to collect their luggage when the rest of the 2,680 passengers disembarked. Survival expert Dr Paul Luckin said if the couple, from Barraba, near Tamworth in NSW, had survived the impact of hitting the water, fatigue would be their biggest problem. Dr Luckin, who advises the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said he would not expect anyone to last as long as three days after falling from a ship. He told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'If you're stuck in the water and constantly being hit in the face by water, that is tremendously fatiguing... 'It will certainly be under three days that you would expect somebody to survive without water in those conditions.' Holiday: The couple was on holiday with a group of seven relatives and friends when they went missing on Wednesday night . Mr Rossington, a paramedic, and his . girlfriend had been on holiday on the cruise around the Pacific Islands . with a group of seven relatives and friends. Their cabin on the ship remains sealed off while forensic officers inspect it, although the ship did set sail from Sydney on its next cruise at 6.30pm last night. NSW police marine area commander Mark . Hutchings said the couple's fall was not believed to be suspicious, and . officers were inspecting the ship's CCTV footage. He said: 'It’s very unclear, but it does depict one person going over and then a short time (later) another person going over.' The ship was about 120km (75 miles) off the coastal town of Forster when the couple plunged into the sea. A statement released by Carnival Cruise Lines said: 'As part of our standard protocol, a full ship search was conducted as well as examination of closed circuit video. 'There is indication from the shipboard video of what transpired. 'There is no evidence of foul play.  However, out of respect for the families, we are not going to publicly disclose the details of what occurred.' The firm's spokesman said the rails on the cabin balconies are higher than the required standard. CCTV: Police studying enhanced CCTV footage from the ship's cameras believe Miss Schroder fell into the sea first . Carnival Cruise Lines, operated by Miami-based Carnival Corp, has been beset by a . series of problems and onboard crimes including power outage, rape, . sickness and theft. Several lawsuits have been launched against Carnival - but whether complainants will have any success is doubtful as the cruise company has a legal structure that shields it from big-money lawsuits. Many passengers will have unknowingly signed Carnival's contracts prohibiting them from class action lawsuits, while the small print also bans them suing on the grounds of emotional distress. Inspection: Police combed the cruise ship while it was berthed at Sydney's Circular Quay before it set sail again . Passengers for the next Carnival Spirit cruise lined up ready to board it yesterday as the search of the ship continued .

"By . Rob Cooper . Updated: . 04:05 EST, 23 August 2011 . Four wealthy Russians who used an . iPhone to film themselves gang-raping a student at an exclusive private . college are facing jail today. The . group had been in Britain for just two weeks when they carried out the . horrific two-and-a-half hour attack on the Malaysian teenager at the . £30,000-per-year college. The . Russians, aged between 19 and 23, gave a sickening running commentary - . and even filmed themselves boasting about what they were going to do to . her the day before. Guilty: Clockwise from top left, Oleg Ivanov, 23, Norayr Davtyan, 22, Armen Simonyan, 19, and 23-year-old Gregory Melnikov all denied the offence but were unanimously convicted by a jury at Woolwich Crown Court . The prosecution fear that she may have had her drinks spiked as she was too drunk to consent. Oleg . Ivanov, 23, Norayr Davtyan, 22, Armen Simonyan, 19, and 23-year-old . Gregory Melnikov all denied rape but were unanimously convicted by a . jury at Woolwich Crown Court yesterday. Davtyan described the girl as a 'machine' and in the witness box referred to her as a 'sl**'. The . court heard that Ivanov expressed 'pity' for the victim, when they . noticed she was crying but was talked out of it by his friend Davtyan. College: Oleg Ivanov was one of the four 'minigarchs' convicted of rape . Peter . Clement, prosecuting, said: 'Various members of the gang of four . watched each other, encouraged each other, and gave a running commentary . as to what they had done and what they were going to do to their fellow . student. 'They referred to . her merely in the abstract as ""her"" or ""she"" and in the course of the . incident one of the four even has to ask another ""What's her name?'' International . water polo player Davtyan was holding a party at his dorm at the . exclusive college in South London on January 21 this year which the girl . attended. The group of Russians filmed the whole attack on a mobile phone . She had a shot of whisky at the party before going to a disco at the school. Although there is no concrete . evidence her drink was spiked, she felt 'funny, dizzy and peculiar' and . was clearly intoxicated before going back to the party and vomiting then . falling asleep. The next time she awoke, a man was having sex with her but she was unable to move, the jury heard. She . told police: 'I just wanted him to stop, I couldn't wake up, I couldn't . stand up, I felt really, really, really tired, I couldn't do anything. I . couldn't move my hand... 'I just wanted to close my eyes, I just wanted to die, I did not consent to it.' Mr . Clements added: 'Relatively early on in the footage Mr Ivanov says in . Russian ""She is crying"" but it didn't deter him or any of the others at . any point. 'He said ""I feel pity for her"" but this is only after he and others had had sex with her. 'As . she left, Davtyan told her that she should not tell anyone about what . had happened because she would be the one who was ""embarrassed"" and . ""ashamed"" but she ignored his warnings and went to a pal before calling . the police.' The four men were all unanimously found guilty of rape at Woolwich Crown Court . Despite Simonyan texting Davtyan the next day to tell him to delete the footage which spanned between 12.38am and 3.10am it was still on his iPhone when he was arrested. Only Ivanov received legal aid and the rest of the group were able to pay for their own top QCs. They had denied raping the teen. In the harrowing footage shown to the court, she can be seen barely moving. They said she was a 'sl**' who 'willingly consented' but they were unanimously convicted by a jury of seven men and four women after an eight-week trial. They sat emotionless in the dock as the verdicts against them were read out but a cry was heard from the family members in the public gallery. Davtyan was convicted on two counts of rape, Melnikov was guilty of rape and attempted rape while Ivanov and Simonyan were both convicted of one count of rape. They were remanded in custody until they are sentenced today.","Gang had only been in Britain for two weeks when attack occurred .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Washington has become the second US state to allow people to buy legal recreational marijuana, as customers lined up outside pot shops to snap up samples. Nearly two years after the state voted to legalize marijuana, 29-year-old Cale Holdsworth became the first person to buy the herb there. 'This is a great moment,' Holdsworth said, beating the crowd to pick up two grams of pot from Bellingham's Top Shelf Cannabis. Scroll down for video . First in line: Cale Holdsworth (pictured) is the first person to legally buy recreational marijuana from a shop in Washington, the second state to allow people to buy marijuana legally in the US without a doctor's note . James Lathrop, the owner of recreational marijuana store 'Cannabis City', pumps his fist in the air while addressing the media before opening the shop on the first day in which retail marijuana sales are legal in Seattle . Lining up: Mike Watson buys marijuana at Top Shelf Cannabis, a retail marijuana store in Bellingham, Washington as dozens of people wait in line . Top Shelf Cannabis is one of two Bellingham stores that started selling the drug as soon as it was allowed under state regulations. Before it opened, several dozen people lined up outside the shop in this liberal college town of about 80,000 north of Seattle. Holdsworth, wearing salmon-colored shorts and a brown sweatshirt jacket over a tie-dyed T-shirt, was first in line, along with his girlfriend, Sarah Gorton, and her younger brother. They showed up at 4am. Gorton said the trio was in Bellingham for her grandfather's 84th birthday. 'It's just a happy coincidence and an opportunity we're not going to have for a long time,' said Gorton, a 24-year-old with dreadlocks and homemade jewelry. 'I'm really thrilled to be a part of something that I never thought would happen.' The start of legal pot sales in Washington marks a major step that's been 20 months in the making. Washington . and Colorado stunned much of the world by voting in November 2012 to . legalize marijuana for adults over 21, and to create state-licensed . systems for growing, selling and taxing the pot. Sales began in Colorado . on January 1. Washington issued its first 24 retail licenses Monday. Products: Two grams of a strain of marijuana named 'Sweet Lafayette' on display at Top Shelf Cannabis in Bellingham, Washington . Sampling the merchandise: A customer, who declined to give his name, sniffs a strain of recreational marijuana at Top Shelf Cannabis in Bellingham, Washington on Tuesday . An Associated Press survey of the . licensees showed only about six planned to open Tuesday: two in . Bellingham, one in Seattle, one in Spokane, one in Prosser and one in . Kelso. Some were set to . open later this week or next, while others said it could be a month or . more before they could acquire marijuana to sell. It's been a bumpy ride in Washington, with product shortages expected as growers and sellers scrambled to prepare. Pot prices were expected to be higher than what people pay at the state's unregulated medical marijuana dispensaries. That was largely due to the short supply of legally produced pot in the state. Although more than 2,600 people applied to become licensed growers, fewer than 100 have been approved — and only about a dozen were ready to harvest by early this month.Colorado already had a regulated medical . marijuana system, making for a smoother transition when it allowed those . dispensaries to start selling to recreational pot shops January 1. Campaigner: Kevin Nelson, of Bellingham, Washington, holds a sign that reads 'Drug War Ends Here' outside Top Shelf Cannabis on the first day of legal pot sales in the state . Washington's medical system is unregulated, so officials here were starting from scratch as they immersed themselves in the pot world and tried to come up with regulations that made sense for the industry and the public. The rules include protocols for testing marijuana and requirements for child-resistant packaging. Officials also had to determine things like how much criminal history was too much to get a license, and what types of security systems pot shops and growers should have. Washington law allows the sale of up to an ounce of dried marijuana, 16 ounces of pot-infused solids, 72 ounces of pot-infused liquids or seven grams of concentrated marijuana, like hashish, to adults over 21.

Brian Kost, a 45-year-old Bellingham man, was among the first in line at Top Shelf Cannabis, in an industrial area off Interstate 5. He said he hadn't smoked marijuana in 17 years because he didn't like the hassle of trying to find it on the illegal market. 'With the chance to buy it legally, I just couldn't pass it up,' Kost said. 'I never thought I'd see the day.' Gorton said she, her brother and boyfriend planned to head back to their relatives' house and sample their purchase. 'We're probably going to break open a bottle of wine, sit on the porch and enjoy this,' she said.","Washington stores began selling weed today as soon as they were allowed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A U.S. Marine veteran jailed in Mexico on weapons charges for allegedly bringing guns across the border had his first court appearance on Wednesday after spending more than three months in a Mexican jail. Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, said he was headed to dinner in San Ysidro . on March 31 when he mistakenly wound up at a border crossing point in . Tijuana and accidentally traveled into Mexico. At the time, Tahmooressi had firearms in his truck - the weapons were purchased legally in the U.S., but it is illegal to cross into Mexico with guns. Mistake: Marine Andrew Tahmooressi says he mistakenly entered Mexico with guns in his car in March while trying to meet friends for dinner . Border: Tahmooressi says he accidentally entered the wrong lane at the border, and had no option other than to cross into Mexico and turn around . Jail: Tahmooressi has been jailed in Mexico since his March 31, arrest near Tijuana . Tahmooressi maintains that he never intended to leave the country but missed an exit when heading to meet friends in a border town. 'I was going to call them after I drove off the exit, but I never got . off the exit, I blew right past it,' he told UTSanDiego.com in May during an . interview from jail. 'I wasn't paying attention, thinking I had way . farther to go. I ended up in Mexico with no way to turn around.' Mexican authorities found three guns inside the truck he had recently . driven from Florida to make a new start in San Diego. He was jailed, and has been held in a Mexican jail without bail ever since. Wednesday's hearing will be Tahmooressi's first opportunity to tell his story to a judge. The delay has been caused by both Mexico's glacially paced judicial system and Tahmooressi's indecision in picking an attorney. After firing two of his lawyers - one of whom reportedly instructed him to commit purjury - Tahmooressi has settled on Fernando Benitez, who tells Fox News that he plans to press the prosecution's witnesses until he gets honest answers. Pressure: Senator Marco Rubio is one of several members of Congress to support Tahmooressi as critics fault the Obama administration for not doing more to get him released . 'I hope they tell the truth, because if not, I'm gonna make them tell . the truth and it's not gonna be pretty,' Benetiz told the network prior to the hearing. Tahmooressi's case has garnered significant media attention, as critics have blamed the Obama Administration for not doing more to get him released over what he maintains was just an honest mistake. In April, Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter wrote a letter asking Secretary of State John Kerry to secure Tahmooressi's release. State Department officials said they were aware of an arrest of a U.S. citizen in Mexico, but they do not comment on arrests of private individuals without the person's permission. On Tuesday, Hunter and Nebraska Congressman Lee Terry sent a letter Mexican federal Judge Victor Octavio Luna Escobedo asking that he consider the fact that Tahmooressi's entry into Mexico was accidental. 'We believe the evidence supports Andrew's claim that he mistakenly . entered into Mexico,' wrote the congressmen. 'One of the most compelling . pieces of evidence is a 911 call Andrew made at the border checkpoint, . where he stated he was unaware of his location.' Prison: If convicted, Tahmooressi faces anywhere from six to 21 years in a Mexican prison . Similar cases have occurred before. In 2008, an active-duty Army soldier was jailed in Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, for driving into Mexico with guns, knives and ammunition. In 1999, a Marine was detained in Tijuana for two weeks after driving into Mexico with guns. If Tahmooressi is convicted, he faces six to 21 years in a Mexican prison, his lawyers said, adding that alternatively the case could be dropped if the Mexican attorney general's office in Mexico City requests dismissal. Tahmooressi served four years in the Marines, including two tours in Afghanistan. He says he was honorably discharged in November 2012. After he was jailed, Tahmooressi tried to escape by climbing over a gate and heading up onto a roof, and then onto another one. He gave up when a guard opened fire, but the incident earned him the nickname ""Spider-Man."" Soldier: Tahmooressi served two tours in Afghanistan while a sergeant in the Marine Corps. He later grabbed a light bulb and stabbed himself in the neck. He was taken to the hospital and given stiches. He said he longs for his family and friends and has been receiving visits from an English-speaking Christian chaplain. 'I put my faith in God that he will take care of me,' he said. 'It was just a big mistake, and I hope that the people here will realize that and that the judge will realize that.'","Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi has been held in a Mexican jail since March 31 .

"By . Chris Pleasance . When one very excited 10-year-old . claimed to have found a mummy in his grandmother's attic, it took his . parents a while to realise he wasn't making it up. But, . unfortunately for little Alexander Kettler, from Diepholz, his historic . find has proved to be a little less exciting than originally thought. It . turns out that the supposed 2000-year-old Egyptian mummy is actually . made of plastic, a discovery made after scientists finally unwrapped the . corpse for inspection. Mysterious find: A 10-year-old German boy found what appeared to be a mummy in a sarcophagus in his grandmother's attic . Experts now claim they were fooled by a chemical spray which made the bones appear real. Lutz . Gaebler, a Lower Saxony prosecutor who had declared the 'mummy' was . 2,000 years old, has admitted that bone X-rays have proven him wrong. 'The mummy was unwrapped, and we have seen relatively quickly that the ingredients are not ancient,' he said. In . an unexpected and slightly macabre twist, the mummy did contain a . genuine skull, though an arrowhead found lodged in it appeared to come . from a child's toy. Relic: Mr Kettler believed that his father may have brought an unusual souvenir back from a trip to north Africa in the 1950s . Interest peaked the the so-called 'mummy of Diepholz' after it was found in the corner of an attic last month. Lutz . Wolfgang Kettler, father of the boy who discovered it, theorised that . his own father may have bought it while travelling in the 1950s when . there was still a mummy trade operating. According . to Kettler, 'unwrapping parties' - where a genuine mummy is unwrapped . and the trinkets inside handed out - were not uncommon in Germany at the . time. The sarcophagus was . found alongside a death mask and a canopic jar - used to store . organs extracted from the deceased - but these were quickly outed as . fake. Kettler insisted on . having the corpse itself tested though, intrigued at the possibility of it . being real, despite some pointing out that the body was bound in 20th . century cloth. The mummification process dates back to 3,500BC with the oldest intact Egyptian mummy dating from 100 years after that. The mummy, known simply as ID #32751, is currently held by the British Museum. It was apparently preserved by direct contact with the dry desert sand, though it is uncertain whether the mummification was intended. The only mystery that now remains is why somebody would store a fake mummy in their attic for four decades. Tradition: Ancient Egyptians used to mummify both humans and animals when they died . Ancient Egyptians were firm believers in the afterlife when someone died. But they thought to get there, the body needed to be recognisable, so that the dead person could repossess it. The chief embalmer was a priest wearing the mask of Anubis - the jackal-headed God of the dead. First the brains would be pulled out of the person through the nose using a hook. Then all the internal organs would removed, including the lungs, stomach, intestines and liver and placed in jars. The heart would be replaced. The inside of the body would be rinsed with wine and spices before being covered with salt for 70 days. After 40 days it would be stuffed with linen to give it a more humane shape. At 70 days it would be wrapped in bandages and placed inside a brightly-painted coffin. Mainly wealthy people were mummified because poorer people could not afford it. Animals were also sometimes mummified as gestures to the Gods or so that they could accompany their owners in the afterlife.","Alexander Kettler found the 'mummy' in Diepholz, northern Germany .

"By . Kate Lyons . Frostie is a cheeky, happy, little goat, who loves attention. And the baby goat is certainly getting a lot of it, as he learns to walk with the help of a customised wheelchair. Frostie, who is just over one-week old, was brought to Edgar's Mission, a not-for profit sanctuary for rescued farm animals outside of Melbourne, on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Before: Frostie as a one-week-old, getting used to his makeshift wheelchair, unable to use his hind legs as a result of an infection contracted through the umbilical cord . The wheelchair was once used by Leon Trotsky (right) whose mother sat on him crushing his legs as a baby. The little pig is now one-month-old and is mostly recovered . He was covered in lice, severely dehydrated and had lost the use of his back legs, due to an infection he contracted through his umbilical cord. Pam Ahern, founder and director of Edgar's Mission, said that after a few days at the sanctuary being treated with antibiotics and painkillers, the little goat had improved so much that he began getting frustrated and trying to run around and play. Frostie was fitted with a wheelchair, which allows him to run around using his forelegs until he recovers the use of his legs, which should happen as the infection leaves his system. The wheelchair was originally made for a baby pig named Leon Trotsky, now one month old, who was injured when his mother sat on him, crushing his hind legs. The little pig, whom Ms Ahern says has 'so much spunk', has recovered enough that he was able to donate his wheelchair to his friend, Frostie, though Ms Ahern says that Leon is definitely 'too fast for Frostie to keep up with him.' Frostie was brought to Edgar's Mission, which was founded by Pam Ahern in 2003, as a place for rescued farm animals to be cared for . Frostie will use the wheelchair until the infection has passed and he regains the use of his legs . Leon and Frostie are close friends, though Ms Ahern says that the 'spunky' pig is too fast and the injured goat has trouble keeping up with him . The little goat is one of 350 animals currently cared for on the sanctuary, which as well as pigs and goats is home to cows, alpacas, deer, sheep, chicken, geese, duck, rabbits, guinea pigs, peacocks, and horses. Edgar's Mission was started by Pam Ahearn after she rescued her first pig, Edgar Alan, in 2003 and realised that injured farm animals did not have the same help as native animals or pets. 'I was involved in fostering cats and dogs and rehabilitating native animals, and a lot of organisations do that and a lot of individuals do that, but they forget about farm animals,' she said. 'Just because they look different to cats and dogs, they're still animals.' Sometimes the animals are brought to the sanctuary by members of the public, as was the case when locals found an injured two-day-old goat on Tuesday that they suspected had fallen off the back of a truck. Pam Ahearn says that the little goat, who is just over a week old, thinks of her as its mother and will cry out if she leaves his sight . The wheelchair was initially used by Leon Trotsky, a baby pig whose mother sat on him crushing his hind legs . Thomasina, as she was named, now lives at the sanctuary is Frosty's favourite playmate. In other cases, the animals are rescued from imminent death, such as Monty, the miniature horse who was 'not miniature enough' and so was going to be sent to the knackery due to his size. 'Luckily someone intervened and he came to us. 'Every animal at the sanctuary has a story to tell. All of them have different stories of some kind act that got them to the sanctuary,' said Ms Ahearn. 'These stories are really lovely. It shows the goodness of the human heart, because people see an animal in pain and they want to help, they don't like to see another animal suffer.' The little piglet is now one-month old and has recovered enough to get around without the wheelchair . Pam Ahearn described Leon Trotsky as a 'spunky' little pig, who is now running about Edgar's Mission and playing with other animals .","Baby goat contracted an infection in his hind legs through umbilical cord .

"By . John Drayton . and Harriet Large . Brazil kick-off this month's World Cup against Croatia on Thursday, with most of the best on show in South America. But who are the stars earning most money? Sportsmail takes a look at the top 10 highest-paid players - by weekly wage at club level - who will feature in Brazil. Reported Weekly Wage: £300,000Age: 28Club: Manchester UnitedCountry: EnglandMajor Sponsors: Harper Collins, Nike, EA Sports, Coca-Cola . Earning 50p a second, Rooney’s new, terrifyingly profitable contract assures he takes first place above his fellow superstars. Striker for a Manchester United side that underperformed last season, he still managed to become the club’s third top scorer of all time, overtaking George Best and Ryan Giggs, and as a result, now has an enormous net worth estimated to be in excess of £60million. Endorsements earn him a fair wedge, with lucrative deals including Nike and Electronic Arts, the computer gaming company which features Rooney on the front of its best-selling FIFA football games. He also had his third book, ‘My Decade In The Premier League,’ published in 2012 as part of his deal with Harper Collins. All smiles: England talisman Wayne Rooney is on £300,000-a-week at Manchester United . Holding the key: Lionel Messi will attempt to win Argentina's first World Cup since 1986 . Reported Weekly Wage: £292,000Age: 26Club: BarcelonaCountry: ArgentinaMajor sponsors: Adidas, Turkish Airlines, PepsiCo, Herbalife, EA Sports, Dolce & Gabanna, Adidas, Gillette . Okay, we kind of cheated by putting Rooney first, because the £300,000 a week figure is before tax. Messi’s contract, signed last year, sees him earn a reported £292,000 AFTER tax in Spain. (You can read about the different taxes in each country here). He is often regarded as the best footballer in the world - although he lost the Ballon d’Or crown to Cristiano Ronaldo this season - so it is apt he is paid accordingly. His accolades, just like his salary, are certainly not in short supply. He broke the 39-year record for most goals in a European club season in 2012 when he finished the season with 73 goals and has won the Ballon d’Or a whopping three times. He is also a three-time winner of FIFA Player of the Year and became the first player to score five goals in a Champions League match. In addition to his gargantuan salary, Messi makes millions more every year from endorsements, the biggest of which is Adidas, who launched his 'icon signature' line in 2013. Reported Weekly Wage: £288,000Age: 29Club: Real MadridCountry: Portugal Major sponsors: Nike, Coca-Cola, Castrol, Konami, Motorola, Herbalife, KFC, Tag Heuer, Fly Emirates, Emporio Armani . Ronaldo is reported to earn £288,000 after tax, in a deal similar to his La Liga rival Messi. He is currently reported to be in contract extension talks with Real Madrid, so he could see himself rocketed to the highest paid footballer once again soon. Importantly, he also owns a 50-50 share of his image rights. His popularity on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have translated into big bucks from sponsors like Nike, Castrol and Konami, all of which he promotes through his own social media accounts. Not content with monopolising the advertising world, Ronaldo also launched himself into the fashion industry as the ‘spokesmodel’ for Emporio Armani Underwear and Armani Jeans in 2009. In March, a 'Rich List' compiled by Goal.com was topped by Ronaldo, with an estimated net worth of around £122million. Frightening talent: Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world at the moment . Reported Weekly Wage: £250,000Age: 30Club: Manchester UnitedCountry: HollandMajor Sponsors: Nike, Adidas, BT Sport, Pepsi . With many an achievement to his name, including PFA Player of the Year and the Football Writers’ Footballer of the Year, it’s no wonder Van Persie left Arsenal to chase for club honours. Born in Rotterdam, Van Persie is currently the all-time top scorer for Holland. He is also one of world football's top earners. He has been part of major commercial campaigns for huge corporate brands, including Nike, BT Sport and Pepsi, all of which have rendered a tidy sum for the Dutchman. Twisting and turning: Robin van Persie is set to link-up with Holland coach Louis van Gaal at Man United . In the money: The Ivory Coast's Yaya Toure has had a very public spat with Manchester City recently . Reported Weekly Wage: £230,000Age: 31Club: Manchester CityCountry: Ivory CoastMajor Sponsors: Puma, Ford . With a four-year contract that pays him over £10million a year, there is no surprise that Touré is among the top earners on the pitch. The Ivorian midfielder has had a distinguished international career with 82 caps for the Ivory Coast, representing the team in their first appearance in a World Cup in 2006 and again in 2010. Touré has won the African Footballer of the Year for the last three consecutive years. In addition to his rewarding salary, he also signed an endorsement deal with Puma that includes distributing the brand’s gear to underprivileged African children. He is one of the only non-strikers on the list - but despite this, was third top scorer in the Premiership last season chipping in with 20 goals for Manchester City helping them win the title. His future at the club is in doubt however because of a falling-out over a birthday cake. Reported Weekly Wage: £220,000Age: 26Club: Manchester City Country: ArgentinaMajor sponsors: Puma, Pepsi . Multiple leg injuries have resulted in a bit of a stop-start career at Manchester City so far for the Argentine, nicknamed ‘Kun’. However, this has not hindered his relationship with the club who, in May 2013, agreed to give him a contract extension and salary increase that not only keeps him with the club until 2017 but also makes him one of the highest paid football players in the world. Snappy dresser: Man City's Argentine striker Sergio Aguero is on £220,000-a-week at the Etihad Stadium . Reported Weekly Wage: £220,000Age: 27Club: LiverpoolCountry: Uruguay Major Sponsors: Adidas . Despite Suarez’s turbulent tenure with Liverpool, involving multiple suspensions and an attempted escape to Arsenal, he enhanced his reputation as a world-class footballer last season forming a deadly partnership with Englishman Daniel Sturridge and in turn, earns one of the highest salaries of the Premier League. As Uruguay’s all-time leading goal scorer with 39 for the national team, Suarez commands the top wage at Liverpool after he was rewarded with a new contract in December. He was seen as a national hero when he helped lead his country to a fourth place finish in the 2010 World Cup after blocking a goal bound header from Ghana in the quarter-final with his hands. He was sent off, but Ghana missed the penalty and Uruguay went on to go through to the next round. Putting his foot through it! Luis Suarez is fighting to get himself fit fort Uruguay's opener against Costa Rica . Reported Weekly Wage: £200,000Age: 28Club: Manchester CityCountry: SpainMajor sponsors: Adidas . Nicknamed ‘Merlin’ for his wizard-like passing abilities, Silva signed a five-year contract to make up a reported £200,000 a week playing for Manchester City. Since joining the club, the Spanish midfielder has appeared in over 150 games in three seasons, winning the FA Cup, League Cup and Premier League. He is famously described by his sponsor Adidas as a ‘new brand of player’ with surgical precision and a brain for strategy. Could he fire Spain to a second consecutive World Cup win? Thinker: David Silva will provide Spain with the incisive sort of intelligent play they are renowned for . Main man: Chelsea's Eden Hazard will be the main spark for dark horses Belgium . Reported Weekly Wage: £185,000Age: 23Club: ChelseaCountry: BelgiumMajor sponsors: Nike . Currently regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation, even compared to the likes of Zidane, it's not hard for Chelsea to rationalise spending a reported £185,000 a week on the Belgian. With rumours circling that Hazard is a target for Paris Saint-Germain, the Blues have said they are prepared to pay the big bucks to keep hold of him – so he could race up this list in the near future. Although approached by Adidas, Hazard has remained loyal to his long-term sponsors Nike, with a renewed endorsement contract that is said to make him one of their leading football faces along with Ronaldo, Rooney, Neymar and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Incredible! Fernando Torres might be struggling for goals for Chelsea and Spain but he makes the top 10 . Reported Weekly Wage: £175,000Age: 30Club: ChelseaCountry: SpainSponsorship: Adidas, Pepsi, Aviva, . Despite his outrageously large salary, all that glitters is not gold - throughout his time at the club, Torres has been a disappointment for Chelsea with many a second-rate performance. It's a far cry from the prolific period he spent at Liverpool, where he became the fastest player in the club's history to score 50 league goals, but something hasn't clicked since his £50million move to the West London club in 2011. In spite of this, he has been capped over 100 times for his country and is Spain’s third-highest goalscorer of all time. He also has a couple of high profile endorsement deals with Adidas and Pepsi, as well as a few domestic Spanish brands, boosting his income.","Yaya Toure, Fernando Torres and Robin van Persie all named .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Staff at Paignton Zoo have filmed the moment an endangered Rothschild's Giraffe gave birth. The baby girl was born at the Devon zoo on Saturday afternoon, and already stands more than six foot tall and was on her feet within hours. Mother Sangha gave birth during the day which is unusual for a giraffe, but also allowed her keepers to record it. This unnamed female Rothschild's Giraffe was born at Paignton Zoo in Devon on Saturday . Unusually mother Sangha gave birth during the day which allowed zookeepers to film it . The girl's father is 10-year-old Yoda, who arrived in Devon from Givskud Zoo, Denmark in September 2006, while mother Sangha came from Liberec Zoo in Slovakia. The gestation period for the species is between 14 and 16 months, after which they give birth standing up in order to break the umbilical chord. The breeding pair did produce one other calf, a male, which was born in August last year but died shortly afterwards. The zoo’s other female is Janica, who came from Duvr Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic. The birth is important as Rothschild's Giraffe are the most endangered of all the giraffe species . Janica gave birth to Valentino in February 2012, while Otilie was born to Sangha in September 2012. The zoo’s giraffes are all Rothschild’s Giraffe, which are classified as Endangered. The species is named after Lord Walter Rothschild who discovered them in east Africa in the early 1900s. Sangha and her breeding partner Yoda had another calf, a male, in August last year but it died shortly after birth . They used to be common across Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, but now they are the most endangered of all giraffe species. With just 670 left in the wild, it makes them rarer than Giant Pandas, of which there are thought to be 1,600 left. There are thought to be about 450 in captivity, and efforts in 2011 to re-introduce individuals back into the Lake Baringo area in Kenya have proved successful. There are only 670 Rothschild's giraffes in the wild, making them rarer than Giant Pandas . Very little is known about why the Rothschild's Giraffe - named after Lord Walter Rothschild - is so endangered. Poaching, loss of habitat and increased contact with humans have all been put forward as theories to explain their gradual disappearance. Giraffe are relatively easy to kill as they will often stare intently at a target before running, aming them easy to shoot. Their long legs are also easily tangled in traps and one fall can be enough to break their necks. For the amount of effort required to kill, they have a large amount of meat and could therefore be targets for bush meat poachers. Their skins are also prized for use on clothing, their mane can be woven into bracelets, their tails are used to convey authority and their leg tendons can be used as guitar strings. Like most endangered species their body parts are also commonly used in tribal medicine. There are as few as 670 left in the wild, making them rarer than Giant Pandas, with another 450 believed to be in captivity.","Unnamed baby girl was born on Saturday at Paignton Zoo in Devon .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . North Korea's dictator Kim Jong-Un has warned that war could break out 'without notice' as he called on his military to be combat ready. The warning came a day after reports that satellite images appeared to show North Korea has started producing fuel rods for its nuclear reactor. The U.S. and South Korea had been wary of possible threats from the North, where tensions have been high since the execution of Kim's uncle and mentor. Threat: Kim Jong-Un, pictured center during a visit to his troops, said war could break out 'without prior notice' The latest sabre rattling came as Kim visited his troops on Christmas Eve, according to Al Jazeera. 'He instructed the unit to put utmost . spurs on rounding off its combat readiness ... always bearing in mind . that a war breaks out without any prior notice,' reports from state media said. Tens of thousands of troops pledged their loyalty to Kim last week at a parade to mark the anniversary of the death of his father, and former leader. Satellite images seen by the Johns Hopkins University appeared to show facilities at the North's scientific research center could be used to make fuel rods for the plutonium reactor. 'The . identification of these facilities indicates a more wide-ranging, . extensive effort by North Korea to modernise and restart the Yongbyon . complex dating back to 2009 than previously understood,' the report . said. North Korea's reactor was put back into service earlier this year, after a six-year break, according to the New York Times. Show of loyalty: North Korea's army pays tribute to Kim Jong-Un's grandmother on December 24 . Evidence of renewed activity at the plant comes as the North repeatedly said it was working to improve its nuclear arsenal. UN inspectors were forced out of North Korea in 2009, a year after the latest round of nuclear arms negotiations failed. North Korea has also carried out three nuclear tests since 2006, including two since Kim Jong-Un took control of the country after his father's death in 2011. After the latest calls for troops to be ready, the South has called for its troops to bolster its security measures. During her trip to a military post on the border, South Korean President Park Geun-Hye described the threats as 'ominous'. 'We should react sternly and mercilessly to any provocations by North Korea,' she said.","Threat comes as satellite images appear to show renewed nuclear activity .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Thousands of British air passengers were stranded abroad last night as the chaos caused by striking French air traffic controllers worsened. Many were forced to sleep on the floors of airports in Mediterranean resorts as they awaited news of rescheduled flights. Some face being stranded for a week. Amid ‘nightmare’ scenes at popular holiday destinations in Spain and Portugal, flights were cancelled with no warning in the early hours of the morning, leaving parents to struggle with crying children as they awaited news. Scroll down for video . Delays: Passengers at Stansted Airport faced delays as striking French air traffic controllers caused chaos across Europe, causing delays and cancellations for flights to France, Spain and Portugal . Frustrated travellers complained of a lack of information from airline staff. Even when staff were able to provide details of a rescheduled flight, they admitted there was no guarantee it would not also fall victim to the strike. With the walkout due to last until Monday, many travellers were facing the prospect of waiting until next week to be flown home, prompting angry scenes at some airports as holidaymakers queued for hours only to receive little concrete information. Airlines including Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways were forced to book thousands of emergency hotel rooms for stranded passengers. Long wait: Thousands of travellers are now waiting to hear when they will be able to make their journeys after the six-day strike was cut short . On the second day of the walk-out, airline bosses accused the militants of holding them to ransom and called for staff from neighbouring countries to take over French airspace. Airlines have been ordered to ground up to a quarter of flights that would normally use French airspace. Problems intensified yesterday after air traffic controllers in Belgium also walked out. EasyJet, which has cancelled 300 flights over two days, said it had booked 2,800 hotel rooms to deal with passengers unable to fly home. Ryanair cancelled around 250 flights for the second day in a row. British Airways cancelled 30 flights. Kenny Jacobs, marketing chief at Ryanair, said EU governments needed to get tough on French air traffic controllers to stop them ‘holding people to ransom’ with their annual walk-outs. ‘It’s a disgrace,’ he said. ‘The French need to sort this out. Ronald Reagan had the right idea when he broke the air traffic controllers’ strike in the USA by sending in the military to run it. ‘Strike action by air traffic controllers should be made illegal. And if they do go on strike, neighbouring EU countries should be able to operate the airspace over France to keep planes flying.’ An easyJet spokesman said: ‘We have booked around 2,800 hotel rooms to date and some passengers will also have booked their own accommodation and will claim it back from us. ‘We are advising passengers on cancelled flights to either claim a refund or re-book after the strike period has finished.’ That will see some heading back in the middle of next week at the earliest. Among those stranded is Sophia Ali, 31, from London, who had been in Ibiza for a friend’s wedding when her flight home was cancelled without warning. ‘The scenes at the airport were horrendous,’ she said. ‘Some people were swearing and kicking off. As soon as the flight was cancelled the internet went down so you couldn’t get information. ‘One guy had been in Ibiza for a stag do and was getting married in a couple of days’ time so had to get back for the wedding. But he couldn’t. He was beside himself.’ Chemistry student Liam Stephens, 22, risks missing his graduation at Bath University next week because his flight home from Portugal to Bristol was cancelled last night. Queues at UK airports were less severe than on Tuesday because airlines had ‘pre-cancelled’ most of the affected outbound flights overnight and alerted passengers in advance by text or email. The strike is over job cuts as part of an EU plan for a ‘single European sky’.","Fights in holiday destinations like Spain and Portugal cancelled without warning in the early hours of the morning .

"By . Rob Waugh . Updated: . 10:28 EST, 13 February 2012 . Physicists at the Large Hadron Collider are to 'turn up' the beams of the enormous machine to a higher beam energy for a last-ditch hunt for the Higgs boson, a theoretical particle which would change physics. CERN will turn up the LHC's beam energy to 4 TeVs, 0.5 TeV higher than last year, and run the particle accelerator until November. The physicists have one year to complete their experiments before the LHC shuts down for 20 months to upgrade its beam to an even higher energy of 7 TeV. Physicists are to turn up the energies of the LHC for 2012 - the particle accelerator will operate at a beam energy of 4 TeVs, higher than 2011 or 2010 . 'When we started operating the LHC for physics in 2010, we chose the . lowest safe beam energy consistent with the physics we wanted to do,' said CERN’s Director for Accelerators and Technology, Steve Myers. 'Two . good years of operational experience with beam and many additional . measurements made during 2011 give us the confidence to safely move up a . notch, and thereby extend the physics reach of the experiments before . we go into the LHC’s first long shutdown.' 'By the time the LHC goes into its first long stop at the end of this . year, we will either know that a Higgs particle exists or have ruled out . the existence of a Standard Model Higgs,' said CERN’s Research . Director, Sergio Bertolucci. 'Either would be a major advance in our . exploration of nature, bringing us closer to understanding how the . fundamental particles acquire their mass, and marking the beginning of a . new chapter in particle physics.' The LHC will shut down for 20 months at the end of 2012 to upgrade the machine to even higher energies . The scientists aim to deliver the maximum possible amount of data in 2012 before the LHC goes into a long shutdown. The data target for 2012 is  three times higher than in 2011. The LHC’s excellent performance in 2010 and 2011 has brought tantalising hints of new physics, notably narrowing the range of masses available to the Higgs particle to a window of just 16 GeV. Within this window, both the ATLAS and CMS experiments have seen hints that a Higgs might exist in the mass range 124-126 GeV. However, to turn those hints into a discovery, or to rule out the Standard Model Higgs particle altogether, requires one more year’s worth of data. The schedule announced today foresees beams back in the LHC next month, and running through to November.","LHC will run until November, then shut down for 20 months .

"By . Tara Brady . Black cab drivers have warned they are planning more go-slow protests despite action giving the Uber app £100million of free publicity. This week commuters in central London faced gridlock after taxi drivers staged a major protest over the introduction of cut-price fare app Uber. Black cab drivers and licensed taxis converged at Trafalgar Square for the go-slow protest to show their opposition to Uber, an app which allows customers to book and track vehicles. Scroll down for video . Black cab drivers have warned they are planning more go-slow protests despite action giving the Uber app £100million of free publicity . Despite the protests, the technology firm behind Uber confirmed a surge in downloads for the app, with a week-on-week increase of 850 per cent. A spokesman for Uber said it couldn't divulge specific numbers of users before and after the protest because the figures are commercially sensitive. However, he did say the app surged from number 26 in the iTunes most popular chart on the eve of the protest to number three yesterday, surpassed only by Fifa's World Cup app and Facebook's Messenger service. However . Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers . Association, has said there will be more demonstrations in the near future. He told The Times: 'We will be having more protests. Quite a lot of cabbies enjoyed themselves yesterday.' However, Ian Stephens, head of Saffron Brand Consultants, said the move had not been properly thought through. Smartphone app Uber allows customers to book and track vehicles in their area . Uber is one of a number of apps people can use to book and pay for taxi journeys. Launched in 2009 and currently in operation in more than 70 cities across 37 countries, the app makes cities more accessible for people by ‘seamlessly connecting riders to drivers’, according to the company website. The app detects the GPS on a mobile device and finds the nearest available driver. Users can track the vehicle, pay with their phone, and even split the fare with friends using a credit card system. Its on-demand service means reservations can be booked over the phone and passengers don’t have to wait in line at a taxi rank. Users can compare rates for different vehicles and get specific fare quotes via the app, before paying for a booking using a debit card or PayPal. It also allows users to track their driver once a cab has been ordered, so passengers know exactly what time they will be collected and if their taxi has been held up. It rivals an app already on the market in the UK, called Hailo, which allows passengers to ‘hail’ a cab via their smartphone. However black cab drivers are angry because they believe Uber effectively allows passengers to hail minicabs, which are supposed to be booked in advance. 'I think it is a massive own goal. Uber have come across has the consumer champion.' Analysis of social media shows more people opposed the protest than supported it. Uber has now also launched a new black cab booking feature called UberTaxi in a bid to placate drivers. As well as London, demonstrations and strikes also took place in other major European cities including Paris, Berlin, Rome and Madrid as international drivers protested against the introduction of the Uber app. In response to the outcry, Uber confirmed it would add a new section to its app – called UberTaxi – as a compromise with cab drivers. It would allow users to book . and pay for a traditional London black cab directly through the app and . fare rates will be the same as those set out by authorities. Roads around Trafalgar Square were closed to non-taxis on Wednesday and traffic lined nearby streets around the area during the hour-long demonstration this afternoon. Protesters chanted . ‘Boris, Boris, Boris, out, out, out’, while taxi drivers beeped their . horns and others held large placards. Many motorists chose to sit on the pavements as they waited for the protest to end. London Mayor Boris Johnson has said he . understood the concerns of taxi drivers but added that the issue should . be resolved in the courts, where Transport for London is planning a . case. He said London's black . cab trade was crucial to the fabric of the city, adding: 'The hackney . carriage is iconic, and it is absolutely right that our cabbies are . properly protected. 'Black cab drivers are the face of London not just for Londoners but for millions of visitors to our city.'","Licensed cab drivers say Uber smartphone app putting them out of business .

"By . Richard Spillett . Adolf Hitler's half-brother Alois lived in a terrace house in Liverpool before the First World War, newly-uncovered documents suggest - but the home was later flattened by a German Luftwaffe bomb. A copy of the 1911 census shows an 'Anton Hitler' - widely believed to the dictator's older half-sibling - and his wife Bridget, who was known as Cissie, were residents of the city. Ironically, considering his infamous half-brother's Nazi policies, Alois lists his job as a 'chef waiter' in a Lyons cafe - which was a Jewish company. Alois Hitler, the half-brother of Nazi leader Adolf, and his wife, Bridget (pictured in later life), are believed to have lived in Liverpool before the First World War . An 'Anton Hitler' (number 4 on list), believed to be Alois, and his wife 'Cissie Hitler' (number 6) are recorded as living in Upper Stanhope Street in the city . Hitler was said to have had a strained relationship with his half-brother, although there are reports that he may have visited Alois in Liverpool before the First World War . The property they were living in, at Upper Stanhope Street, was later destroyed during a German air raid on Liverpool in 1942 and to this day is still wasteland. The fascinating document, uncovered by genealogy website findmypast.co.uk, shows the couple and their son William living in the property just years before the outbreak of the First World War. The different styles of writing on the sheet suggest that each family member filled in their own details - with Alois even mistakenly writing in German in one entry - recording his son, William, as his 'sohn'. For an unknown reason, he lists himself as being called 'Anton', rather than his full name, Alois, but it is thought that may have been a moniker he was using at the time. Alois Hitler, pictured (left) at his home in Hamburg in 1945 and (right) in 1937, was said to be a gambler . The document, from 1911, shows Alois Hitler living in a house that was later destroyed in a German bombing raid and working at a Jewish-owned cafe . Alois Hitler Sr (left), fathered Alois Jr by a former partner, who later died, before he married Klara Polzi - the mother of Adolf Hitler, pictured (right) before his rise to power . Irish-born Bridget has also used a different name on the document, Cissie Hitler, but the first recording of her name is crossed out on the form and her family name 'Cissie Dowling' is still clearly visible. Having been married less than a year, it seems Bridget was still adjusting to her new married name.Alois Hitler Jr had a troubled childhood and is said to have had a rocky relationship with his parents. His mother died when he was two and his father married Klara Polzi - Adolf's mother. It is thought Alois had a poor relationship with his younger half-brother and he is not mentioned in Hitler's book Mein Kampf. In 1910, . he met a young woman called Bridget Elizabeth Dowling, at the Dublin . horse show in Ireland. Alois and Bridget eloped to London and married in . June 1910. In 1914, he returned to Germany without his family and married another woman - he was later prosecuted for bigamy. Bridget Hitler and her Liverpool-born son William in later life, after William moved to the US . William Hitler, Alois and Bridget's son, pictured being sworn into the US navy after he fled to America ahead of the Second World War . The house on Liverpool's Upper Stanhope Street has since been destroyed by a German bomb . The area where the house once stood is now wasteland. Liverpool came under heavy bombing during the Second World War due to its important dockyards . It is believed he was arrested by the British at the end of the Second World War, but was released after it emerged he had not joined the Nazi party. He reportedly later made money from selling autographed photos of his step-brother before his death in Hamburg, Germany in 1956. His son William later visited Germany but fled to the US ahead of the Second World War and, after writing a magazine article called 'Why I Hate My Uncle', he took the name William Stuart-Houston and died in New York in 1987. It is said William later had four sons, three of whom are still believed to be alive and are reportedly living in Long Island, near New York. As well as half-brother, Alois, Adolf Hitler had a half-sister, Angela, and was one of six children born to his father Alois Sr and his wife Klara. He had two older brothers, Gustav and Otto, an older sister, Ida, and two younger siblings, Edmund and Paula. In a book called The Hitlers of Liverpool, author Mike Unger claims the future Fuhrer fled to Merseyside from Vienna, to avoid national service in 1912 and stayed in a flat in Toxteth with his married half-brother Alois. Based on the memoirs of Bridget Hitler, the book claims Alois was a chronic gambler and, after one win, sent his sister Angela some money so she and her husband could visit from Vienna. But Adolf took the money and traveled over instead – to his half-brother's apparent fury, the book claims. His arrival in Liverpool prompted Alois to suspect his half-brother was trying to dodge conscription into the Austrian army. Bridget's book claims Alois told her: 'Adolf has been hiding from the military authorities, consequently from the police, for the last 18 months. That's why he came here to me. He had no choice.' Bridget apparently wrote that in his five months at their Toxteth home, Hitler was a lazy guest who spent much of his time walking the streets and drinking in the nearby Poste House pub (pictured). She wrote: 'Adolf took everything we did for granted and I'm sure would have remained indefinitely if he had had the slightest encouragement. After the first few weeks he would often come and sit in my cosy little kitchen playing with my two-year-old baby, while I was preparing our meals. 'He said he was looking for a job, but since he knew only a few words of English and never left early in the morning, it was always my opinion that he just wandered about Liverpool.' Relations between the two brothers became more strained during the stay and, it is claimed, Alois bought his half-brother a ticket back to Germany, where he was sent to fight in the First World War before embarking on his infamous rise to political power.","Census data suggests Hitler's step-brother Alois lived in the city in 1911 .

"By . Sam Greenhill . Strolling hand in hand with his partner on a tropical beach, Chris Huhne takes a break from lecturing us on climate change. The former Cabinet minister and Carina Trimingham jetted off on a 12,000-mile return flight to enjoy a carefree break on an exotic island. Huhne, 59, a crusader for green taxes, flew almost half way round the world for the winter sun getaway with his 47-year-old girlfriend. Miles away: Chris Huhne and his partner Carina Trimingham seem deep in thought as they stroll along a  beach . Exotic break: The former Cabinet minister, a crusader for green taxes, and Miss Trimingham jetted off on a 12,000-mile return flight to enjoy the carefree break on Phu Quoc, an idyllic island in the Gulf of Thailand . Romantic getaway: Huhne, 59, plants a kiss on his 47-year-old girlfriend's lips after a stroll along the seafront . They enjoyed beach walks and dips in the azure waters of Phu Quoc, an idyllic Vietnamese island in the Gulf of Thailand. It was a far cry from Leyhill Prison in Gloucestershire, where Huhne last year served 62 days of an eight-month sentence for his dishonesty in the speeding points affair. When he was climate change secretary, Huhne called for a sharp increase in air taxes as part of efforts to persuade people to take fewer flights. Carbon dioxide emissions from aeroplanes are blamed for contributing to global warming. Taking a dip: During the holiday, the pair enjoyed beach walks and dips in the island's azure waters (pictured) Idyllic location: Huhne flew almost half way round the world for the winter sun getaway on Phu Quoc (pictured) This is the same as the average carbon footprint for one Briton for a whole year – or 90 times that of one Ethiopian – and would need 24 trees to be planted to ‘offset’ it. On Monday Huhne was back on the airwaves as part of his bid to stage a comeback to public life following the humiliating fall from grace that ended his political career. On Radio 4’s Today programme, he warned listeners that threats from climate change remained ‘severe’ and he later appeared on Newsnight on BBC2. Stark contrast: It was a far cry from Leyhill Prison in Gloucestershire, where Huhne last year served 62 days . Court appearance: Huhne was jailed for perverting the course of justice following months of lies in which he repeatedly denied a speeding offence. Above, Huhne and Carina Trimingham arrive at Southwark Crown Court . Heading home: The millionaire former MP is pictured leaving Leyhill Prison following his 62-day incarceration . However the threats are not ‘severe’ enough, it seems, to have put him off flying to the Far East and back . for his holiday last month. Huhne and Miss Trimingham spent their days lazing on sun-loungers on the beach and reading espionage novels. The millionaire former MP stayed in a £28-a-night budget hotel – in one of the cheapest rooms available – in a coconut grove fringing the beach. A fellow tourist said: ‘The resort is a stone’s throw from five-star beachfront hotels, but they were very happy in the sparse accommodation costing much less. They seemed very relaxed and happily mingled with other guests.’ Huhne was jailed for perverting the course of justice following months of lies in which he repeatedly denied the offence of making his wife take his speeding points in 2003 so that he could avoid a driving ban. Huhne’s former wife Vicky Pryce was also jailed for the offence. Warning: Chris Huhne has previously referred to climate change as 'a man-made disaster' Chris Huhne has been more than happy to preach the climate change message over the years.

"By . Sam Greenhill . He has racked up a record 54 penalty points on his licence but Keith Baldock has been allowed to carry on driving. The unemployed 34-year-old is believed to be the only motorist in Britain legally on the road despite such a shocking catalogue of convictions. He begged a judge to let him keep his . licence so he could look for work as a mobile tyre fitter. Keith Baldock begged a judge to let him keep his licence so he could look for work as a mobile tyre fitter . No ban: Keith Baldock, of Herne Bay, Kent, is believed to be the only driver in Britain to be legally on the road despite having more than 50 points on a licence. He is pictured here with an unknown woman . A mistake by . the court meant the judge was unaware of Baldock’s previous offences – . and that he should already have been banned. Ordinarily, just 12 points are enough for disqualification, but Baldock persuaded the court he was a special case. Last . night road safety campaigners said the case undermined the system to . protect the public from ‘selfish and dangerous drivers’, and called for . the law to be overhauled. Baldock, . a father-of-two from Herne Bay, Kent, who lost his job as a tyre fitter . two years ago, had already been banned for a year in 2010 for . drink-driving. Still driving: Baldock (in the blue and white tracksuit) outside Canterbury Magsitrates' Court last year . In court: Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl said Balcok was 'a lucky man indeed', adding that the case was closed . Last year he was given a one-year supervision order for stealing petrol worth £500 from garages. The legal limit for a driving ban in Britain is 12 points on a licence. But courts can choose against enforcing a ban in cases where it would cause ‘exceptional hardship’, and fine the driver instead. Following . the sentencing, if new evidence emerges of points that have been . clocked up on a driver’s record, this can be submitted to the Crown . Prosecution Service. However, . any variation in ‘the substance of a sentence’ must be made within 56 . days of the original sentencing. In Baldock’s case, this time period had . already passed. Then . in November, Baldock was hit with 30 penalty points after being . convicted of driving without insurance on five separate occasions. He . was also convicted of stealing fuel from cars. But . when he appeared in the dock at Canterbury Crown Court, a mistake meant . the court was unaware he had already accumulated 24 points from . previous offences. Baldock . then argued he had turned to stealing out of ‘desperation’ to feed his . family after his Jobseeker’s Allowance was stopped. Judge . Nigel Van Der Bijl fined Baldock £500 and said: ‘I am making no order . for disqualification because if he is looking for work he will need a . car.’ It was not until this . week that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency realised Baldock . already had 24 points and informed the Crown Prosecution Service. Too late: Prosecutors approached Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) with the new evidence, but the law states any variation in 'the substance of a sentence' must be made within 56 days . Hometown: The seafront is pictured at the coastal town of Herne Bay, where 34-year-old Baldock lives . Baldock holds the record for the most penalty points of any motorist legally on the road. He has beaten a motorist from Liverpool who clocked up a former record of 45 penalty points on his licence in a nine-month offending spree. The . driver got the points for eight offences of either failing to disclose . the identity of the driver or for speeding between October 2012 and June . 2013. That man's total exceeded the previous record of 42 points. The third-highest total, 36, goes to a man from Warrington, Cheshire, who was caught driving without insurance six times in less than two weeks between February and March 2012. A woman from Lincoln is fourth with 34 . points, after being caught speeding three times and failed to give . information to identify the driver four times over nine months in 2012. The . CPS told the court, but the law states any variation in ‘the substance . of a sentence’ must be made within 56 days – making it too late to . change Baldock’s. Prosecutor . Francis Lloyd told Canterbury Crown Court: ‘At the earlier hearing he . was not  disqualified, but in fact he should have been unless there was . exceptional hardship. ‘Unfortunately there is not a great deal we can do about it now – he’s a lucky fellow.’ Judge Van Der Bijl replied: ‘A lucky man indeed. Case closed.’ Last . night Baldock admitted: ‘The judge gave me 30 points – and I knew I . already had 24 points. I was quite shocked when I found out that I . hadn’t been banned. ‘I expected to get an 18-months to two-year ban and a hefty fine. I got a £500 fine.’ Speaking . from a farm where he lives in Herne Bay, he said: ‘It’s a f*** up from . the DVLA and the judge. I should have been banned.’ A close friend said: ‘He’s got to be the luckiest man in Britain. We had a good laugh about it.’ The friend added: ‘Keith did a hop, skip and a jump out of the courtroom and he’s been hopping and skipping around the farm.’ But . Ellen Booth, of road safety charity Brake, said: ‘The penalty points . system exists to protect the public from selfish and dangerous drivers . who repeatedly take life-threatening risks on roads. ‘But . this protection is undermined every time a driver who reaches 12 points . is allowed to keep their licence, particularly so when we’re talking . about drivers who have accumulated very high numbers of points. ‘By . the time you have reached 12 points, you’ve had multiple opportunities . to turn your behaviour around. If you need your licence, look after it.’ The Institute of Advanced . Motorists is calling for the system to be re-examined. Chief executive . Simon Best said: ‘The DVLA must rapidly overhaul their systems and . working relationships with the courts to ensure that the whole principle . of “12 points and you are off the road” is not undermined.’ The DVLA declined to comment on the case.","Keith Baldock, 34, of Herne Bay, lost his job as tyre fitter two years ago .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It may be a grisly affair, but for centuries, the only way for aspiring medics to learn about anatomy was to dissect corpses. Now, there is another way, as medical students can use ‘virtual dissection software’ to explore the human body in the absence of real corpses, which are in short supply. While they may not get the sensation of cutting human flesh, the virtual tool claims to be cheaper and faster than using cadavers. Warning: Graphic images. Scroll down for video . Medical students can use 'virtual dissection software' to perform dissections in the absence of real bodies, which are in short supply. A real corpse and the body's muscles  is pictured. The Anatomedia website shows a demo video and screenshots. To use the tool, users must request access from the university . The tool provides: . The software is called Anatomedia and claims to be a 'comprehensive, self-paced learning programme that explores anatomy from four different perspectives,’ in order to teach students how the body is constructed. It even allows people to complete practical dissections and post mortems, as well as being able to see ‘sections’ of the human body. Users can see detailed dissections of real bodies, coloured overlays of specific structures and choose different perspectives from which to view the anatomy they are interested in. The Australian makers of the learning tool said that users do not need any prior knowledge of anatomy to use the tool, and that labels that pop up over the images can be selected at any level of difficulty. The Anatomedia website shows a demo video and screenshots. To use the tool, users must request access from the university via this site. The software is called Anatomedia and claims to be a 'comprehensive, self-paced earning programme that explores anatomy from four different perspectives,' which teaches students how the body is constructed. Here, a tutorial explains how to remove the lungs and identify features behind them . The tool was the brainchild of Norman Eizenberg, an associate professor at Monash University - who started his work at Melbourne University - in Australia and has been 20 years in the making. He made the database because the time spent in dissection and tutorials is being reduced in medical schools, and there are typically 80 students sharing each cadaver. ‘Anatomedia bridges the educational gap by providing students with a detailed anatomy resource to use before, during and after their practicals,’ according to the website. ‘It allows them to make better use of their time and to focus on areas of clinical significance and anatomy relevant to practical procedures.’ The tool was developed by Norman Eizenberg an associate professor at Monash University in Australia and has been 20 years in the making. As well as views of real corpses, it includes X-rays such as this one which shows how men and womens' pelvises differ . Professor Eizenberg told Digital Trends that it takes days to clear away the fat and fibres of a corpse, but this process can be done with a few clicks in the programme and each screen on Anatomedia represents a week’s worth of dissection. 'The tool can also be used by medical practitioners to explain anatomical issues to patients and its layer-by-layer dissections offer an excellent alternative in countries where dissection is not performed for cultural or other reasons,’ the company said. In the future, it could even be used in the creation of a ‘virtual human’ that students can feel, as programmers assign tactile qualities to the database of photos using a programming language.

It includes  diagrams of how children develop (pictured), for example . The visual database could be used to create a 'virtual human' that students could feel if programmers assign tactile qualities to photos. Two experts want to make a human that medical students could see on a screen but feel the sensations of conducting a dissection, from slicing through wobbly fat to moving blood vessels. They envisage that such a model would use a model to apply forces and vibrations to a user, replicating the rigidity of a scalpel slicing through flesh, while they are watching footage on a computer screen. There is currently no funding for the project, or a date when it could be realised. Former Nasa consultant Robert Rice, together with a chief executive of a sensing and simulation technology company, plan to use the tool to create a 3D virtual human that students can see on a screen and feel the sensations of conducting a dissection, from slicing through wobbly fat to moving blood vessels. They envisage that such an innovation would use a model to apply forces and vibrations to a user, replicating the resistance to a scalpel, while they are watching footage on a computer screen. Dr Rice said: ‘We’ll offer multi-touch, both-hands haptics which invokes the remarkable human sense of touch, sensitivity and meaning.’ ‘You will feel the texture of skin, the firmness of an athletic muscle or the flabbiness of belly fat, the rigidity of your bony elbow or the pulsatile flow of blood at your wrist pulse point.’ While such a project would cost around $15million (£8 million) to develop, the innovators think it could save medical schools money in the long run, as a cadaver lab can cost up to $4million (£2.4 million) to run every year. There is no indication when the technology could be realised and the duo have yet to secure investment for their idea. The tool allows students to complete practical dissections and post mortems, as well as being able to see 'sections' of the human body.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Extradited: British soldier David McIntyre, 43, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, has lost his appeal fighting extradition to the US . A British soldier suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder has lost his legal challenge against extradition to the US where he is wanted on fraud charges. David McIntyre, 43, who served in Afghanistan, was given additional time by Home Secretary Theresa May to present evidence of his illness to London's High Court in a bid to stand trial in Britain. But despite being 'at high risk of suicide', he was today told the medical notes were not enough to block his removal. In an irreversible ruling, Mr McIntyre, who also served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Iraq, now faces eight counts of fraud and a possible 20-year jail term in an American prison. The fraud case concerns a contract between Mr McIntyre's security firm Quantam Risk and the US Institute of Peace. It is alleged that McIntyre . overcharged the institute by $100,000 (£66,000) when providing security for the group in Iraq during a break from army service. The former soldier insists he is innocent and is the victim of a plea bargain in which a US official, accused of similar offences, named him to secure a lenient sentence. Mr McIntyre, from Manchester, served with the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment from 1996 to 2002. When he left, he set up his company to provide security to American clients, including the Iraqi ambassador to the US. But in 2009 he closed the business and enrolled in the Royal Military Police Territorial Army. He was serving in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, when the allegations emerged in July 2012, forcing him to be discharged and flown home. Despite two years of legal battles, and a military psychiatric report warning extradition could have 'potentially tragic' consequences, he has now been told he will be sent to the US. And Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas . said there was 'no conceivable basis' on which he could appeal this . latest ruling in the Supreme Court. Blasting the sentence as 'cruel', Friends Extradited spokesman Melanie Riley told MailOnline: . Ruling: Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas ruled there was 'no injustice' in the case at London's High Court . 'David is somebody who has served his country all of his life and as a result of what he has seen is suffering from PTSD. 'I think it is cruel and unnecessary to extradite him. 'We . have the facilities to investigate the alleged overcharging of £66,000 . without putting him through the added trauma of automatically locking . him up, separating him from his partner, his kids, his home. 'I am also not persuaded that the US justice system takes sufficient care of people with mental health problems.' 'David has served his country all his life. It is cruel and unnecessary to put him through the trauma of separating him from his partner, kids, and home' - Melanie Riley, Friends Extradited . At . the March hearing, Edward Fitzgerald QC, for McIntyre, argued there was . convincing medical evidence that he was suffering from a mental . disorder and it would violate his human rights if extradition went ahead . because of the suicide risk. He suggested McIntyre could stand trial in the UK. The US authorities opposed the bid to block removal. McIntyre’s supporters say of the extradition threat: 'Is this really the way Britain should be treating its brave soldiers?' The ex-soldier has said in an online blog: 'If I was given an order to be extradited to the US I am fearful that I would take my own life as I would rather be dead then be locked up in an American prison away from my family and knowing that everything that I had been working towards would have been taken away from me. 'I think, after serving my country all my life, the least I can expect is to be helped with my PTSD and being allowed to prove my innocence in my own country.' But the judges said they were satisfied there was no 'injustice' in the case.","David McIntyre is accused of overcharging U.S. peace group £66,000 .

"By . Sam Greenhill . With his handsome chestnut plumage and rapacious sexual appetite, the ruddy duck has long been designated a ruddy pest. Every year, the promiscuous male of the British species flies south to Spain where he ravishes females of the rare white-headed duck. Such is the ruddy duck’s success with the ladies in Spain – to the humiliating detriment of the cuckolded male white-heads there – that Madrid complained of the threat to its native bird’s survival. The Spanish Government fears the British-bred ruddy duck is putting their country's species at risk . Not satisfied with one partner, the blue-billed British birds with snow-white cheeks have let their fancies take flight. They . fathered so many cross-breed ‘Euro ducklings’ that the precious line of . white-heads was in danger of being bred out of existence, causing all . manner of a flutter in diplomatic corridors. And so, to appease the Spanish, British ministers have spent ten years and £4million trying to slaughter the ruddy duck. Yesterday . it emerged they have found a further £120,000 of taxpayers’ money to . fully exterminate the British species, even though it causes no harm in . the UK. An estimated 100 – . or even as few as  20 – remain, hiding among the reeds  in remote watery . corners of England, Wales and Scotland. Now . there is a £2,500 bounty on each coppery head, and one day the final . ruddy duck will peer above the rushes and stare down the barrel of a . hunting rifle. The massacre . of the ruddy duck was ordered in 2003 by the Department for the . Environment, Food and Rural Affairs following a series of protests from . Madrid. The massacre of the ruddy duck was ordered in 2003 by Defra (the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), following a series of government-level protests from Madrid . So far the cull has claimed some 5,500 ruddy ducks, causing anger among British conservationists, bird lovers and landowners. The RSPB has taken the Government’s side, leaving some of its members incensed. One, . Roger Barlow, 69, of Norton, Stockton-on-Tees, told the Daily Mail: ‘If . the Spanish government or environmentalists do not like the idea of the . ruddy duck mating with their white-head ducks, then they should cull . them when they arrive in Spain. 'It’s . what ducks do, and why should we foot the bill? The Canada goose is . becoming a problem in Britain, but any culling will quite rightly be . paid for by the British taxpayer. ‘Tell . Spain to leave well alone or do its own dirty business, and send them a . bill for costs incurred to date.’ The ruddy duck is native to North and . South America, where its population is around 700,000. It . was introduced to Britain  from the US more than 50 years ago by Sir . Peter Scott, and since then has slowly established itself across Europe. Brian Ankers, chairman of . Woolston Eyes Nature Reserve in Cheshire, told the Sunday Telegraph: . ‘They are beautiful things. It’s very sad and I can’t make sense of it. ‘They’ve . never been a nuisance here and it seems a ridiculous amount of . Government money  to spend on getting rid of them.’ Lee Evans, of the . British Birding Association, said: ‘The whole thing is a fiasco. ‘It’s . a total waste of public money, and all that will happen when the cull . stops is that new ducks will fly over from the Continent, and we’ll be . back to square one.’ There . are still relatively large populations of ruddy duck in France and . Netherlands, meaning that even if the British effort is successful, the . tragic loneliness of male white-head ducks in Spain may continue. Defra . said the Government’s action was ‘in line with the commitment of other . European countries to eradicate ruddy ducks elsewhere by 2015’.","Promiscuous males fly to mainland Europe where it ravishes females .

"By . Rachel Reilly . Toys that contain powerful lasers such as the lightsaber could cause permanent eye damage . Toys that contain small lasers could cause serious injuries and even blindness, health authorities have warned. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has flagged up that many toys, such as lightsabers and spinning tops, contain powerful lasers that can cause permanent damage to the eye. Laser injuries do not usually hurt, but vision can deteriorate slowly over time. These injuries may go unnoticed for days and even weeks, and could be permanent, they said. ‘A beam shone directly into a person's eye can injure it in an instant, especially if the laser is a powerful one,' Dan Hewett, health promotion officer at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in an FDA release. He said that the toys that most typically cause damage include lasers mounted on toy guns that can be used for aiming, spinning tops that project beams while they spin, hand-held lasers used during play as lightsabers and lasers intended for entertainment that create optical effects in an open room. He added that advertisers often promote their toys as playthings, so parents and children believe they're harmless. But this is often not the case and vigilance must be maintained by parents while children play with the electronic toys. In recent years, the power of lasers has increased while prices have fallen, Mr Hewitt added. Laser injuries don't usually hurt, but vision can deteriorate slowly over time with injuries going unnoticed for days and even weeks . The FDA recommends that users never aim or shine a laser directly at any person or animal. In some cases the light energy from a laser aimed into the eye can be even more dangerous than staring directly into the sun. They also advise not to aim a laser at any reflective surface. In addition to this, they say to keep in mind that the startling effect of a bright beam of light can cause serious accidents when aimed at a driver in a car or lead to injuries among people doing other activities, such as playing sports.","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has flagged up that many toys, such as toy guns, contain lasers that can damage the eye’s retina .

"By . Bianca London . A teen beauty queen has followed in her mother's high heeled footsteps - by clinching the same beauty pageant title as she did 30 years earlier. Zara Holland, 18, is now in the running to be made Miss England after being crowned Miss Hull. But for proud mother, Cheryl Hakeney, 49, her daughter's victory was extra special - because she herself held the Miss Hull title in 1984, when she was just 19. Good genes: Zara Holland, 18, is now in the running to be made Miss England after being crowned Miss Hull. Her mother Cheryl Hakeney, 49, held the title herself in 1984, when she was 19 . The similarity between the pair in their winners' photos is striking - with the exception of Cheryl's 80s perm. Cheryl, from Hull, East Yorks, says: 'It was totally incredible when Zara won. I was seeing it from a different angle. 'When it is your child, you just want them to do well and I was really rooting for her to win. 'There were so many pretty girls that entered. When they announced Zara had won, I thought I was going to faint.' Spot the difference: Zara (left) looks similar to her mother (right) - with the exception of Cheryl's perm (right) Proud: Cheryl, from Hull, East Yorks, said: 'It was totally incredible when Zara won.' Talented: Zara has also done some acting, appearing in Hollyoaks, Coronation Street and Emmerdale, and now hopes to take home the Miss England title . The Miss Hull and District final was held on Friday evening at The Country Park Inn in Hessle and saw 30 girls compete for the coveted title over four rounds. Zara, an aspiring actress who has appeared in Hollyoaks, Coronation Street and Emmerdale, says: 'I'm still on cloud nine at the moment, it is absolutely amazing. I could not be any happier. 'I did not expect to win at all. When they called out my name, I just burst into tears. It was the best feeling in my whole entire life. 'Everyone involved in the competition has been amazing and so supportive. Changing times: Cheryl, pictured for the swimwear round, says that a lot has changed and the competitions are much more 'up-to-date' now and look for the whole package rather than just a pretty face . Back in the day: Cheryl admits that beauty pageants have changed from what they were like 30 years ago when she competed . 'All the other girls who entered have also been lovely and have been sending me messages congratulating me. 'I am just so happy to represent Hull in the Miss England final.' Zara was able to ask her mother for advice on the competition, after Cheryl was crowned Miss Viking Radio, the equivalent to what is now Miss Hull and District, when the competition first started. Zara, 18, adds: 'Mum knows all about what it is like to be in the competitions. It is really nice because we can talk about everything. Going for gold: Zara will now represent Hull at the Miss England final held in Torquay in June and has her mother's guidance . Proud: For Cheryl, her daughters victory was extra special - because she had held the title herself in 1984, when she was just 19 . 'She has been lovely throughout all of this, really supportive. We are really close and get on so well.' 'Mum was the runner-up when she was in Miss England, so I am hoping to go that one stage further and take the title,' Zara says.

"By . Mark Prigg . Nasa should focus on a manned mission to Mars, and consider partneting with China on space missions, according to a new review of the human space flight program. The National Research Council report, commissioned by the U.S. space agency Nasa, recommends a stepping stone approach toward Mars that builds technological know-how through a series of well-defined preliminary missions. The space agency backed the report, saying 'There is a consensus that our horizon goal should be a human mission to Mars.' Scroll down for video . Nasa's chief scientist Dr Ellen Stofan has revealed the agency plans to land humans on Mars in the next 20 years. To get there she says there are a number of technological milestones that must be reached, including sending astronauts to an asteroid, to ensure the crew's survival . All options begin with the International Space Station, a $100 billion research complex flying 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, the 286-page report released in Washington D.C., said. One path includes Nasa's current plan to robotically capture an asteroid, redirect it into a high orbit around the moon and send astronauts there to explore. The report suggests that path continue with missions to the moons of Mars, then on to Martian orbit and finally to the surface of the planet. But two other paths would be less technologically daunting, NRC panel co-chairman Jonathan Lunine of Cornell University told reporters during a webcast press conference. Nasa could follow the International Space Station program, which currently costs the United States about $3 billion a year, with a series of lunar sorties, an outpost on the moon and then to Mars, the report said. The last path has the most stops en route to Mars, but poses the least technological risk since milestones have to be met along the way. That option would follow the space station with human missions to an orbit beyond the moon, then to an asteroid in its native orbit, then to the lunar surface, the moons of Mars, Martian orbit and then to Mars itself. Nasa would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide. They would then tow or push it towards Earth so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon. In . 2021 astronauts would then use an Orion capsule - a manned spacecraft - . to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for . analysis. This asteroid would also, probably in the 2030s, be used as a stop-off point for astronauts on their way to Mars. Exact . details on how Nasa plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory . are not yet known, but the most recent rendering rendering shows it is . captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag. The mission involves astronauts . making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the . next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object. Once . the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the . crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the . conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take . photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After . the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it . journeyed out on, loops around the moon included, and splashes down in . an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video. Nasa said it supports the panel’s findings. 'There is a consensus that our horizon goal should be a human mission to Mars,' the agency said in a statement. 'The pathways thrust of the report complements Nasa's ongoing approach.' All options will depend heavily on international, private sector and other partnerships, according to the report titled “Pathways to Exploration - Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration.” 'We’re really talking about international collaboration of a different scale than what has been conducted in the past,' Lunine said. In particular, the United States’ current relationship with China, which is not a member of the 15-nation space station partnership, needs to be reassessed, the report said. 'Given the rapid development of China’s capabilities in space, it is in the best interests of the United States to be open to its inclusion in future international partnerships.' Nasa's Orion capsule will be one of the key components of any future attempt to land on Mars. The capsule will be responsible for launching astronauts into space and ultimately returning them to Earth. It is pictured here at the Operations and Checkout Building at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center. Its first flight will occur in December . The panel gave no specific estimate of what a Mars mission would cost. But based on past space initiatives, the public would support the endeavor. 'There is a temptation to rush to the question of dollars,' panel co-chairman and former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels said. 'Dollars is the secondary question.' The pathways approach to Mars is 'a very different way of doing business,' Lunine said. Last week, Nasa Chief scientist Dr Ellen Stofan, in a series of talks across the UK, outlined the plans of the agency to undertake such a mission in the next two decades. Dr Stofan, however, as keen to stress the importance of being cautious when undertaking what would arguably be makind’s greatest accomplishment. Other organisations such as the privately funded Mars One have claimed they will land humans on Mars by 2025, but have yet to reveal much research and development that indicates such a goal is achievable. Nasa, meanwhile, is taking the careful approach. ‘We want to make sure we get living astronauts to the surface of Mars,’ Dr Stofan said according to the Guardian. ‘For us, that is a non-negotiable position. There is a lot of work to do, that’s why we need all of the space agencies around the world working together.’","These include landing on an asteroid and building necessary components for a 2035 mission .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Eleanor Harding . and Martin Robinson . A suspected plot to kill a magistrate with a rare poison extracted from the seeds of a Peruvian plant has been uncovered by police. Detectives believe Meena Patel, 54, was the target of an unprecedented attack with abrin, a substance described as ‘more poisonous than ricin’. Her daughter Kuntal, 36, is accused of spiking her Diet Coke with the toxin after allegedly buying it from an underworld website based in the US. Detectives believe Meena Patel (left) was the target of an unprecedented attack with abrin. Her daughter Kuntal (right) is accused of . spiking her Diet Coke with it after allegedly buying it from an . underworld website . The alleged intended victim, who sits on the bench at Thames Magistrates’ Court, apparently drank the substance at her home in Stratford, East London, but survived. Abrin is derived from the distinctive red seeds of the rosary pea plant, a sub-tropical perennial commonly found in Peru. It strikes at the liver, stomach and kidneys, and leads to vomiting, seizures and an agonising death within 72 hours. Experts say a dose as small as three millionths of a gram can kill if it enters the bloodstream. There is no known antidote. Kuntal Patel, who works for Barclays . at its headquarters in Canary Wharf, appeared before Westminster . Magistrates’ Court yesterday accused of attempted murder. Mistake? The family of Mr Sutcliffe, a first secretary to the Foreign Office, claim police may have 'messed up' after a tip-off which led to the garden being dug up . She . was arrested by detectives from Scotland Yard’s counter terrorism . command during a huge search operation last weekend. They were acting on . a tip-off from the US Department of Homeland Security which smashed a . hidden website that specialised in selling lethal toxins. Dozens of officers subjected the Stratford home she shared with her mother to a fingertip search as part of the investigation. They also combed the back garden, neighbours’ bins and a nearby skip, and seized Meena Patel’s white Nissan Micra. Kuntal Patel, wearing a blue Hello . Kitty sweatshirt with a pigtail hanging down her back, was told she does . not face any terrorist charges yesterday. Instead she is accused of . attempted murder between December and January 26. District Judge Jeremy . Coleman refused an application for bail and sent her case to the Old . Bailey for a hearing next month. In . a separate development, it emerged that a senior diplomat became . embroiled in the search after his son signed for a package which police . believed contained the poison. Arrests: Police stand guard outside Mr Sutcliffe's house during the operation in leafy Streatham Hill. His son James was released on bail, with one relative claiming Scotland Yard said he had 'nothing to worry about'' Response: Dozens of officers spent four days searching the Sutcliffes' four-bedroom home and garden. Above, officers raid Mrs Patel's house in east London on January 26 . Well equipped: Many of the police officers were wearing biohazard suits and using breathing equipment . James . Sutcliffe, 19, was arrested under counter terrorism laws after it is . believed that he innocently accepted the parcel for his neighbour. Investigators . are examining the possibility that the package was delivered to someone . who lives next door to him in Streatham Hill, South London. Mr . Sutcliffe’s decision to accept the package is believed to have led . police to spend four days searching the £650,000 family home he shares . with his father Nicholas, a first secretary to the Foreign Office. Neighbours . looked on as specialist officers wearing protective equipment and . breathing apparatus entered the property and sealed off the road. Position: Mr Sutcliffe, a senior diplomat, was posted to Brazil in the early 1990s . Anger: The diplomat's sister-in-law Jenny described James's arrest as 'lunacy' and a 'mix-up' They . spent four days scouring the property and digging up the garden, using . arc lights and tents so they could work around the clock. James . Sutcliffe was questioned for several hours on Saturday before being . released on bail. On Wednesday he was told there would be no further . police action. None of his neighbours, the Wong family, was arrested although their house and garden were also searched. A . Sutcliffe family friend said: ‘They now want to get back to normal. James is very relieved that he has been totally cleared by the police – . he knew all along he was innocent.’ There . is not believed to be a single recorded murder in which abrin was used, . but it has appeared in fiction. Kathy Reichs includes a detailed . account of the poison as a weapon in her 2011 novel Flash And Bones. Planned operation: The arrests on Mr Sutcliffe and Miss Patel were made by police over the weekend . Scene: A neighbouring house belonging to a family from Hong Kong was also searched during the operation . Action: A Met spokesman said public safety was 'a priority' and people in the area didn't appear to be at risk .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A Minnesota teen living on a U.S. military base in Japan has been arrested for raping a classmate and recording the act on a smartphone while friends watched, authorities said. Ricky Sherwood, 18, allegedly got the 17-year-old girl intoxicated February 11 before forcing himself on her at Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa, said police. Witnesses said she was barely conscious during the assault. Her blood alcohol content was discovered that night at a local hospital to be 0208 per cent, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Where it happened: Ricky Sherwood raped the teen girl on Kadena Air Force Base, in Okinawa, Japan, police said . The high school senior and part-time lifeguard at the island base was undeterred by a friend heard in the video saying ‘she looks like she’s gonna die,’ according to a criminal complaint cited by the paper. Sherwood admitted to plying the girl with alcohol, raping her and recording a video of his actions when interviewed by investigators, the affidavit said, according to the paper. The girl told police that went to Sherwood’s home that afternoon after school, drank two cups of alcohol and blacked out until being tended to by paramedics in a local park hours later. Other students said the victim was ‘unable to stand, walk or dress herself,’ cops said. Sherwood put her in a chair, carried her to a car and dumped her in the park after the rape, police said. Investigators said the video shows the girl not moving and with her eyes closed while Sherwood raped her. Sherwood was living on the base with his uncle, who has legal custody of him, because his mother lives in Mexico, the Star Tribune reported. He was arraigned this week over the phone by a judge in St. Paul – U.S. officials have jurisdiction over the case because he is a base employee, the paper said. He will eventually be extradited to the U.S. to face charges, ad faces at least one year in prison.","Ricky Sherwood, 18, went to school with his underage victim, authorities said .

"By . James Rush . A father-of-two left his wedding ring and watch to give to his children in case something happened to him before boarding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight as he flew out to start a dream job in Mongolia. Mechanical engineer Paul Weeks, 39, of Perth, Australia, was on the flight as he made his way to his first shift in a fly-in fly-out job. His wife Danica has revealed how he left the objects with her to give to their two boys if something was to happen to him. Father-of-two Paul Weeks was on board the missing flight MH370 as he flew out to Mongolia to start a dream job . Mrs Weeks however said on Sunday that she was praying for a miracle as she waited for news of him. She told 9News National in Perth: '(He said) ""If something should happen to me then the wedding ring should go to the first son that gets married and then the watch to the second"".' The former soldier, who was born in New Zealand, moved his young family to Perth after their home in Christchurch was devastated by earthquakes. The couple have a three-year-old son called Lincoln and an 11-month-old called Jack. Mr Weeks was believed to have got a new job with Transwest Mongolia. Mrs Weeks said before he left he took 'lots of photos' of his family. She told WA Today: 'I can’t give up hope. I would love him to walk through that door, hold him one more time ... I see him everywhere in the house.' Mr Weeks's wife Danica has said her husband left his wedding ring and watch in case something happened to him . Mrs Weeks has said she 'can't give up hope' after the Malaysia Airlines flight went missing early Saturday morning . Mr Weeks was one of 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board the Malaysia Airlines flight which went missing early Saturday morning as it made its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The manifest included 152 passengers from China, 38 from Malaysia, seven from Indonesia, six from Australia, five from India, three from the U.S., and others from Indonesia, France, New Zealand, Canada, Ukraine, Russia, Taiwan and the Netherlands. A mid-air explosion: The lack of debris could be explained by it falling into Malaysian jungle . A terrorist attack: Director of CIA has said terrorism could not be ruled out . Power failure: Possibly caused by deliberate cutting of power to communication instruments . Electronic warfare: 20 passengers on board were experts in this technology. Hijacking: Radar data indicates the plane might have made a U-turn. A pilot error: There is a chance of them in all air mysteries, claim experts . Structural failure: Possibly involving damage sustained by an accident in 2012 . Pilot suicide: There were two large jet crashes in the late 1990s caused by this . Aeronautical black hole: Plane is stranded hundreds of miles from current search area . Among those travelling on the flight was a group of eight Chinese and 12 Malaysian employees of Austin, Texas, semiconductor company Freescale, which said it was assembling 'around-the-clock support' for their families. For seasoned Australian travellers Robert Lawton, 58, and his wife, Catherine, 54, the seemingly routine takeoff of flight MH370 was the beginning of another adventure. Sharing their adventure was another 50-something Australian couple, Rodney and Mary Burrows. Neighbor Don Stokes said the trip was intended as the beginning of the 'next step in their life'. Among the family groups on board were teenage sweethearts Hadrien Wattrelos, 17, and Zhao Yan, 18, students at a French school in Beijing who were returning from the Malaysian leg of a two-week holiday along with Hadrien's mother and younger sister. In December, Zhao changed her Facebook profile photo to one of her and Hadrien. He had commented: 'Je t'aime,' followed by a heart, and she had 'liked' his comment. Some boarded the plane with more serious purposes in mind. Colleagues of Chandrika Sharma said the 50-year-old director of the Chennai chapter of an organization that works with fishermen was on her way from the southern Indian city to Mongolia for a Food and Agriculture Organization conference. More than three days after the Boeing 777 disappeared, no trace of the plane has been found in waters between Malaysia and Vietnam that have been scoured by more than 40 planes and ships from at least 10 nations. Catherine and Robert Lawton, from Brisbane, were named as one of three couples from Australia who were missing . French teenagers Zhao Yan and Hadrien Wattrelos had enrolled together at the Lycee Francais International de Pekin. Both are believed to have been on board . The plane dropped off radar less than an hour into the flight without sending out a distress signal. Authorities have said it may have attempted to turn back to Kuala Lumpur, but they expressed surprise that it would do so without informing ground control. Malaysia Airlines has said in a statement that search and rescue teams expanded their scope to the Malacca Strait between Malaysia's western coast and Indonesia's Sumatra island - the opposite side of Malaysia from the plane's last known location. To reach the strait, a busy shipping lane, the plane would have had to cross over the country, presumably within the range of radar. An earlier statement said the western coast of Malaysia was 'now the focus', but the airline subsequently said that phrase was an oversight. It did not elaborate. Civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said the search remained 'on both sides' of the country.","Paul Weeks was on the missing flight as he made his way to new job .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Afternoon tea with your nan will never be the same again. A London-based designer has created a coffee table that doubles up as a levitating magic carpet. The impressive design is the brainchild of Barking-based artist Chris Duffy who has launched an optical illusion furniture range inspired by his childhood fairy tales. Designer Chris Duffy has created this pixelated 'magic carpet' rug as part of its optical illusion furniture range . The designer set about inventing the magic carpet after watching Aladdin and thinking: ‘How can I get that into my home?’ The digitally-printed table, which costs £1,495, features a pixelated Persian rug design with a shadow design on its base. 'I didn't want to have to resort to using supernatural powers or industrial magnets,' Mr Duffy told MailOnline. The illusion is created by mounting the steel rug on a hidden 5cm-wide leg at the centre of the table. A shadow base, shown in these images in black, makes the table appear as though it is floating . Another one of Mr Duffy's designs is the £2,495 Woodsman Axe Table, inspired by the Brothers Grimm fairy tale 'Little Red Riding Hood', as the imagined furniture of the woodsman . The illusion is created by mounting the steel rug on a hidden 5cm-wide cantilever at the centre of the table. A shadow base makes it appear as though it is floating. It also has a wave-like surface to add to the illusion of a magic carpet moving in its stationary position. Unless you lie down on the floor next to the table, you won’t know how it works, said Mr Duffy. 'The solution came from one of our previous designs, the shadow chair which was launched a year or two before. 'The table works in a similar way by a cantilever against the shadow base. 'This way we can keep the legs and framework very well hidden under the table top, we are able to maximise this using the latest CAD technology and 3D design programmes, to push these effects and materials to their limits. 'The illusion works from all angles both sitting and standing, the wave effect is also an optical illusion caused by the pixelated Persian rug pattern and form, the table top is actually completely flat.' 'Our designs often play with the theme of gravity, which rings true with the mind-boggling creation of the ""Up"" coffee table,' said the Brighton University graduate . The designer has also created a four poster table structure that uses its structure to suspend eight chairs that sway playfully . 'We've had interest from offices, hotels and homes,' said Mr Duffy. 'They really love the quirky furniture.' Pictured here is a close-up of chairs swinging on a boardroom table . Another one of Mr Duffy's designs is the £2,495 Woodsman Axe Table, inspired by the Brothers Grimm fairy tale 'Little Red Riding Hood', as the imagined furniture of the woodsman. ‘Our designs often play with the theme of gravity, which rings true with the mind-boggling creation of the “Up” coffee table,’ said the Brighton University graduate. Working with the illusion of levitation the table gives the impression the glass top is being suspended by small balloons. The limited edition version costs £5,800. The Monolith Table by Christopher Duffy. This table takes its inspiration from The Sentinel, a book by Arthur C. Clarke that went on to be made into the film 2001: A Space Odyssey . Another version of the Monolith table is pictured here. The glass table top seems to balance miraculously on top of toppling monoliths, which appear to be frozen in a permanent state of impending collapse . And it isn’t just living rooms Mr Duffy is planning to invade. The designer has also created a four poster boardroom table that uses its structure to suspend eight chairs that sway playfully. ‘We’ve had interest from offices, hotels, homes,’ said Mr Duffy. ‘They really love the quirky furniture.’ In the ‘Monolith Table’, Mr Duffy took inspiration from The Sentinel, a book by Arthur C. Clarke that went on to be made into the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick. The glass table top seems to balance miraculously on top of toppling monoliths, which appear to be frozen in a permanent state of impending collapse. ‘It's supported by magic’, said Mr Duffy. ‘…and also some physics.’ This table is inspired by the Brothers Grimm fairy tale 'Little Red Riding Hood', as the imagined furniture of the woodsman .","The illusion is created by mounting the rug on a hidden 5cm-wide leg .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Homeowners living in the world's tallest residential skyscraper are having to climb up more than 1,300ft of steps - the equivalent of walking one-third of the way up Ben Nevis - after all the lifts broke down. Princess Tower in Dubai, which stands at 1,355ft tall with 97 above-ground residential floors, has been named the tallest residential building in the world Guinness World . Records. But residents living in the luxurious tower block - many of whom are British - have been told they have 'no choice' but to walk up to their flats, some on the 97th floor, after all eight lifts in the building broke down last week. Tall order: Residents of Dubai's Princess Towers, the tallest building pictured with a domed roof, have been told they will have to use the stairs to reach their flats after all eight lifts in the building broke down . The building, which has six levels in the basement and 101 above ground . level, opened in September last year, with two-bed flats on the rental market for £140-a-day and penthouse flats selling for more than £2million. It is 339ft taller than The Shard, although still dwarfed by the world's tallest building, the 2,722ft tall Burj Khalifa in Dubai which is not classed as a residential building. Princess Tower boasts 763 luxury apartments as well as eight giant stores and overlooks the Palm Jumeirah, the manmade 'palm island' where David Beckham and Brad Pitt are said to have bought luxury pads. But after a persistent water . leak, the owners of Princess Towers have shut down all of its eight . lifts - forcing residents to walk the equivalent of one-third of the way . up Ben Nevis - Britain's highest mountain - which stands at 4,408ft . tall. Emergency repairs . are ongoing after the problems began last week - leaving penthouse . owners who paid £2millio plus for their flats forced to take the stairs. Rooms with a view: All eight lifts in the Princess Tower, pictured centre with the domed roof, broke down after a hose pipe leak on the 96th floor . Flat owners have today been told that a . solitary 'service elevator' is available for 'limited' trips to the 50th . floor - but anyone living above that level will still have to walk . the rest of the way. Bosses at the skyscraper - owned by Tameer estates - say the flooding was caused by water from the 'fire protection system' and that a 'faulty fire hose' was to blame. Water from the hose got into the residents' lift shafts, flooding them and causing them to be shut down. One resident, who lives on the 78th floor, said: 'I came home after a hard day of work and was told I'd have to walk to my apartment on the 78th floor. 'I truly couldn't believe it - there was no way I was walking all that distance so I just booked myself into a hotel.' The 47-year-old, who left the UK two years ago to take a job in Dubai, added: 'They need to get this fixed pronto - I can't afford a hotel every night.' Quite a climb: The startling view from the 85th floor of the Princess Tower in Dubai Marina gives an idea the stair climb faced by residents after the building's lifts broke down . An email sent by the skyscrapers owners' association, called Kingfield Owners Association, said: 'The serious leak occurred from a fire hose reel located on the 96th floor and although there are strong indications as to the cause of the leak, all associated contractors, insurance loss adjusters and building design consultants are completing their investigations and reports into the incident at this time. 'Once we have received the conclusions we will advise all residents of the findings forthwith. 'We ask that all residents continue to be vigilant with taps/hand sprays in their apartments, as we all know that the implications to the building systems can be quite severe in the event of water leaks.' In the meantime, parts from Kone Elevators in Finland are being flown in before repairs can be made. A spokesman for Kone Elevators said: 'We have had engineers on site 24-hours a day since the water leak occurred.'","Luxurious Princess Tower in Dubai stands at 1,355ft tall and has 107 floors .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A South Korean soldier who went on the run after allegedly killing five colleagues has been captured after shooting himself in hs military officials said today. A Defence Ministry spokesman said the 22-year-old sergeant, identified only by his surname Yim, shot himself in the side of his abdomen but failed to kill himself. He said Yim has been taken to a nearby hospital. A massive manhunt was launched for Yim after authorities said he killed five comrades and injured seven others near the North Korean border on Saturday night before fleeing his frontline army unit with his standard issue K2 assault rifle. Decoy: A stand-in poses as the rogue South Korean soldier who killed five comrades then shot himself . Trick: The ploy was used because the fugitive, who allegedly killed five colleagues and wounded several more before going on the run, needed quick medical treatment, said a Defence Ministry official . Pictured: The conscript soldier travels to a hospital after shooting himself . A platoon leader was wounded trying to approach the man, named only as Yim, after he threw grenades . Troops had surrounded Yim in a forest about four miles from the border outpost and threw him a mobile phone so he could talk to his father . Yesterday, he fired on the troops chasing him, injuring a platoon leader. Today, officials said a South Korean soldier was wounded by suspected friendly fire.

A Defence Ministry spokesman said two of the wounded were in a serious condition, but added that all three were expected to survive (pictured, soldiers from Yim's outpost) 'Due . to a shortage of troops, even some soldiers on the list of special . attention had to be on border guard, which requires soldiers to be . heavily armed. Needless to say, the military needs to come up with . remedial measures to this problem,' the Korea Times said in an . editorial. Hundreds of . thousands of troops from the rival Koreas are squared off along the . world's most heavily armed border. The Korean Peninsula is still . technically in a state of war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an . armistice, not a peace treaty. Shooting . rampages against fellow soldiers happen occasionally. South Korea's . military maintains a conscription system requiring all able-bodied men . to serve about two years because of the North Korean threat. In . 2011, a 19-year-old marine corporal went on a shooting rampage at a . Gwanghwa Island base, just south of the maritime border with North . Korea.

"By . Alex Ballard . Energy firm Npower has been accused of issuing demands to customers through an invented firm of debt collectors. The German-owned company, which has seen complaints against it double from December 2013 to March 2014, has reportedly sent customers in arrears threatening letters from a debt-collection agency called Collections Direct. The letters which have the name Collections Direct at the top, threaten recipients with court action and bailiffs. But at the bottom of the letter it states that Collections Direct is a trading name of npower. Bottom of the league: Npower has suffered the double whammy of falling to the bottom of a customer complaints league while also being accused of sending out letters from a made-up debt collection agency . The Daily Mirror reports that one example begins 'Final Demand' before stating 'It's a legal requirement to send you notice of an intended court summons before it's issued'. Npower insists that the firm does exist in its own right, and that it is used as a last resort. A spokesman said:'We use these letters after we have made 4 attempts to communicate with the customer, three of them using the npower logo and letterhead - the other by phone. 'The purpose of this letter, with a different name, is to make sure the customer knows that the process has reached an escalated stage, when we or an external agency will be pursuing the matter through legal action. 'However, we are still clear about npower being the sender of the letter and continue to offer help and further time for payment. While our letters are already fully compliant, we are looking at their content.' But the controversy will be damaging for the supplier, especially given that it comes as Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland revealed that almost twice as many complaints were made about npower in January to March this year, compared to the last three months of 2013. The latest complaints league table released by the consumer charity sees npower firmly at rock bottom in sixth place, with 592.4 per every 100,000 customers in January to March 2014, or one complaint for every 168.8. The firm said that a system switchover has precipitated a host of issues for consumers, and claim that other power suppliers will encounter a similar issue when changing their systems. Scottish Power sits just above them in fifth, but, worryingly, Citizens Advice also said that complaints about all suppliers have increased. Changeover: Npower say switchover to a new system has led to the large increase in customer complaints . Citizens Advice Chief Executive Gillian Guy said: 'The knock-on effect of poor billing systems can turn household budgets upside down. Many people do not have the spare cash to cover the cost of a large bill that suddenly lands on their doorstep. 'A rise in complaints about all suppliers is concerning. Suppliers won’t win the trust of customers back unless they show they understand what consumers need, recognise the financial pressures many people are under and are able to sort out problems quickly. 'This is something that all suppliers can act on now.' Notorious payday lender Wonga was ordered to pay £2.6million in . compensation after sending letters threatening legal action from made-up . law firms to customers in arrears. After conducting an investigation into the practice, the Financial Conduct Authority reported that the firm wrote to 45,000 customers . who had fallen into arrears posing as 'Chainey, D’Amato & Shannon' and 'Barker and Lowe Legal Recoveries'. Subsequent investigations found that the names were taken from staff working at Wonga. Claims . then emerged accusing the official Student Loans Company of using . similar tactics, with warnings being sent to graduates by firm ‘Smith . Lawson and Company’. High-street banks have also been implicated, with Royal Bank of . Scotland and its NatWest arm, along with HSBC, Lloyds and Nat West all . allegedly sending out letters from what appeared to be independent . solicitors when actually they are from the firms themselves.","Energy firm accused of following in footsteps of Wonga and the Student Loans Company .
