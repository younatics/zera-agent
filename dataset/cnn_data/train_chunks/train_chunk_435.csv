"A federal jury on Monday found a friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty of obstructing the investigation into the 2013 attack. The jury found Azamat Tazhayakov guilty of obstructing justice and conspiring to obstruct justice, in connection with the removal of a backpack with potential evidence from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombings. Jurors indicated in a verdict questionnaire that they didn't believe a separate allegation -- involving the removal of a laptop computer from the same dorm room -- amounted to obstruction or conspiracy. But his attorneys said they'll appeal the verdict, maintaining that a different defendant was the one who removed the backpack and put it into a garbage bin, and that the jury was under pressure by a community upset by the bombings to find Tazhayakov guilty. ""He never took a backpack out of the dormitory. ... We will certainly push that the evidence, and my client's intent did not match up with the actions of the case,"" Tazhayakov attorney Mathew Myers told reporters Monday. Sentencing for Tazhayakov, who could get up to 25 years in prison, is scheduled for October. The verdict came in the first trial related to the April 15, 2013, bombings that killed three people and injured more than 200 others. Tazhayakov's mother wept loudly in court when the verdict was read. Tazhayakov spoke briefly to his parents before he was escorted out of the courtroom. Prosecutors accused Tazhayakov and his roommate, fellow Kazakh national Dias Kadyrbayev, of trying to protect Tsarnaev three days after the bombings by removing a backpack and a laptop from Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, which Tazhayakov also attended. Prosecutors alleged that Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov took the laptop to their apartment, and that Kadyrbayev, with Tazhayakov's knowledge, tossed the backpack in a trash bin. Authorities eventually found the backpack -- containing Vaseline, a thumb drive and fireworks -- in a landfill. Kadyrbayev is awaiting trial on the same charges and has pleaded not guilty. Another friend, Robel Phillipos, pleaded not guilty to making false statements. None of Tsarnaev's friends is accused in the bomb plot itself. Prosecutors: Friends knew suspects' identities before public . Prosecutors told jurors Tazhayakov knew the identity of the suspected bombers -- Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- before the public found out, allegedly texting Kadyrbayev, ""i think they got his brother,"" hours before the public knew their names or their relationship to one another. The friends recognized the Tsarnaev brothers after authorities released video and still photos asking for the public's helping finding the two men, prosecutors said. Kadyrbayev told his friends that he believed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ""used the Vaseline 'to make bombs,' or words to that effect,"" an indictment against him reads. The government said Tsarnaev texted Kadyrbayev after the bombings and told him he could go to his dorm room and take what he wanted. Kadyrbayev showed that text to Tazhayakov, the government alleged. Authorities alleged that the friends picked up the backpack and the laptop from Tsarnaev's dorm room on April 18, 2013,  shortly before Tsarnaev was taken into custody. The FBI interviewed the friends as part of the bombing investigation, and lawyers for Tazhayakov said he did everything he could to help the probe when he spoke with investigators. Based on that information, authorities found Tsarnaev's backpack in the landfill, his attorneys said. Juror: Friends were 'getting rid of evidence' Daniel Antonino, one of the jurors in Tazhayakov's case, said the panel found him guilty of obstruction because ""the backpack was simply taken and discarded like they were getting rid of evidence."" ""They just threw it in the trash, so that's obstructing justice. Just taking it from the dorm room, we felt, was obstructing justice,"" Antonino said. Antonino said the jury didn't feel the same way about the laptop, because ""they didn't destroy it,"" and because jurors felt the friends saw the laptop as something they should take for its potential monetary value. Antonino cited Tsarnaev's alleged text to Kadyrbayev, inviting him to take what he wanted. Myers, Tazhayakov's attorney, said his client was being unfairly punished for what Kadyrbayev is alleged to have done. The only thing Tazhayakov took from Tsarnaev's room, Myers said, was a pair of headphones that rightfully belonged to him. ""I understand we've spoken about pronouns in this case: 'They did this, they did that.' (But) my client did not leave that dorm room with a backpack,"" Myers said. ""He can only control what people do to a certain extent. ... 'They' did not do anything. ""Dias Kadyrbayev went and took that backpack to a Dumpster. My client wasn't part of that. How a jury claims that my client had intent to do that with Dias, I guess, is a misconstruing of the plain evidence."" Myers said his team also would object to the court's verdict questionnaire, which asked for both charges whether Tazhayakov should be found guilty because of the backpack, the laptop or both. Myers said the jurors might have thought that saying no to the laptop was significant -- perhaps thinking they were giving Tazhayakov a break -- when in fact it did no such thing. ""We knew that could be misleading to the jury,"" Myers said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev awaits trial, having pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges tied to the bombing and the subsequent pursuit of him and his brother, Tamerlan. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with police days after the bombing. Boston bombing suspect's lawyers: We want trial moved away, to Washington .

"Two people were arrested Thursday evening after police said they snatched some of the nearly 15.23 million Hong Kong dollars that spilled from a money transport van onto a street on Christmas Eve. A 43-year-old man was arrested in Kowloon and a 36-year-old woman was taken into custody in Tseung Kwan O, police said. They are accused of stealing bank notes off the street and hiding the money in their homes. Authorities said 29 people have voluntarily handed over the money resulting in HK$5.7 million being returned. Those that voluntarily returned the money likely will not face charges, police said. It was a wild scene as last-minute shoppers in Hong Kong were treated to a Christmas Eve cash grab when the bills spilled from a money transport van into the street. Passing motorists and pedestrians were caught on camera helping themselves to banknotes scattered in Gloucester Road in the city's Wan Chai district at around lunchtime, before police arrived to secure the loot and disperse the opportunists. Three cash boxes had fallen from the van, resulting in the loss of an estimated 15.23 million Hong Kong dollars (nearly $2 million U.S.), police said Thursday. A statement from the security company that operates the cash transport van, G4S, said ""the majority"" of the money had been recovered from the scene. ""G4S vehicles have in place a number of systems to prevent such occurrences and G4S has commenced an immediate investigation into the causes of the incident,"" the statement said. ""We will take urgent steps to prevent any similar cases happening again in the future.""","The people arrested hid money in their homes, authorities say .

"(CNN)Pope Francis donned a slicker to conduct an outdoor Mass for hundreds of thousands who gathered Saturday morning in the Philippines despite stormy weather. The Mass in Tacloban was shortened because of an approaching typhoon that had sustained winds of 80 mph and higher gusts. A throng gathered at the Tacloban airport to greet the Pope when he arrived at about 9 a.m. local time (8 p.m. ET.) The Mass began nearby about half an hour after he landed. Wind rustled the hood on the pontiff's slicker as he spoke to a crowd clad in raincoats. Tacloban is still recovering from the 2013 disaster of Super Typhoon Haiyan, described as perhaps the strongest storm ever recorded with 195 mph sustained winds that killed 6,300 people nationwide. Typhoon Mekkhala was upgraded from a tropical storm and should make landfall in the Philippines at about noon, about an hour after the Mass concluded, just northeast of Tacloban, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. The forecast track has shifted slightly northward with the center of the storm expected to pass north of Tacloban. Another typhoon was headed for the same general area in the Philippines early Saturday, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said. Typhoon Mekkhala, which is called Typhoon Amang in the Philippines, was arriving on the island of eastern Samar -- a site about 50 miles from where the Pope was in Tacloban. Just two weeks ago, a tropical storm struck Tacloban and surrounding area, causing a commercial passenger plane to slide off the runway while landing at the Tacloban airport, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Tropical Storm Jiangmi, renamed Seniang in the Philippines, killed 54 people in landslides and flash floods in that region, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported. During the Pope's visit to Tacloban, he will have lunch with survivors of the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan, renamed Typhoon Yolanda in that country. That typhoon displaced 918,000 families nationwide, the government says. Francis is also to bless the Pope Francis Centre for the Poor and will meet with clergy and more typhoon survivors in the cathedral in Palo. The Pope is expected to fly out of Tacloban at 5 p.m. Saturday (4 a.m. Saturday ET). ""At that point, they're still in the teeth of the storm. So not only is getting in a challenge, but also getting out,"" Miller said. The Pontiff is also scheduled to perform an outdoor Mass in Manila on Sunday before millions of Filipinos, Miller said. By then, the storm should weaken to a tropical depression, and its center should be about 109 miles south of the Pope, Miller said. Still, the storm is capable of delivering its heaviest rainfall at that distance, and Manila could face gusty winds and significant rain during the Mass, Miller added. The Pope's trip to Asian isles began Tuesday in Sri Lanka, and he landed in the Philippines on Friday. On Friday, Francis met with President Benigno Aquino, and the Pontiff urged the political leader to reject corruption and promote ""honesty, integrity and commitment to the common good,"" the Vatican said. He also spoke of ""the moral imperative of ensuring social justice and respect for human dignity,"" according to a copy of his remarks provided by the Vatican. ""Here in the Philippines, countless families are still suffering from the effects of natural disasters. The economic situation has caused families to be separated by migration and the search for employment, and financial problems strain many households. While all too many people live in dire poverty, others are caught up in materialism and lifestyles which are destructive of family life and the most basic demands of Christian morality,"" the Pope said in other remarks. The Pope will end his tour Monday, when he will leave Manila for Rome.","Pope Francis celebrates outdoor Mass in stormy weather .

"For mobile users who text with friends via Facebook, it's almost time to download the social-media giant's dedicated app for doing so, or lose the ability. Facebook says that, for the next few days, it will be notifying people that if they want to continue sending mobile message, they'll need to download the Messenger app. ""As we've said, our goal is to focus development efforts on making Messenger the best mobile messaging experience possible and avoid the confusion of having separate Facebook mobile messaging experiences,"" a Facebook spokeswoman said Tuesday in a written statement. ""Messenger is used by more than 200 million people every month, and we'll keep working to make it an even more engaging way to connect with people."" In April, Facebook announced the change was coming. It has been rolled out to Android and iOS users in parts of Europe and elsewhere since then, and is now coming to the United States. In November, after Facebook launched Messenger 3.0, the company discontinued messaging in the core Facebook app for people who already had Messenger. The good news for people still using just the Facebook app is that they'll be able to message friends in much the same way they do now. Once both apps are installed, tapping the ""message"" icon on the Facebook app will simply send the user to Messenger. They'll be able to return via a ""return to Facebook"" icon. The popularity of apps like Messenger and WhatsApp, which Facebook purchased in February, are helping change the rules for texting. Wireless plans that charge for texting are becoming a thing of the past in the United States, though they remain the norm in places like India, South America and Africa, where WhatsApp has become a popular, nearly free alternative.

"Residents of this sleepy Turkish border town breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday. For the first time in a week, there were no explosions, bullets or bombs coming from the Syrian side of the border. The lull led some locals to gloat. Read more: Blasts may have struck prison of torture in Syria . ""You're late,"" announced the owner of a tea shop, as a van full of foreign journalists pulled up to his business, 20 meters from the border fence. But worry was still in the air. ""It's quiet today,"" said a grizzled Turkish man sipping a glass of tea.  ""I hope that $*&# guy running that country doesn't do something #*&$ today,"" he cursed. Fighting first erupted in the area on November 8, when Syrian rebels mounted an assault on Syrian government forces in the neighboring Syrian town of Ras Al Ain.  Ras Al Ain, Syria, and Ceylanpinar, Turkey, are effectively one town, separated by a fence and a parallel line of railroad tracks. Read more: After the election, a new push on Syria . The next day, rebels claimed victory. They raised the opposition flag triumphantly over Ras Al Ain, despite the fact that their offensive had sent thousands of terrified residents streaming across the border to Turkey for safety. Those refugee numbers swelled when Syrian regime forces struck back, pounding Ras Al Ain with artillery, airstrikes and bombardments with ""barrel bombs"" hurled out of hovering helicopters. As Ras Al Ain shook and shuddered, Turkish soldiers and ambulances waited at the nearby border gate, collecting scores of Syrians who arrived wounded, and rushing them to nearby hospitals. Locals said Turkish authorities parked lines of railroad cars on the tracks between the two towns in an effort to protect Ceylanpinar from shrapnel and errant bullets.  But the Turkish government said at least a half dozen Turks were wounded during the week of fighting. On Wednesday, Turkey's defense minister issued a warning to Syria. Read more: Over 37,000 have died in Syria's civil war, opposition group says . ""We will respond to Syrian planes or helicopters that violate our borders,"" said Ismet Yilmaz.  ""Syria has been given a note of protest.  Our citizens, especially residents of the (border) regions, should stay calm.  Our armed forces are on duty full time and the troops on the ground have been authorized to intervene immediately when necessary."" Whether or not Damascus heeded Ankara's warning is not clear.  But on Thursday, after being shuttered for days, shops were once again open in downtown Ceylanpinar. Mehmet Saitavci, a community leader and the owner of a stationery shop, pointed out businesses that had windows shattered by the force of the Syrian airstrikes. ""Of course we were afraid,"" he said. ""Jets flew overhead, there were bombardments, the children were terrified.  We had to close the schools for their safety!"" Now, houses were packed full of refugees. An officer from the local Zabita, a municipal police force, said he was hosting 30 Syrian refugees in his home. Volunteers at a nearby municipal building distributed yogurt, beans and bread to families, while also hosting scores of refugees. These frightened Syrians said Ras Al Ain had been a safe haven until last week's rebel attack. Read more: France, U.S. stand behind new opposition alliance as Syria remains defiant . ""From the beginning of the revolution, refugees came from all across Syria to Ras Al Ain because it was safe,"" said Rashid Mohammed, a Kurdish farmer who was living in the municipal building with 60 of his relatives.  He said seven of his cousins were killed by government helicopter attacks. ""We are angry at both of them (the rebels and the government), because the rebels entered Ras Al Ain and because the regime bombed us with its aircraft,"" Mohammed said.  ""Most of the Kurds want neither the rebels nor the regime."" The refugee farmer reflected the ambivalence many members of Syria's ethnic Kurdish minority have had toward Syria's grinding conflict. Since the start of the uprising 19 months ago, various Kurdish political parties have resisted joining Syrian opposition groups, which are dominated by Arabs. Last summer, a Kurdish militia closely affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, assumed control over a number of predominantly Kurdish towns along the border with Turkey.  The power grab triggered alarm bells in Turkey, which has fought a 30-year war against PKK guerillas. Read more: As U.N. falters, Syria's conflict threatens regional stability . Roughly half of Ras Al Ain's population is said to be Kurdish.  On Wednesday, an umbrella group of Kurdish political parties issued a public declaration, demanding that all armed groups abandon the border town.  It was a warning primarily to the Free Syrian Army rebels, who now patrol Ras Al Ain in pickup trucks jerry-rigged with heavy machine guns. ""The FSA has to know that their enemy is not in Ras Al Ain and in other Kurdish areas.  Their enemy is in Aleppo and Damascus, so why don't you go there to attack your real enemy?"" said Omar Aloush, a top official in the Kurdish Democratic Union Party, the Syrian wing of the PKK. Speaking by phone from the Kurdish-controlled Syrian town of Qoubani, Aloush said his Kurdish faction would not use force to push Syrian rebel groups out of Ras Al Ain.  But he warned that his movement could withhold food and other supplies to put pressure on the rebels. The threats were met with defiance by a rebel media activist in Ras Al Ain. ""We don't care if the Kurds say you have to leave,"" said Yalmaz Basha of the FSA.  ""All Syrians have to sacrifice, even the Kurds, because they are part of the Syrian people."" The simmering tensions between Kurdish militiamen and the FSA have exploded in deadly violence within the past month in the embattled northern city of Aleppo. They also underscore the difficulties foreign powers face trying to unify Syria's opposition, while trying to hasten the downfall of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. On Friday, the Turkish government once again denounced the Syrian regime, claiming it had no legitimacy. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu then announced his government would be recognizing a newly formed Western-backed opposition movement known as the National Coalition Forces of the Syrian Revolution as ""the legitimate representative of the Syrian people."" But Turkey has failed to deter the Syrian military from carrying out operations within sight of the Turkish border. On Friday, Syrian and Turkish witnesses told CNN they saw Syrian government aircraft bombing targets near the Bab el Hawa border get between the two countries.","Syrian fight overflows to Turkish town of Ceylanpinar .

"Hong Kong (CNN)The face of Hong Kong's chief executive covers the toilet paper and China's leader lingers next to you in the shower. Safe to say -- it's not your average hotel. Tucked away in an apartment building on a quiet side street of Hong Kong's busy Causeway Bay district, this small hotel is a shrine to the Umbrella Revolution. Freelance translator Stephen Thompson rented the apartment in early December, in the same week that police began clearing out the city's pro-democracy protest sites. ""I literally got the keys and then the next day I went down to Admiralty (the main protest site) and the police were coming and I just grabbed as much as I could,"" says Thompson. Posters, artwork and memorabilia from all three main protest sites now plaster every inch of the 600 square foot abode. Rows of construction helmets are mounted neatly on the wall, gas masks hang like ornaments around a door frame, newspaper clippings wallpaper the kitchen and a yellow umbrella serves a partial curtain, shielding the living room from the sun. ""I had the idea at first of an exhibition,"" Thompson says, ""and then when they (police) gave me the tents I thought, well, I'll put the tents in here too."" And the idea for Occupy Central Hotel was born. For as little as HK$78 ($10) per night, guests can pay via a listing on Airbnb to sleep in an original occupy tent. The two-bedroom apartment accommodates a total of eight, Thompson says, but five is the most he's rented at once. Each tent is adorned with a name relating to the movement, such as ""Freedom House"" and ""Foreign Force HQ."" Nicholas Watmough, 26, followed the Hong Kong protests from his hometown of Manchester, England, and recently extended his visit at the hotel. ""I had a look online. There are cheaper places to stay, but I thought this would just be more interesting. It's an experience worth having and it's a cause worth supporting,"" says Watmough. Visitors from Ukraine, France, and Mexico round out some of the hotel's other recent occupants. Thompson says he has also hosted guests from mainland China, but only after they sent him messages saying they opposed Communist rule. Originally from London, Thompson describes himself as a ""white-skinned Chinese dissident."" A fluent Mandarin speaker and writer, he spent three decades in and out of China before the government threatened to revoke his visa for writing politically critical articles. He has been living in Hong Kong for eight years now -- and hoping to gain permanent residency soon. ""I feel Hong Kong is a kind of bubble of freedom and human rights in China,"" he says, which is why he found the 11-week-long, pro-democracy demonstrations so inspirational. Victor Gaume, 29, watched the Occupy movement with interest from afar. He says the Chinese university where he teaches French and history forbade him to come to Hong Kong to see the protests in person, which is why he is now staying at the hotel. ""It's always good to have people like Stephen who keep the memory,"" Gaume says. ""In China, students don't know what happened in (the Tiananmen Square incident in) 1989, because all the memories have been deleted."" Preserving the memory and keeping the democracy movement alive is something the 50-year-old Thompson says he is passionate about. However, the Hong Kong Home Affairs Department requires anyone running a guesthouse to apply for a special permit from the Office of the Licensing Authority -- something Thompson says he doesn't need to do, because he is selective about who he allows to stay. Despite questions over the legality of his venture, Thompson says he hopes to eventually open up two more Occupy-themed hotels - one for each of the main protest sites. Until then, pro-democracy supporters can continue reliving the protests in a tiny Causeway Bay apartment - having their own movement against Hong Kong's Chief Executive CY Leung, one flush at a time.","Entrepreneur opened up the small hotel using memorabilia from Hong Kong's Occupy Central protests .

"The United States has increased its military presence in Iraq, ordering 300 more troops to the violence-ravaged nation, the Pentagon announced Monday. ISIS militants have ""continued to pose a legitimate threat to Baghdad and its environs,"" a U.S. official told CNN. ""We have seen them reinforce themselves around Baghdad enough to convince us more troops was the prudent thing to do."" The new troops, 200 of whom arrived Sunday and Monday, will provide security for the U.S. Embassy, the Baghdad airport and other facilities in Iraq, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. The deployment includes ""a detachment of helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles, which will bolster airfield and travel route security,"" Kirby said in a written statement. The airport is in western Baghdad about 12 miles (20 kilometers) by helicopter from the embassy in the capital's fortified Green Zone. The 300 troops are in addition to 300 U.S. advisers who will help train Iraq's security forces. They will bring the total of American forces in Iraq to about 800 troops. Revered Shiite shrine attacked . On Monday, Three mortar rounds hit the outer gate of a Shiite holy site in Samarra, killing one person and wounding 14, a spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said. Al-Iraqiya, a state-run television network, reported that the Iraqi air force demolished the site where the mortars were fired. The Al-Askariya mosque was heavily damaged by militants in February 2006. That attack triggered retaliatory attacks against Sunnis, and touched off the sectarian fighting that nearly tore the country apart. The mosque houses the Imam Ali al-Hadi and Imam Hassan al-Askari shrine, one of the holiest sites for Shiite Muslims. Samarra is about  80 miles (129 kilometers) north of Baghdad. The death was one of 1,873 in June due to violence, according to the Interior Ministry, a figure that includes 355 Iraqi soldiers and 130 police officers. That is a dramatic increase from the May death toll of 994 given by the United Nations and health officials in restive Anbar province. The U.N. said 144 of the people killed in May were civilian police officers. ISIS declares caliphate . Emboldened by a weakened Iraqi government that is struggling to stop their murderous advance, extremists of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria declared over the weekend that they have set up a caliphate spanning large areas of the two countries. In a newly released audio message and written statement, purportedly from the official spokesman of ISIS, the group called on Muslims to swear allegiance to the caliphate, which means Islamic state. The group said in the message Sunday, which CNN couldn't independently confirm, that its flag now flies from Aleppo province in northwestern Syria to Diyala province in eastern Iraq. It announced that it was changing its name to just the ""Islamic State."" The ISIS statement was just one of the many developments in the fast-moving situation in Iraq over the weekend. How ISIS is overshadowing al Qaeda . Who controls Tikrit? Iraq's government touted its military offensive to recapture Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists, with some officials taking to state-run television over the weekend to declare that the army had defeated ISIS. But residents in the city nestled along the Tigris River, about 140 kilometers (about 87 miles) northwest of Baghdad, gave a different account Sunday. ""There are no Iraqi troops here,"" one woman told CNN by telephone from Tikrit. The only presence, at least in her neighborhood, is the ""Islamic state,"" she said, referring to ISIS. The woman, who asked not to be identified over concerns for her safety, said she could hear the sounds of a fierce battle, in the form of shelling, being carried out by both sides. Heavy shelling . A video posted on YouTube appears to support her assertion. A man gives a tour of the city to show, he says, that there were no Iraqi security forces on the streets on Saturday, the day Iraqi forces said they launched the offensive. In the video, the man can be heard repeatedly saying ""June 28, 2014,"" presumably to offer evidence of the date. He says ""Thank God, Tikrit is safe and still in the hand of tribesmen and not troops of 'al-Haliki,' "" a derogatory reference to al-Maliki that refers to his death. Witnesses inside and outside Tikrit said Iraqi forces were heavily shelling the city. Two days ago, the air force dropped leaflets from helicopters, demanding that residents leave the city ""for their safety."" A large number of people have fled Tikrit for smaller villages to the north, according to witnesses, who say Iraqi forces are battling ISIS on the southern edge of the city. State-run Iraqi TV showed video footage of large plumes of black smoke billowing from the city. Another video, released by the Ministry of Defense, showed Iraqi troops and convoys loaded with heavy weapons driving through the desert. The video was titled ""cleansing the road between Samarra and Tikrit."" CNN couldn't independently confirm the different claims. Russian jets arrive . Five Russian Sukhoi fighter jets have arrived in Iraq, the first of 25 warplanes expected to be delivered under a contract between Moscow and Baghdad, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense said in a statement. A video the ministry released Monday showed the jets, with wings unattached, being pulled toward hangars. ""These jet fighters will contribute to increase the combat capability of the air force and the rest of the armed forces in eliminating terrorism,"" the ministry said. The Su-25 has been in service for more than three decades and was part of the Iraqi air force under Saddam Hussein's regime. The announcement follows a comment by al-Maliki that recent militant advances might have been avoided if Iraq had proper air power in the form of fighter jets that Iraq has been trying to get from the United States. ""I'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract"" with the United States, al-Maliki told the BBC in the interview last week, which was released Friday. Iraq has now turned to Russia and Belarus to buy fighter jets, he said. ""God willing, within one week, this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists' dens,"" he said. U.S. officials were quick to reject al-Maliki's complaints. U.S. fighter jets have not been slow in coming, Kirby said. The first two promised F-16s ""weren't expected to be delivered until the fall, which is still months away,"" Kirby said. ""And we were in the process of working towards that delivery."" The advance of the al Qaeda splinter group ""couldn't have been stemmed through the use of two particular fighter planes,"" he said. Al-Maliki's statements about the need for air support came as American and Arab diplomats told CNN that the United States is unlikely to undertake any military strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and its allied fighters before a new government is formed in Iraq. Mass graves reported . Human Rights Watch has reported the discovery in Tikrit of two mass graves believed to contain the bodies of Iraqi soldiers, police and civilians killed by ISIS and its militant allies. In addition to the alleged executions in Tikrit, reports continue to emerge of atrocities committed by both sides. Human Rights Watch, citing displaced residents and local activists and journalists, said Saturday that ISIS fighters kidnapped at least 40 Shiite Turkmens, dynamited four Shiite places of worship and ransacked homes and farms in two villages just outside Mosul. The few Sunni villagers who remained in Guba and Shireekhan told those who fled that at least some of the kidnapped Turkmens had been killed, the rights group said. However, they had not seen bodies and could not give more information. ISIS destroyed seven Shiite places of worship in the predominantly Shiite Turkmen city of Tal Afar, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Mosul, earlier in the week, Human Rights Watch added, citing local sources. But the allegations of atrocities are not just limited to ISIS. Amnesty International has said it has gathered evidence pointing to a pattern of ""extrajudicial executions"" of Sunni detainees by government forces and Shiite militias in Tal Afar, Mosul and Baquba.

"A convoy of British diplomats made it safely into Tunisia from Libya despite an attack on its vehicles Sunday, British officials said. ""There was an attempted carjacking of a British Embassy convoy this morning,"" UK Ambassador Michael Aron said in a Twitter posting Sunday.  ""Shots were fired at our vehicles but all safe."" Several Western embassies, including those of Britain and the United States, were evacuated over the weekend as heavy militia violence raged in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The German government renewed its ""urgent call for citizens to leave Libya"" because of the dangers of kidnappings and fighting. Britain warned its citizens against all travel to Libya and asked that any of them in the country ""leave now"" by commercial means, which is made difficult by the limited flights out of the main airport. 'Libya is reaching a critical stage' Fighting in Tripoli and Benghazi is the worst seen since the revolution that overthrew the regime of Moammar Gadhafi nearly three years ago. The central government has been outgunned by increasingly powerful militias. Witnesses reported heavy shelling and fighting around the Tripoli international airport Sunday, which has been under attack by an alliance of powerful militias from the city of Misrata and Islamist militias. The fighters are trying to take it from militias from the city of Zintan, which have controlled it since the 2011 revolution. Dozens of people, including some women and children, died in fighting in Benghazi in recent days, according to the Libyan state news agency. Intense shelling continued Sunday, the reports said. Violence erupted in Benghazi last Monday when Islamist militias attacked military bases in the city. The Libyan Health Ministry said at least 32 people who were killed and 62 wounded were taken to the Benghazi medical center on Saturday and Sunday. The ministry counted at least 97 killed and 404 wounded in Tripoli over the past two weeks. The casualty numbers do not count those taken to smaller field hospitals. Envoys from the Arab League, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Malta, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States issued a joint statement Saturday calling for ""a ceasefire from all sides."" ""The situation in Libya is reaching a critical stage. We are deeply concerned about the ongoing violence across the country and its humanitarian consequences,"" the envoys said.  The statement called for ""a willingness to compromise"" by all sides in ""an inclusive political dialogue on the back of the ceasefire agreement."" U.N. 'should play a leading role' The United Nations ""should play a leading role in reaching a ceasefire in conjunction with the Libyan government and other internal partners, with the full support of the international envoys,"" the statement said. The U.N. and other international organizations and businesses temporarily evacuated staff from Libya earlier this month. The envoys also said Libya's recently elected Council of Representatives ""must have the opportunity to convene according to the time table set out in the law"" and ""carry out its tasks in a spirit of inclusiveness, moderation and in the interest of the country."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, at the U.S. Embassy in Paris meeting with the Turkish and Qatari foreign ministers Saturday, called upon various factions to engage in a political process, saying ""the current course of violence would only bring chaos."" Kerry added that due to the ""freewheeling militia violence that is taking place in Tripoli"" the U.S., along with other countries including Turkey, has ""suspended our current diplomatic activities at the Embassy."" 'Robust package of military forces' standing by . The U.S. evacuated its 150 personnel, including 80 U.S. Marines, from the embassy in Tripoli on Saturday. Their convoy drove across the border into Tunisia, U.S. officials confirm to CNN. U.S. officials stress operations have been ""temporarily suspended"" until ""the security situation on the ground improves."" The embassy will continue to operate from other locations.  A senior State Department official said some of the staff will be sent to other U.S. embassies in the region and others will return to Washington. U.S. President Barack Obama approved the State Department recommendation to temporarily relocate personnel because of the ""ongoing violence resulting from clashes between Libyan militias in the immediate vicinity"" of the embassy, a White House official said. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the United States is ""currently exploring options for a permanent return to Tripoli as soon as the security situation on the ground improves. In the interim, staff will operate from Washington and other posts in the region,"" Harf said in a statement. ""Securing our facilities and ensuring the safety of our personnel are top Department priorities, and we did not make this decision lightly. Security has to come first. Regrettably, we had to take this step because the location of our embassy is in very close proximity to intense fighting and ongoing violence between armed Libyan factions."" The Pentagon had a ""robust package of military forces"" in the vicinity but out of sight, ready to move in if the convoy of evacuees had come under attack. Two F-16s were on combat air patrol overhead, while a drone tracked the convoy to the border and a Navy destroyer watched from offshore in the Mediterranean, CNN learned. An ""airborne response force"" of several dozen Marines was on V-22 Osprey aircraft flying nearby, prepared to land and protect the Americans if they came under attack during the transit to the Tunisian border. The Pentagon had pressed for weeks to evacuate the embassy, especially after the Tripoli airport came under repeated militia attack, leaving Americans no way to get out via commercial air, the official said. The decision to use vehicles to drive the Americans across the border was seen as the best low-profile approach to conducting the evacuation rather than sending U.S. military helicopters and troops into Tripoli. This comes nearly two years after attacks on U.S. government facilities in the Libyan city of Benghazi. The assaults of September 11-12, 2012, left four Americans dead, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, and spawned political controversy in Washington. Republican lawmakers have claimed the Obama administration tried to mislead the public about the cause of the attacks and should have done more to prevent them. GOP critics say they plan to make Benghazi an issue for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, under whose watch the attacks occurred, should she decide to run for president.","British diplomats are safe after attack on evacuation convoy .

"As the bloody battles pushed up tragic death tolls on both sides, world powers held a flurry of diplomatic meetings Wednesday aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders as well as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, while several Middle Eastern nations worked to try to win Hamas' agreement for an Egyptian-led cease-fire. But perhaps the most powerful message came from a woman whose son's death played a role in sparking the current fighting. ""Your children and our children -- nobody should really go through what we're going through now,"" said Rachel Fraenkel, whose son Naftali was among three Jewish teens kidnapped and killed on the way home from school in the West Bank last month.  Israel blamed Hamas.  Later, a Palestinian teen was killed in what Israel calls a revenge attack. Israel has indicted an adult and two minors for the killing. The Fraenkels are American citizens.  Yishai Fraenkel, Naftali's uncle, works to bring Palestinians into Israel's high-tech sector. Rachel Fraenkel met with Kerry on Wednesday.  Afterward, speaking to media, she said, ""I just want to turn to Palestinian parents and say maybe you can stop Hamas from using you as human shields and your death as propaganda."" ""I promise the Palestinian parents: All we want is to live in peace and raise our children without threats of missiles or tunnels under our communities,"" noting that an Israeli kindergarten was struck by a rocket this week -- it was empty at the time. ""Maybe we can teach our children that we want to live in peace,"" she said. Some Palestinian parents visited her family after Naftali's death and they had very good conversations, she said.  ""I do know decent, good Palestinian people."" Israeli Jewish families also visited the family of Mohammed Abu Khedair, the Palestinian teen killed. Despite Fraenkel's sentiments, many Palestinian parents accuse Israel of carrying out a ""massacre"" -- and have called on Israelis to push the government to stop military action. ""Nobody is safe and nobody can flee anywhere because everywhere is targeted,"" said a mother of two who lives in the al-Remal neighborhood of Gaza City, as CNN reported Monday.  ""When we hear the shelling my kids will cry."" Death tolls jump . The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday 695 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting, including 166 children. More than 4,500 people have been wounded, the health officials said. It's unclear how many of the dead were civilians.  The United Nations estimates that more than 70% were. The Israeli military said 230 militants have been killed. Palestinians have disputed Israeli and American assertions that many of the deaths are due to people choosing to be part of human shields.  While Hamas leaders have encouraged people to do so, many Palestinians have told CNN they worried that if they followed Israeli warnings and fled their homes, they'd have nowhere safe to go. Three more Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday, bringing the total to 32 plus three civilians. Among the soldiers, three died from friendly fire. A Hamas mortar shell killed a foreign worker in Ashkelon on Wednesday, marking the third civilian death on the Israeli side. Hamas has said it is holding an Israeli soldier it captured in an ambush on an armored personnel carrier Sunday. Six other IDF soldiers died in the ambush. On Tuesday, the Israeli military released the soldier's name -- Sgt. Oren Shaul -- but said it was ""working to identify his body."" Israeli media reported that Shaul was missing and presumed dead. U.N. slams possible 'war crimes' ""There seems to be a strong possibility that international humanitarian law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Wednesday. ""I unequivocally reiterate to all actors in this conflict that civilians must not be targeted. It is imperative that Israel, Hamas and all Palestinian armed groups strictly abide by applicable norms of international humanitarian law and international human rights law,"" Pillay said. ""This entails applying the principles of distinction between civilians and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives; proportionality; and precautions in attack. Respect for the right to life of civilians, including children, should be a foremost consideration. Not abiding by these principles may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity."" Some Israeli officials rejected Pillay's statements about Israel. ""She would be better advised to seek credible first-hand information rather than making intolerably biased statements based on newspaper clippings,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said, according to The Jerusalem Post. He added that Pillay's ""embarrassingly shallow and populist affirmations ... do a huge disservice to actual human rights."" Also Wednesday, Ban announced he was ordering a review of incidents where rockets were placed at United Nations Relief and Works Agency schools. Ban ""expresses his outrage, and regret, at the placing of weapons in a UN-administered school,"" a written statement from the U.N. said. He demanded that militants stop endangering civilians by putting rockets at the schools. Tunnels found, ambulances hit . The Israeli military, meanwhile, said it hit more than 187 targets overnight, and most of them were in Shaja'ia. The Israel Defense Forces has warned residents of the neighborhood to flee multiple times and has accused Hamas of telling people to remain in their homes. An IDF force found another ""terror access shaft"" in Gaza on Wednesday, Israel said. Inside it were weapons, maps and IDF uniforms, ""all intended for the execution of terror attacks against Israel."" The IDF also ""attacked several militants emerging from a tunnel opening"" in southern Gaza, Israel said. ""Since the beginning of the ground operation, more than 60 access shafts leading to some 28 tunnels were uncovered."" The al-Wafa hospital, near hard-hit Shaja'ia, ""is a Hamas military compound,"" the Israel Defense Forces said Wednesday. At Israel's request, it was evacuated of patients and staff Tuesday, though Hamas gunmen remained, firing at Israeli forces, the IDF said. Israel confirmed the evacuation with a World Health Organization official, then struck the ""terror targets"" at the site, the IDF said. The Israeli military released video it said showed secondary explosions from stockpiled munitions when the hospital was hit. Palestinian ambulances have been shelled, Gazan medics have complained. On Wednesday, the IDF said militants used one to escape the Israeli military. The International Committee of the Red Cross prepared to go into Shaja'ia early Wednesday. The neighborhood is ""partially demolished,"" the ICRC said. Cease-fire possible? Kerry shuttled between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank on Wednesday. Abbas' Fatah party has long controlled the Palestinian government in the West Bank, while Hamas has controlled Gaza. The two groups, which have engaged in violent battles in the past, recently announced another effort at a joint government. Earlier Wednesday, Kerry met with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who was already on the ground calling for an end to the bloodshed in Gaza. Israel has publicly accepted Egypt's call for a cease-fire and condemned Hamas for not doing so. Hamas political leadership lives in Qatar, another country involved in efforts to achieve a cease-fire. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal said from Doha, Qatar, that Hamas' demand that Israel end an air, land and sea blockade of Gaza is their most important demand. ""Then we can negotiate,"" he said. Turkey and Kuwait are involved as well, a Hamas official told CNN. Can Kerry end the Gaza-Israel bloodshed?","U.N. Secretary-General calls for militants to stop placing rockets at schools .

"(CNN)From footfalls to climbing stairs, to opening doors, the cities of the future will look at ways of tapping energy from all the mechanical energy we expend going about our daily lives. When looking at the amount of kinetic energy produced in the average metro station at rush hour, or even on the dance floors of nightclubs, harvesting electricity from human activity makes sense. The technology that makes it possible -- the piezoelectric effect -- is more than 130 years old: in 1880, the brothers Jacques and Pierre Curie discovered that placing crystals under pressure produced an electric charge. Today, manufacturing technology has made it possible to place piezoelectric devices in the most unlikely places and one company, Pavegen, has developed power-generating systems for pavements, football fields and even school corridors. ""People walk up to 150 million footsteps in their lifetime,"" Pavegen CEO Laurence Kemball-Cook told CNN. ""When I was walking through a busy train station in London I thought what if we can convert the energy from every single person walking at the station into a meaningful amount of power."" The company's footfall harvesting technology -- a deflecting pad covered with the type of soft ground surface commonly found in playgrounds - can produce up to 7 watts of energy with each step. Collecting this energy, Kemball-Cook says, is enough to power lights and other small devices for minutes at a time from a mere one hundred or so footfalls. The technology is most effective in areas with high traffic, producing an efficient solution that matches supply with demand. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for instance, the company installed 200 kinetic tiles into a local football pitch in Morro da Mineira -- a favela plagued by blackouts. The Pavegen tiles work day and night alongside solar panels to power the lights for up to 10 hours on a full battery, creating the world's first ever people-powered football pitch. ""It's not only a way of inspiring future generations into energy savings but it shows we need different energy mixes,"" Kemball-Cook said. ""Some people walk 40,000 steps a day, so there's a lot of potential in those wasted footsteps. ""Most people go to a gym so why are we plugging in those treadmills? Why not have those self-powered to charge your cellphone? To power the aircon in the building? Use the energy in a new way?"" The company this year installed 36 tiles to create two people-powered dance floors at the 20th Essence Festival, placing digital screens in front of the dance floors to display the amount of energy produced during each dance off. Energy-harvesting technology has even been developed for miniature applications including self-powered contact lenses that use blinking as their power source. Much like Google glasses, the battery-free contact lenses could deliver information to a user that would be projected before a users' eyes as if it were thrown up on a screen. Despite the one-off niche applications, Pavegen has ambitious plans for the sector as a fully scalable renewables producer. Analysts estimate the energy harvesting industry could be worth as much $30 billion by 2018. Read more from Tomorrow Transformed: . NASA's plan for a floating city above Venus .

"Congress faces several big issues before beginning its August recess at the end of the week. While it appears lawmakers might get to a few things on the to-do list, other matters are likely to be left until they return in September. Here's what will and won't get done before the end of the week: . 1. Crisis on the border: Agencies responsible for dealing with the influx of youth migrants from Central America on the southern border could run out of money next month. But competing legislative proposals means it's highly unlikely a resolution will materialize before Friday. Senate Democrats are looking at a $2.7 billion plan to address the border crisis, while House Republicans are crafting a measure totaling less than $1 billion. President Barack Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion. The major sticking point overall is whether to change a 2008 law to make it easier to deport those streaming across the border from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Central American leaders to Obama: We're working on it . Most Republicans argue for the change in policy because it can take months or years to determine legal status under current law. They want to link any new money to a change in the 2008 law. Most Democrats oppose altering the law, saying doing so could lead to an unfair process that might short-change kids fleeing gangs and violence who want to stay in the United States legally. They want any new money to include no change in policy. But Democrats have sent mixed messages. Obama top administration officials say they are open to addressing the 2008 law, while Hispanic lawmakers and top leaders warn any major revisions are unacceptable. Poll: Border crisis impacts public opinion . House Republicans are expected as early as Monday to unveil details of legislation that would fund border and other related agencies through the end of September. They could vote by week's end. Speaker John Boehner says he wants the House to act but it's unclear if anything can pass. 2. A fix for veterans' health care: CNN uncovered troubling stories of delayed care for veterans, some of whom died. Allegations surfaced of secret waiting lists for patient care, mismanagement, and bonuses for executives who oversaw such dysfunction. Investigations were launched, the VA secretary resigned, and Congress stepped in. Veterans caught up in the bureaucratic mess who feared retaliation for speaking out prompted Congress to fast-track legislation to revise procedures at hospitals and provide more resources to address case backlogs. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, a independent who normally sides with Democrats, and his House Republican counterpart, Rep. Jeff Miller, announced a deal on a $17 billion pacage on Monday. Public outrage over the alarming VA shortcomings has lit a fire under Congress to ensure a final measure gets to Obama before week's end. On Friday, 115 House members wrote to Boehner demanding that Congress stay in session until it approves a bill on veterans care. Veterans waiting longer for cancer care . The Senate is expected to confirm Robert McDonald, a former CEO of Proctor & Gamble and a West Point graduate as the next VA secretary as early as Tuesday. 3. Highway fund running on empty: The highway trust fund, which pays for road and bridge repair carried out by the states, is about to run out of money. Funded by gasoline taxes, the account has been in trouble for years with prices at the pump steadily higher and people driving more fuel efficient cars and trucks. The sluggish economy also has cut down on fuel purchases. Less money going into the trust fund fund means hard choices. Raising the 18.4 cents per gallon gas tax is a non-starter, especially in an election year. So where will the money come from? Congress in the past has diverted billions in general tax revenues to shore up the trust fund, and that is what's on the table now. A short-term House bill would infuse the trust fund with $11 billion in new revenue. It is expected to pass the Senate this week. But that measure just means this emergency will arise again next May, when the balance gets low again. Without federal money, states will have to curtail -- and shut down, in some cases -- road projects. That's unappealing on both sides of the aisle since construction provides a lot of jobs and fuels economic growth in other ways. 5 ways the highway crisis could affect you . 4. House Republicans vs. Obama: The House is expected later this week to pass a resolution authorizing Boehner to sue Obama for exceeding his executive authority. Republicans are basing the case on Obama's decision last year to authorize a one-year delay in the Obamacare requirement that businesses provide health coverage. Although House Republicans voted to do the same thing, they maintain it's the job of Congress to change the laws, not the President's . ""This is also not about me vs. President Obama. This is about future Congresses and future presidents. There is a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch of our government. It is the judiciary branch's role to help resolve it,"" Boehner wrote on Monday in a USA Today opinion piece. House Democrats are using the case to raise money and make argument that the suit is merely a political move to rally the Republican base ahead of the midterms. There is a small contingent of House conservatives who want to impeach Obama, but Boehner has said multiple times that he disagrees with such a step. A CNN-ORC poll released last week shows that nearly two thirds of Americans oppose any move to impeach Obama. 5. Funding government agencies: The most basic function of Congress is its power of the purse. It decides annually how much each agency can spend. To date, the House has passed about half of the annual spending bills establishing budgets for these departments for the fiscal year starting October 1. But the Senate has not voted on one yet. Unless both pass some type of massive spending bill to cover everything at once before the end of September, there could be another federal shutdown. Remember last fall. Boehner has said he expects the House to approve a resolution extending current levels of funding through some time in December. When lawmakers return after Labor Day, there are about 10 days left in the legislative calendar for a deal to come together.","GOP, Dems push competing border plans, but policy change may be biggest obstacle .

"It's 7 a.m. in Tanauan, the Philippines, and the church bells are ringing for Sunday mass. It's May 2014 and I'm accompanying 11-year-old Jednel and his parents to the weekly service. Jednel is one of the children I have got to know through my work with children's charity Plan International. When Typhoon Haiyan wreaked havoc across the Philippines in November 2013, I was deployed to support the team. Jednel lives in a coastal village in Leyte, which was badly destroyed by the tsunami-like waves that followed the storm. Many of the people attending the church service lost family members and friends, many of whom are now buried in the mass grave outside on the main square. When the minister calls for prayers, the air is thick with sorrow. There is a common experience that, as an outsider, I cannot fully grasp. Everyone in here has sensed the risk of death. They have been so close to the end, but they have survived. Soon the air fills with a sense of power and energy. When the minister cracks a joke, laughter echoes out through the open doors. Now, having visited the Philippines three times over the past year (in November 2013, and then May and September, 2014), I truly believe the disaster recovery has come this far because of the remarkable resilience and spirit of the Filipino people. IMAGES: Before and After, six months on . Rush to rebuild . When I first arrived in Western Samar in November 2013, just three weeks after the typhoon, all I could see was piles of debris, reminiscent of apocalyptic destruction. Yet, in the middle of the rubble and burning waste, I could hear the sound of people hammering, already in the process of rebuilding their houses. Women were washing their clothes and hanging it between the few walls that were left of their homes. Children were running around in flip-flops looking for scrap metal and old glasses they could sell to help their families get food. I even heard people singing. A year later and a lot has happened; Jednel's school is being rebuilt, he is attending a temporary school, and plays with his friends on the weekend. The rubble and fallen trees have been cleared and the vegetation is lush and green. Shops have reopened and the streets are crowded with cars, bicycles and taxis, while the community is out in full force, selling fruit and sweets. Children can play freely on the beach and they are finally allowed to go swimming in the sea once again. Children among most vulnerable . Jednel has grown a great deal since last November. Now he is a confident, relaxed boy who welcomes me to the house of his great grandmother. He says he's still afraid of storms and bad weather, but the nightmares come more seldom. Plan International's priority is protecting children who are among those worst affected by a disaster, and among the most vulnerable after. After Haiyan, Plan set up ""Child Friendly Spaces,"" providing a safe space for 21,000 children to play, learn and get much-needed emotional support -- while nearly 10,000 parents, children and community members were trained on how to avoid violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. Over the past year, Plan has helped more than 40,000 children to return to school with its ""Back to School"" kits -- including bags, books and pens -- or by rebuilding classrooms, training teachers and supplying school equipment. Although we've come a long way from the devastating scenes my colleagues and I witnessed a year ago, work still remains. In Tacloban City, one of the areas worst hit by Typhoon Haiyan, Plan's ""Building Back Better"" project is working with the government and community members to help residents build a community that's better able to withstand the next powerful storm. As for Jednel, he now dreams of becoming a scientist and learning more about typhoons and climate change. We look out towards the calm ocean and I ask him what it's like to live in the Philippines, where a natural disaster never seems too far away. Jednel replies: ""This is my favorite place. It's like a freedom, where my family can live and be happy and proud."" For me, hearing his words is testament to the resilience of Jednel, his family and the Filipino community.","Spirit of Filipinos remains strong one year after typhoon made landfall November 8, 2013 .

"(CNN)A humpback whale has become tangled up in a synthetic line attached to a buoy off the coast of the island of Hawaii. Maritime officials are trying to find the right opportunity to unsnarl the roughly 45-foot-long mammal as it swims around the Big Island. ""We want it to come back to an area that is safe. It is not too easy to detangle a 40 ton animal,"" said Edward Lyman, the Large Whale Entanglement Response Coordinator in Hawaii for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The humpback was first spotted Friday. It has since been sighted several times by people as it moves around the island counterclockwise, dragging the red buoy with it. ""We know that these situations are not immediately life threatening, but the animal will eventually succumb to this if we don't rescue it,"" Lyman told CNN on Tuesday. Weather conditions and the whale's shifting location appear to have complicated the task. ""We are standing by waiting for certain things to come together,"" Lyman said. Whales regularly get caught up in lines around the Hawaiian Islands. ""In the past year, 13 large whales have been reported entangled in gear and we cut one free successfully maybe two,"" Lyman said. ""The second one, we weren't sure because the line didn't shed away."" He said the response network he runs manages to free on average two to four whales each year but doesn't always find them when they are reported.

"Nervous anticipation extends far beyond the racially charged powder keg of Ferguson, Missouri, over a grand jury decision on whether to indict a white police officer for fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager. The St. Louis suburb has simmered with anger since the day in August when 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot multiple times by Officer Darren Wilson. With the grand jury expected to deliver its decision any day, people worry that tensions could boil over -- not only in Ferguson, but at demonstrations in more than 30 cities from Boston to Los Angeles organized by a group called the Ferguson National Response Network, mostly for the day after the decision is announced. While most protests in Ferguson have been peaceful, some devolved into violence, especially in the nights immediately after the shooting. The imminent decision has renewed concerns over clashes between protesters and heavily armed law enforcement officers, especially if Wilson is not indicted. ""I, like so many other people, am on pins and needles,"" said the Rev. Alvin Herring, a Washington-based deputy director of the community organizing group PICO National Network. ""This case has resonated with a lot of people who are beginning to understand that the issue of police violence and lawlessness is an issue that, although for the moment is focused on Ferguson ... it is an issue that challenges the nation."" Though Herring expects to be in Ferguson after the announcement, he said members of the network's 3,000 multidenominational congregations around the country plan to participate in vigils and protests. The Ferguson National Response Network lists planned community responses to the grand jury decision in big cities such as Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Seattle. It's also planned public gatherings -- to be held the day of the announcement or the day after -- in smaller cities that include Portland, Oregon; New London, Connecticut; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Blacksburg, Virginia and Iowa City, Iowa. ""The faith community has been quite busy on issue of Ferguson,"" Herring said. ""It has been a challenging experience because many clergy have been looking for how they make the connection between the faith they celebrate on Sunday and the everyday cares, challenges and struggles that their people face the other six days of the week."" Police departments prepare . Throughout the country, law enforcement agencies have been busy with Ferguson. ""Many of my colleagues I've had an opportunity over the last few days to talk to around the country ... are preparing for whatever the outcome may happen to be,"" said Cedric Alexander, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives and public safety director for DeKalb County, Georgia. Alexander said law enforcement agencies in the Atlanta area, for instance, have ""working relationships with our community members and leaders"" and are preparing to mobilize should tensions erupt. ""There are many communities in which we really have to engage our communities and set some real parameters about how we're going to work together,"" Alexander said. Atlanta police spokeswoman Kim Jones said the department will respect the rights of demonstrators to peaceably assemble but will not ""tolerate those who violate our laws, destroy property or endanger lives."" ""We have met with, and are in discussion with, numerous law enforcement agencies throughout the metro Atlanta area to ensure our efforts are coordinated, and that we are maintaining the same level of readiness and vigilance,"" she said. In Texas, a Dallas police spokesman, Lt. Jose Garcia, said the city did not anticipate violent demonstrations following the grand jury decision. ""However, we have adequate resources in place to address any situation that may arise,"" he said. ""In addition to the resources, we work hard to develop and maintain strong relationships within our communities. We feel confident that together we can address such a situation if it arises."" Police officials would not reveal specific preparations. But CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and police officer, said federal agencies will likely be working with local police departments, particularly sharing information on agitators from the U.S. and abroad who typically move from state to state to stir problems at public demonstrations. And law enforcement agencies in cities such as New York and Washington have extensive experience dealing with protests. ""The Washington metro police have demonstrations in downtown Washington all the time,"" he said. ""It's not like they're not prepared or equipped. People will be on heightened alert. When the word goes out that the decision has been made, departments are going to be trying to at least be ready, to have their officers on standby to go to extended shifts and whatever might be necessary to prevent things from getting out of hand."" Unresolved tensions . When members of the United States Conference of Mayors met with police chiefs from around the country in Little Rock, Arkansas, last month, the situation in Ferguson was at the top of the agenda. Conference spokeswoman Elena Temple said the group has had internal discussions on how to react to the grand jury decision but will not make a statement on the case until the announcement. ""We don't know what's going to happen,"" she said. ""We're waiting like everybody else."" Outgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told the gathering of mayors and police chiefs that law enforcement had a responsibility to address tensions within communities. ""The events in Ferguson reminded us that we cannot and we must not allow tensions, which are present in so many neighborhoods across America, to go unresolved,"" Holder said. The Ferguson case, Holder said, underscored divisions between police and residents in many U.S. cities. ""When I traveled to Ferguson in the days after that incident, my pledge to the people of that community was that our nation's Department of Justice would remain focused on the challenges they faced, and the deep-seated issues and difficult conversations that the shooting brought to the surface, long after national headlines had faded,"" he said. Federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations, one into Brown's killing and the other into the local police department's overall track record with minorities. Free speech, worries about violence . Police will be on hand at protests to ensure freedom of expression -- without any criminal activity. PICO, on its website, says it opposes ""any militarized response against American citizens exercising our right to freely and peaceably assemble."" Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has called for protests to remain peaceful once the grand jury rules in Wilson's case but vowed to crack down on any ""ugliness."" Nixon made clear last week he's not anticipating violence, but wants to be ready for anything. ""This is America. People have a right to express their views and grievances, but they do not have the right to put their fellow citizens or their property at risk,"" he said. Many protesters, furious because they felt Brown's killing was an example of excessive force, clashed with heavily armed law enforcement in the streets for days after the shooting. Authorities, who responded in armored vehicles and military gear, were criticized for escalating the violence rather than tempering it. Brown's family has implored would-be protesters to refrain from the looting and violence that marred the early protests. But through its attorney, the family asked authorities to use ""reasonable restraints"" in dealing with protesters. The attorney blamed assault rifles, manhandling, tear gas, rubber bullets and false arrests for agitating the protesters who took to the streets. Fuentes said people on both sides of the issue have all but telegraphed what's to come after the grand jury decision is announced. What happens in Ferguson, he said, can influence what happens in the rest of the country. ""When you have demonstrations, emotions are high,"" Fuentes said. ""When you have high emotions, a mob can get out of control. ... When emotions are high, all it takes is one or two people to incite the crowd into doing something else. And one bad cop can incite things if shots are fired or if the police do something too aggressive. It can work both ways.""","Cities around the country anxiously await grand jury decision in Ferguson case .

"One of the odder, funnier moments of ""Mad Men"" came recently when two head honchos, Lane Pryce and Pete Campbell, duked it out in a conference room. The fight lasted only moments, but according to Vincent Kartheiser, who plays Campbell, it was one of those rare moments that creator Matthew Weiner had a vision that aligned with what fans had clamored for over the years. Kartheiser's portrayal of the young go-getter is an excellent study in how to make an audience despise a character. He's slimy and cruel and will step right over you, sometimes even on you, just to climb the corporate ladder. And while it's easy to cast Campbell as one of ""Mad Men""s villains, still, there's something sympathetic and likeable about him underneath it all. CNN spoke with Kartheiser about staging fights and social change on ""Mad Men"" and why there's a little Pete Campbell in all of us. CNN: This recent episode featured a fist fight between Pete and Lane. Does a small part of you wish he knocked Lane out? Kartheiser: Well, no, not really. The reason is, I stopped wishing for things with my character because I'm very aware that (creator) Matt Weiner has a plan for how this story should go. I trust him like I've never trusted any writer or creator that I've worked with. He knows what the audience wants and he rarely gives it to them. But in a rare case, the audience wanted this, very badly, for many a year. It's one of the few times that Matt's plans happened to coincide with what the general population of ""Mad Men"" wanted. So I'm kinda glad to give the people a little something that they've been longing for. To be honest, I take a hit much better than I give one. CNN: When you get a script with Pete in a fight, what's your reaction? Do you research how a guy in the '60s would fight. Kartheiser: Most fights that I saw growing up in high school and most fights I've seen as an adult at bars are pretty stupid. They look ridiculous and rarely do they look two guys who know what they're doing. So, I didn't do any research. We have a team of people who are very good at researching that stuff. We showed up a week before the fight and had stunt coordinators and had been schooled in the research of the era and what Matt wanted. I've done a lot of shows where there's fighting and often times the stunt coordinators can get carried away, throwing in fancy moves and special punches. I love Matt because he comes in and says ""No, that's not real, that would never happen. Take three punches out and make it real."" I think most people who have seen a fight in real life would be like ""Yep, that's about right: Two guys who should never be throwing down are taking crazy swings at each other and one guy gets plunked in the nose and that's game."" CNN: Punches aside, one of the interesting aspects that we're still seeing evolve with this show is Pete Campbell's relationship with Don Draper. In a recent episode he was so giddy that his boss was coming to his house. You never see him that happy. Kartheiser: Well, it's a rite of passage. Don is finally accepting him as a friend, as an equal! Making the trek out to Cos Cob on the weekend, it seems like he's going out his way for Pete. And Pete really seems like he needs that kind of attention. John Slattery said, ""In this scene, you're basically like 'Aw, shucks, boss. You came on down to Cos Cob.' That whole idea of ""Aw, shucks,"" it really helped me in that scene in hitting the right tone. CNN: The show over the years and certainly now hints at these socio-political changes that are happening outside of the office and might be trickling in now. Is that a big thing for this season? Kartheiser: The times are a-changing and in the first few episodes we've seen it make its way into Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Times have been changing for the last few years. There's been riots and integration and things have been changing but it hasn't affected the lives of these people as profoundly as we maybe the history books would want you to believe. Let's take something huge, like the war in Iraq. It's huge and in 30 years we'll look back and think that everybody's life was inundated with this war but for most of the people I know, including myself, it had very little effect on us.  It has an effect, but we can't quite see it yet. It's the same with the 1960s, and we look back and say: ""Oh, there were these great changes, everyone must've felt it."" It takes a while for these things to take effect in the exclusive, upper- and middle-class office buildings. We're just starting to see it now. It's '66 and it's starting to hit home. CNN: The show has a handful of directors that are used frequently. Are there stylistic differences that each have that you're seeing shape different aspects of your performance? Kartheiser: Every director brings a little taste of themselves. At the end of the day, Matthew Weiner has final cut. At the end of the day, Matthew Weiner will re-shoot a scene if it doesn't fit into the look of the show. That's wonderful. Everyone has stylistic differences and he wants them to express those things, but he wants to make sure that there's a consistency to the look of the show, to the tone of the show. That being said, I absolutely love John Slattery as a director. He loves the art form of it. CNN: Do you relate to Pete at all at this stage in the show in any way? Kartheiser: All sorts of times. Something that Matt does wonderfully, is that he writes for his actors. He says: ""What do these people deal with in real life?"" Pete feels emasculated, he feels a bit insecure about his place among the men of the world. ... He doesn't have that machismo or the elegance of the men that surround him. I think I can relate to some of those things and some of the way Pete hates himself and worries that the world hates him for those things too. Now, granted, I'm not trying to say I'm Pete Campbell. Those issues reside in me as deeply as they do as him. But I have understood those through my life. I think most people can. I think if people took a fearless look at themselves, they'd see a lot more Pete Campbell than they'd want to believe. CNN: There's a great line in this Slate interview where you said people are always asking you about highbrow stuff, but sometimes you're just a lowbrow dude. I picture you sitting around listening to Katy Perry and enjoying whoopee cushions. Kartheiser: (Laughs) No, I don't think I'm a lowbrow dude, feeding off Top 40 and watching Fox News all afternoon. I enjoy reading literature and learning about the world. This show deals with some complex issues -- every episode contains a theme and they come from the minds of some really intelligent people. I'm just saying I don't know if I'm the best person to answer those types of questions. As much as I don't think I'm an idiot, those ideas are very profound.","Vincent Kartheiser plays Pete Campbell, a young go-getter on ""Mad Men""

"(CNN)The first female engineer to work on offshore oil and gas rigs in the U.K, knows what it's like to be the only woman in sight for hundreds of kilometers. In her twenties, mathematician Ann Cairns was quite literally thrown in the deep end, working on British Gas rigs in the remote North Sea in the early 1980s. ""It started off with designing pipelines, testing them, blowing up the pipes and seeing what pressure they'd burst at,"" said the mother-of-one, originally from Newcastle in the north of England. Decades later, Cairns' office is far more conventional -- though no less demanding. She is now the President of International Markets for credit card giant, Mastercard, overseeing 5,000 employees in over 200 countries. Funnily enough, Cairns says working in investment banking in the 1980s, was a more sexist environment than the all-male rigs. ""I think engineers, as I see it, are really team players,"" she said. ""And providing that you have a scale that people can recognize and you add value to, then you're seen not for who you are -- but what you can do."" Towards the end of the decade Cairns was again plunged in the deep end, this time joining Citigroup in 1987 -- just 19 days before the ""Black Monday"" market crash. ""I think if you're in the engineering world you love fixing things,"" she said of coping under extreme pressure. ""And I found that I thrived in that environment."" It's a trait that served Cairns well later in her career -- in 2008 she led the European team managing the Lehman Brothers' Bankruptcy. Three years later Cairns joined Mastercard as the head of international business, managing all operations for the company outside of the U.S. Does she want to be the ultimate boss one day? ""I think we have a fantastic CEO in Ajay Banga, but you know I think there's nothing wrong with being ambitious and wanting to have the next job,"" she said. ""So that's a 'yes.'"" ""You're only as good as your boss thinks you are. And if your boss doesn't think you're great, go and find another boss!"" ""I hope my daughter has learned that happiness and success are bound together -- you can't separate your business life from your family life."" Insight: Meet the woman controlling India's money .

"A metal object that washed ashore on Australia's coast wasn't from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, officials said. Detailed pictures of the object were enough to convince investigators that it wasn't a lead in the search for the missing plane, the Australian agency leading the search for the aircraft said on Thursday. Officials had previously called the piece of metal, which appeared to have rivets on one side, an ""object of interest"" in the search. Police picked it up near Augusta, Australia, roughly 1,000 miles away from the suspected crash site, after many futile days of searching for the missing plane. Authorities haven't said what they think the object could be. Possible promising leads have turned out to be false alarms for weeks in the lengthy search for the missing plane, which disappeared mid-flight on March 8 with 239 people aboard. One major challenge that's complicated the search: the ocean is full of garbage. Other objects search teams have spotted in the Indian Ocean turned out to be trash, jellyfish and fishing gear. Bad weather grounded planes searching for signs of debris on Wednesday. And a high-tech underwater drone found no sign of the Boeing 777 jetliner. If nothing turns up in the Bluefin-21's underwater search, the investigation will move into a new phase that could involve new equipment and an expanded search area. And as the search came up empty again, a key question loomed: Are they looking in the right place? ""They have been searching for more than a month. All of the ships, the planes, the satellites they're using, not even a small piece of the plane was found,"" Steve Wang, whose mother was aboard the aircraft, told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Thursday. Abbott: 'We may rethink the search, but we will not rest' Up to 11 military aircraft and 11 ships are set to search for the plane on Thursday. And there's still ground left to cover. The Bluefin-21 has scanned more than 90% of the underwater search area set out by investigators and began its 12th mission on Thursday. ""We will continue with the search operation until we fully cover the search area,"" Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's acting transport minister, said Wednesday. Despite the search efforts for MH370 repeatedly coming up empty during the 48 days since it started, there's no suggestion the hunt in the southern Indian Ocean is anywhere close to ending. Quite to the contrary, according to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, whose country is heading up the search for the missing aircraft. ""We are not going to abandon ... the families of the 239 people who were on that plane by lightly surrendering while there is reasonable hope of finding something,"" he said Wednesday.  ""We may well rethink the search, but we will not rest until we have done everything we can to solve this mystery."" What comes next? Malaysian and Australian authorities are already mapping out a long-term strategy for the search, which could go on for months or years, if the two-year search for Air France Flight 447 is any guide. Guidelines drafted by Malaysia raise the possibility of a significantly wider search area should the current underwater search fail to turn up evidence of the plane. The document discusses how best to deploy resources, including new underwater search assets. If the underwater search comes up empty, it could ground the air search as well, CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. ""If it doesn't pan out, then all the equations that have been put in the mix to determine where debris might be ...  all of that is for naught,"" he said. The next logical step after the underwater search is to ""rethink all of the information we have at hand,"" ocean search specialist Rob McCallum told CNN. An expanded search area might include the last 370 miles of the plane's flight path, perhaps 15 miles on either side, he said. He also said it would make sense to turn to deep-towed sonar, which provides less resolution than the Bluefin-21 but about 10 times the range. If the search changes tacks, that doesn't mean investigators did the wrong thing by looking where they did for the plane, said CNN analyst David Gallo, who co-led the search for Air France Flight 447. Satellite and fuel consumption data, and possible pings from the plane's flight data recorders led searchers to the part of the Indian Ocean they're combing now, he said. ""It's the place they had to look. ... Everything pointed to this area,"" he said. Going forward, he said, investigators may double or triple the size of the search area while using sonar to map the ocean floor ""so you see where every pebble is."" ""I just don't know how you leave this place before you take that area of the seafloor apart completely,"" he said. What happens if data recorders are found? Investigators would love to find the flight data recorders from Flight 370, a potential treasure trove of information into what happened to the jetliner and the 239 passengers and crew on board. If found, the ""black boxes"" probably would go to the Australian Transport Safety Board's accident investigation lab. But the investigation is officially Malaysian, so that country's officials would decide where the boxes would go. Australia is just one of a handful of countries that have the capability and technical know-how to decipher what's inside a black box. The investigation into Flight 370's disappearance is Malaysia's responsibility. Australia is leading the search for the missing aircraft and participating in the investigation as an accredited representative. The Malaysian Cabinet approved the appointment of an international investigation team to look into the disappearance of Flight 370, Hishammuddin said. The names of the members will be announced next week, he added. He also said the team will not be looking at the criminal aspects of the investigation, which remain under the Royal Malaysian Police. ""The main purpose is to evaluate and determine the cause of the accident,"" Hishammuddin said. Malaysia has completed a preliminary report on the incident, as required by the International Civil Aviation Organization, but has not released it publicly, he said.

"(CNN)If when you say internet, you think of a computer, then you probably don't live in an African country. The continent has some of the lowest fixed-broadband subscription rates in the world, with most people's first encounter with the world wide web coming via their mobile phones. Around 70% of mobile users browse the internet on their devices, and Africa's mobile broadband growth is increasing at a rate of more than 40% --  twice the global average. This is largely due to the weak land-line infrastructure on the continent, which makes connecting through a desktop computer difficult. Low-cost or second-hand feature phones are also much cheaper to buy, which has made them ubiquitous across the continent, and it is estimated that by 2016 Africa will have a billion mobile phones. Feature devices also stay charged for longer -- a crucial requirement in a part of the world where the supply of power is irregular and unreliable. ""More people in Africa have a mobile phone than access to electricity,"" according to Toby Shapshak, editor and publisher of Stuff Magazine. ""That means, for a phone to be functional, it needs decent battery life. These feature phones have anywhere up to a week."" This has created a unique environment where mobile technology have been adapted for a wide range of usages, from lowering information barriers and improving access to financial and health services to boosting commerce and bringing people together. Mobile money transfer systems such as M-Pesa, which launched in Nairobi in 2007, allow customers to send cash to remote areas with the touch of a button. The service has nearly 17 million active customers who make more than US$1.1 billion worth of transactions per month. And if you're worried that the medicines you bought might be counterfeit, you can check their authenticity through mPedigree, a mobile application which gives you a ""genuine"" or ""fake"" answer after you text the drug's serial number. Mobile phone technology has also moved into sectors outside the traditional tech remit. Farmers can access information about the weather, real-time market prices, and new farming tips though mobile apps like Farmerline and Esoko. Mobiles have even infiltrated arts and culture, with Badilisha Poetry X-Change, the world's largest archive of African poets featured on a mobile first website. The spread of internet-enabled cell phones has also had an effect on the fiber of society: ""The impact of Internet access via mobile devices on the continent has been a game changer on the continent,"" according to Nmachi Jidenma, manager of mobile disruptors at PayPal. ""Access to social networks has given youth a platform for self-expression and civic participation in ways that are having real impact on elections, governance and accountability.""

"(CNN)""We're racist, we're racist, and that's the way we like it,"" chanted a group of Chelsea football fans as they shoved a black man off a Paris Metro train. Again and again the black passenger attempted to board the waiting train, only to be pushed back onto the platform by a torrent of limbs and hateful words. The man went home to his wife and three children and, having lost his phone in the melee, was initially unaware the incident had sparked a global debate about racism that spilled far beyond the sports stadium. The ugly scene, caught on camera by a horrified onlooker, showed racism is very much alive and kicking -- and it's not just football's problem. ""There's a strand of male culture you see in the UK, and to some extent other Anglo Saxon societies, prevalent among 20, 30 and even 40-year-olds, which is: you go abroad, you drink a fair amount, you sing songs and engage in banter, and pick on someone who is different to you,"" said Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE). ""There's this pervasive sexism and racism. The idea that 'anyone who isn't like us, we're going to sing about them and insult them and it's part of the lad's day out.'"" It's a culture absent from women's football. ""The fastest growing participation sport in the UK, and many countries around the world, is women's football,"" explained Lord Herman Ouseley of football equality group, Kick it Out. ""And I have to tell you we don't get such incidents in women's football. Or such incidents in disabled people's football. But we get it in men's football. ""It's part of that lad's culture and the stick-together mentality that goes with it. And it doesn't just have to be on the issue of race. It embodies sexism, homophobia and anti-Islam."" Racism and football have a long relationship, says Powar, pointing to the strong sense of tribalism within the sport. ""English football in particular is rooted in a white, working class community,"" he explained. ""When the country started to experience mass migration from the colonies in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, then the racism that was prevalent on the streets and schools and workplaces, was being amplified inside football stadiums. ""And then at some point racism in football stadiums was actually more prevalent than in the streets and schools -- it was more consistent, heard more often, and more virulent."" Football's ""dark days"" of racial abuse in 1970s and 1980s are behind well behind us, he says. Though there is still some way to go in stamping it out completely. ""Even 10 years ago, the chances of an ethnic minority hearing something racially offensive in the football stadium, was commonplace. ""But now I think there's an acceptance that a line has been drawn, that it's not acceptable, and that we revere many black players. Chelsea fans themselves voted Didier Drogba, a black player, as being one of their all-time heroes."" Strangely enough, the same Chelsea 'fan' who shoved the black passenger in Paris supports a team with some of the most talented black players in the league and which has just signed the talented Colombian winger Juan Cuadrado. In recent years football has suffered a spate of high-profile racial abuse cases, notably involving Luis Suarez, who is now at Barcelona and Chelsea captain John Terry. While Liverpool's Mario Balotelli was racially abused while playing in Italy's Serie A. Over the last decade, Europe's governing body UEFA have prosecuted over 120 incidents of racism -- sanctions included player suspensions, matches played behind closed doors, and fines. Back in Britain, the English Football Association created a 92-point Inclusion and Anti-Discrimination Action Plan in 2012, including confidential hotlines for players to report discrimination, ethnic quotas for referees and coaches, and state-of-the-art cameras to catch racist abuse in the stands. Following the incident in Paris this week, Chelsea has now suspended five people from its home ground Stamford Bridge. Depending on the evidence, they may also be banned from the club for life. ""In England, our stadiums are far safer, they're better stewarded, there are policing operations which are quite sophisticated,"" said Powar. ""And actually some would argue that it's gone too far. Some would argue that those stadiums are quite sterile, that they lack the passion they once did."" Away from the stadia and away from the Paris Metro another kind of prejudice is in action. Powar estimates that just 3% of those in professional coaching and management positions are from ethnic minorities. ""The boardrooms are almost exclusively white and male -- and senior administrative positions are the same way,"" said Ouseley. ""We're seeing some progress, but it's slow. At the start of this season there were no black managers -- now there are five, including one in the premier league."" Queens Park Rangers boss Chris Ramsey is that one black manager in the English Premier League and he insisted blame for the incident in Paris shouldn't be left at football's door. ""I don't believe they are Chelsea fans or fans of football,"" said Ramsey. ""I believe they are acting in a manner which we all think is a thing of the past,"" he said. ""Those views are intrinsic in everyday life. I've been saying for a long time these are social issues which manifest themselves in the football world."" And as the incident in Paris showed, racism in football needn't be confined to the playing field.","English football fans make racist chants as they push black man off Paris train .

"(CNN)Imagine flying over The Netherlands and seeing one of the fat-pixeled images from the gallery above. It would be hard not to smile, right? I mean, what is that alien thing? An oversized kaleidoscope? A rip in the Matrix? Some kind of freakish, town-sized cauliflower? When Mishka Henner, a 38-year-old artist and photographer, came across these ""blurred"" images of Dutch landscapes on Google Maps, he was similarly perplexed and amused. ""Well, I laughed,"" he said of the initial discovery. The hidden zones are ""not only bases, they're also royal palaces and fuel depots and ammunition depots and that sort of thing,"" Henner told me. The Dutch government ""used a pretty spectacular method for hiding these locations, which does everything but hide them, basically."" Henner, who lives in the UK, decided to turn this strangely beautiful form of censorship into art. His series of high-resolution Google Maps renderings is called ""Dutch Landscapes."" Created in 2011, the series has been on display at New York's Museum of Modern Art and elsewhere. Next month, he said, it will be on display at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Each of the pieces in the series, he told me, is actually a composite of about 60 smaller Google images. Henner stitched them together to create a print large enough to be displayed in a gallery. Gallery curators have told Henner that this work reminds them of the Cubist movement of the early 1900s, in which painters like Picasso and Braque simplified reality into a collection of angular shapes. Henner told me he'd never thought of it that way -- and that he suspects all the Dutch government did to create this effect was use the ""crystallize"" filter in Photoshop. ""It could have been the Friday of the month when the parents (at the Dutch Defense Ministry) were allowed to bring their kids to work,"" he said. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The images are ""very, kind of, childlike in a way."" They also hit at something deeper. ""It's a paradox: So much is visible"" in the modern world, where security cameras and smartphones are everywhere, he told me. ""And yet, so much effort goes into making things not visible. The Dutch landscapes reflect that really brilliantly. They're the effort to conceal something when it's visible."" And that's what I love about this work -- and this method of censorship. It's obvious. And it's almost whimsical. Like the country is letting its citizens in on the joke -- acknowledging, for once, that it is obscuring reality for security purposes. A spokesman for the Dutch Defense Ministry, Klaas Meijer, told me that these artful obfuscations are no longer required under Dutch law, and that, following a 2013 law change, ""Google Maps will show military or royal locations without restrictions."" There is at least one remaining exception. That imagery likely hasn't been updated since the law changed, Meijer said. Google does not play a role in the censorship, according to a company spokeswoman. ""The imagery in Google Earth and Maps comes from a variety of sources,"" the company said in an e-mail. ""Local aerial photography collected by imagery providers are subject to local law, and in some countries, as a condition for overflight, they require aerial photography companies to blur military installations and other areas deemed sensitive by the government.  This is implemented by the local companies prior to delivery to third-parties like Google."" Perhaps it's already antiquated, but I still find the easy-to-spot censorship from the Dutch landscape series refreshing at a time when so many government efforts at information manipulation and obfuscation are scarily covert. In the book ""The Dictator's Learning Curve,"" William Dobson argues authoritarian (or would-be authoritarian) governments are getting increasingly sophisticated and clever. Instead of the outright manipulation and control shown by North Korea, for example, many world leaders try to manipulate without being noticed, or while maintaining plausible deniability. ""Take, for example, Russia,"" Dobson wrote. ""Even as Vladimir Putin became increasingly authoritarian, he never did violence to the Russian constitution; he worked in the seams of Russia's political system, centralizing power through channels that could at least appear to be democratic."" Internet censorship in China is another good example. The country's Great Firewall is used to filter local Internet searches of provocative terms like ""Tiananmen Square,"" the site of a 1989 pro-democracy demonstration. But there's no big-bold-polygon equivalent shown to Internet users when the Web is being censored. When people search Google for banned terms, for example, ""the user will see a blank page or a browser error message,"" according to the site greatfire.org, which tracks Internet censorship in China. Was that censorship? Or a bad connection? It's clear but kind of isn't, exactly. The United States is guilty of this, too. I'd almost rather the NSA sent me a daily e-mail with a list of all of the information they're collecting on me. They could do it in emoticons or whatever cutesy, pseudo-artful way they wanted. At least I'd know what was happening. Not knowing is worse. ""A new kind of iron fist has arrived, tucked behind an acid-whitened smile,"" Dwight Garner writes in a review of Dobson's book for The New York Times. The Dutch way -- beautifully obvious censorship -- is clearly preferable, if unrealistic. Few governments seem willing to fess up to their efforts to censor and manipulate. Pity, though. If they all took the artful Dutch approach to it, their citizens might be more likely to trust them. At least they'd know what's going on, and could form rational arguments in support or opposition. As it is now, many government programs -- especially those that involve spying and censorship -- are largely invisible and, therefore, entirely suspect. Mishka Henner is a Belgian photographer.

"The horrifying crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 has put the pro-Russia rebels operating in Ukraine's eastern regions center stage -- and raised all kinds of questions about who they are, what they want and who's in charge. U.S. and other officials have said it appears the plane was shot down by a sophisticated surface-to-air missile located within rebel-held territory. The rebels have repeatedly denied responsibility and instead point the finger at Ukraine's armed forces. Where are the rebels? The rebels are pro-Russia militants concentrated in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, with the industrial city of Donetsk a particular stronghold. Recent gains by Ukrainian armed forces have seen the territory controlled by the rebels contract. But the rural area where MH17 crashed to earth July 17 remains under the rebels' sway. The various rebel groups operating across the region do not appear to have a strong central command. When did they first appear on the scene? After popular protests toppled Ukraine's pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych from power in February, pro-Russia rebels first appeared in Ukraine's Crimea region, where they seized key infrastructure. The region was subsequently annexed by Russia. Unrest then broke out in eastern Ukraine, a heartland of support for Yanukovych, where many people speak Russian and feel closer ties to Moscow than to Kiev. Rebel leaders in Luhansk and Donetsk seized key government buildings and declared themselves the heads of the People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. In May, a referendum was held in each region on secession from Ukraine. Who are the main rebel leaders? Alexander Borodai, a Russian citizen, was appointed prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic and has been a prominent public face for the rebels. He's the rebel leader who after speaking with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak agreed that the plane's flight data recorders would be handed over. According to Andrew Kuchins, a Russia expert at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, there are rumors Borodai is a Russian intelligence officer who has reached the rank of general in the FSB, the successor to the KGB. ""Borodai himself has denied (the rumors), but I would say that given his trips back and forth to Moscow, he has certainly been consulting with parts of Russian intelligence over the past couple of months,"" he said. In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, Borodai denied any responsibility for the downing of MH17. Another name that crops up frequently is that of Igor Girkin, also known as Igor Strelkov, the self-proclaimed defense minister for the people's republic. According to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Strelkov on July 17 ""posted a social media report bragging about the shoot-down of a transport plane -- at which point when it became clear it was civilian, they pulled down that particular report."" Also a Russian, Strelkov was a military commander in the rebel redoubt of Slovyansk before it was retaken by Ukrainian forces, later reappearing in Donetsk city. He was also present in Crimea at the time of its annexation. Added to an EU sanctions list in April, he was described as being on the staff of the Russian military's main Intelligence Directorate. What is the rebels' response to the claim they shot down MH17? After three months or more of bitter fighting against the Ukrainian authorities, the rebels are disinclined to believe anything they hear from Kiev or the West, says freelance journalist Noah Sneider in Ukraine. They deny shooting down MH17 and many instead claim it is a provocation conjured up by the Ukrainian authorities in Kiev, he said. Many of them claim they don't have the equipment to have hit the plane. ""Anything that's released by the current authorities in Kiev is seen in rebel eyes as fabricated, as intended to -- essentially to draw NATO into Ukraine,"" Sneider said. Asked about the growing weight of evidence gathered by Washington and Kiev, such as social media postings and phone intercepts, Borodai told CNN it was fake. ""It is very simple to disprove it. All of the information that comes through the Internet, in my opinion, is practically all lies,"" he said. Would the rebels have been able to shoot down the plane? Russia denies claims by Kiev and the West that it has provided training, heavy weaponry and logistical support to the rebels. It also dismisses any direct involvement of Russian forces in Ukraine. In recent weeks, rebel forces have brought down a number of Ukrainian military aircraft in the eastern regions, including two Antonov AN-26 transport planes, several Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters, an Su-25 fighter jet and an Ilyushin IL-76 cargo plane. However, Ukrainian and U.S. officials believe Russian expertise would have been needed to operate the SA-11, or Buk, antiaircraft system that seems increasingly likely to have been used to shoot down MH17. Vitaly Nayda, Ukraine's director of informational security, told CNN that he is certain a Russian officer personally pushed the button to shoot down the plane. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, who has reported extensively from Ukraine and met many of the rebel fighters, said it was hard to say if any of them had the specialist training needed to operate the Buk system. ""The people we've met, the militia, they're ragtag, a lot of them have old military experience, and that's mostly ground, street-to-street fighting, rather than the technological stuff you need to know to run something like that."" A lot of heavy weaponry has flooded in during the past few weeks, said Paton Walsh. ""But the majority of video you see of separatist armor and weapons, lighter artillery, even Grad rocket launchers sometimes, are nothing of the scale of the Buk."" What weapons do the rebels have? The military aircraft brought down by the rebels were flying at relatively low altitudes and were for the most part brought down by shoulder-launched SA-7 missiles and ZU 23-2 anti-aircraft guns. Such weapons were seized when pro-Russian rebels took control of several Ukrainian military depots and bases. But those weapons are a world away from the Buk system, effective at a higher altitude, at which the Malaysia Airlines plane was flying. Peter Felstead, an expert on former Soviet military hardware at IHS Jane's, says that ""the Buk is in both the Russian and Ukrainian inventories, but it's unclear whether the one suspected in the shoot-down was taken by rebels when they overran a Ukrainian base, or was supplied by Russia."" Video posted by Ukraine's Interior Ministry on its Facebook page shows a Buk system, according to the Ukrainian officials, heading toward Russia, with one missile missing. Borodai told CNN that the rebels had never been in control of a single Buk missile system. What does Russia say? Russia insists it has no direct influence over the separatists. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been consistent in his denials of any Russian involvement in the bringing down of MH17. ""No one should have the right to use this tragedy to achieve selfish political objectives,"" he said. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia wanted to see an objective, open and independent investigation, adding that Ukraine must take the initiative since the tragedy occurred on its territory. ""With regard to the claims raised by Kiev, that it was almost us who did it: in fact I haven't heard any truthful statements from Kiev over the past few months,"" he told state TV channel Russia 24. Russian state media reports have sought to suggest that Ukraine's own armed forces may have been involved in bringing down MH17. Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, also blamed Ukraine for the crash in remarks Monday. But when asked about audio recordings of purported pro-Russia separatists talking about shooting down a plane, he suggested that if they did, it was an accident. ""According to them, the people from the east were saying that they shot down a military jet,"" he said. ""If they think they shot down a military jet, it was confusion. If it was confusion, it was not an act of terrorism.""","The pro-Russia rebels are concentrated in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk .
The leader of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic is Alexander Borodai .
Analysts say he is rumored to be a senior Russian intelligence officer .
The rebels have denied any involvement in bringing down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 ."
"The conflict raging in Gaza is different this time. While Hamas' rocket attacks and Israel's military actions may look familiar, they're taking place against a whole new backdrop. ""This is unprecedented in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict,"" says CNN's Ali Younes, an analyst who has covered the region for decades. ""Most Arab states are actively supporting Israel against the Palestinians -- and not even shy about it or doing it discreetly."" It's a ""joint Arab-Israeli war consisting of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia against other Arabs -- the Palestinians as represented by Hamas."" As the New York Times put it, ""Arab leaders, viewing Hamas as worse than Israel, stay silent."" One of the outcomes of the fighting will likely be ""the end of the old Arab alliance system that has, even nominally, supported the Palestinians and their goal of establishing a Palestinian state,"" Younes says. ""The Israel-Hamas conflict has laid bare the new divides of the Middle East,"" says Danielle Pletka, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. ""It's no longer the Muslims against the Jews. Now it's the extremists -- the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Hezbollah, and their backers Iran, Qatar and Turkey -- against Israel and the more moderate Muslims including Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia."" ""It's a proxy war for control or dominance in the Middle East,"" says CNN's Fareed Zakaria. To understand why and what all this means, we need to begin with understanding of Hamas. Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood . Hamas, which has controlled the Palestinian government in Gaza for years, is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood. To many Americans, the brotherhood is familiar for its central role in the power struggle for Egypt. But it's much larger than that. ""The Muslim Brotherhood is international, with affiliated groups in more than 70 countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE,"" says Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The Arab Spring showed the region that uprisings can lead to the Brotherhood gaining power. So it's a threat to the governments it opposes. ""Israel's ongoing battle against Hamas is part of a wider regional war on the Muslim Brotherhood,"" says the Soufan Group, which tracks global security. ""Most Arab states share Israel's determination to finish the movement off once and for all, but they are unlikely to be successful."" ""From the perspective of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the UAE and some other Arab states, what the Israeli Prime Minister is doing is fighting this war against Hamas on their behalf so they can finish the last stronghold of the Muslim Brotherhood,"" Younes says. ""Arab governments and official Arab media have all but adopted the Israeli view of who is a terrorist and who is not. Egyptian and Saudi-owned media are liberal in labeling the Muslim Brotherhood as 'terrorists' and describing Hamas as a 'terrorist organization.' It's a complete turnabout from the past, when Arab states fought Israel and the U.S. in the international organizations on the definition of terrorism, and who is a terrorist or a 'freedom fighter.'"" Egypt . Egypt's new President vowed during his campaign that he would finish off the Muslim Brotherhood. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the former military chief, deposed Egypt's first freely elected leader, President Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, last year following mass protests against Morsy's rule. El-Sisi was elected officially in June. ""In Egypt you have a regime that came to power by toppling a Muslim Brotherhood government,"" says Trager. ""It's therefore in an existential conflict with the Brotherhood. So it doesn't want to see Hamas, the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood, emerge stronger in a neighboring territory."" Egypt also has another reason to stand against Hamas: rising violence and instability in Sinai, the northern part of Egypt that borders Israel and Gaza.  Hamas' network of tunnels includes some in and out of Egypt used to smuggle goods include weapons for attackson Israeli civilians. The new Egyptian government has been ""cracking down aggressively since it removed the brotherhood from power,"" Trager says. El-Sisi closed the border crossings between Egypt and Gaza, which has helped block Hamas militants from escaping or smuggling in more weapons during Israel's onslaught. But it also has contributed to the humanitarian crisis of people trapped in Gaza. Egypt proposed a cease-fire, and Israel quickly accepted it -- indicating that it contained the terms Israel was looking for, analysts say. Hamas rejected it. While Egypt has worked furiously to try to broker a truce in the past, Cairo this time shows little rush to change its proposal to one much more favorable to Hamas, analysts say. Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan . The monarchies of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan have called on Hamas to accept the cease-fire proposal as is. ""We condemn the Israeli aggression and we support the Egyptian cease-fire proposal,"" Jordan's King Abdullah said last week. Countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE are ""challenged by Islamists who come to power via the ballot box rather than through royal succession,"" says Trager. ""So these countries have been directly supportive of the coup in Egypt because it removed elected Islamists and therefore discredited that model."" Saudi Arabia is ""leading the charge,"" partly through backing the coup and financing state media reports that attacked the brotherhood, says Younes. ""Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE all see the destruction of Hamas as of benefit to their internal security as well as to regional stability."" ""The Saudis and the Egyptians are now more scared of Islamic fundamentalism than they are of Israel,"" says Zakaria. ""The Saudi monarchy is more worried about the prospects of Hamas winning, which would embolden Islamists in other parts of the Middle East, and therefore potentially an Islamist opposition in Saudi Arabia."" But Hamas is not alone. Turkey and Qatar . Turkey and Qatar remain supportive of Hamas. Qatar supported Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood government, and built ""an Egypt-centric Al Jazeera network that became known for its strongly pro-Muslim Brotherhood line,"" says Trager. Qatar also funds many Muslim Brotherhood figures in exile, including Hamas political leader Khaled Mashaal, who is believed to have orchestrated numerous Hamas terrorist attacks. ""I think this is a case of a country with a lot of money to burn making a certain calculation in 2011 that made a lot of sense at the time: that the Brotherhood was the next big thing that was going to dominate many of the countries of the region,"" says Trager. ""Realistically, it made sense to bet on it."" Turkey has ""more of an ideological sympathy with the Brotherhood,"" he says. Last week, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke with CNN, accusing Israel of ""genocide."" ""Erdogan has tried to use the cause of the Brotherhood to bolster his own Islamist credentials at home,"" says Trager. Last year, Erdogan cracked down on mass demonstrations in his country. Iran and Syria . Iran has long supported Hamas, supplying it with weapons. And Meshaal used to be based in Syria. But that changed. In 2012, Meshaal left Syria as the country's civil war deepened -- a decision believed to have caused a breakdown in his relationship with Iran as well, says Firas Abi Ali, head of Middle East and North Africa Country Risk and Forecasting at the global information company IHS.  Tehran is aligned with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Now, Syria -- Israel's neighbor to the north -- is locked in a brutal, multiparty civil war, with Islamist extremists hoisting severed heads onto poles. The war, believed to have killed more than 115,000 people, is just one of the many developments emphasizing how many ""fault lines"" there are in the region, Richard Haass, president of Council on Foreign Relations, told ""CNN Tonight."" ""There's fault lines within the Palestinians between Hamas and the other part of the Palestinian Authority. You have Sunnis vs. Shia. You have Iran vs. Saudi Arabia and the Arabs. You have secularists vs. people who embrace religion in the political space."" The Palestinian Authority . Paying a price for all this is another key player: Fatah, the Palestinian faction that controls the West Bank. Fatah and Hamas have long fought each other, but earlier this year made another effort at a unity government. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who is in charge of the government in the West Bank, ""seems politically exhausted by all the twists and turns he has made in search of a durable solution,"" the Soufan Gruop says. ""And the one chance of reasserting his authority through a unity government that would have forced Hamas into a subordinate and less militant role has now disappeared. He must now watch helplessly as protests in the West Bank undo whatever progress he had made towards a two-state solution."" Gaza conflict by the numbers .","The Gaza conflict is a proxy war for the Middle East, analysts say .
Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia are seen as supporting Israel's crackdown on Hamas .
Turkey and Qatar support Hamas .
Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood, which threatens some governments ."
"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- It was freezing, wet and a busy travel day before a holiday, but a few dozen protesters showed up outside police headquarters in Ferguson on Wednesday night. Standing underneath a ""Seasons Greetings"" sign stretching over the road, the demonstrators fired obscenities at National Guard members who stood on watch outside the police department's offices. The mood was much calmer than the two nights since a grand jury decided not to indict Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson, but still there was tension in the protest. A one-mile stretch of West Florissant Avenue, the site of previous protests, was closed to cars and pedestrians, with authorities saying the burned out buildings on the route are crime scenes. One of those buildings is Flood Christian Church, of which Michael Brown Sr. is a member. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is leading the investigation into the fire that destroyed the church, a spokesman said. Investigators have found that someone broke into the church and the fire began in a foyer near the doors that were breached, the ATF spokesman said. The church is some distance away from the strip of stores that burned Monday. Other structures nearby were untouched, which is cause for suspicion, the spokesman said. Also Wednesday, Ferguson police were looking for clues as to who stole an AR-15 that was locked in a rack plucked from a police car that was torched by rioters this week. ""They took the entire rack from the car,"" St. Louis County Police Sgt. Brian Schellman said. Better night but not without ugliness . As Ferguson residents looked around on Wednesday morning, they didn't see the kind of damage inflicted on the city a day earlier. There were fewer arrests and fewer instances of vandalism Tuesday night than the night before. And while there was plenty of anger among residents, it was channeled in chants and not chaos. ""We were perhaps not optimistic, but we were at least hopeful we would have a better night,"" said St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar. There were ugly incidents, though. Some rowdy protesters flipped over a police cruiser briefly, broke out its windows and set it on fire. Police moved in quickly to snuff it out. The acrid smell of pepper spray filled the air. Eyes were burning. Throats were scratchy. Elsewhere, vandals broke windows and trashed businesses. St. Louis County police said protesters hurled bottles of ""what appears to be urine"" at them. A car was set ablaze at a parking lot near Michael Brown's memorial -- which still stands where the unarmed teen was killed on August 9 -- but sporadic gunfire in the area stopped officers from responding, Belmar said. Officers said they seized a Molotov cocktail and made 44 arrests -- far fewer than Monday night, when anger and dismay over a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in Brown's killing led to violence authorities say surpassed the tumult that erupted after the shooting itself. ""A day before, we were kind of on different pages,"" Missouri State Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said. ""But what I'm hearing from this community is that we are all on the same page to make our community whole and make sure it stays whole."" Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . Nationwide protests . As in Ferguson, outrage over the grand jury's decision escalated from coast to coast, with protests in at least 130 cities nationwide. From New York to Los Angeles and dozens of cities in between, protesters flooded the streets to denounce the grand jury's decision. Some demonstrations blocked bridges, tunnels and major highways, but the protests were largely peaceful. ""They have given us no justice! We will give them no peace,"" protesters chanted as they massed in front of the Underground Atlanta shopping mall. In the New York area, demonstrators briefly blocked one of the entrances to the Lincoln Tunnel. ""We are on the side of Michael Brown to fight for what is right,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton said. ""We may have lost round one, but the fight is not over."" Darren Wilson speaks out . Meanwhile, in his first interview since the fatal shooting, Wilson maintained that he killed Brown, 18, out of fear for his life during their encounter. In the interview with ABC News, he said his response had nothing to do with race. ""I know I did my job right,"" he said. Repeating what he told the grand jury, Wilson said Brown reached into his police vehicle and grabbed for his gun. ""I just felt the immense power that he had. And then the way I've described it is, it was like a 5-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan. That's just how big this man was,"" Wilson said. ""He was very large, very powerful man."" Avoiding a repeat . Back in Ferguson, authorities were determined Tuesday to prevent a repeat of Monday night's violence. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon ordered additional National Guard troops to the area, boosting their numbers from 700 to 2,200. ""We are not your enemy,"" protesters chanted at officers who stood in full riot gear. ""We just want justice."" Cleaning up . Earlier Tuesday, volunteers helped clean up vandalized stores and eateries and boarded up broken windows and doors. Some residents carried guns and said volunteers were protecting houses on the streets off South Florissant Road. Armed men carrying semi-automatic rifles paced the roof of Beauty World, a store that was badly damaged in Monday's protests. Also Tuesday, St. Louis police identified a man who was found shot to death and set on fire. Belmar told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper that he isn't discounting the possibility that the death was linked to Monday night's violence. Deandre Joshua, 20, was found behind the wheel of a Pontiac in a parking lot, just down the street from Canfield Green Apartments, near where Brown was killed. Joshua had been shot in the head, police said. An accelerant was used to set him on fire, but the fire went out on its own, police said. He had burns to his arm, fingers and both legs. CNN's Moni Basu and Evan Perez reported from Ferguson. CNN's Sara Sidner, Faith Karimi, Jason Hanna and Evan Perez contributed to this report.","NEW: The group congregates outside police headquarters in Ferguson .

"Japan's annual trade deficit rose to a record $78 billion in 2012, according to official data from the Ministry of Finance. Japan, a nation whose export-driven wealth has traditionally been built on trade surpluses, had a second straight year of trade deficits thanks to a persistently high yen, trouble with trading partner China and weakening demand in the eurozone. Exports fell 5.8% in December 2012 compared to a year earlier due in large part to a strong yen which makes Japanese exports more expensive overseas. A protracted territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea has also seen Beijing slow its imports of Japanese goods. Japan's exports to the country plunged 10.8% in December year-on-year. Imports grew 1.9% over the same period, with mineral fuels including oil accounting for 34.1% -- and the majority -- of Japan's total imports for the year. Late last year, then-prime ministerial candidate Shinzo Abe campaigned on a mission to turn his country's economy around. His government unveiled $117 billion in new stimulus earlier this month. ""Beating deflation and curbing the yen's appreciation is crucially important,"" Abe said on January 10 and that a ""daring monetary policy is essential."" Earlier this week, the Bank of Japan signed on to Abe's plan to raise inflation to 2%, with the hope of pulling the world's third largest economy out of a two-decade slump of deflation. Since mid-November, Japan's currency has weakened more than 9% and to a two-and-a-half year low -- boding well for Japan's exporters. Abe, who served as Japan's premier from 2006 to 2007, was sworn back into the office on December 26.","Japan exports fell 5.8% in December from strong yen, China territorial dispute .

"(CNN)Are you ready for the ""most honest conversation you'll ever have?"" That's how VProud describes itself -- an apparently troll-proof website for women to discuss everything from politics to their sex lives, all without fear of garnering online abuse. While four in 10 internet users have been harassed online, according to the Pew Research Center, young women suffer the brunt of more extreme abuse -- 26% have been stalked online, and 25% sexually harassed. Now Karen Cahn, a former Google, YouTube, and AOL video executive, thinks she might have the answer to keeping trolls at bay. Her new social network filters out what she describes as ""Mean Girl"" language. ""Our definition of 'troll' is all about rude, hateful, mean, and unproductive comments,"" explained Cahn. ""And these comments can come from men and women."" In the VProud world, users are verified through their Google, Facebook, and Twitter accounts -- though they still have the option of commenting under a public or anonymous profile. Is Cahn the equivalent of a modern day ""Troll Slayer?"" We'll soon find out. CNN: What is VProud? Karen Cahn: VProud is a digital safe space for women to have intimate conversations with each other, without feeling like the whole world is going to see what they are saying, and without trolls making hateful and unproductive comments. It's an open platform where women can participate in discussions started by someone else, or start their own conversation and invite other people to join in. CNN: How does it keep out trolls? KC: We have 4 lines of defense against trollish comments: . 1. A database that understands context, and  over time can determine whether a comment is intended to be disruptive. 2. Filters that catch words and phrases that are against our community guidelines. 3. Editors who live and breathe VProud conversations, making sure the dialogue is one that is productive. 4. On every piece of content and comment on the site, there is a troll icon. If someone is being hateful or disrespectful, users can report the troll and our community managers will review it. CNN: Can you still post content anonymously? KC: Yes. Women can choose to participate in discussions using one of two identities: VPublic, which is their social username, and VPrivate which is a custom username. She can toggle back and forth between the two identities based on the conversation she's involved in. For example, I may be perfectly comfortable talking about yoga or girls education with my real name, Karen Cahn, but I'm certainly not going to comment about my sex life or intimate issues using my real name.   Instead, I will use my VPrivate name. You know, so my Aunt Gertrude doesn't see what I'm saying. CNN: Are you concerned about limiting free speech? KC: VProud is about the democratization of conversation. We are not the arbiters of opinions. We are not Democrats or Republicans, we are not pro-choice or pro-life. What we don't approve of is ""Mean Girl"" behavior -- name calling and putting people down. But we are not about censorship -- we just think you can have productive conversations without engaging in that type of behavior. CNN: What inspired you to set up the site? KC: I went through a divorce and the experience was the most isolating and lonely time in my life. I had lots of friends and Facebook friends but I still felt alone. I would sit up in bed at night and cry and put these ridiculous 20 word search phrases into Google and hope that a Yahoo group or something helpful would come up where I could find women like me to relate to -- but I never found anything. I figured I wasn't alone, so I decided to create a space for those types of conversations. CNN: Why did you make it women-centric? KC: Based on my personal experience, I wanted to create a space where women would have the freedom to discuss whatever is on their minds and, equally important, find a community around the issues they most want and need to discuss. I partnered with a group of women who all had different experiences with cyberbullying and comment trolling, and we all collectively built the site we now have. CNN: What has been your most popular topic of discussion? KC: Some of the topics people have become most engaged with are about mental health issues. We've also seen a lot of participation in our parenting conversations -- it appears to us that people are really looking for a community around these topics that can be hard to discuss with neighbors or friends who are not in similar circumstances. Topics around parenting a child with special needs is an area where people feel such a wide array of emotions -- confusion, guilt, fear, hope, shame. So it feels incredibly rewarding to see that we are providing a space where people feel comfortable asking questions and discussing things. CNN: You worked as an executive at Google, YouTube, and AOL -- how come none of these companies have set up something like this before? KC: I think it's easier to innovate when you're on your own or in a small group. I do my best thinking when I'm in the shower or curling my hair. And you can't exactly come into a huge organization like Google or AOL and say: ""Hey, so I was curling my hair and I had this really good idea, so I'm going off to build it now."" CNN: What is your advice for women harassed by trolls -- engage or ignore? KC: Dealing with trollish behavior online is no different than dealing with it in real life. The difference is that it happens more often in our online lives because our screens allow us to hide, and give us courage to say things that we would never say in our ""real lives."" But the truth is that the line between your online life and your regular life is pretty much gone -- more and more it's all the same. So take a deep breath and walk away because everything looks different after you pause for a break. In short, ignore. CNN: Where do you see the world of trolling headed -- will there come a breaking point? Trollish behavior comes from real people and typically it's the people who were bullied, who feel hurt by someone else, who have gone through a traumatic event. They are taking their feelings out on someone online and whether you call it cyberbullying or trolling, until people face the inner demons and get mental health support, we're going to see this continue. I think that's where we each have a role to play -- to not stand for the behavior, and to demand that there be better protections. CNN: Almost all of the videos featured on VProud are pulled from other websites -- are you concerned about ""piggy-backing"" on someone else's work? KC: VProud produces our own original video conversation starters every day in our studios in New York City. A huge part of VProud's mission is supporting the female creative economy in video, so it's our job to highlight and support the work of female content creators online.

"International monitors investigating the Malaysia Airlines crash in eastern Ukraine said Friday the team was not given full access to the site and was greeted with hostility by armed men. ""There didn't seem to be anyone really in control,""  Michael Bociurkiw, spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe team, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Armed men, apparently pro-Russia militants, loosely guarded the area but couldn't answer the monitors' questions, he said. Bociurkiw said the group only stayed about 75 minutes and examined about 200 meters at the scene before being forced to leave. Pieces of the airplane and bodies are spread over several kilometers. The OSCE team arrived at the crash site near Torez in a remote section of eastern Ukraine that's controlled by pro-Russian militants battling the Ukraine government. The United States says a surface-to-air missile, possibly fired by the militants, took down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on Thursday as the plane traveled from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. All 298 people on board died. U.N. Under Secretary General Feltman said 80 of the victims were children. Lack of access to the crash site worries U.S. officials, including Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, who tweeted:  ""Monitors should be able to access the crash site of MH17. US is deeply concerned by reports that separatists are denying access."" Bociurkiw said the investigation will be difficult because the plane crashed in a difficult-to-access area in the countryside with no electricity. Many of the victims were on vacation . ""I don't think too much of the crime scene has been compromised already,"" Bociurkiw said. ""The bodies are still there. They have not been tampered with. We actually spoke to some civilian emergency workers. They said their job was just to mark where the bodies are."" The FBI is sending two investigators to work on the case, a U.S. law enforcement official said, but the Ukraine government will be in charge of the investigation. Obama puts focus on Russia . The location of the flight recorder has not been determined. Ukrainian Economy and Trade Minister Pavlo Sheremeta told CNN's Richard Quest that MH17's black boxes are in Ukraine.  Sheremeta would not say, though, whether the government has them. ""They are on Ukrainian territory. I don't know whether we have it or the international team has it,"" he said. Earlier Friday, the adviser to the exiled governor of Dontesk told CNN's Victoria Butenko that the black boxes had been retrieved and were in rebel hands, though the location was not clear. Russia likely bears some of the responsibility for the apparent downing of Flight 17, President Barack Obama said. In the administration's strongest words yet on the downing of the jet, Obama said rebel fighters couldn't have operated the surface-to-air missile believed responsible for the shootdown ""without sophisticated equipment and sophisticated training, and that is coming from Russia."" In his remarks to reporters, Obama said that he did not want to get ahead of the facts of who may have been directly involved in the airliner's destruction. But he said the United States would work hard to hold accountable those responsible for it. He and other U.S. officials stopped short of publicly placing the responsibility on Russia, which has denied involvement in the destruction of the jetliner. But a senior defense official told CNN that the ""working theory"" among U.S. intelligence analysts is that the Russian military supplied the Buk missile system to rebel fighters inside Ukraine. The United States believes the missile system was transferred into eastern Ukraine from Russia ""in recent days or weeks,"" a senior administration official told CNN, and that the system was operational at the time. The United States believes pro-Russian separatists could not have operated it without Russian training, the official said, noting that it's unknown whether Russian personnel were on scene when the plane was shot down. U.S. officials believe the plane was ""likely downed by a surface-to-air missile ... operated from a separatist-held location in eastern Ukraine,"" the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council.  If pro-Russian separatists are responsible for shooting down the plane with a missile, investigators can't rule out the possibility that Russia offered help to operate the system, she said. Power also said Russia should take steps to cool tensions in Ukraine. ""Russia can end this war,"" she said. ""Russia must end this war. At least one American on board . Obama confirmed that at least one U.S. citizen was aboard the plane; Quinn Lucas Schansman was a student at International Business School Hogeschool van Amsterdam, according to his Facebook page. A majority of the passengers (at least 173) were Dutch. ""No one can deny the truth that is revealed in the awful images that we all have seen, and the eyes of the world are on eastern Ukraine, and we are going to make sure that the truth is out,"" Obama said. He called for an immediate cease-fire in the region and for a ""credible international investigation"" into what happened. MAPS: What route did the flight take? Among the evidence cited by U.S. officials and others for their conclusions was an audio recording released by Ukrainian intelligence officials which purportedly feature pro-Russian rebels and Russian military officers discussing a surface-to-air strike and the crash of a civilian jetliner. ""How are things going there,"" a man identified as a Russian intelligence agent asks. ""Well, we are 100% sure that it was a civilian plane,"" a man identified as a pro-Russian fighter responds. ""Are there a lot of people?"" the Russian officer asks. The rebel fighter then utters an obscenity and says, ""The debris was falling straight into the yards."" CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of this audio, or other similar recordings. Also, in a news conference Friday, the chief of Ukraine's security service, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, said the Buk missile system that shot down the airliner crossed the border from Russia only ""right before"" the attack. He didn't say how investigators know that, however . Ukraine's Interfax news agency reported claims by an adviser to Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs Anton Geraschenko that the launcher, as well as the flight data recorders from MH17, were handed over to Russian agents across the border at a checkpoint in the Luhansk area overnight. A senior Ukrainian official who spoke to CNN also accused Russia of carrying out a cover-up of its role in the shoot-down. He cited video showing a Buk launcher being moved toward Russia overnight. CNN could not independently confirm the claims. Should downed Malaysian jet have flown over Ukraine? Russia-Ukraine dispute . Tensions have been high between Ukraine and Russia since street protests forced former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych from power in February. Russia subsequently annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region, and a pro-Russian separatist rebellion has been raging in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Ukraine's government has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment, including tanks, to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russian rebels. While Ukrainian officials implicated pro-Russian fighters and their Russian backers for the jetliner's downing, Moscow argued Ukraine was to blame. ""With regard to the claims raised by Kiev, that it was almost us who did it: In fact I haven't heard any truthful statements from Kiev over the past few months,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an exclusive interview with the state-run Russia 24 TV channel. European Union leaders agreed this week to expand sanctions against individuals and entities in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, with details to be decided by the end of the month. Expanded U.S. sanctions were also announced in Washington. Airspace closed . The Ukrainian Ministry of Infrastructure announced Friday that the airspace over Donetsk, Luhansk and part of Kharkiv where rebels are operating had been closed indefinitely. Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai defended the routing of the Malaysia Airlines plane over the region, saying other carriers were sending their aircraft through the same airspace. Three months ago, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying in areas some way south of where Flight 17 crashed Thursday. Thursday night, the FAA expanded the flight restrictions to all of eastern Ukraine. Airline's troubles . Thursday's crash marks the second time this year that Malaysia Airlines has faced an incident involving a downed plane. In March, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board. Searchers have found no trace of the Boeing 777 or its passengers despite extensive search efforts. Flight 370 probably flew into the southern Indian Ocean on autopilot with an unresponsive crew, Australian authorities said last month. A new underwater search is expected to begin in August.

"The world's eyes may have been focused on the breathtakingly fast political changes unfolding in Ukraine's capital Kiev this week, but it is the Crimean peninsula, where dozens of gunmen raised the Russian flag over parliament Thursday, that should now be the primary source of concern for Ukraine's fledgling government and world leaders. Crimea is an autonomous republic whose history has long been marred by political tension. Gifted to Ukraine by Soviet Union leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954, its population is ethnic Russian by just over half and Ukrainian by a quarter, while more than ten percent are Crimean Tatars who are fiercely anti-Russian as a result of Joseph Stalin's repression of the group a half century ago. Russia's strategically important Black Sea naval fleet is hosted at Sevastopol, the region's largest city, an arrangement that controversially extended until 2042 by the ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was last seen fleeing Kiev. His whereabouts are unknown. The large Russian population of Crimea has long viewed the central government of Ukraine with suspicion. In recent days the mood has turned into aggressive hostility towards the new authorities in Kiev. Crimean Russians see the newly-powerful opposition movement as illegitimate, sponsored by the West, and even fascist. Anti-Ukrainian protests are being held, Russian vigilante groups have sprung up across Crimea, Russian flags have been hoisted on government buildings, clashes have broken out between Russian separatists and loyalist Tatars and Ukrainians, and the Russian military has been seen patrolling key buildings and infrastructure. The Russian Federation has done precious little to contain this dangerous dynamic. On the contrary, its state-sponsored media have covered the unrest in Crimea extensively and reiterated the Kremlin's view of the events in Kiev as a coup d'état. Envoys from Moscow have descended on Crimea to promise Russian citizenship to all who want it and even the region's re-integration into Russia proper. Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry is warning of violations of the human rights of ethnic Russians in Ukraine, while the Russian military is reportedly preparing lists for the evacuation of the families of seamen serving at Sevastopol. Snap military exercises have been ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin close to Ukraine's borders. In short, the Kremlin is stoking the fires of the building separatism that can be observed in Crimea, despite its official commitment to non-interference and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. This situation bears all the hallmarks of several long-standing, often referred to as ""frozen"", conflicts in Eastern Europe. In Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova, in Nagorno-Karabakh, which is contested by Armenia and Azerbaijan, or in Abkhazia and South-Ossetia, which have seceded from Georgia, Russia has long propped up separatists, providing political backing, military support, funding and passports. This undermines the stability of its smaller neighbors, challenges those nations' sovereignty, blocks domestic reforms, and impedes European integration. By underwriting Crimean separatism, Russia is taking the first steps toward repeating such a scenario in Ukraine. So while many in Kiev and in Western capitals are pondering what Russia will do next, the the Kremlin has already made its decision. Russia's choice of tactics is no coincidence. Rather, it is based on a sober analysis of the post-Euro-Maidan situation in Ukraine, particularly Kiev, and of Russia's limited leverage there. The hoped-for public mayhem and political stalemate have not materialized. Western acceptance of the new government thwarts Russian claims of its illegitimacy. The country's industrial east shows little inclination to move closer to Russia, and Western financial aid is shaping up to reduce Ukraine's dependency on money from Moscow. In this constellation, Crimea is the ""weakest link"" in Ukraine today. This leaves the new Ukrainian government with a very difficult choice. It is obliged by the constitution to defend the territorial integrity of Ukraine, to re-establish public order in Crimea, and to guarantee the safety of its citizens there, irrespective of their ethnic background. However, the central government is only just regaining control over the situation, and faces enormous political, economic and social challenges. Its resources are already stretched without having to deal with a strong separatist movement and its even stronger external backer. What is more, Europe and the U.S. will be of very limited help in confronting Crimean separatists and their Russian masters. Ukraine's choice, then, is between consolidating the gains of the Euro-Maidan revolution across most of the country, and risking it all to maintain control over a historically reticent part of Ukraine that may already be lost. The question that has to be answered now is whether Crimea is a price worth paying for getting Ukraine on track for democracy and European integration.

"They dress like allies, but they kill like enemies. Gunmen wearing Afghan military uniforms turning against coalition troops has been an ongoing nightmare for NATO's International Security Assistance Forces. It happened again Tuesday, when a man believed to be an Afghan soldier killed U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Harold Greene and shot several others at a military training facility in Kabul. It's impossible to tell if or when the next ""green-on-blue"" attack might occur. But here's what we do know: . How often do these attacks happen? Such assaults were rare in the first few years of the Afghan War, averaging no more than one a year through 2008, according to the New America Foundation. But after the ""surge"" of 33,000 U.S. troops in 2009, the number of insider attacks jumped to four. The attacks spiked in 2012 with 48, according to a Pentagon report. The incidents have declined since then, with 15 attacks in 2013 and two in the first quarter of 2014, as more troops withdraw and coalition forces try new ways of mitigating the attacks. ""Despite this sharp decline, these attacks may still have strategic effects on the campaign and could jeopardize the relationship between coalition and ANSF (Afghan National Security Forces) personnel,"" a U.S. Defense Department report said. Who carries out these attacks? Sometimes it's actual Afghan soldiers or police officers; sometimes it's insurgents such as Taliban militants disguised as Afghan security forces. The Taliban acknowledged Gen. Greene's killing Tuesday, but hasn't claimed responsibility for it. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said officials believe an Afghan soldier was the gunman. An ISAF official said the group of coalition forces was standing outside, and the attacker shot from inside a nearby building at a distance of about 100 yards. The Pentagon isn't commenting on the possibility of Taliban involvement, saying the Afghan military and international forces are in the early stages of an investigation. But the Taliban have claimed responsibility for previous attacks. The terror group even released a video showing how their fighters trained to break through the fence at Camp Bastion, the site of a 2012 assault that left two U.S. Marines dead and six jets destroyed. NATO said the Taliban militants were wearing U.S. Army uniforms. They also carried automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests. What are the motives? The intentions can run the gamut. Witnessing the horrors of war sometimes inspires soldiers to turn against their onetime allies, said Philip Mudd, a CNN counterterrorism analyst and former CIA official. In 2012, the deadliest year of insider attacks, a Defense Department official said the United States estimated 40% of them were due to Afghan members' own combat or emotional stress, and 15% are a result of intimidation by the insurgency or actually being recruited by it. The official said about 10% came from impersonators who are not part of the military. But in more than 30% of the assaults, no clear motivations were found. In many cases, such as in Tuesday's attack, the answer might never be known because the assailant was killed. How does the Afghan military vet its soldiers? Military recruits are vetted by their high school grades, an entrance exam, a health screening and biometrics, said Daulat Waziri, deputy spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense. They must also pass a background check and provide two references who are government employees. It's still unclear whether the gunman in Tuesday's attack had Taliban ties or whether he slipped through the military's screening process. ""I don't think we should look and make judgments about the vetting process too quickly,"" Mudd said. ""You would think on the surface that maybe he was recruited by the Taliban. That's not necessarily the case."" What about allied forces turning against Afghan civilians? In March 2012, U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales slipped away from the camp where he was stationed and into a village in Kandahar province, where he began shooting at civilians. He returned to the base, reloaded, and went out again to target another village. He left a trail of blood and gore in both villages, with nine children among the dead. Witnesses claimed the U.S. soldier dragged some bodies of his victims' outside and set them ablaze. By the end of the rampage, 16 villagers were dead. Bales was charged with murder and eventually sentenced to life in prison. Bales described his attack as ""an act of cowardice"" and said he'd taken steroids and drank sporadically. The Taliban vowed to retaliate ""by killing and beheading Americans anywhere in the country."" What can be done to mitigate insider attacks? Coalition forces have started using what they call ""guardian angels,"" or armed troops who oversee others during meal times and when soldiers are sleeping. Two years ago, after the deadliest spate of attacks, troops started receiving a fold-up pamphlet called ""Inside the Wire Threats - Afghanistan Green on Blue"" to help prevent such assaults. A Defense Department official said it advises troops under attack who have their own weapons on them to ""resolve the situation with forces at hand"" and not wait for backup. Unarmed troops at meetings or dining halls have been vulnerable in the past, but now, all are carrying their weapons, preloaded with a magazine of ammunition. Weapons must be within arm's reach at all times, according to U.S. military sources. The pamphlet also offers broad indicators of behaviors by Afghans that could indicate they are a threat, the Defense Department official said. Things to watch for include complaints about other countries or religions, comments that advocate violence, a personality change, becoming isolated and not wanting to be around others, speaking in favor of radical ideology or showing an undue interest in coalition base headquarters or living quarters. But Kirby said insider attacks are ""a pernicious threat"" that are ""difficult to always ascertain, to come to grips with ... anywhere, particularly in a place like Afghanistan."" ""Afghanistan is still a war zone,"" he noted. What's the future of U.S. troops in Afghanistan? In February, the Obama administration announced it had started planning for the possible withdrawal of all U.S. troops by the end of 2014 if Afghanistan did not sign a security agreement pertaining to rights of U.S. troops operating there. President Barack Obama called for 9,800 U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan after the end of 2014, along with some allied forces. The number would get cut roughly in half by the end of 2015, and a year later the U.S. military presence would scale down to what officials described as a ""normal"" embassy security contingent.","Afghan defense official: Recruits must pass background checks and provide government references .

"Army Maj. Gen. Harold Greene worked his way up the military over 34 years to become a training leader and infrastructure expert in the U.S. effort to heal war-torn Afghanistan, where he was killed Tuesday. His service took him all over the world, and along the way, he earned two master's degrees in engineering and even a doctorate. Greene was slain when a gunman believed to be an Afghan soldier opened fire at a training facility in Kabul, hitting the general and several others. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno described Greene and soldiers who were wounded in Tuesday's attack as ""professionals, committed to the mission"" in Afghanistan. ""It is their service and sacrifice that define us as an Army,"" Odierno said in statement. Greene was the deputy commander of the Combined Security Transition Command, which is responsible for helping transfer security control in Afghanistan to the Afghans. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said the general was a logistics and infrastructure expert helping to lead training efforts. Throughout his military career, Greene's focus was using technology to make soldiers' lives better, retired Maj. Gen. Robert Scales told The Army TImes. ""He had a real sense of what was important,"" Scales said. ""Harry was always the one who always understood the tactical needs of the close-combat soldiers."" And Greene was someone who many admired, he said. ""He was just very level, down-to-earth,"" Scales told The Army Times. ""It's just devastating that you've got this great genius with this incredible reputation and education, and some Islamist wacko comes in and fires a 10-cent bullet and Harry's life is over. There's a certain unfairness in life that war brings."" 'Singular ability to display wisdom' A native of upstate New York, Greene received his commission as an engineer officer after graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1980, the Army said. He later earned a master's degree in engineering from that school and another master's in engineering from the University of Southern California. He also earned a Ph.D. in materials science from USC. After 1980, he traveled widely and served in posts around the country and the world: Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri; Fort Monmouth, New Jersey;  Army Aviation and Troop Command in St. Louis, Missouri; Fort Polk, Louisiana; Germany; Athens, Greece; and Istanbul, Turkey. Greene had served as deputy for acquisition and systems management in the Army's headquarters in Washington before deploying to Afghanistan, according to an Army website. His prior assignment was the program executive officer leading the group responsible for ""research, development, acquisition, and life cycle management of the Army intelligence, electronic warfare and sensor systems."" When he was promoted to brigadier general in 2009, Greene earned praise for what one military leader called his ""singular ability to display wisdom."" ""He has the rare abilities to make others better, and that's something very special too because at the level he's at right now his ability to inspire others, to show others the way, is so important as well,"" Lt. Gen. Stephen M. Speakes said at the time. Greene told people at the ceremony that his success was part of a team effort. 'Get great things done' ""All I did was try to pull people in the right direction, and they went and did great things. So the reason I'm up here is not what I did, but what all of you did. I know it was truly you guys and gals that did the work the Army recognized today, and for that I thank you,"" he said. ""I was very lucky. I worked with tremendous people, and over the years I was honored to have jobs where I could work with great people and we could get great things done."" In 2011, Greene gave a farewell speech at the Natick Soldier Systems Center in Massachusetts, where he was the senior commander. ""We've accomplished a lot, but there is still a lot of work to do,"" Greene said, according to a description of his remarks on the Army's website. He told the audience he wished he could have made more improvements, like replacing windows so more light would come in. ""The one thing I didn't get to: quality of life and facilities,"" Greene said. ""I wish I could have stayed longer to continue to do more. The workforce here deserves better. We need to keep working to improve the quality of life for the workforce and the soldiers that are stationed here."" Insider attacks: When Afghan soldiers turns and kill allies .","Friend: Maj. Gen.

"When Shakespeare wrote of Richard III as a ""bunchback'd toad,"" he didn't have the benefit of actually seeing the king, who had died in the previous century. Now we know the playwright was probably wrong about Richard's physical features. Scientists have analyzed the bones of the British monarch and determined that he was not actually a hunchback. In fact, he had a significant spinal curve that we would call scoliosis. Researchers published their latest results Thursday in the Lancet. ""It's a twist rather than a forward bend,"" said study co-author Piers Mitchell of the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Cambridge. ""We were expecting him to have a hunchback deformity the way Shakespeare described,"" he added. Richard III reigned over England from 1483 to 1485 and died during the two-hour Battle of Bosworth against the forces of Henry Tudor. The king's remains were discovered in 2012 under a parking lot. Archaeologists determined at that time that Richard III had scoliosis, a condition characterized by a curvature of the spine. Researchers wanted to make sure Richard was like that in life, not just as a result of his bones having been buried for centuries. Just by looking at his skeleton, they had clues. ""A lot of the bones around the maximum part of the curve of his scoliosis were asymmetric. One side was different from the other, which shows that the deformity was a genuine thing during life."" Using computerized tomography, researchers created a three-dimensional reconstruction of Richard's spine. They also made a model of the spine using a 3-D printer. This let them examine the bones more closely than when the spine was in the ground. The spine appeared to have a twist indicative of scoliosis. Researchers measured the angle of curve and used medical research to understand what Richard's life might have been like. The diagnosis of scoliosis means Richard III had a physical health condition in common with about 2% to 3% of the American population, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. ""Buffy"" actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, top golfer Stacy Lewis and Judy Blume's character Deenie all have it, too. Richard's scoliosis was probably not inherited, and it probably began sometime after he was 10, researchers said. Conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy might cause scoliosis, but those are rare explanations, according to the Mayo Clinic. In up to 85% of people with scoliosis, including Richard III, there is no known cause, according to the National Institutes of Health. Doctors call this ""idiopathic."" Normally in scoliosis, the spine takes on a shape that resembles the letter ""S"" or ""C."" Children may be prescribed a brace to prevent further curving. The NIH says patients who are still growing and have curves of more than 25 to 30 degrees, or a curve between 20 to 29 degrees that is getting worse, will be advised to wear a brace. Richard's spine has a curvature of 70 to 80 degrees. Anything over 50 degrees is a candidate for surgery, Mitchell said; the NIH puts this figure at 45 degrees. Research has not proved that chiropractic manipulation, electrical stimulation, nutritional supplementation or exercise stop curves that are worsening, although exercise has other benefits for general well-being. The spinal curve probably wouldn't have reduced Richard's lung capacity such that he couldn't exercise, researchers said. There are other discrepancies between Shakespeare's descriptions and the skeleton besides the back problem, Mitchell said. The real Richard does not appear to have had a limp or a withered arm, as Shakespeare had described. His trunk and abdomen would have appeared short compared with his arms and legs, Mitchell said. His right shoulder would have been slightly higher than the left. His curved spine and these other asymmetries would have been more obvious when the king was unclothed than clothed. ""However, a good tailor and custom-made armour could have minimized the visual impact of this,"" the study's authors wrote.","Scientists made 3-D model of Richard III's spine .

"A popular American fast food restaurant wants you to ""Eat mor chikin"" without antibiotics. Chick-fil-A Inc. announced plans Tuesday to use chicken raised without antibiotics in all of its restaurants within five years. National and regional poultry suppliers are partnering with the company to stock up. Chik-fil-A wants these suppliers to collaborate with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ensure the chickens do not receive any antibiotics. ""Since our family business began 67 years ago, we have focused on our customers. It's why we insist upon using the highest quality ingredients,"" Dan Cathy, president and chief executive officer of Chick-fil-A, said in a statement. ""We want to continue that heritage, and offering antibiotic-free chicken is the next step."" Chick-fil-A is a privately owned company with 1,700 locations in 39 states and Washington. It deems itself the ""second largest quick-service chicken restaurant chain in the United States."" The company produced sales of $5 billion in 2013, the announcement said. 7 other chemicals in your food . What's the big deal about antibiotics? Antibiotics are used in livestock to prevent disease as well as to assist with growth of the animals. In 2011, about 29.9 million pounds of antibiotics were sold for meat and poultry production. By comparison, 7.7 million pounds were sold for human use, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. Chick-fil-A's announcement comes amid a growing awareness about the problem of antibiotic resistance. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said that antibiotics in livestock are contributing to the rise of dangerous bacteria. Many antibiotics that farmers give food-producing animals are also used to treat sick humans. The FDA announced a plan in December to phase out certain antibiotics in the food production industry. ""Because all uses of antimicrobial drugs, in both humans and animals, contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance, it is important to use these drugs only when medically necessary,"" the FDA said on its website. FDA hopes to curb antibiotic use on farms . The National Chicken Council said the Chick-Fil-A move is a ""business decision"" and that many organization members offer poultry lines without antibiotics to provide a choice for consumers. ""Antibiotics are not always used in chicken production; rather, they are administered to prevent and treat disease, only under the care of a licensed veterinarian,"" said Ashley Peterson, National Chicken Council vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs, in a statement. ""The science shows that responsible and judicious use of FDA-approved antibiotics to treat and prevent disease in livestock and poultry is both safe and effective."" Companies responding to health concerns . Chick-fil-A has made other changes to its ingredients in recent years, such as removing yellow dye from its chicken soup. The company is also testing the possibility of taking out other food additives, including artificial ingredients in the buns and high fructose corn syrup in dressings and sauces. Those developments, announced late last year, came after food blogger Vani Hari wrote about controversial ingredients in Chik-fil-A's products. The company responded by inviting her to its headquarters, and Hari posted to her blog in 2012 that she'd had a four-hour meeting there with company executives.  Among the topics covered: The use of antibiotics in their chicken, she said. How 'Food Babe' helped persuade Subway to remove chemical from bread . Hari also recently launched a petition to get the sandwich chain Subway to remove a chemical called azodicarbonamide, also found in yoga mats and shoe soles, from its breads. Subway announced last week that it was in the process of taking azodicarbonamide out ""as part of our bread improvement efforts."" In addition, the food blogger has shown her power in the pasta arena. After Hari posted a petition on Change.org, Kraft said in November that it would remove Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6 dyes from some varieties of its Macaroni & Cheese products. The color additives will be nixed from pastas shaped like SpongeBob SquarePants, Nickelodeon's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" from Dreamworks, a company spokeswoman told CNN.

"A Russian space rocket launch went sour Friday, destroying the booster and its payload, Russian state media said. Nine minutes after the Proton-M rocket lifted off in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on Friday, officials on the ground lost contact with the it, ITAR-Tass reported, citing an official from Russia's Federal Space Agency. The rocket had veered off path, causing an emergency system to cut off propulsion. The rocket, which was carrying a communications satellite into orbit, was about 100 miles high into its ascent at the time and burned up in the atmosphere, the agency reported. But the agency also said that part of the rocket could be in a ""non-intended orbit"" and small pieces could fall down to Earth. Friday's mishap marks the second time a Proton rocket has destructed after liftoff within a year and is one in a series of failures. In July, an unmanned Proton rocket exploded after liftoff over Kazakhstan. In 2010, another Proton-M rocket carrying three satellites crashed in the Pacific Ocean. And in 1999, a Proton rocket exploded six minutes after liftoff, destroying the rocket and its payload. The Russian Federation is known for its active space program; it carried out more than 30 space launches last year, according to a Russian media report.

"(CNN) -- A week before her death, South African model Reeva Steenkamp talked about her secure, blissful environment. ""I woke up in a happy, safe home this morning,"" she tweeted. ""Not everyone did."" Four days after she posted that message, neither did she. The 29-year-old model was shot dead by her boyfriend at his house in Pretoria. She died on Valentine's Day last year. Read More: Who is ""Blade Runner"" Oscar Pistorius? Her boyfriend, Olympian Oscar Pistorius, 27, has been convicted of culpable homicide, the South African term for unintentionally -- but unlawfully -- killing a person. He was also found guilty of one gun charge in an unrelated shooting at a restaurant. Pistorius has admitted to shooting Steenkamp but says he mistook her for an intruder. Beauty and brains . Before she started dating Pistorius, Steenkamp was famous in her own right. She was a striking, platinum-haired model, gearing up for her reality television debut. A law school graduate, she had a vibrant personality and a slew of modeling gigs under her belt. A haunting message . Her growing exposure brought more opportunities. She was a presenter for FashionTV in South Africa, an FHM cover girl and the face of cosmetics company Avon. FHM described her as a ""beautiful, intelligent and warm-hearted woman"" who had a ""wicked"" sense of humor. ""She was the kindest, sweetest human being, an angel on earth,"" said Capacity Relations, the agency that represented her. And her fame was growing. 'I don't have any regrets' Two days after her death, a prerecorded reality show in which she appeared as a contestant aired. In the context of what transpired, her message in it sounds haunting. ""I'm going home with sort of a sweet taste in my mouth. I don't have any regrets. I don't have any bitterness. I'm going to miss you all so much and I love you very, very much,"" she said as she blew a kiss to the camera. South Africa's national broadcaster aired the show ""Tropika Island of Treasure"" showing a clip discussing her exit from the taped program. The show features local celebrities competing for prize money. Power couple . Steenkamp was born in Cape Town but moved to Johannesburg years ago to pursue modeling. The two became an item around November 2012, and were popular in South African social circles. She constantly referred to him as ""my boo"" on social media and posted pictures of their vacations together. But phone messages read during the trial showed a couple that had some rocky patches as well. In some of the messages, she accused him of being overly jealous and overbearing. But he said he loved her and was planning a life with her. About a month before her death, the model shared a picture collage that included the runner. ""Some of my favorite people,"" she described the picture. Shortly after they met, she posted a message that appeared to make a reference to their love. ""The only guy you need in your life is the one who proves that he needs you in his,"" she said. They had big dreams . Pistorius' relatives said she made him happy. ""All of us saw at first hand how close she had become to Oscar during that time and how happy they were,"" said Arnold Pistorius, his uncle. Both had big dreams, the uncle said. ""They had plans together and Oscar was happier in his private life than he had been for a long time,"" he said. ""We are all grieving for Reeva, her family and her friends. Oscar -- as you can imagine -- is also numb with shock as well as grief.""

"Prince George made his first public appearance in three months Wednesday, as he arrived with his parents, Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, for his christening at St. James's Palace. The baby prince smiled as he was shown off to family members including his great-grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, before the royals entered the Chapel Royal. George was dressed in an elaborate lace and satin christening gown that's a replica of one made in 1841 for the christening of Queen Victoria's eldest daughter. Being baptized into the church is more significant for George than for most people, since he is in line to become king, which would also make him the supreme governor of the Church of England. The occasion was kept uncharacteristically small, in a shift away from the larger ceremonies that his father and grandfather enjoyed at Buckingham Palace. His grandfather Prince Charles and uncle, Prince Harry, were among the select few invited to the ceremony, along with Catherine's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, and her siblings, James and Pippa. New photos of Prince George released . The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Justin Welby, greeted the guests as they arrived at the chapel. The royal baby, who was born in July, has seven godparents, among them Prince William's cousin Zara Tindall, daughter of Princess Anne, and close friends of the couple. They include Oliver Baker, who got to know William and Catherine at St. Andrew's University, Emilia Jardine-Paterson, who went to school with Catherine, and William van Cutsem, a childhood friend of William. The other godparents are Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, a former private secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry; Julia Samuel, who was a good friend of William's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales; and Earl Grosvenor, son of the Duke of Westminster. The replica christening gown was brought into use in 2008 to help preserve the 170-year-old original, used until then for every royal christening, including those of Prince William and his father, Charles. The venue for the christening also has a special significance for Prince William. The body of his mother, Diana, rested in the Chapel Royal for five days before her funeral in 1997. After the service, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, held a private tea at Clarence House. The guests were served slices of christening cake, which is a tier taken from William and Catherine's 2011 wedding cake. Prince William interview: Future king talks fatherhood, baby George . 'What a gift' In a short video posted on his website, Welby spoke of the significance of the baby prince's baptism, which will see him ""join the family of the church,"" numbering almost 2 billion people around the world. Welby said any christening was a moment for the parents to celebrate the birth of their child, royal or not. ""All babies are unbelievably special, not only royal babies,"" he said. But Prince George's christening does carry an extra significance, he said. ""As a nation we are celebrating the birth of someone who in due course will be the head of state. That's extraordinary. It gives you this sense of forward looking, of the forwardness of history as well as the backwardness of history, and what a gift to have this new life and to look forward."" As with any other infant's baptism, Welby marked the Prince with the sign of the cross on his forehead and splash water on his head. The silver font  used for George's baptism has been used for every royal christening since 1841 and will be filled with water from the River Jordan. The 3-month-old boy has already made history. He's the first royal baby to be honored with a christening coin from the Royal Mint. The design of the coins, produced by the mint in a range of sizes and materials, has been approved by his parents and the Queen, the Royal Mint said. The public can buy the keepsakes, which start at 13 pounds ($21) for the simplest type but rise to a whopping 50,000 pounds ($80,000) for a version containing a kilogram of gold. A historic look at royal baby clothes . Service details . Prince George's christening  ceremony included two hymns, two lessons and two anthems, according to Kensington Palace. Prince Harry read him a lesson form John 15:1-5, and his aunt Pippa Middleton read Luke 18:15-17. The music started with a processional, Bach's ""Fantasia in G,"" played on organ. The Choir of Her Majesty's Chapel Royal, made up of six men and 10 boys, sang the anthem ""Blessed Jesu! Here we Stand,"" which was written for the baptism of baby George's father, Prince William, in 1982. The second anthem was ""The Lord Bless You and Keep You"" by John Rutter. The newest royal also heard the hymns ""Breathe on Me, Breathe on God"" and ""Be Thou My Vision"" before the organ played the recessional, which was C.W. Widor's Toccata from Symphony No. 5.","Prince George christened in small, private event at St. James's Palace .

"For Hannah Chung, at least one element of her parents' culture was something of an acquired taste. Kimchi -- a pungent blend of fermented vegetables and spices -- is a staple of the Korean table, and is typically offered amid a series of banchan, or free side dishes that are meant to accompany and complement the main dish. But for Chung, it was a dish that made her feel removed from the dominant culture, not included. ""I actually rebelled against my parents by refusing to eat kimchi sometimes, and I've actually found out that that's a super common experience among second-generation Koreans,"" she says. ""I got made fun of for all the foods I ate,"" Chung, a second-generation Korean-American, recalls. ""I didn't want to invite my friends over to my house because my house smelled like kimchi and Korean food, and it was really embarrassing for me."" Bridging generations and cultures, one blistering bowl of bibimbap at a time . After her grandmother, the family kimchi maker, passed away, Chung found she longed for the taste she once so adamantly rejected in her youth. So Chung decided to start making her own version, and relied on her experience of working in several top Atlanta restaurants to find the right formula. Now, Chung considers herself a ""kimchi missionary"" and has turned her craving into a full-fledged commercial operation called Simply Seoul Kitchen. Cabbage is the most widely used kimchi vegetable, but as the popularity of fermentation and Korean food grows in the U.S., makers are experimenting with other leafy vegetables like collard greens as well as Daikon radishes and Brussels sprouts. Commercial production has not always gone perfectly for Chung, who once during the development phase had to throw away about 50 jars because she'd gotten the salt measurements wrong. But now that she's mastered the making (and offers varieties including white Napa, cabbage, cucumber, radish and more) she still has one hurdle to clear. The kid with the stinky lunch . ""Kimchi has a bad rap out there,"" she says. ""People have tried kimchi for the first time at Korean restaurants where they cut costs. They don't have the time to dedicate to make real kimchi -- and it's pretty untasty."" Because of the difficulty involved in producing a high-quality product, she saw the perfect opportunity to fill that niche and offer people a perception-altering taste of a misunderstood dish. From there, it's all about letting the average consumer know what Koreans have known for centuries: Nothing else packs the same combination of sour, spice, texture and funk in one package. Stall confessions: Life lessons from my lunch box . The author offers these tips for the optimal kimchi experience: . -- Open jars over or near a sink. The contents are under pressure from gas created by fermentation and can rise out of the jar after it's open.-- Many kimchi enthusiasts opt to keep a second refrigerator in the garage for kimchi storage, so the funky smells are kept away from the other food and living areas.-- Kimchi sold in stores may be as fresh as a week-and-a-half old, but the flavors will continue to develop in the jar. Chung says the flavors of kimchi deepen even more after six months or so.-- Kimchi most often accompanies Korean food, but also goes well with burgers, tacos, hot dogs or even on eggs for breakfast.","Kimchi is a Korean dish of fermented vegetables, and served with most meals .

"(CNN)Vice presidential ear whispers. Awkward actor-singer chin grabs. And who could forget the belly grab-cheek smooch that rocked the Internet? It's enough to make you ask: What in the world has happened to personal space? Or, in the case of the Internet, you make fun. There's John Travolta kissing not actress Scarlett Johansson -- as in the original incident from Sunday's Academy Awards -- but Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un or the Statue of Liberty. Then there's Travolta holding ""Frozen"" star Idina Menzel's chin and being urged to ""Let her go ... let her go!"" ""Today's word. #Travolta - (verb) - To touch (meaning) - For example, I like to travolta your cheeks,"" Twitter user @IamMrTex wrote Tuesday. Of course, invasions of personal space aren't anything new. It's been more than 20 years since ""Seinfeld"" brought us the ""close talker,"" and it was old news even then. But all the jokes aside -- and there were plenty --  there is a serious side to this. Take a look at these photos, and a theme emerges. There's Travolta grabbing Johansson, who received an even more invasive grab at the 2006 Golden Globes, when designer Isaac Mizrahi actually grabbed her breast on the red carpet while checking out the construction of her dress. Then there's Biden gripping the shoulders of Stephanie Carter, the wife of the new U.S. defense secretary, last week. That image evoked memories of former President George W. Bush's awkward shoulder massage of German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the 2006 G8 summit. Though the notion of cultural space varies with culture, Americans are undisputed champions for a large personal zone, argues University of Massachusetts, Amherst psychology professor Susan Krauss Whitbourne. And although they make might for laughs by violating the unspoken rules of personal space in such egregious ways, Travolta, Biden and others are demonstrating a cultural disregard for women, she said. ""Breaking those zones shows a lack of respect,"" she said. ""It's a way of showing your power."" Don't argue that it happens to everyone, columnist Barbara Ellen wrote in the Guardian. ""Even though it happens to some males sometimes, it happens to females all the time,"" she said. ""Try to imagine the White House situation with the roles reversed -- Stephanie Carter gripping Biden's shoulders; or, to even things up, Hillary Clinton or Angela Merkel doing the grabbing and whispering,"" she said. ""It's implausible to say the least."" The power plays do happen among men but take on a different cast. There's a whole field of research into the ""power handshake"" -- who stands where and does what -- that elevates a simple, quiet greeting into proxy chest thumping. And then there's trying to escape when one latches on a party, author Mark Mason wrote in the Spectator this week. ""There's a particular breed of alpha who displays his credentials by standing unnervingly close to you, his face just a few inches from yours, eye contact maintained for what seems like centuries,"" he wrote. ""Some of them even avoid blinking,"" he said. ""Or is that just how it feels?""","Personal space gaffes by John Travolta, Vice President Joe Biden make for new memes .

"The second-in-command of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was killed in a recent counter-terrorism operation, the Yemeni government confirmed Thursday. Abu Sufyan al-Azdi, also known as Saeed al-Shahri, died after being wounded in the governorate of Saadah on November 28, said the Supreme National Security Committee of Yemen. He was also one of the most wanted men in Saudi Arabia. Al-Azdi was buried by militants linked to al Qaeda at an undisclosed location inside Yemen, the government said in a statement. Read more: Drone kills 6 suspected militants in Yemen . The confirmation comes a day after a prominent jihadist announced that al-Azdi died ""after a long journey in fighting the Zio-Crusader campaign."" That jihadist was Abdulla bin Muhammad, who used his Twitter account to report the purported death. The tweet was reported by SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors global terrorism. Al-Azdi was co-founder and deputy emir of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and had ""survived multiple operations in the past,"" the government said. Al-Azdi ""was a coconspirator in a number of AQAP foreign operations and was possibly involved in the kidnappings and killings of foreigners in Yemen,"" the government said. ""Dozens of brave Yemeni officers and innocent civilians have lost their lives in this ongoing war. Yemen remains committed to fighting terrorism and eradicating extremism."" This week, the Arabic news network Al-Arabiya also reported al-Azdi's death, citing his relatives. But three senior Yemeni defense ministry officials told CNN the country then had no evidence proving his death. Al-Azdi had been falsely reported dead in the past, the latest incident being in September when Yemen claimed he was killed in an air raid. An audio message released the next month supposedly featured al-Azdi saying he was still alive. Al-Azdi spent six years in the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay before being released in 2007. A Saudi national, he escaped Saudi Arabia to Yemen in 2008. Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi announced in October that Yemen would step up its military operations with the United States against al Qaeda operatives. U.S. drone activity increased in 2012 targeting senior leaders of AQAP. At the same time, al Qaeda carried out a number of attacks on military and security commanders, personnel, patrols and installations, killing more than 60 people, according to Yemen's Interior Ministry.","Al Qaeda's No. 2 leader in Arabia was Abu Sufyan al-Azdi, also named Saeed al-Shahri .

"China and ""probably one or two other"" countries have the capacity to shut down the nation's power grid and other critical infrastructure through a cyber attack, the head of the National Security Agency told a Congressional panel Thursday. Admiral Michael Rogers, who also serves the dual role as head of U.S. Cyber Command, said the United States has detected malware from China and elsewhere on U.S. computers systems that affect the daily lives of every American. ""It enables you to shut down very segmented, very tailored parts of our infrastructure that forestall the ability to provide that service to us as citizens,"" Rogers said in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Rogers said such attacks are part of the ""coming trends"" he sees based on ""reconnaissance"" currently taking place that nation-states, or other actors may use to exploit vulnerabilities in U.S. cyber systems. A recent report by Mandiant, a cyber-security firm, found that hackers working on behalf of the Chinese government were able to penetrate American public utility systems that service everything from power generation, to the movement of water and fuel across the country. Related: Mandiant - China is sponsoring cyber espionage . ""We see them attempting to steal information on how our systems are configured, the very schematics of most of our control systems, down to engineering level of detail so they can look at where are the vulnerabilities, how are they constructed, how could I get in and defeat them,"" Rogers said.  ""We're seeing multiple nation-states invest in those kinds of capabilities."" Admiral Rogers declined to identify who the other countries, beside China, because of the classified nature of their identities.   Russia is generally regarded as also having an aggressive cyber program. In addition to nation-state actors, Admiral Rogers noted the increasing presence of ""surrogate"" criminal actors in cyberspace that serve to obscure the hidden hand of criminal activity done on behalf of formal nation-states. ""That's a troubling development for us,"" Rogers said. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, the retiring chairman of the committee, called the groups ""cyber hit men for hire"" for nation-state actors in cyberspace. The testimony also comes in the wake of a report from the Pew Internet and American Life Project that cited a prediction by technology experts that a catastrophic cyber-attack that causes significant losses in life and financial damage would occur by 2025. Related: Catastrophic cyber attack looms . Admiral Rogers told the committee he did not disagree with the assessment. In addition to the threats from specific nation-states, Admiral Rogers said there are already groups within the U.S. cyber architecture who seek to cause major damage to corporate and other critical sectors of the American economy. ""It is only a matter of the when, not the if, that we are going to see something traumatic."" he said.","The head of U.S. Cyber Command said China has the ability to attack the U.S. power grid .

"Texas Gov. Rick Perry, calling his indictment politically motivated, vowed Saturday to fight charges he abused his power by trying to pressure a district attorney to resign. ""This farce of a prosecution will be revealed for what it is, and those responsible will be held accountable,"" Perry said at a news conference in Austin, the capital. A grand jury in Travis County indicted Perry, a Republican, on two felony counts stemming from his threat to veto funding for a statewide public integrity unit run by Travis Country District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, unless she stepped down, according to the special prosecutor in the case, Michael McCrum. The case centers on Perry's June 2013 veto of the $7.5 million budget for the unit run by Lehmberg, after she refused his demand to resign following her drunken driving arrest and conviction. Perry faces accusations of coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity in connection with the threat and veto. Right to veto? According to McCrum, the indictment alleges that the circumstances around Perry's veto threat amounted to a misuse of state money earmarked by the Legislature to fund the public integrity unit in Travis County run by Lehmberg. The second charge alleges that he improperly used the veto threat to get her to resign following her arrest on a drunk driving charge. She stayed in office. But the governor said under the state constitution he has the discretionary right to veto items in the state budget. ""I exercised this discretion,"" he said. Read the indictment (PDF) Perry defended his actions, pointing to Lehmberg's blood alcohol level at the time of her arrest in April 2013 and then her behavior during her arrest, which was captured on video and made public. ""Given that information and given that choice again, that is exactly what I would do again,"" Perry said. The governor said the indictment amounted to nothing more than ""abuse of power."" ""We don't settle political differences with indictments in this country,"" Perry said. CNN affiliate KVUE reported that Perry will have to report to the Travis County Jail in Austin to be booked, fingerprinted and have his photo made for a mugshot. Political implications . Perry can continue to serve as governor while under indictment, KVUE reported. His attorneys could seek to have the charges thrown out, a motion that would delay the case, at the very least. The charges have serious political implications, both in Texas and beyond. Perry is entering his final few months in office after a historic 14-year run in Austin. Perry's presidential prospects could be damaged. It's an open secret he's laying groundwork for a second presidential campaign after his disastrous 2012 effort. The governor is scheduled to visit the early primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina in the coming weeks to meet with Republican activists and legislators. He has positioned himself as an early conservative alternative to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another GOP presidential contender. Perry attorney David L. Botsford on Friday called the indictment a violence of the separation of powers, saying it ""sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a grand jury to punish the exercise of a lawful and constitutional authority afforded to the Texas governor."" The special prosecutor, McCrum, told the San Antonio Express-News the claim the case was politically motivated was ""not only ridiculous, but it's disappointing."" ""I think it's important to note that while that may be good rhetoric for the state, there's absolutely no basis for it,"" he told the newspaper. ""My investigation not only did not involve that, but my conversations with Mr. Botsford have never involved that. It's always been about the facts and the law. That's what this case is all about --- the facts and the law, and nothing else."" Support for Perry . Even so, a number of national political figures -- on both sides of the political line -- came to Perry's defense. ""Unless he was demonstrably trying to scrap the ethics unit for other than his stated reason, Perry indictment seems pretty sketchy,"" David Axelrod, President Barack Obama's former top adviser, said in a post on Twitter. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, also took to Twitter on the issue: ""the indictment of @GovernorPerry seems politically motivated and ridiculous. Major overreach and an encroachment on his veto authority."" But the Texas Democratic Party called on Perry to resign, saying in a written statement that the governor ""brought  dishonor to his office, his family and the state of Texas. ""We call on Governor Perry to immediately step down from office. Texans deserve real leadership and this is unbecoming of our governor."" Perry's indictment is the first of a sitting governor in Texas on such charges since 1917 when, according to The Dallas Morning News, James ""Pa"" Ferguson was indicted for vetoing funding for the University of Texas in an attempt to push out faculty and staff. He resigned. Opinion: The case against Perry .","Gov. Rick Perry says the indictment is politically motivated and vows to fight it .

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been crystal clear about the goals of Operation Protective Edge. Destroy Hamas' tunnels, end its rocket-fire (and that of Islamic Jihad), and bring about ""sustainable quiet"" for the people of Israel by demilitarizing Gaza. Those aims were restated by Netanyahu's spokesman, Mark Regev, as the latest ceasefire came into force Tuesday. ""We don't want to see that terrorist military machine rebuilt,"" he told CNN. ""We have to make sure that Gaza stays demilitarized."" After nearly a month of combat, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) say they have destroyed 32 ""offensive"" tunnels. Hamas' stocks of rockets have been depleted (by about two-thirds), its launch facilities hit hard, the IDF says. But how do you define ""demilitarized?"" Hamas' short-range mortars killed more Israelis than its rockets -- does Israel insist on those being surrendered? How would they even be found? And by whom? Sustainable quiet will depend on factors Israel can influence, but not control: Above all its willingness to offer the 1.8 million people of Gaza a future that is something better than an open prison. It's estimated around two-thirds of Gazans have never left the Strip; Palestinian writer Amir Nizar Zuabi speaks of a desperate fatalism after nearly a decade of conflict. ""We, who were attacked from the sky, from the sea, from the fields, who had one-ton bombs dropped on our heads in pointless rounds of killing, have turned our back on life,"" he wrote in Haaretz this week. Can they turn again -- and glimpse a future in which they can sell their produce in foreign markets and travel freely, in which they can find work, build homes and see their children receive an education without the overhanging fear of the next bombardment? Such a possibility was envisaged in the agreement that ended the last conflict in 2012 and provided for ""opening the crossings and facilitating the movements of people and transfer of goods, and refraining from restricting residents' free movements and targeting residents in border areas."" But the agreement was not implemented. ""Israel had committed to holding indirect negotiations with Hamas over the implementation of the ceasefire but repeatedly delayed them,"" partly because of domestic political considerations, writes Nathan Thrall, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, in the London Review of Books. Israeli officials and analysts have cited elections and coalition-building as delaying any meaningful engagement, even though 2013 saw fewer rocket attacks than any year since 2006. Will it be different this time? The destruction of entire Gaza neighborhoods (Zeitoun, Beit Hanoun, Khuzaa to name but three) and the displacement of more than 500,000 people according to U.N. estimates Tuesday  -- will demand a huge reconstruction program. Netanyahu says Israel is ""demanding that the rehabilitation of Gaza be linked to its demilitarization."" On the contrary, says Maen Areikat, the PLO's envoy in the U.S.: ""What they should offer is an end to the blockade, an end to the occupation, before they can even ask the Palestinians to consider the idea of being demilitarized."" Retired Brigadier-General Yossi Kuperwasser, Director-General of Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs, says this linkage or sequencing is the $64,000 question. ""The old ideas didn't work,"" he said. ""We need new ones. We have to make sure the international community takes steps so that cement coming into Gaza is used for civilian projects."" Kuperwasser said a ""totally different structure of supervision should be in place"" before Israel can allow what might be called dual-use materials into Gaza. That structure would include, according to Israeli officials, a Palestinian Authority police force at the Rafah crossing into Egypt. The European Union has offered to reactivate its Border Assistance Mission, which operated at the Rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007, as a second layer of supervision at all crossings. Hamas: a change of heart, or tactics? Will Hamas, chastened by a devastating onslaught that has left hundreds of its fighters dead or captured, and which has seen the tunnels in which it invested so heavily blown up and bulldozed, simply start over -- preparing for the next round? Or will it see a new reality amid the dust and rubble? Few observers expect Hamas to give up the language of defiance. It can derive some satisfaction from the level of resistance its fighters offered, especially in close-quarters fighting in places like Shujayya. The predictions of some Israeli officials that Hamas fighters would melt away once the going got tough were confounded. Veteran defense writer Amos Harel says in Haaretz: ""Hamas was not defeated; the organization will remain in power in Gaza and [will be] the key partner in any future agreement."" But the movement is beleaguered. Its leadership has gone underground, literally and metaphorically, to avoid assassination by IDF air-strikes. It faces a severe financial crisis, unable to pay the salaries of government employees. It's been abandoned by former patrons Iran and Syria, and is caught in the growing Shia-Sunni divide across the Arab world. Its chief financier, Qatar, which has stepped in to pay $20 million a month in wages to Gazan workers, is under pressure from other Gulf states to scale back support for Hamas. Above all President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt has strangled Hamas economically and militarily. Soon after the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsy a year ago, el-Sisi -- then military chief -- moved to close the smuggling tunnels under the Egyptian-Gaza border, depriving Hamas of much-needed revenue and its only way to import weapons. Hamas may also face growing dissent within Gaza, or at least less support, as people weigh up the cost, in human and financial terms, of the latest conflict. In Shujayya Tuesday, Hany Mahmoud el Harezen surveyed the ruins of his house. ""I am a wedding photographer. I have nothing to do with this war,"" he told CNN. ""Maybe if we had got some concessions it would be worth it, but we got nothing."" It appears to be a growing sentiment, and one that Kuperwasser thinks will help change Hamas' calculations. ""It has made a strategic decision,"" he says, ""to give up part of its terrorist identity in order to keep control over Gaza."" Netanyahu's options . For now, Netanyahu can negotiate from a position of strength.  He, his Defense Minister and the Israeli Chief of Staff have enjoyed better than 80% approval ratings for much of the campaign, despite the deaths of more than 60 Israeli soldiers -- a far higher toll than during the fully-fledged invasion of Gaza in 2008-09. ""There is trust from the Israeli public that this triumvirate know exactly what they are doing,"" said Marcus Sheff of the Israel Project. ""They feel they have a leadership that is controlled and moderate in defending them and doing what needs to be done on the military and political level."" Even the opposition Labor Party has praised the conduct of the campaign. ""They operate very carefully, proportionately. I think they defend Israel through their decisions,"" Labor Knesset member Nachman Shai told CNN. If anything, it is the right-wing that challenges Netanyahu -- with some in the coalition government saying the campaign in Gaza has not gone far enough and that Hamas should be crushed. Netanyahu has warned cabinet ministers pushing for a more aggressive approach to fall into line. He appears to accept that Hamas cannot be eradicated, certainly not without a full occupation of Gaza that would be a quagmire and entail international condemnation. Some Israeli officials believe Hamas actually serves a purpose -- preventing fundamentalist groups like Islamic Jihad from taking over Gaza. They are also happy to see the Palestinians in two camps: Hamas and the Palestinian Authority rather than united under one flag. An end to the two-state solution? Netanyahu is now the second-longest serving Prime Minister in Israel's history, To some observers his longevity is down to his innate caution, his refusal to make compromises that might down the road put Israel's security at risk. As the latest conflict in Gaza erupted, he said that had Israel given up security control of the West Bank, it would be inviting disaster. ""If we were to pull out of Judea and Samaria, like they tell us to, there'd be a possibility of thousands of tunnels"" Expanding on the theme, Netanyahu added: ""There cannot be a situation under any agreement in which we relinquish security control of the territory west of the River Jordan."" To many observers in Israel that was shorthand for ""there will be no Palestinian state."" The prospect of a wider peace deal seems as far away as ever, even if its essential components are the same as they were 20 years ago -- a two-state solution, co-existence between Israel and the West Bank with mutually agreed territorial swaps, and the removal of most Jewish settlements from the West Bank. Senior Israeli officials look at the turmoil around them, from Iraq and Syria to Libya, and ask whether settling the Palestinian issue is still the most pressing of the day. Arab governments are preoccupied with survival, not Palestinian liberation. Kuperwasser at Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs says the real threat to the region is Islamist radicalism; and that has brought together Israel and moderate Arab states such as Egypt and Jordan (and by extension Saudi Arabia.) To many observers, an agreement between Fatah and Hamas signed on April 23 this year  provides the best -- perhaps the only -- hope of breaking the cycle of violence. In it, Hamas agreed to a ""consensus government"" of Palestinians that pledged non-violence, the recognition of Israel, and adherence to past agreements, a government that would restore the influence of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. ""Tragically, Israel rejected this opportunity for peace and has succeeded in preventing the new government's deployment in Gaza,"" say former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Mary Robinson, a former U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, in ""Foreign Policy."" If this government is now allowed to take root in Gaza, to take responsibility for its reconstruction and allow for an internationally-agreed and verifiable program of demilitarization, perhaps the future can be different. But as Nathan Thrall of the International Crisis Group concludes: ""This solution would of course have been available to Israel, the U.S., Egypt and the Palestinian Authority in the weeks and months before the war began, before so many lives were shattered.""","Israel has been clear that the aim of Operation Protective Edge was to demilitarize Hamas .
But CNN's Tim Lister says, to secure peace, Israel needs to offer Gazans a better future .
He says many observers believe a Fatah-Hamas deal in April was the best chance for peace .

"The Dallas Safari Club auctioned off a black rhino hunting permit in Namibia for $350,000, according to the club's public relations firm. Wealthy hunters gathered Saturday evening inside the Dallas Convention Center to bid on the rare chance to hunt one of the world's most endangered animals. The Safari Club says the auction was done in the name of conservation, to save the threatened black rhinoceros. All proceeds will be donated to the Namibian government and will be earmarked for conservation efforts, club officials say. Animal conservationists estimate there are only about 5,000 black rhinos in the world, 1,700 of which are in the southern Africa nation. They are considered a ""critically endangered species"" by wildlife organizations around the world. ""This is the best way to have the biggest impact on increasing the black rhino population,"" said Ben Carter, executive director of the Dallas Safari Club. Sacrificing one animal for the greater good of the endangered species is a move that critics and animal conservation groups call ""perverse"" and a ""sad joke."" ""They need to be protected, not sold to the highest bidder,"" said Jeffrey Flocken of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). ""It also sends a dangerous message that these iconic and disappearing animals are worth more as dead trophies to be mounted and hung on a wall in a Texas mansion than living in the wild in Africa."" Photos: Tourist trophy hunters chase African wildlife . Helping or hurting the species? The auction has sparked a contentious debate over the best way to protect the species that has been brought to the edge of extinction because of man's appetite for its horn, which is used for daggers, ornaments and, in Asia, traditional medicine. The Dallas Safari Club said it has received a string of death threats over the auction. The FBI is investigating the threats. ""If a violation of federal law is determined, then additional investigation will take place if necessary,"" said Katherine Chaumont, spokeswoman for the Dallas FBI office. The club obtained the hunting permit from the Namibian government. It's the first time a black rhino hunting permit has been auctioned off outside the country. In recent years, the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism, which oversees the protection of the black rhinos, has allowed three permits a year. In a letter to the Dallas Safari Club, the Namibian government said, ""To hunt a black rhino is not taken lightly by Namibia. ... Only old geriatric bulls, which are marginalized in the population and do not contribute to reproduction, are trophy hunted."" The Dallas Safari Club says the Namibian government will closely monitor the winning bidder's hunting expedition. The club also insists that by allowing a handful of predetermined rhinos to be killed, it's actually protecting younger, stronger rhinos. ""They've already picked out two or three black rhino males that are old, nonbreeding males that are not contributing to the population anymore,"" Carter said. ""We know it's the right way to do it. We're relying on science and biologists. This is the best way to support the population of black rhinos."" But some wildlife conservationists say that argument is dubious. ""It's a farce to say that this is being done for conservation,"" Flocken said. ""It's saying the rarity of this animal is worth more dead than alive."" Several groups such as IFAW argue it would be better to use these rhinos to promote wildlife viewing and ecotourism by charging people for the experience of seeing one of these ancient beasts up close in the wild. 'It really is a dilemma' The biggest threat to these massive beasts is poachers across the African continent. Rhino horns are lucrative on the black market. In Asia, where there are claims it can treat everything from headaches and food poisoning to rheumatism and cancer, horns can fetch up to $60,000 per kilogram, putting its value somewhere between gold and pure cocaine. In the 1980s, the black rhino population had dwindled to just a few dozen. Conservation efforts have slowly helped beef up herd numbers, but poachers are still a threat. Marcia Fargnoli, chief executive officer of the Save the Rhino Trust in Namibia, which works with the government to fight poachers, says the group has tried to convince the Namibian government to stop issuing these hunting permits. But a poor African country like Namibia -- where the World Bank estimates the gross per capita income to be less than $6,000 -- struggles to fund conservation efforts, Fargnoli says. It's difficult for the government to ignore the chance to raise so much money so quickly. ""I really believe every rhino counts,"" said Fargnoli. ""It really is a dilemma. ...But I really struggle to say I'm saving rhinos and then say that one can be hunted."" Poachers are the prey in a park in Republic of Congo .

"Sochi, Russia (CNN) -- The Olympic city has a dog problem. Thousands of stray canines wander the streets and suburbs of Sochi. They can be seen loping through the recently completed parks and housing developments that have sprung up around what was once a sleepy Black Sea resort. In the countdown to the Winter Games, Russian animal rights activists have accused city authorities of ramping up a campaign to exterminate street dogs through the use of poison. Yulia Krasova says she witnessed the long, agonizing death of a street dog when she walked out of a movie theater in Sochi two weeks ago. ""At first I thought someone beat the dog,"" she recalled. ""The dog jumped up and started running around in circles. Then she fell down and started spitting up ... I called the veterinarian. He said there is a 100% guarantee the dog was poisoned."" Krasova filmed the dying dog with her cell phone. So did Irina Gutnik, another Sochi resident. Gutnik said she encountered a dog convulsing and barking in fear and pain in Sochi's Bitka neighborhood in December. ""They always poison the street dogs here,"" Krasova said. ""But in December it got terrible ... they began poisoning the animals terribly before the Olympics."" Reports of the widespread culling of animals have put city and Olympic officials on the defensive. ""All stray dogs that are found on the Olympic Park are collected by a professional veterinary contractor for the well-being of the people on the Park and the animals themselves,"" the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee said in a statement this week. ""All healthy animals are released following their health check."" Vladimir Makarenko, the head of the administration for Sochi's Hostinski district, said volunteers were welcome to take stray dogs to a brand new shelter recently opened on the outskirts of the city. But the announcement of new government-backed shelter was met with deep distrust by members of the grassroots network of animal rights activists in Sochi. ""Over the last couple of days, when this uproar began, they built this new shelter just for the media,"" said Vlada Provotorova, a dentist who built her own make-shift shelter to protect dogs from extermination. Animal rights activists in Sochi sent CNN photos of three recent contracts signed between the Sochi city government and Basia Services, a company headquartered in Rostov-on-Don. In one of the documents, dated May 24, 2013, the city government agreed to pay the company 99,450 rubles [roughly $2,800] for the ""trapping and gathering of neglected animals."" CNN made several attempts to speak by phone with executives at Basia Services. Company representatives declined to respond to allegations their employees poisoned street animals. As alarm grows among Russian dog lovers, some animal rights activists have taken matters into their own hands. Last month, one Muscovite, Igor Airapetyan, drove all the way to Sochi to pick up a van-load of street dogs that he then ""evacuated"" to the Russian capital. Video of the journey trip was posted on a Facebook page titled ""Death in Sochi."" Meanwhile, Provotorova and several friends continue to donate time and money to feed, house and sterilize the dozen street dogs they placed in a small kennel they built on the outskirts of Sochi. This week, the dogs barked and wagged their tails madly when Provotorova and several other volunteers arrived with fresh supplies of dog food. ""We are protecting them from Basia,"" said Provotorova said. ""I don't blame the Olympics,"" said Dina Filippova, as she scrubbed out the kennels with a mop. ""We don't have a sterilization program, so there is a huge amount of stray dogs here and authorities try to control them. They can't."" Filippova, a lawyer living in Sochi, argued Russia needs new legislation for the protection and management of animals. ""In Russia, you can abuse animals and it's not a crime. You can buy and adopt an animal and release it on the street, it's not a crime,"" she said. ""You have no legal obligation to sterilize your dog or cat."" Filippova and Provotorova both conceded that their families often accused them of being ""crazy"" about animals. But one of their fellow volunteers had another explanation for why she devoted so much time to caring and feeding for homeless animals. ""At my age I prefer taking care of animals,"" said Valentina Slivat, who described herself as a ""simple Soviet nurse"" who worked at a hospital in Sochi. A fluffy street dog named ""Pushistik"" followed Slivat constantly around the kennel, and periodically leaped into her arms. ""People have hands, legs, brains. But animals have been abandoned. We need to save them,"" the nurse said. CNN's Gena Somra contributed to this report.","Russian animal rights activists accuse authorities of campaign to exterminate street dogs .

"A California man was arrested Tuesday and accused of running a ""revenge porn"" website and demanding money through another site to remove the sexually explicit material. Kevin Bollaert, 27, of San Diego, was charged with 31 felony counts of conspiracy, identity theft and extortion, the state attorney general's office said in a written statement. Court documents allege that in December 2012 Bollaert created the website ugotposted.com, which allowed for the posting of sexually explicit photographs of people without their permission. ""This website published intimate photos of unsuspecting victims and turned their public humiliation and betrayal into a commodity with the potential to devastate lives,"" Attorney General Kamala D. Harris said. The sexually explicit material, primarily of women, was routinely posted by angry former boyfriends and ex-husbands, authorities said. As part of the public posting, the website required the full name of the person, location, age and Facebook profile link be provided, according to the documents. Bollaert then allegedly created a second website, changemyreputation.com, that charged up to $350 to remove the content, the documents said. Authorities allege he made tens of thousands of dollars through the website. Bollaert was being held at the San Diego County jail in lieu of $50,000 bail. It was unclear Tuesday night whether he had legal representation.","Kevin Bollaert, 27, of San Diego, has been charged with 31 counts, authorities say .

"Two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot were detained briefly Tuesday in central Sochi, after apparently being considered suspects in a theft at their hotel, and then released. ""A survey in connection with the theft at the Hotel Adler is completed, there is no claim against those questioned,"" police said in a prepared statement. Earlier in the day, band members Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were meeting with journalists when police detained them, according to Tolokonnikova's husband, Petr Verzilov. Russian media corroborated the report. ""They were put to the floor and beaten and physical force was used to them when they refused to be questioned without the presence of their lawyer, who was on his way to the police department,"" Verzilov told reporters. ""Unbelievable lawlessness, even we are amazed,"" tweeted Tolokonnikova. ""Beat on the floor of the department, in the Olympic capital!"" Invoking the name of Russian President Vladimir Putin, she added, ""They dragged me on the floor in the hall of the department, hands tied behind back and thrown to the floor. Putin will teach you to love the motherland!"" She said they would file a complaint with the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation. The two women had been walking down a street accompanied by the journalists, three other members of Pussy Riot who use pseudonyms, and two local activists, when a group of about 10 plainclothes police approached them and asked for their identification, said ""Tank,"" one of the anonymous bandmates. The police said they suspected Tolokonnikova may have had something to do with a theft in the hotel where the band members were staying, Tank said. The officers then took away the band members, activists and journalists for questioning. Tolokonnikova, Alyokhina and Tank tweeted the news about their detention from their cell phones, with Tolokonnikova posting photos of what she said was the vehicle that was taking her to a police station. In a separate tweet, Alyokhina said they had been forced into a police van after being stopped near the Church of Mikhail the Archangel and accused of committing a crime. Tank called CNN from the police station, complaining about having to wait there with no information from police. They were not put in handcuffs, she said. Recently free . The band members were in Sochi to protest what they said was the lack of freedom of speech and to record a song in English critical of Putin and called ""Putin will teach you to love the homeland."" Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina had been imprisoned for nearly two years after being convicted of ""hooliganism"" and inciting religious hatred for performing a punk song slamming Putin in a Moscow cathedral and then posting a video of it online. Since their release, just before the Olympic Games began, they have spoken to journalists about their time behind bars, describing the conditions as squalid and their treatment by guards as demeaning and inhumane. A third member of Pussy Riot, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released in 2012. This month, other band members said Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were no longer part of the group, which Verzilov said Tuesday was false.","Police say there is ""no claim"" against detained band members .

"Justin Bieber made a $50,000 donation to a youth charity as part of a plea deal to settle a Miami drunken driving case  Wednesday. Bieber, 20, was not in court when a judge accepted his guilty plea to careless driving and resisting arrest in connection with the Miami Beach incident last January. Prosecutors dropped the drunken driving charge in the agreement, which requires Bieber to get 12 hours of anger management counseling, attend a program that teaches about the impact of drunken driving on victims and make the large donation to the ""Our Kids"" organization. The charity donation, although a prosecution demand, could not legally be required in the plea deal, a prosecutor noted during the hearing.  As a result, the payment was made before the judge accepted the agreement. Judge William Altfield delivered a lecture to Bieber, which he hoped his lawyers would relay to their client, asking him to become a better role model for his young fans. ""I hope that he realizes that his actions not only lead to consequences that affect him, but they lead to consequences that affect others who are looking up to him as a role model,"" the judge said. Although Bieber has never been charged with a felony crime or a drug charge -- and he has never been in drug or alcohol rehab -- the judge compared the singer to actor Robert Downey Jr. when he was young. Altfield said that Downey got into trouble ""because of the drugs, because of the alcohol, because of the fame, because of all of the pressures that he had on a daily basis and look at what he's done with his life.  He turned himself around."" ""Here is someone who is young,"" Altfield said of Bieber. ""His whole life is ahead of him and he just hopefully will get the message.  He will grow up.  He will use all of his talents positively for young persons."" The lead prosecutor, in a written statement to CNN, said ""the strengths and weaknesses of the case"" led both sides to agree to the plea deal. ""The ultimate purpose of the Miami Beach Police Department's initial traffic stop was to end some rash juvenile type conduct before a tragedy occurred,"" State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said. ""The intervention and counseling parts of the plea should provide a pathway toward adult responsibility."" Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez said officers arrested Bieber January 23 after they saw him driving a yellow Lamborghini in a race against a red Ferrari in a residential area. The cars were speeding at about 55 to 60 mph in a 30 mph zone, he said. Police said Bieber was argumentative during the arrest and failed a field sobriety test. Bieber has had a number of run-ins with the law in recent months. In July, a judge in Los Angeles ordered Bieber to pay $80,900 restitution for damaging his former neighbor's mansion by throwing eggs. The pop star accepted a plea deal to settle a vandalism charge that puts him on probation for two years. The probation will be supervised until he completes 12 weekly anger management sessions, works five days of community labor and pays the restitution. He was charged with assault in January after he was accused of hitting his limousine driver in Toronto. In January, the Federal Aviation Administration looked into allegations that Bieber and other passengers on board a charter flight from Canada to New Jersey interfered with the flight crew, the agency said. In July, the FAA cleared them. In February, police in Georgia searched Bieber's limousine and found small amounts of marijuana and drug paraphernalia.

"A leading drug candidate for low sexual desire in women hasn't gotten approved for use in the United States, but the company backing it isn't giving up. Sprout Pharmaceuticals announced Tuesday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the company ""clear guidance"" on ""the path forward"" for its drug to treat low libido in women, called flibanserin. The FDA had rejected an application to approve the drug last year, which Sprout appealed. ""The FDA has requested that Sprout complete two additional Phase I drug interaction studies and a Phase I driving simulator study,"" Sprout said in a statement. Such studies will look at different enzyme pathways and investigate whether the drug's side effects would impair driving. Sprout will resubmit the new drug application for flibanserin by the third quarter of this year, the company said. ""We are encouraged by the FDA's response and view it as a significant step toward the approval of flibanserin,"" said Cindy Whitehead, president and chief operating officer of Sprout Pharmaceuticals, in a statement. The FDA declined to answer specific questions regarding the matter when contacted by CNN in January. FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer said in a statement: ""The FDA is only able to provide information on approved drug product applications. Any information on an application that has yet to receive an approval or was denied approval belongs to the manufacturer/sponsor developing the drug."" Where's the sex drive drug for women? Sprouting a drug . Flibanserin was initially developed by pharmaceutical giant Boehringer Ingelheim, but the company ditched it in 2010 after the FDA declined to approve their new drug application, asking for more research, said Dr. Irwin Goldstein, director of sexual medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, California, who collaborated on clinical trials for flibanserin. A smaller operation, Sprout Pharmaceuticals, took over work on the drug in 2011, and resubmitted an application with 14 new clinical studies, encompassing data on more than 3,000 new patients, according to the company. The drug is designed for the treatment of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in women. That's the technical term for when women have a distressing lack or absence of sexual desire or fantasy. Up to one-third of adult women may experience it, according to a 2002 study. In total, more than 11,000 people have participated in clinical trials for flibanserin, Whitehead said. Still, the most recent attempt to get flibanserin off the ground failed; the FDA did not approve the company's revised drug application in October. The FDA characterized the drug as having a ""modest"" effect in its response letter, Whitehead said. But clinical trial results show statistically significant improvement in the women who took the drug, compared to those who took a placebo, she said. ""In terms of what we see, I would say 'modest' is meaningful,"" Whitehead said. Sex is doctor's life's work . A 2013 study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine showed that women taking the drug reported an average increase of 2.5 satisfying sexual events in four weeks, compared to an increase of 1.5 among women using a placebo. Flibanserin is not a hormonal treatment and does not appear to affect fertility or interact with birth control medications, Whitehead said. Given that the drug has been through numerous, rigorous clinical trials, and so much has been invested in it, the FDA's refusal to approve it is a turning point in the field of sexual medicine, Goldstein said. The drug works by increasing brain blood flow in particular ways, Goldstein said. It increases levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline, and lowers levels of serotonin. Side effects of flibanserin include dizziness, nausea, fatigue and sleepiness. Unlike some treatments for men, flibanserin needs to be taken once a day, every day. If there is no positive action on the drug, it could spell doom for pharmacological efforts to manage female sexual desire, he said. ""It will go back to dark ages of saying, 'This is all a relationship problem,' even though we know it's not,"" he said. Other options . There are other experimental treatments for low female sex drive in the works. Drugs called Lybrido and Lybridos, developed by a company called Emotional Brain, have undergone several randomized studies with results that are ""very promising and will be published soon,"" according to the company's website. A drug called Bremelanotide is being investigated by Palatin Technologies for both men and women. None of these drugs has completed phase 3 trials, which are necessary before approval. Whitehead counts 24 FDA-approved treatments available in the United States for male sexual dysfunction, including popular drugs such as Viagra (sildenafil citrate). For women, it's zero. ""A lot of times, the medical community has really put men's needs first and hasn't really addressed women's sexual needs,"" said Jennifer Foust, a sex therapist in Aventura, Florida, who is not affiliated with flibanserin. Because doctors have no solutions, women have tried less-proven treatments for their low sexual desire, such as diets and herbs. None of Foust's clients has had success with them. She said some women who aren't functioning well sexually would be ""open to anything."" ""I've had women complain, 'Why isn't there a female Viagra?' "" Foust said. Sex drive: It's complicated . Sex drive is more complicated for women than for men, Foust said. There are a lot of factors that could explain a woman's low desire -- and not all of them are medical, she said. Lifestyle and relationship issues may come into play. Having a first child can be a problematic factor for some women; the adjustment and figuring out how to restructure their sex life can throw off desire. Foust has spoken to some new mothers who feel they are constantly being asked for something from their body, as if they are ""touched out,"" but find their lack of desire troubling. Some couples maintain satisfying sex lives over many years -- but some, over time, go on autopilot and have less and less sex. ""You have to continue to feed your sexual relationship, and feed your relationship in general,"" Foust said. ""A lot of it depends on how much importance and energy you put toward your sex life."" Sometimes stress is the issue, too, she said. Foust offers cognitive-behavioral, focused exercises to help women who are distressed about their low sexual desire. Low sexual desire in women isn't necessarily a problem in menopause or later. Foust works with many women complaining of low sex drive who are in their 30s and 40s. The average age of participants in the flibanserin trials was 36, Whitehead said. The new drug application the company will submit will be specifically for premenopausal women.","Flibanserin is a drug that showed positive results in clinical trials .
The FDA has declined to approve this drug .
The drug's promoters have appealed that decision .

"A nurse in Nigeria. A businessman in Saudi Arabia. A Spanish priest in Liberia. With the World Health Organization announcing Wednesday that 932 deaths had been reported or confirmed as a result of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Saudi Arabia joined the list of countries with suspected cases. ""This is the biggest and most complex Ebola outbreak in history,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said. Nearly all of those deaths have been in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, where more than 1,700 cases have been reported, according to WHO. The agency said 108 new cases were reported between Saturday and Monday in those countries and Nigeria. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has declared a state of emergency for 90 days because of the deadly outbreak, her office announced Wednesday. ""The scope and scale of the epidemic, the virulence and deadliness of the virus now exceed the capacity and statutory responsibility of any one government agency or ministry,"" she said in a written statement. ""The government and people of Liberia require extraordinary measures for the very survival of our state and for the protection of the lives of our people."" She said Ebola is a ""clear and present danger."" Concerns about the spread of the deadly virus escalated with Saudi Arabia reporting that a man died, apparently of the virus, after a trip to Sierra Leone, and Nigeria reported that a nurse died after treating someone believed to have contracted Ebola in Liberia. WHO did not immediately confirm the deaths, and its count of Ebola cases does not include the two. The Saudi man died Wednesday at a specialized hospital in Jeddah, the Saudi Ministry of Health said. He had been in intensive care since late Monday ""after exhibiting symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever following a business trip to Sierra Leone,"" the ministry said in a statement. The nurse in Nigeria had helped care for Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian-American man, who died in Nigeria after traveling there from Liberia, Nigeria's Ministry of Health said Wednesday. Read more about Patrick Sawyer's death . The news of the nurse's death came the same day that Nigeria confirmed another five cases of Ebola, the Health Ministry said. Meanwhile, a Spanish priest who contracted the disease in Liberia will be flown to Madrid and become Europe's first patient from this outbreak, according to the Spanish government. Spain's Ministry of Defense is using a medically equipped Airbus A310 to bring Brother Miguel Pajares to Madrid, where he will be treated at Madrid's La Paz hospital, Spanish officials said. In the United States, two patients are being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta: American doctor Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who had been in Liberia. Emory is one of four U.S. institutions capable of providing such treatment. Writebol arrived in Atlanta on Tuesday, just days after Brantly arrived. ""We were able to spend a few minutes with her to encourage her and be encouraged by her condition,"" Writebol's son, Jeremy, said in a statement. A male patient at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York has tested negative for Ebola, the hospital announced Wednesday. The patient, who had a fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, is improving and is listed in stable condition, the hospital said in a written statement. The man became ill after recently traveling to West Africa.  A specimen from the patient was delivered Tuesday to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which confirmed he didn't have Ebola. Is experimental drug helping? Both Brantly and Writebol have been given the experimental drug ZMapp, which had not been tested on humans nor has it undergone any clinical trials. Doctors say it's too early to tell whether ZMapp is effective. The CDC says it's not likely the drug will become available for patients in West Africa. ""The product is still in an experimental stage, and the manufacturer reports that there is a very limited supply, so it cannot be purchased and is not available for general use,"" the CDC said. President Barack Obama said Wednesday that ""we've got to let the science guide us"" on whether to make the experimental drug more widely available. ""I don't think all the information is in on whether this drug is helpful,"" he added during a news conference at the U.S. Africa Leaders Summit in Washington. Opinion: Make more Ebola drug and give it to Africans . The World Health Organization will convene a medical ethics panel early next week to answer questions about whom should receive ZMapp, given that it is in limited supply. ""We have a disease with a high fatality rate without any proven treatment or vaccine,"" said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general at WHO. ""We need to ask the medical ethicists to give us guidance on what the responsible thing to do is,"" she said. 9 questions about this new Ebola drug . 'It won't be easy' Frieden said putting an end to the Ebola outbreak will ""take many months, and it won't be easy, but Ebola can be stopped,"" he said. ""We know what needs to be done."" The United States is planning to send 50 health experts to West Africa to help contain the outbreak, which President Obama addressed in remarks Wednesday, saying citizens of the affected countries are in Americans' thoughts and prayers. ""What we have done is to make sure we're surging not just U.S. resources, but we have reached out to European partners and partners from other countries working with the WHO,""  Obama said. ""Let's get all the health workers that we need on the ground. Let's help to bolster the systems that they already have in place."" Obama said the U.S. is focusing on a public health approach first, and he will seek information about new drugs later. Frieden said the 50 experts from the CDC will work to combat the outbreak and help implement stronger systems to fight the disease. The agency raised the activation level of its emergency operations center in Atlanta to its highest level, meaning more employees are working in the emergency center. In Geneva, Switzerland, members of WHO's Emergency Committee of International Experts were receiving an briefing and trying to determine whether to recommend the outbreak is an international public health emergency. The committee will release its findings on Friday. What is Ebola? The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which affects multiple organ systems in the body and is often accompanied by bleeding. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. It has no known cure. The most common treatment requires supporting organ functions and maintaining bodily fluids such as blood and water long enough for the body to fight off the infection. 5 reasons not to panic about Ebola in the U.S. What is the risk of catching Ebola on a plane?

"Sochi, Russia (CNN) -- ""He didn't want carpets, he preferred to hear footsteps of people as they approached on the wooden parquet flooring,"" says Anna Hovantseva, the tour guide, as she explains another interior-design quirk of one of the most morbidly fascinating personalities of the 20th century. It's fair to say Joseph Stalin, the notorious dictatorial leader of the Soviet Union, still holds a curiosity for many. The Georgia native helped create much that is modern Sochi, the host of the 2014 Winter Games, when he built his summer retreat in this town in 1937. The retreat is open to visitors and will soon offer rooms to guests this summer for 7,000 roubles ($200) per night. Welcome to the home of Stalin. Benefiting from the cool, restorative mix of sea and mountain air streams, the villa -- or ""dacha,"" as it's known locally -- was situated for the health-giving nature of its surroundings. Nestled in the coniferous, cypress-tree forest of the Matsesta mineral springs area and perched in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains, it was seen as the ideal refuge to replenish the man whose day job was ruling over 200 million people. Follow CNN's live Sochi Winter Olympics coverage . It also has a rather snazzy green exterior. ""The color is the same as the trees, it camouflages the building,"" adds Hovantseva -- another handy feature for a property if you have many enemies. For guests staying over, the facilities don't compare well to the luxurious standards of comfort demanded by modern national leaders. The interiors of every room consist of uniform beechwood paneling devoid of decoration. Portraits of Stalin that adorn the walls and the fireplace were hung there long after his demise, such was his dislike of them. There's a swimming pool, so small it more closely resembles an oversized sunken bath, where the Communist chief enjoyed walking (he couldn't swim) in seawater up to his shoulders. There are also fantastic views of the Black Sea, which laps against the shore a few miles away. Entertainment is basic, especially given the cinema room where Stalin used to view his favorite Charlie Chaplin movies is no longer functioning, but there is a billiards room with the original table and cue used by the man dubbed ""Uncle Joe."" And in a break with tradition of museums around the world, visitors can use both to try to pot balls in the small Russian-standard pockets. However, there is one word of warning: If you're considering a stay it's probably wiser to visit in the summer. The property walls are a secure 70 centimeters thick and, on Stalin's orders, the house has no heating. That accounts for the cool temperatures in the majority of rooms CNN visits. But it remains a mystery why the temperature drops five degrees in Stalin's cinema, where his waxwork sits ominously behind a desk in front of copies of Pravda and opposite a bullet-proof sofa. Our guide denies the presence of the rumored ghost of Stalin: ""No, absolutely no. It is cold because of the architecture. (The thick walls) are very difficult to warm up. Of course now it is cold in the dacha, but it's very pleasant to stay there in summer."" It was designed by architect Miron Merzhanov, to whom Stalin made only one request for the building: No fountains. A direction that required a swift alteration to the original water feature that sat in the middle of the central courtyard into a flowerbed. Despite the dacha's peculiarities, though, the presence of the leader of the USSR in such a small coastal resort had a seismic effect in the town now being viewed on televisions across the world. ""No doubt that when our leader began to visit Sochi, the city benefited from great development,"" Hovantseva says. ""Earlier our city was the resort for the nobility, for only rich people. There had been tourists' villas long before Stalin came here. ""But when Stalin began to visit Sochi, he began to develop it as a resort town for all people. Thanks to him, a lot of sanatoriums and hydropathic establishments (and) a road to Matsesta were built. All in all, he did really much for the development of Sochi."" Ironic then that the town Stalin ""built"" was the one chosen by President Vladimir Putin, who also has a summer house in Sochi, to represent the modern face of Russia to the world. Local journalist Alexander Valov edits the independent ""BlogSochi,"" a forum he has used to reflect the positive and negative sides of Sochi hosting the Olympics, much to the ire of Russian officials. ""First of all I see it from the city's point of view and how the infrastructure is being developed. But there are negative sides, too ... we had a huge beach with 70 meters covered with pebble, a beautiful seafront, but now (as a result of development) there is no beach. The ecology and nature was damaged greatly,"" Valov told CNN. The choice may be seen as shrewd if costly politicking by some, but for Hovantseva, Sochi seemed like the obvious and most welcome choice to host the Winter Games. ""With the Olympics, Sochi has received a great new development. For example, the new buildings were built, even the image of the city has changed. We could compare the current policy with Stalin's one,"" she says. ""I was not surprised because our city is really unique. Thanks to our mild climate you can relax here all year round, even in winter. So it was quite logical and natural,"" the guide tells CNN as we view the pictures of Stalin's family on show in the fridge-like cinema room. There is a black and white image of his second wife Svetlana, who died young -- officially from appendicitis amid rumors of suicide. There's also pictures of his son Yakov, who did not survive internment in a German prisoner of war camp. The smiling faces in the photos do not convey the whole picture, according to Hovantseva. ""Generally, he liked to be all alone. He loved his wife Svetlana and his children. He had no friends. He read and thought a lot. He enjoyed hunting. He also loved farming. He grew lemons (for medicinal drinks). So he was an unsociable man, I think."" Hovantseva says there is no shortage of interest in the dacha. She thinks attitudes toward Stalin are as varied as the visitors to the site; some consider him a great politician, many consider him a dictator and treat him a little ""disdainfully."" However, one factor that shows no sign of changing is the restorative powers Sochi offers to the political elite.","Joseph Stalin's summer home is on sightseeing list for Sochi .

"The Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that nSpired Natural Foods Inc. is voluntarily recalling several lots of peanut, almond and other nut butters on fears of salmonella contamination. The company was made aware of the risk after routine testing showed a potential link between consumption of these products and four instances of illness. The affected products include Arrowhead Mills Peanut Butters, MaraNatha Almond Butters and Peanut Butters and specific private label nut butters sold under the Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Kroger and Safeway brands. A complete list of products involved in the recall can be found on FDA.gov. The company is working with consumers and retailers to remove inventory from retail shelves and warehouses. The products were sold in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, Dominican Republic and online. Customers are being advised to dispose of any potentially affected containers of nut butter and contact the company directly at 1-800-937-7008 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. CT for a replacement or refund. A 2012 recall because of Salmonella Bredeney in peanut butter produced by Sunland Inc. resulted in 42 cases of illness and the eventual closure of the company after filing for bankruptcy. Fast facts on salmonella . The CDC reports that people in a normal state of health who ingest Salmonella-tainted food may experience diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps, which typically begin within 12 to 72 hours. This may be accompanied by vomiting, chills, headache and muscle pains. These symptoms may last about four to seven days and then go away without specific treatment, but left unchecked, Salmonella infection may spread to the bloodstream and beyond. It can cause death if the person is not treated promptly with antibiotics. Children, the elderly and people with compromised immune symptoms should practice extreme caution. About 48 million people contract some form of food poisoning each year, according to the CDC. Salmonella was the top cause of foodborne illness, according to the CDC's 2012 report card on food poisoning. However, the overall incidence of Salmonella was unchanged from the 2006-08 data, the agency said. The report card is based on reports from 10 U.S. regions, representing about 15% of the country.

"Young Venezuelans unhappy with the ravaged economy, shortages and rising crime clashed again Friday with security forces who fired tear gas and water cannons. Hundreds of anti-government protesters blocked traffic on a major highway in Caracas, days after three Caracas protesters died in violence. The clashes, which have left dozens more injured or detained across the country, have exacerbated an already tense situation. President Nicolas Maduro, in a nationally televised speech, announced Friday the launch of a ""national plan for peace and coexistence."" Maduro said state and senior military officials will work together to reduce violence ""from its bases,"" state media reported. Authorities on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for an opposition leader on charges including conspiracy and murder in connection with recent clashes. Leopoldo Lopez, head of Popular Will (known as VP after its initials in Spanish), remained free late Friday. He has accused the government of responsibility for violence during protests Wednesday. ""They won't divide us,"" Lopez tweeted Friday. Maduro was elected in April after President Hugo Chavez's death from cancer. He has presided over a sharp decline in living standards and has failed to stem rising violent crime. Maduro insists he is facing a slow-motion coup. ""I want to alert the world. We are facing a developing coup plan against the democracy and the government that I preside over, orchestrated by a small group of irresponsible leaders, violent, full of hatred and personal ambitions,"" he said Wednesday. The U.S. State Department expressed concerns about the state of affairs in Venezuela. ""We are deeply concerned by rising tensions, by the violence surrounding this February 12 protest and by the issuing of a warrant for the arrest of the opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez,"" said spokeswoman Marie Harf. ""We join the secretary general of OAS (Organization of American States) in condemning the violence and calling on authorities to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for the death of peaceful protesters.""

"Sinkholes are swallowing Corvettes now. Last year it was houses in Florida, and on Wednesday nature gobbled up some of the coolest and fastest cars to come off the assembly line. Eight valuable 'vettes at Bowling Green, Kentucky's National Corvette Museum fell victim to a 40-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep sinkhole that opened up in the facility's yellow Sky Dome wing. The museum unofficially estimates it caused millions of dollars in damage. Motion detectors alerted security that something was amiss shortly after 5:30 a.m., said museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli. An employee who first walked into the room ""has been in shock all day,"" she said. ""When you go in there, it's unreal,"" said Frassinelli. ""The hole is so big, it makes the Corvettes look like little Matchbox cars."" The news triggered a collective worldwide gasp from the Corvette Nation. ""I was shocked,"" said Frazer Bharucha, 47, a Corvette owner since age 17. ""We're talking about iconic cars that have been around for years."" Using remote-controlled drones, geologists and engineers from nearby Western Kentucky University have already explored the sinkhole and determined that the Sky Dome suffered no structural damage, Frassinelli said. ""There's a cave down there,"" she said, adding that the museum is only a short drive away from Mammoth Cave National Park. The damaged portion of the museum will be closed indefinitely, but the rest of the facility will be open as usual on Thursday, she said. The painful losses have been tallied: Of the eight cars that fell, six were donated to the museum by Corvette enthusiasts, and two are owned by the car's maker, General Motors. Here's the museum's list of cars that went down the hole: . -- a 1962 ""Black Corvette""-- a 1984 PPG pace car-- a 2009 ZR1 ""Blue Devil""-- the 1992 white ""1 Millionth Corvette""-- a 1993 ruby red ""40th Anniversary Corvette""-- a 2001 Mallett Hammer Z06 Corvette-- the 2009 white ""1.5 Millionth Corvette""-- a 1993 ZR-1 Spyder . The total value of the damaged cars is substantial, said museum executive director Wendell Strode. Almost all the cars have been removed from the room. They've been setting up ramps to get the last one out,"" said Frassinelli. That remaining Corvette is suspended in a precarious position on a riser directly above the sinkhole. Bharucha, of the Long Island Corvette Owners Association, knows the museum well, having visited it at least six times. ""There's a sense of awe and you get a lump in your throat when you walk inside."" He's right. I've been there. It's hallowed ground. Under the Sky Dome's recognizable red spire and towering vaulted 100-foot high ceiling sits a round chamber that cradled rare vehicles, including Indianapolis 500 and Daytona 500 pace cars. The room feels like a cathedral. And for many enthusiasts, it is kind of the Church of the Corvette. It is home to more than 70 unique Corvettes, including several prototypes and a unique 1983 model -- the only one in existence. Only 43 1983 Corvettes were manufactured before GM decided to scrap them and move on to the 1984 design. All were destroyed, except the one now housed at the museum. That car will likely go on display elsewhere in the museum, Frassinelli said, but the others from the damaged dome will be placed in storage. Let's remember the Corvette's rich tradition. This is the ultra-cool car driven by Bill Bixby in the 1970s TV series, ""The Magician."" It also was the cherry ride that was good enough to be piloted by the dudes with the right stuff: NASA's Apollo astronauts. ""It's the all-American car,"" Bharucha said. ""No matter where you go, people know it and love it. Sometimes they'll stare at it. Other times they'll wave."" You always remember your first car, and Bharucha is no different. For him it was a 1966 yellow Corvette convertible. Guess what? He still has it. ""That's my baby,"" he said. ""That's the one car I will not sell."" The sinkhole couldn't have come at a worse time, as the museum prepares to celebrate its 20th annivesary and open a 184-acre Motorsports Park in August. Some 5,000 people are already pre-registered to attend the park's grand opening. Sinkholes at the Motorsports Park aren't really a concern, Frassinelli said. Several holes were found during construction and were made harmless, she said. ""We want to move forward as soon as possible"", she said. ""We want to start repairs and recovery.""

"The death last month of a man who struggled with police while being taken into  custody in Manhattan has been ruled a homicide, the medical examiner's officer said. Ronald Singleton, 45, died in police custody on July 13, four days before a man in Staten Island died after police put him in a choke hold, a case that sparked national outrage. The Staten Island death also was declared a homicide, and is under investigation. In the statement Friday, the medical examiner's office declared the manner of death in the Singleton case as homicide caused by the ""physical restraint by police during excited delirium due to acute phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication,"" said Julie Bolcer, spokeswoman for the medical examiner. Singleton, who was African-American, was taken into police custody after a yellow cab driver flagged down a police officer near St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, police said in a statement. The cab driver claimed the passenger was ""acting overly irate and irrational, cursing and screaming and causing alarm,"" according to the statement. Singleton got out of the taxi and ""became combative with the officer, trying to fight with him,"" the police statement said. The officer called for help and other officers responded along with members of the NYPD Emergency Service Unit. Singleton was placed in a ""protective body wrap by the ESU officers,"" the police statement said. An ambulance was taking Singleton to a hospital when he went into cardiac arrest, the statement said. Singleton was dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital. The NYPD said it was cooperating with the Manhattan district attorney's office investigation of the death. The medical examiner's office said factors such as ""hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"" and obesity contributed to Singleton's death, according to Bolcer. The case went unnoticed by national media, unlike the death of Eric Garner four days later. He died after being put in a choke hold by a NYPD officer while being arrested for selling cigarettes illegally. Garner's death sparked protests and calls for federal civil rights charges against the officer who took down the 43-year-old, 350-pound man with an illegal choke hold. A cell phone video of the incident shows Garner waving both hands in the air and telling the officers not to touch him. Seconds later, an officer behind Garner grabs him in a choke hold and pulls him to the sidewalk, then rolls him over onto his stomach. ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" Garner is heard saying repeatedly, his cries muffled into the pavement. The cause of Garner's death was ""compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police,"" according to Bolcer. The death was ruled a homicide. Garner's death occurred just weeks before Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot to death by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9. Both cases fueled protests and thrust into the forefront the issue of law enforcement's use of deadly force against people who are unarmed.

"The U.N. Security Council delegation visiting South Sudan last week came face-to-face with a troubling reality: The country has been seized by an eight-month civil war between parties that have committed violence against civilians on a devastating scale. The result is an unprecedented challenge for the organization, which now finds itself protecting almost 100,000 people seeking refuge from the conflict in peacekeeping bases across South Sudan. Yet despite the high cost and risk, the U.N. should be prepared to host and protect them for months, if not years, to come. This crisis ignited on December 15, when fighting broke out between the President of South Sudan Salva Kiir and his former Vice President Riek Machar along with other opposition leaders. The army split, militias chose sides and others took up arms. This political and military conflict took on a strong ethnic dimension when the protagonists used ethnicity to pit soldiers and police against each other and then against civilians. In the first days and weeks of the conflict, tens of thousands of people ran to bases of the U.N. peacekeeping operation in South Sudan (called UNMISS). The numbers inside the bases have continued to rise, in part because UNMISS and humanitarians have worked hard to protect the bases, and have deterred attempts by parties to the conflict to force entry into some bases and prevented large outbreaks of diseases such as cholera. Still, the civilians inside UNMISS bases are living in a kind of purgatory. And despite the good intentions and efforts of the peacekeeping operation and the humanitarian community, the conditions at these sites are deplorable, some flooding with rain. Residents say they aren't receiving adequate essential services needed to survive and to live in dignity. At the same time, if residents leave these bases they risk rape, detention, torture or death. Those seeking shelter are being deliberately targeted because of their ethnicity or political allegiance. Some report that they have not left the bases in eight months. Others take tremendous risks to leave the base during the day in search of food, medical care not provided on site and opportunities to earn money. The reality is that the U.N. bases weren't designed or funded to house and protect such a vast number of people for such a long time. The situation has put UNMISS, which is mandated to protect civilians from physical violence, in an incredibly difficult position. UNMISS has three choices: Allow those under threat to remain in the bases, try to create conditions outside of the current protection sites that provide enough security to make people feel safe enough to relocate or go home, or force the people seeking shelter to leave. The third option would open the peacekeeping operation to strong and well-deserved criticism, as it violates international principles that forbid forcibly resettling people to locations where they are at risk for their lives, safety, liberty or health. The second option is beyond the scope of the U.N. peacekeeping operation to implement. In one site, residents insisted that only a change in the current government would guarantee their security. As one woman told me in an interview, ""If President Kiir is in power for the next 20 or 30 years, we will stay in the site for those same years."" But the government and opposition forces have just missed a deadline to agree on a transitional government, and it is clear that even if a political resolution is reached between the main parties, years of inter-communal and intra-communal peace and reconciliation will be needed. UNMISS doesn't have the leverage to play a principal role in the negotiation between the parties and doesn't have the capability to undertake subnational-level reconciliation at the scale needed. Other residents were insistent that they wouldn't feel safe going home or to new sites without the same level of protection that they receive at UNMISS bases. UNMISS doesn't have -- and likely will not have -- the resources to protect people's homes or a number of new sites outside its bases. At the start of the crisis, the U.N. Security Council authorized an increase in troops from 7,000 to 12,500, but even with its newly expanded numbers UNMISS won't be able to provide adequate area security to ensure safe and voluntary relocation for the majority of people inside its bases. The U.N. Security Council is unlikely to increase UNMISS's troop levels again. It has already struggled to find 12,500 properly trained and equipped troops for the mission. Moreover, in the current fiscal climate, U.N. donor countries have little appetite to fund an ever-increasing number of large peacekeeping operations. This leaves UNMISS with the first option: It must prepare itself to continue to protect those within and adjacent to its bases and keep the gates open for more to arrive. U.N. donor states will need to approve a new budget in the coming months that accommodates the cost of this protection. Humanitarian donors need to step up their funding not only to provide services to those inside the bases, but to give urgent assistance to the millions outside the protection sites who continue to face targeted violence and massive food insecurity. According to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as of August 1, there was a $916 million gap in humanitarian funding needed to avert a drastic deterioration of the already dire humanitarian crisis. As one woman in a protection site said, ""Initially, we hoped that this war would only last two days or one week. But now it's taken almost half a year, so what is the plan for UNMISS? Is it ready to protect us? When are we going to be outside? Will they protect us for the next 10 years?"" Despite the logistical, financial and political challenges such a scenario would pose, the U.N. Security Council and donors must prepare to answer in the affirmative.","South Sudan has been embroiled in 8-month civil war .

"The involvement of five Arab countries in the air strikes against ISIS in Syria is a major new development for the region. It is not yet clear exactly what role they have played in what the Pentagon described as ""participation and support"" for the operation, but this is about symbolism more than military might. For the U.S., it was vitally important to avoid this looking like another Western attack on a Middle Eastern country, and to emphasize that opposition to ISIS comes from within the Arab and Muslim worlds - where the vast majority of their victims have come from. But what's in it for the Arab countries? The move reflects a combination of concerns about their domestic security and their international reputation. Longer term, beyond the concerns about ISIS itself, it reflects a desire on the part of these Arab states to play a more active role in regional security -- but also illustrates the risks that can affect anyone wanting to become the policeman of the region. Firstly, these states see ISIS as a threat to their own domestic security. ISIS's ideology doesn't only condemn the ""infidel West;"" like al Qaeda, it is also dead set against the existing regimes in the Arab states, and wants the states themselves to fall and be replaced by a caliphate. Saudi Arabia, which has confirmed its air force was involved in Tuesday's strikes, has been the victim of al Qaeda (AQ) attacks before, in 2003-04, and Jordan was bombed by an AQ affiliate led by Abu Musab al Zarqawi, an ideological precursor of ISIS. For its part, the UAE has accused the Muslim Brotherhood of plotting to overthrow it. The UAE is the most hawkish of the five states when it comes to Islamists, and U.S. officials say that UAE forces recently bombed Islamist militants in Libya, a claim dismissed by a UAE minister. If so, this would be another indication of the growing military assertiveness of this small but wealthy country. However, if it happened it proved ineffective; the militants subsequently took Tripoli airport. Second, for some Gulf states, especially Qatar, there is a worry that some in the West actually blame them for ISIS emerging. Several Gulf countries have been arming and funding a variety of Syrian opposition groups -- as the West has too. Gulf states say they've funded only ""moderate rebels"", and that though this has included some Islamists, they are not ISIS. But there are allegations of Qatari funding for Jebhat al Nusra, an al Qaeda affiliate, which Qatar denies. Qatar is also being criticized harshly by Israel for supporting Hamas. For Qatar, therefore, a role in the airstrikes operation is a chance to counter the allegations that it supports terrorism. It is also a chance to make a rare display of solidarity between Qatar and UAE, who have been at odds because they take opposing approaches to Islamists in the region. Both the Qatari and UAE air forces participated in enforcing the no fly zone in Libya. But since then they've backed different sides in Libya. Indeed the Libyan PM has alleged that Qatari planes tried to take weapons to the militants holding Tripoli airport. This evident disunity has weakened the foreign policy credibility of the Gulf cooperation council, the regional alliance of Gulf monarchies, so it has been especially important for the key Gulf players to pull together against ISIS. The Saudi interior ministry has always been concerned that funding Islamists could lead to blowback. They've seen this before, with Afghanistan. However, it's less clear exactly what covert intelligence operations may have been supported in their bid to topple Assad and combat Iran; and when weapons and money go into a complex and fragmented civil war, it is not always certain where they will end up. There has certainly been private funding from the Gulf; the U.N. has recently blacklisted several private individuals from the Gulf for funding ISIS and JaN. Several thousand Saudis have gone to fight in Syria -- though with a range of opposition groups, some of which are supported by the West. And there have been claims in the Western media that the Saudi interpretation of Islam itself promotes this kind of exclusionary ideology -- which Saudis reject strongly, saying their religion is against the shedding of innocent blood. For Riyadh, this is a reminder of the period after 9/11, when U.S. analysts seriously questioned the value of their alliance with Saudi Arabia. Indeed, as part of its response to ISIS, Saudi Arabia convened a regional counterterrorism summit on this year's anniversary of 9/11. But for the Kingdom to take part in a U.S.- led coalition is something much more dramatic, not seen since 1991, when Gulf forces joined U.S.-led coalition to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. Saudi Arabian forces have been involved in fighting Houthi militants in Yemen in recent years, in a war almost entirely ignored by Western media. But both these conflicts were on their own borders, and had a defensive aspect. Greater military assertiveness by the Gulf countries, and Gulf cooperation with the larger armies in Egypt and Jordan, are key regional trends to watch. Gulf countries will remain keen to expand their own limited military capabilities and be less reliant on the U.S., just in case it is not always there to guard them. Some in the Gulf, including the former emir of Qatar, have expressed frustration that the U.S. was not doing enough to end the Syrian conflict and suggesting that there should be an Arab intervention. However, until recently, they were talking about an Arab intervention against Assad. With this latest display of military force, the Syrians who sympathize with the opposition will be asking why these countries didn't have the same interest in defending them against regime attacks and chemical weapons.","Five Arab states participated in or support airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria, the U.S. says .

List of states with the Enterovirus . Enteroviruses are common, especially in September, but this particular type is not. There have been fewer than 100 cases recorded since it was identified in the 1960s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here's what you need to know as a parent: . What are the symptoms? The virus usually starts like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. This is all that happens for most people who catch an enterovirus. But some patients will get a severe cough, have difficulty breathing and/or develop a rash. EV-D68 is sometimes also accompanied by a fever or wheezing. So when should you begin worrying? Unfortunately in the beginning it's difficult -- if not impossible -- to tell the difference between a regular cold and this type of virus. But there are symptoms you should be on the lookout for if your child becomes sick. Go to the doctor if he or she develops a fever or a rash, or if your child has difficulty breathing. Children with asthma or a history of breathing problems are particularly susceptible for severe symptoms. How is EV-D68 treated? There is no specific treatment for enteroviruses, according to the CDC. Plenty of rest, fluids and over-the-counter medications will help ease symptoms in standard cases. Patients who are hospitalized will likely receive assistance breathing and what's called ""supportive therapy"" to help their immune systems fight off the infection. Where is the virus spreading? Twelve states are investigating clusters of enterovirus illnesses: Alabama, Colorado, Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Utah. But EV-D68 is often hard to distinguish from its relatives so the virus could be in other states as well. Enterovirus difficult to track . Why are kids being hospitalized? Anyone can get infected with enteroviruses, according to the CDC, but infants, children and teens are more likely to become sick because they have not yet built up immunity from previous exposures to the viruses. How do I protect my children? The respiratory illness spreads through close contact, just like the common cold. You can also be infected by touching objects or surfaces that have the virus on them, then touching your face. There's not a great deal you can do, health officials say, beyond taking common-sense steps to reduce the risk. Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds -- particularly after going to the bathroom and changing diapers. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are regularly touched by different people, such as toys and doorknobs. Avoid shaking hands, kissing, hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick. And stay home if you feel unwell.","Enterovirus D68 usually starts like the common cold .

"UK Prime Minister David Cameron has laid out his battle plan to counter the threat posed by Islamist extremists returning to Britain after fighting with terror groups overseas. But already there are questions about how effective those measures would be, whether they are legal and whether Cameron, who heads a coalition government, can push them through Parliament. ""Dealing with this terrorist threat is not just about new powers, it is also about how we combat extremism in all its forms,"" he said as he announced his plans Monday. His proposals, which come after the UK government raised its terror threat level Friday from ""substantial"" to ""severe,"" include a radical new measure to ban Britons from coming home once they join jihadi ranks abroad. ""What we need is a targeted, discretionary power to allow us to exclude British nationals from the UK,"" he said. Cameron wants to confiscate passports from would-be fighters, before they travel, and ban other suspects from boarding planes. ""Passports are not an automatic right,"" he said. ""We will introduce specific and targeted legislation to fill this gap by providing the police with a temporary power to seize a passport at the border, during which time they will be able to investigate the individual concerned. ""This power will include appropriate safeguards and oversight arrangements."" Work to prepare legislation to allow this will begin immediately, Cameron said. Civil liberties issue . As well as stopping would-be jihadists, Cameron said Britain needed measures to prevent the return of foreign fighters. UK authorities estimate that 500 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamist groups. But opposition lawmakers question whether some of the toughest plans are legal. ""We very much want to see the detail of that because some of our MPs say to do that would breach a whole number of legal and international obligations this country has,"" said Diana Johnson, a Labour lawmaker and shadow Home Office minister for security and crime. She backs tough action but insists there must be a balance. ""I can categorically say that civil liberties is a big issue in any debate we have about any new powers."" The head of Britain's counter-terrorism efforts, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, said in a statement Tuesday that in response to the raised alert level, more police would be seen on the streets and that there would be an increase in vehicle searches and other security measures. Secret evidence . Pledges to safeguard citizens' rights ring hollow to British Muslim-convert Cerie Bullivant. In 2006, he was detained by British security agents under anti-terror laws. He told CNN he was headed to Syria to volunteer helping orphans. The Syrian civil war hadn't started, and ISIS didn't yet exist. ""Suddenly you go on the basis of secret evidence from being an ordinary member of the public to the worst of the worst,"" said Bullivant. ""Terrorism and terrorists are some of the most heinous and horrible of people. I didn't even know what I was accused of."" He believes he came under suspicion because he had unwittingly, he says, become friends with the brother of a jailed terrorist. Bullivant was never arrested, never convicted of a crime, nor told what evidence security services had against him. The British government imposed a ""control order"" on him, banning him from traveling or meeting friends and subjecting him to a curfew.  ""A couple of times a week the police would come and you can't stop them and they would search your house,"" he added. Two years later, a top court exonerated him. Bullivant: Bring suspects to trial . As part of his new anti-terror drive, Cameron proposes beefing up existing terrorism prevention and investigation measures, or TPIMs, which allow restrictions on terror suspects, including overnight residence at a specified address, GPS tagging, reporting requirements, and restrictions on travel, movement, association, communication, finances, work and study. Cameron said he would introduce legislation giving British authorities new powers that would strengthen their ability to track suspected supporters of ISIS, by providing ""enhanced use of exclusion zones"" or ""relocation powers."" But Bullivant opposes that approach. ""If somebody is a danger to the British public, then they need to be in a British prison,"" he said. ""The only way to do that is to bring charges and a trial in an open and fair court. If they're not a dangerous person, then you're oppressing them for no reason."" Far from defending against radical Islam, Bullivant fears tougher government powers risk turning Britain into a police state. Analyst: UK threat is greater . Officials in the United States say there are no plans to issue a terror alert there, despite the activities of ISIS, also known as the ""Islamic State"" or ISIL, in Iraq and Syria. ""The most detailed intelligence assessment that I can offer from here is that there is no evidence or indication right now that ISIL is actively plotting to attack the United States homeland,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson also pointed out there is no specific threat against the United States. That said, Johnson noted that ISIS has proved to be a threat to Americans overseas -- notably the execution of American journalist James Foley and the threats of more killings to follow. Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst, said, ""The threat is much greater in the UK, and that's why you are seeing a raft of new measures in the UK to try and tackle this problem. They are very, very worried that ISIS may try and retaliate in some form or way."" UK PM: Police need power to seize passports of would-be jihad suspects . Opportunity for al Qaeda? While the world's attention is focused on ISIS, a suspected U.S. drone strike against senior leaders of Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia on Monday has highlighted continuing concern about extremists elsewhere. Will Geddes, a security analyst and managing director of International Corporate Protection, told CNN that the merging and consolidation of different Islamist militant groups around the world were of big concern. ""You will have various groups working together, sharing resources, sharing capability, and in this particular region, it's important to try to dismantle it where possible,"" he said. Somalia's porous borders mean it presents a particular risk, he added. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said it would be ""a mistake to take our eye off the ball when it comes it al Qaeda"" and warned that the rise of ISIS could aid the terror network. Before his death, Osama bin Laden wanted to rebrand al Qaeda, Gartenstein-Ross said. ""He believed that its brand had been very much diminished by the excesses of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who had led al Qaeda in Iraq, which became ISIS later on,"" he said. ""With ISIS's rise, it gives al Qaeda a prime opportunity to rebrand itself as being a more rational, more moderate voice of jihadism, and as a result I think there's a lot of risks of more money channeling into the al Qaeda network."" Some will come from quite moderate countries in the region who are looking at whether or not al Qaeda and some of its offshoots, such as al-Nusra Front in Syria, could be viewed as a counterweight to ISIS, Gartenstein-Ross said. ""It will be seen, I think, as a real problem for us in the longer term,"" he added.","British PM David Cameron announces proposals to counter extremist threats .

"(CNN) -- Over the past few weeks, politicians who have taken a hard-line stance against insurance coverage for contraception are offering a new alternative: make birth control available over the counter. At first glance, this appears to be a welcome shift, a reflection of the growing support for making birth control available to more women. It's not. When health insurance doesn't cover birth control and women have to pay out of pocket at the drugstore, it won't expand access to birth control but shrink it. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more than 48 million women in the U.S. are eligible for preventive care, including birth control, with no co-pay. We're not just talking about the pill; we are talking about the full range of contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration. That's 48 million women who are able to go to the pharmacy or a doctor's office and get birth control with no out-of-pocket costs. In the first full year of the birth control benefit, American women saved $483 million more (PDF). So when politicians who have otherwise embraced policies that would drag women back to the 1950s suggest making birth control available over the counter instead of covering it in insurance plans, they're not experiencing a change of heart. They're suggesting something that would take us back to the days when women had to pay out-of-pocket for their prescriptions, making birth control harder to get for many women, not least women who use birth control methods that simply cannot be stocked on store shelves, like IUDs, one of the most effective (and expensive) forms of long-acting birth control. Offering over-the-counter birth control instead of insurance coverage for birth control amounts to a $483 million tax on women. Let's get one thing clear: More access to birth control is a good thing. That's why Planned Parenthood was founded nearly 100 years ago -- and it's why a full range of women's preventive care, including birth control, is now covered under the Affordable Care Act. Planned Parenthood, the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology agree with virtually every other mainstream health care provider and expert in this country: Birth control should be more available. Planned Parenthood has been fighting to expand access to birth control for nearly 100 years. We support making it available over the counter, in addition to requiring insurance plans to cover it -- but not instead of requiring no co-pay coverage. Women deserve both/and, not either/or. When America's leading doctors and scientists sat down last year to identify the top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century, here's what made the list: reducing heart disease, fluoride in drinking water, identifying the risks of tobacco, vaccines for a host of epidemics -- and birth control. That's because for women, the ability to decide whether and when to have children has changed everything. Thanks to birth control, more women are able to get an education, finish school and pursue careers. Women are now making more money (though we still have a ways to go on that front) and are represented in higher numbers in the work force. In the decades since birth control became widely available, child mortality declined and health outcomes improved for women, infants and children. For women, birth control isn't a controversial topic or a political bargaining chip; it's basic health care, and it's only a ""social issue"" if you've never had to pay for it. That's why insurance coverage for birth control is so revolutionary -- and necessary. Let's get one thing clear: More access to birth control is a good thing. Back when Congress was figuring out what should and shouldn't be included as part of health reform, the nonpartisan Institute of Medicine was asked to develop recommendations for women's health benefits that absolutely had to be in. The Institute recommended that insurance cover eight critical women's health services, including breastfeeding counseling and supplies, HIV screening, domestic violence services -- and birth control. Sensing a theme? The bottom line: Political proposals to make birth control available over the counter have less to do with access and more to do with the price tag, which they want women to cover out of pocket. We don't have time or energy to waste on political games, not when roughly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended and too many women still struggle to get the health care they need. At Planned Parenthood, we are eager to work with anyone who has an idea that would make birth control more readily available to women. So to these politicians: Come see us when you're really ready to talk, and let's see if we can come up with the next great advance in women's health.","Cecile Richards: Politicians' push for over-the-counter birth control is not good news .

"Lori Day, a mom, educational psychologist, parenting coach and new author, remembers that day about 15 years ago so well. She was reading something in The New York Times about how clothing manufacturers were marketing adult fashions directly to girls as young as her daughter, who was 7 at the time. Frustrated, she headed upstairs to her ""clunky old Dell desktop computer"" (remember, it was 1999) and wrote her first letter to the editor. At about the same time that she says her eyes were opened to the sexualization of girls, she and her only child, Charlotte, passed by their local book shop. In the window was a display about mother-daughter book clubs. Pink, princess-y and sexy too soon . Charlotte was immediately curious. ""We went in, and she really quickly said, 'Mommy, I want to do this.' And ... all the light bulbs were going off for me."" Day and Charlotte, who was then 8 and in the third grade, went on to start their mother-daughter book club in 2000 with four other mothers and daughters. Their experiences and the ways mother-daughter book clubs can help empower girls are the focus of Day's new book, ""Her Next Chapter: How Mother-Daughter Book Clubs Can Help Girls Navigate Malicious Media, Risky Relationships, Girl Gossip and So Much More."" For six years, from the third grade up until the girls finished middle school, Day, Charlotte and the other mothers and daughters would meet monthly and tackle issues that the girls might have felt uncomfortable discussing directly with their mothers and that their moms might not have known how to bring up with them. ""You get these wonderful moments where it's almost like the girls forget their moms are there and they're into the discussion,"" Day said. She said that happened when they read a book that involved bullying. ""And the kids will be talking about the girl who was bullied, and then one of them will say, 'Well, that was me' or 'This happened to my friend.' They'll start telling a story about something that happened at school, and the moms are sort of invisible in that moment, and that lets you see something that you might not otherwise ever see or hear from your child or someone else's child."" Children's Choice Book Awards: What your kids actually like to read . Ironically, they dealt with bullying in their very own club. One of the girls was fat-shaming another girl in the club who was overweight, and these were kids who had known each other since kindergarten and who had been together since the third grade. ""My biggest regret honestly, and I talk about this in the book, is that we never explicitly discussed at the beginning of forming our club what we would do if it happens, because there was just this ... assumption that we had been friends for so long that we were somehow immune, but why did we think that? ""Anyone's child can be the bully; anyone's child can be bullied."" Day recommends that mothers who are planning to start a book club get together first to discuss issues such as how they'll handle any conflicts, the goals of the club and the comfort level with the amount of sex and violence that might be included in books, especially as the girls enter middle school. At times, even in her own club, it was hard to come to agreement on books. She was the more liberal member of her club when it came to mature content, she says, because as someone who has worked in schools for 25 years, she knew that children are always more worldly than their parents think they are. Mean girls: How not to raise one . ""So I wanted my daughter to share about things and learn about things first with me so that ... I could process those things with her and answer her questions."" Day believes mother-daughter book clubs may be even more important today than when she started one nearly 15 years ago. ""When I was raising Charlotte, we didn't have the Internet. We didn't have the cyberbullying. We did not have the digital media assault on girls in terms of body image and everything that we have right now. ""I have so many concerns about how adrift girls can be and how vulnerable they are to the messages they get from media about what their role is as females, and so I think having these clubs is just a way to sidestep some of that noise."" Helping girls navigate what they see and hear in the media was an enormous positive to their book club experience, Day said. So was getting to know her daughter, now a graduate student at the University of Rhode Island, in a unique way. The puberty ad you'll want to show all girls and boys . ""I had a different lens on her than I ever would have had without this experience of seeing her in a group with other girls and seeing her with other female role models besides me,"" she said. ""It let us know the girls and the girls know us as human beings, just in a different way than mommies and daughters."" It was also a big benefit to learn from the other mothers: to see how they modeled things, how they talked to their girls and how they handled issues. ""I mean, we dealt with a lot of the usual things that come up in life such as going back to work, divorce, more children, things that happen in the life of a family,"" she said. They also became each other's support group. ""I think mothers can feel really isolated and intimidated. The parenting culture right now is very judgmental and confusing, all these different methods ... attachment parenting or this or that, and we were not about that stuff. ... We created our own support system for raising these girls."" To those who say ""what about mother-son or father-son book clubs,"" Day says bring them on. She supports any opportunity for parents and their children to connect over books -- or movies and videos if the parents or children don't have the interest or time to read. Middle school transition: Tough for teens and parents . She wrote about mother-daughter book clubs, she says, because that was her experience but also because she does believe there are certain issues going on now in our culture that are particularly difficult for girls. ""Boys have issues too, and I have concerns about boys as well, but I think for girls, when you are talking about media and marketing, the sexualization, the stereotypes about girls, the dumbing down of stuff for girls is just so concerning to me, so I don't feel I have anything to apologize for in pushing mother-daughter book clubs."" No, you don't, as far as this reporter is concerned. And now, as my daughter enters the third grade, I'm planning to send this story to her friends' moms. Time for us to start a mother-daughter book club of our own! 100 books to read in a lifetime . Do you think mother-daughter book clubs are a good way to empower women?

"Less than two months after 43-year-old Eric Garner died in a police chokehold, New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton announced that all NYPD officers will undergo a three-day retraining period on the proper use of force when engaging a suspect. The training will focus on how officers can avoid physical confrontations when talking to and restraining suspects, as well as how to safely take them into custody without bringing harm to either the individual or the officer.  Officers will also undergo a leadership and cultural sensitivity workshop. ""It was evident to me and Mayor (Bill) de Blasio... that there was a need for a fundamental shift in the culture of the department, from an overarching focus on police activity... to an emphasis on collaborative problem-solving with the community,"" Bratton said before the city council's Committee for Public Safety Monday. The retraining will begin with a pilot program in November and then will then be administered to the approximately 20,000 officers who regularly serve on patrol.  The remaining 15,000 officers will receive the training as part of their annual ""in-service"" training program.  New recruits will adopt the new training program into their existing curriculum. Funds needed for program . Bratton appealed to the city council for monetary support for the new initiative, estimating that the NYPD will need about $25 million to pay for additional trainers, expand the size of the Police Academy staff, and to cover overtime compensation costs for officers needed to fill in for other officers during their three-day training period. Bratton ordered an extensive review of the NYPD's training procedures following Garner's death and hopes that new resources devoted to training will lead to overall improvement in officer practices. ""We cannot arrest our way out of every crime problem,"" Bratton said.  ""Arrests will always be a critical part of what we do.  However, there are other tools in our toolbox we can use when the situation calls for it."" Death ruled a homicide . Garner, a father of six, died after NYPD officers confronted him on Staten Island for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally. During the encounter, a video shows a police officer grabbing the 350-pound man in a chokehold and pulling him onto a sidewalk. The New York City Medical Examiner's office later ruled Garner's death a homicide.  The cause of death was ""compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police."" A Staten Island grand jury is expected to hear evidence in the case sometime this month. Another restraint death . On July 13, another suspect died after being restrained in police custody -- a death that was also ruled a homicide, the medical examiner's office said. Ronald Singleton, who was African-American, was taken into police custody after a yellow cab driver flagged down a police officer near St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, police said in a statement. The cab driver claimed the passenger was ""acting overly irate and irrational, cursing and screaming and causing alarm,"" according to the statement. Singleton got out of the taxi and ""became combative with the officer, trying to fight with him,"" the police statement said. The officer called for help and other officers responded, along with members of the NYPD Emergency Service Unit. Singleton, 45, was placed in a ""protective body wrap by the ESU officers,"" the police statement said. An ambulance was taking Singleton to a hospital when he went into cardiac arrest, the statement said. Singleton was dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital. The NYPD said it was cooperating with the Manhattan district attorney's office investigation of the death. The medical examiner's office said factors such as ""hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"" and obesity contributed to Singleton's death.

"In July and early August, doctors at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta diagnosed 15 to 20 children a week with serious respiratory infections -- a normal number for the summer months. Then, pediatricians started to see more children who were having trouble breathing, more parents with worried looks on their faces. Since school started, the hospital has seen an average of 100 cases a week. ""We are seeing a double to quadruple increase in the number of children with respiratory infections,"" says Dr. Andi Shane, hospital epidemiologist at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. U.S. 'ill-prepared' for a pandemic, feds say . More than 10 states around the Midwest and Southeast have reported seeing similarly high numbers of hospitalizations for children with severe respiratory illnesses. The virus has sent more than 30 children a day to a Kansas City, Missouri, hospital, where about 15% of the youngsters were placed in intensive care, health officials said. Doctors say they think the increase is due to a bug called Enterovirus D68, an uncommon type of enterovirus that seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children with asthma. List of states with Enterovirus grows . But nailing down the culprit, and tracking the number of cases, is easier said than done. Children's Healthcare, like most hospitals around the nation, tests samples from children with respiratory illnesses to determine if they have a viral infection. But the tests don't distinguish between the rhinovirus, which is the most common cause of the common cold, and enteroviruses, which can cause a variety of symptoms. Once hospitals noticed this upward trend in severe respiratory illness cases, they requested help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in identifying the specific virus at fault. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta is working with the Georgia Department of Public Health to submit specimens to the CDC, which is already testing samples from states like Alabama, Utah and Michigan. Sick kids flooding ER in Alabama . Six states -- Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri and Iowa -- have confirmed cases of EV-D68. Yet even in those states, not all samples came back positive for this specific type of enterovirus. Nineteen of the 25 samples sent from Children's Hospital Colorado were EV-D68, said Dr. Christine Nyquist, medical director of infection control. Kentucky submitted 10 samples; five came back positive. In Missouri, 19 of 22 specimens sent to the CDC were confirmed to be EV-D68. The problem is that there are more than 60 enteroviruses that are known to infect humans, according to the CDC; these viruses cause an estimated 10 million to 15 million illnesses each year. Symptoms can range from the sniffles to stomach issues to a severe respiratory infection. What parents should know about EV-D68 . The average healthy adult gets two to three colds a year, the CDC says; children usually get more. They're more at risk because their immune systems haven't had a chance to build up immunity to these common viral infections. The CDC doesn't require state health departments to track these types of infections, since they are usually dealt with at home and patients recover with a little TLC. So getting a firm count of the number of people infected -- or what other states may be at risk -- for EV-D68 is difficult. ""CDC is watching this situation closely,"" the public health agency's website states.","Children's Healthcare of Atlanta has seen a ""double to quadruple increase"" in respiratory illnesses .

"(CNN)The wait is finally over for aviation fanatics wanting to book a flight aboard the Airbus A350 XWB. Qatar Airways, the global launch customer of the A350 XWB, accepted delivery of the commercial plane during a ceremony at Airbus' headquarters in Toulouse, France, on Monday morning. ""It is more than a great day for Airbus,"" the manufacturer's CEO, Fabrice Bregier, told a press conference. ""I would say it was an historic day."" The ""XWB"" in the name means ""extra wide body."" There are three different iterations of the plane being built: the A350-800, the A350-900 and the A350-1000, which seat 270, 314 and 350 passengers, respectively, in three-class seating. Qatar Airways opted for a two-class, 283-seat configuration in its A350-900, offering 36 business class seats and 247 in economy class. In total, the airline has ordered 80 of the airplanes -- 43 A350-900 jetliners and 37 of the longer-fuselage -1000 versions. In a statement, the airline said it expects to induct the first eight production aircraft into its fleet before 2015 year-end. Qatar Airways' new A350-900 will enter into commercial service in January, operating daily flights between its Hamad International Airport hub in Doha, Qatar and Frankfurt, Germany. Minor turbulence delays delivery . Monday's A350 delivery ceremony was originally supposed to take place on December 12, but the airline canceled the event just a few days beforehand. Neither side initially offered an explanation, leaving aviation analysts to speculate on what was behind the hold up. Qatar Airlines CEO Akbar Al Baker told Monday's press conference that the delay was related to one of its suppliers and was not an issue with Airbus. ""It's important to note that the aircraft has been delivered to us one week ahead of schedule, not late,"" he said. Delays are nothing new for Qatar Airways, which also postponed the delivery of three of its A380 superjumbos this year after Al Baker reportedly expressed concerns about the quality of the interior. Airbus chief Bregier described Al Baker as a ""tough customer... you are demanding, sometimes for us a bit too demanding."" He said Qatar's exacting standards had raised the quality of the final product and would make it easier to sell to other carriers. Bregier also used Monday's event to try to draw a line under recent reports that it might pull the plug on A380 production after a fall off in orders. He said such speculation was ""just crazy... after all the efforts we have made."" ""I can tell you the A380 will have a brighter future as the market gets bigger."" The A350's road to flight . The A350 XWB is the first in a family of super-efficient passenger planes Airbus designed to go head-to-head with rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 777s. The project for the new jet began in 2006 and was initially criticized by some in the industry, including airlines, for not really advancing the global aviation scene. Being publicly lambasted by some of its largest customers -- one aviation executive called it a Band-Aid reaction to the 787 Dreamliner, while the CEO of Singapore Airlines said the plane just didn't go far enough -- the pressure was on for Airbus to come up with a game changing plane. Much of the aircraft we see today is the result of that pressure. Made from advanced materials, 53% of the A350 XWB frame consists of carbon-fiber reinforced polymer, including Airbus' first carbon-fiber fuselage. As a result, Airbus says the plane will burn 25% less fuel than existing similar size jets. The A350 XWB is powered by two massive Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines, though those who have experienced its test flights say it's remarkable just how quiet the plane actually is. Airbus says passengers will also get a higher quality of air (replaced on the aircraft every two to three minutes), wider cabins and 18-inch-wide seats in economy. As of the end of November, Airbus has received 778 firm A350 orders from 41 airlines. To meet this demand, Airbus says it's ramping up production progressively to reach the planned rate of 10 aircraft per month by 2018. The 2014 list prices for the aircraft are: $260.9 million for the A350-800, $295.2 million for the A350-900 and $340.7 million for the A350-1000. How to spot an A350? With the first of nearly 800 A350s set to hit the skies, plane spotters will be particularly keen to see the sporty new jet in flight. So how will you know when you're looking at one? Key distinguishing features include a streamlined nose and wrap-around cockpit windows. Also, located just ahead of the windshield are the jetliner's nose-mounted pitot tubes, which measure speed, lateral drift and angle of attack during flight, says Airbus.

"For three months, they've staked their claim to Kiev's Maidan, or Independence Square, and to Ukraine itself. We will leave only when you pull closer to the European Union, when you change the constitution, when you alter the government's power structure, they have loudly insisted. But why? Why have thousands of protesters staked their lives, seemingly, on their desire for political change? And why has the government resisted their calls so vehemently? Let's take a look: . 1. What prompted the protests? At the heart of the protests is a trade pact. For a year, President Viktor Yanukovych insisted he was intent on signing a historical political and trade agreement with the European Union. But on November 21, he decided to suspend talks with the EU. 2. What would the pact have done? The deal, the EU's ""Eastern Partnership,"" would have created closer political ties and generated economic growth. It would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion, supporters of the pact said. 3. Why did Yanukovych backpedal? He had his reasons. Chief among them was Russia's opposition to it. Russia threatened its much smaller neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if Ukraine forged ahead. If Ukraine didn't, and instead joined a Moscow-led Customs Union, it would get deep discounts on natural gas, Russia said. 4. Were there any other reasons? Yes, a more personal one. Yanukovych also was facing a key EU demand that he was unwilling to meet: Free former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, his bitter political opponent. Two years ago, she was found guilty of abuse of office in a Russian gas deal and sentenced to seven years in prison, in a case widely seen as politically motivated. Her supporters say she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment. 5. What happened next? Many Ukrainians were outraged. They took to the streets, demanding that Yanukovych sign the EU deal. Their numbers swelled. The demonstrations drew parallels to Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution, which booted Yanukovych, then a prime minister, from office. 6. Who's heading the opposition? It's not just one figure, but a coalition. The best known figure is Vitali Klitschko. He's a former world champion boxer (just like his brother Wladimir). Klitschko heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party. But the oppositon bloc goes well beyond Klitschko and the UDAR. There's also Arseniy Yatsenyuk. (More on him later.) 7. How did Yanukovych react? In a way that inflamed passions further. He flew to Moscow, where he and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Russia would buy $15 billion in Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas. And then, when the demonstrations showed no signs of dying down, he adopted a sweepting anti-protest law. 8. What did the anti-protest law say? The law barred people from wearing helmets and masks to rallies and from setting up tents or sound equipment without prior police permission. This sparked concerns it could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech -- and clashes soon escalated. The demonstrators took over City Hall for the better part of three months. 9. But wasn't the law repealed? Yes, ultimately it was. Amid intense pressure, deputies loyal to Yanukovych backtracked and overturned it. But by then, the protests had become about something much bigger: constitutional reform. 10. What change in the constitution did they want to see? The protesters want to see a change in the government's overall power structure. They feel that too much power rests with Yanukovych and not enough with parliament. 11. What did the government do? In late January, the President offered a package of concessions under which Yatsenyuk, the opposition leader, would have become the prime minister and, under the President's offer, been able to dismiss the government. He also offered Klitschko the post of deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues. He also agreed to a working group looking at changes to the constitution. But the opposition refused. 12. Why did the opposition pass on the offer? The concessions weren't enough to satisfy them. They said Yanukovych had hardly loosened his grip on the government, nor had he seemingly reined in authorities' approach to protesters. ""We're finishing what we started,"" Yatsenyuk said. 13. But over the weekend, it seemed things were getting better, weren't they? Yes. On Sunday, protesters vacated Kiev's City Hall, unblocked a major street and left other government buildings in exchange for the government dropping charges against those arrested. But any breakthrough was a distant memory by Tuesday. 14. Why? What happened Tuesday? The opposition wanted to introduce amendments in parliament that would have limited the President's powers and restored the constitution to what it was in 2004. But the speaker of parliament refused to allow it. Bloody clashes followed. 15. Who was to blame for the clashes? Depends on whom you ask. The government pointed the finger at protesters. The opposition, in turn, blamed the government. Regardless, it was the bloodiest day of protests up to that point; 28 people died. 16. Wasn't there a truce called? Yes, the government and opposition agreed on a truce late Wednesday. But it barely took hold -- and blood was flowing again Thursday. 17. What caused the fresh clashes? Gunfire erupted Thursday at Maidan, or Independence Square, which has been ground zero for anti-government protesters. At least 20 people died. It's unclear what prompted the gunfire. Again, finger-pointing followed: The government said protesters broke the truce; the protesters said the government did. 18. So, what happens next? Top international diplomats have been trying to resolve the crisis. There's also been talk of sanctions. 19. Will sanctions help? Analysts warn there's little that outside pressure could do, especially if the Ukrainian military gets involved on the side of the government. 20. What's the takeaway here? Street protests that started in November over a trade pact have swelled into something much bigger -- a demand that the President loosen his grip on power and the constitution be changed. As a result, the eastern European country is in the midst of a wave of anti-government protests, the likes of which it hasn't seen in 10 years. There's something else: Ukraine, the biggest frontier nation separating Russia and the European Union, is something of a pawn between Russia and the West. The EU and the U.S. think Russia wields a lot of influence. Russia denies it. One open-ended question is how much worse it will all get. ""My own hunch,"" said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, ""is this is going to continue to escalate.""","Ukraine has been rattled by anti-government protests since November .
The trigger then was the President's decision not to sign a trade pact with the EU .
Ukraine is split: Some want to align more with the West, others favor Russia .
The opposition has also pushed to shift power away from the President ."
"(CNN) -- In a video uploaded to YouTube on Saturday purportedly by the terrorist group ISIS, various scenes of jihadist propaganda flash across the screen: militants reading verses from the Quran and examining a map of northern Syria, clips of violent clashes and explosions. But this video had something else in it that previous videos released by ISIS have not: Surveillance footage apparently shot by a drone. The almost 14-minute video shows aerial views of Syrian Army Military Base 93 near Raqqa province in northern Syria. ISIS militants attacked the base on August 7, deploying suicide bombers driving truck bombs to soften up resistance in scenes that are also shown in the videotape that was released Saturday. The caption over the surveillance footage of the Syrian military base reads: ""From the drone of the army of the Islamic State."" That ISIS appears now to be using a relatively sophisticated surveillance drone to plan its military operations underlines an important development: Technology that was once the monopoly of states is now being used by terrorist groups. In April, for example, the Israeli military said it had shot down a drone off the coast of Haifa and that it was operated by Hezbollah, the militant Shiite group operating out of Lebanon. Hezbollah denied responsibility for the drone, but had claimed earlier that it had operated another drone that had flown 35 miles into Israel in October. Hamas, too, has drone capabilities. On July 14, Israel shot down a Hamas-operated drone that was flying in Israeli airspace above Ashdod, a city in southern Israel, marking what is believed to be the first time the militant group had sent an unmanned aircraft into Israeli territory. Hamas then posted a video online that showed another drone, this one with four small rockets under its wings, flying over what analysts believe could also be Israeli airspace. According to Hamas, its military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, has engineered three different types of drones: ones for surveillance purposes; ones that can be armed; and ones that can operate as self-guided missiles -- a sort of ""suicide drone."" Israel subsequently bombed what it claimed was a Hamas-run drone facility in Gaza. Libyan opposition fighters targeting Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi started using drones for surveillance during the summer of 2011 when they bought a Scout drone from a Canadian company. The Libyan opposition needed a way to survey its routes before sending rebels into areas where Gadhafi's soldiers were stationed. The four-rotor helicopter that dangles a stabilized camera seemed like the perfect option. The drone cost between $100,000 and $200,000, according to an article by Laura Rozen for Yahoo News. Armed drones have been deployed in combat by only three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel. However, according to a count by the New America Foundation, some 80 countries have some kind of drone capability, whether armed or unarmed. Russia, China and Iran are among the nations that possess armed drones but haven't used them in combat . That terrorist and militant organizations have acquired and used drones during combat operations for surveillance purposes shows how rapidly this technology is proliferating. This is why it is crucial to have some kind of international agreement that governs the use of armed drones by both states and ""nonstate actors."" One could imagine the creation of some kind of Geneva Convention that specifies as a matter of international law when the use of armed drones could be sanctioned outside of conventional war zones to kill terrorists. Such a convention would also help to prevent the sale or transfer of sophisticated drone technology to nonstate actors such as ISIS.","Peter Bergen, Cynthia Schneider: Video seems to show that ISIS has surveillance drone .

"Utah officials will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a lower-court ruling allowing same-sex marriage in the state, the state attorney general's office said Thursday. Newly appointed Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes will seek a stay of the federal judge's ruling after state officials consult first with outside attorneys over the next few days. ""It is the intent of the Attorney General's Office to file with the Supreme Court as soon as possible,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement. The emergency appeal, when filed, would go to Justice Sonia Sotomayor because she has jurisdiction over appeals from Utah and nearby states. She could rule on the state's application herself or ask the entire nine-member court to weigh in. Sotomayor is likely to refer the Utah request to the entire court, as is tradition with high-profile traditional cases, said Carl Tobias, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Richmond. The Utah announcement comes two days after state officials lost their case in a federal appeals court, which said the state's request for a stay wasn't warranted and ordered the appeal process be expedited. The appeals court's ruling allows same-sex marriages to continue in Utah while appeals continue. Last week, U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby struck down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage, saying the law ""conflicts with the United States Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law."" Utah voters approved a law banning same-sex marriage in 2004. Judge Shelby's ruling drew national attention partly because Utah is viewed as among the more conservative states and because the U.S. Supreme Court just ruled this summer on same-sex marriage. In June, the nation's highest court cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume after it ruled private parties did not have ""standing"" to defend California's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. The U.S. Supreme Court also rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in a 5-4 decision, dismissing an appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds and ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. In the Utah case, the state argues that the ""federal district court's ruling that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right has never been established in any previous case in the 10th Circuit"" Court of Appeals, the attorney general's office said. The federal judge's ruling, nonetheless, prompted a rush of same-sex couples to courthouses in Utah where they obtained marriage licenses, despite the state's ongoing legal challenge. Some jurisdictions such as Piute and San Juan Counties are issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but there haven't been requests for them there, officials said. Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert has criticized Judge Shelby's ruling of last week, calling him ""an activist federal judge."" Shelby said the state's ""current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason. ""Accordingly, the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional,"" the judge said. Same-sex marriage is banned by constitutional amendment or state law in: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It is legal in 17 other U.S states and the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.","Sotomayor is likely to refer Utah request to entire court, expert says .

"Since mid-August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed more than 100 cases of Enterovirus D68 in 12 states: Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, New York and Oklahoma. Yet the real number of severe respiratory illnesses caused by this virus is probably even higher, the CDC says. Enteroviruses are very common, especially in the early fall. The CDC estimates that 10 million to 15 million infections occur in the United States each year. These viruses usually present like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. Most people recover without any treatment. But Enterovirus D68 appears to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma. ""Children less than 5 years old and children with underlying asthma appear to be at greatest risk of having medical complications from EV-D68,"" Oklahoma epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley said. ""If a child develops a cold or a cough, parents and caregivers should just watch the child a little more closely. ... If wheezing or asthma-like symptoms develop, medical care should be accessed immediately."" What parents should know . The virus is hard to track, as many enteroviruses cause similar symptoms and hospitals generally do not test for specific types. But the CDC has asked hospitals across the country to send in samples if workers suspect that Enterovirus D68 has caused a patient's severe respiratory illness. Alabama, Indiana and Oklahoma are the latest to join the growing list of states with confirmed cases, health officials say. Seven of 24 specimens sent to the CDC from Oklahoma hospitals and laboratories have tested positive for Enterovirus D68, the Oklahoma State Department of Health announced Tuesday. The state has seen an increase in pediatric admissions at hospitals in its central region. Enterovirus infections difficult to track . The Alabama Department of Public Health also sent six samples from Mobile County to the CDC for testing; four came back positive for Enterovirus D68. One of the other samples was Coxsackievirus B3, and the remaining one was negative, the department said in a news release. Health care providers in the state have been asked to report clusters of severe respiratory illness. Four children in Lake County, Indiana, were sickened by Enterovirus D68 and were treated at University of Chicago Hospital, according to a news release from the Indiana State Department of Health; all four have since been discharged from the hospital. Lake County is in the northwest corner of the state. Other states including Michigan, Georgia, Ohio and Utah are also investigating clusters of respiratory illnesses. Several have sent samples to the CDC for testing.","Oklahoma confirms seven cases of Enterovirus D68 .

"Los Angeles Authorities have arrested a man accused of swiping a piece of the wrecked sports car that ""Fast & Furious"" star Paul Walker was riding in when he died in a fiery crash Saturday. The theft occurred at a stop light as the charred 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was being removed from the accident scene on a flatbed tow truck late Saturday, according to the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. ""A witness saw a male exit a vehicle that was following the tow truck,"" the sheriff's department said Friday. ""The male grabbed a piece of the wrecked Porsche off the tow truck bed."" Authorities later arrested 18-year-old Jameson Witty in Tujunga, California.  A red T-top roof panel was recovered from a residence in Canyon Country.  Both are in the Santa Clarita area, where the accident happened. A second suspect has also been identified and is making arrangements to surrender himself, the sheriff's department said. Investigators have asked the district attorney to consider charges of felony grand theft and tampering with evidence against both men. The appropriation of Paul Walker . The accident . The crash took place on a wide street in a business park in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Hollywood. Walker was attending a holiday toy donation event for his charity, Reach Out WorldWide, when he hopped into the car, witnesses said. The Porsche, which was one of only a few hundred made, was on display at the event, which was held at a high-performance car shop owned by Roger Rodas, who was driving the car. Minutes after the two men drove away, people at the event heard the crash about 500 yards away, witnesses said. 5 things to know about Roger Rodas . Autopsy results .

"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Egypt had a critical role to play in countering extremism, as he met with Egyptian leaders in his latest effort to build regional support for President Barack Obama's strategy to combat ISIS. His stop in Cairo follows talks with leaders in Turkey on Friday and meetings with Arab leaders in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, a day earlier. Kerry spoke with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby, before meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. Egypt, a country whose population makes up a quarter of the Arab world, has great influence in the region as an intellectual and cultural capital, Kerry told a news conference in Cairo. As such it can play a central role in the global fight against terrorism and extremism, he said, adding that this had been an important feature of the Arab leaders' discussions in Jeddah. The ideology of ISIS has ""nothing to do with Islam,"" Kerry said. ""It is increasingly clear that its message of hate is rejected by the overwhelming majority of Muslims around the world. ""I've heard this loud and clear from leader after leader in Muslim states that I've visited and it is clear in the pronouncements of religious leaders around the world."" Nice words but limited commitment so far for Obama's ISIS coalition . 'No place in modern world' Kerry also spoke of the need for international partners to support the new government in Iraq, not only militarily but with humanitarian aid, addressing illicit funding stream reaching ISIS and stopping the flow of foreign fighters. Kerry said efforts to move forward the coalition against ISIS would continue Monday in Paris, where France is hosting an international conference on the crisis in Iraq. The Australian government is preparing to deploy up to 10 aircraft, including up to eight combat aircraft, to the United Arab Emirates in response to a U.S. request to contribute to the coalition, the Australian prime minister's office said Sunday. ""We are not deploying combat troops but contributing to international efforts to prevent the humanitarian crisis from deepening,"" Prime Minister Tony Abbott's office said in a statement. The threat posed by ISIS will also be on the agenda of the upcoming U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, Kerry said. Almost every country in the world can help in the fight against the Sunni extremist group, he said. ""The bottom line is that terrorists like ISIL have no place in the modern world but it's up to the world to enforce that truth."" The U.S. government refers to ISIS as ISIL, while the group now calls itself Islamic State. Kerry also said he had discussed Egypt's democratic transition with el-Sisi. Kerry: U.S. not at war with ISIS . 'Acute threat' A senior State Department official told reporters on the way to Cairo that a ""broad consensus"" was reached in the Jeddah talks that the threat posed by ISIS is the most acute in the region. This threat ""crosses borders, and if it isn't stopped, would increasingly expand beyond borders,"" the official said. ""So that is why, not just Egypt, but all countries in the region need to focus not just on whatever parochial counterterrorism and other issues that they need to resolve, but also this broader threat to the region and beyond."" Obama outlined a plan in a speech Wednesday to ""dismantle and ultimately destroy"" the Sunni extremist group that has seized a swath of territory across Iraq and Syria. ISIS has said it's bent on creating an Islamic ""caliphate,"" where harsh Sharia law governs every aspect of life. As Iraq needs strong air support from its allies to confront ISIS, French President Francois Hollande promised Iraq's new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi that France ""will participate in efforts to hit terrorist locations in Iraq,"" al-Abadi told reporters in Baghdad Friday. ""We need air support and not soldiers on the ground,"" al-Abadi said. U.S. forces have already carried out more than 150 air strikes against ISIS targets in Iraq. Military aid . Obama said Wednesday that the U.S. counterterrorism operation could include possible airstrikes in civil war-torn Syria. He also said 475 more U.S. military advisers will head to Iraq, raising the total of American forces there to 1,700 for a mission originally described as limited. In addition, Obama shifted $25 million in military aid to Iraqi forces, including Kurdish fighters in the north combating the ISIS extremists. The aid could include ammunition, small arms and vehicles, as well as military education and training, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. It's not clear how soon U.S. forces will launch operations in Syria. New U.S. envoy to join coalition . Kerry announced Saturday his appointment of retired Gen. John Allen as special presidential envoy for the new coalition to fight ISIS, to be joined by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Brett McGurk. Both will begin work immediately, according to Kerry's statement. Taking on ISIS: That which we call a 'war' ...","Australia will send up to 10 aircraft to help fight ISIS after a U.S. request .

"The Porsche carrying ""Fast & Furious"" star Paul Walker was speeding at more than 100 miles per hour when it crashed in November, killing the actor and a friend, according to the final coroner's report on the deaths. The 15-page report released Friday by the Los Angeles County coroner's office answered several questions that had been the subject of speculation about how Walker and racing team partner Roger Rodas died. The two men apparently did not live long after the high-performance 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, which was traveling at ""approximately 100+ mph,"" slammed into a light post and tree and burst into flames, the report said. Walker, who shot to fame as star of the high-octane street racing franchise ""Fast & Furious,"" was in the passenger seat of the car driven by Rodas. Walker, 40, and Rodas, 38, left a charity event at a car shop co-owned by the men to take a ride in an office park in the community of Valencia in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Hollywood. The crash happened a few hundred yards away on a wide street. ""For unknown reasons, the driver lost control of the vehicle, and the vehicle partially spun around, and began to travel in a southeast direction,"" the coroner's report said. ""The vehicle then struck a sidewalk and the driver's side of the vehicle struck a tree and then a light post. The force of those collisions caused the vehicle to spin 180 degrees, and it continued to travel in an easterly direction. The passenger side of the vehicle then struck a tree and the vehicle burst into flames."" 5 things to know about Roger Rodas . Video obtained by CNN from a security camera posted on a building on the opposite side of the street from the crash suggests that the fire that engulfed the Porsche did not erupt until about a minute after the car crashed. In the video, which does not show the car, black smoke is seen rising from the crash scene 60 seconds after the light pole and a tree fall. Smoke is faintly visible above the scene after one minute, followed by a heavy plume of black smoke after two minutes. The autopsy revealed ""scant soot"" in Walker's trachea, suggesting his life ended before the smoke and fire engulfed the car. Director: Paul Walker was excited about new career direction . The actor's body was badly burned ""and in a pugilistic stance. His right wrist was fractured and his left arm was fractured,"" the report said. Rodas was also described as in ""a pugilistic"" -- or defensive -- position. Walker suffered fractures of his left jawbone, collarbone, pelvis, ribs and spine, the report said. Rodas ""rapidly died of severe blunt head, neck and chest trauma,""  the report said. Stars who died during production . Investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department met with engineers from Porsche to analyze the data-retrieval system in the car's computer, the department said last month. That system is used to shed light on the car's speed, throttle opening, air bag deployment, seat belt use and, possibly, other information from the time of the crash. The coroner's report did not conclude whether the men were wearing seat belts. Walker's death came during a Thanksgiving break in filming of ""Fast and Furious 7,"" forcing a halt in the production. Universal Studios announced last month that the movie will be completed using scenes already filmed by Walker, but the release will be delayed from this summer until April 10, 2015.

"U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced Thursday a Justice Department investigation into the Ferguson, Missouri, police department, which has come under fire for its past practices in the uproar over the shooting of Michael Brown. Holder spoke about his recent trip to the area and about conversations he had with its residents. ""People consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents, from general policing practices and from the lack of diversity on the Ferguson police force. These anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in Ferguson that has received a good deal of attention,"" Holder told reporters. ""Our investigation will assess the police department's use of force, including deadly force. It will analyze stops, searches and arrests. And it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at Ferguson's city jail,"" he said. Such probes typically focus on paving the way for systemic reform going forward, rather than punishing misconduct from the past, said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. Nonetheless, they can produce significant changes within a department. ""It's very serious,"" Toobin said of the investigation, before it was formally announced, ""because it can lead to a virtual federal takeover of the police, as happened recently in New Orleans."" It is distinct from the Justice Department's previously announced civil rights probe that is specific to the August 9 shooting of Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson, who is white. Proving a civil rights violation would require showing that Wilson was actively hostile to Brown because of his race. The shooting and the fact authorities didn't immediately, and still haven't, charged Wilson spurred emotional and, at times, violent protests on the streets of Ferguson. Dozens were arrested over those tense few weeks, which were sometimes marred by looting and clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Brown's shooting also stirred up locals' gripes about Ferguson police over the years. Some of them said members of the predominantly white police force would routinely and inordinately single out African-Americans, who make up two-thirds of the St. Louis suburb's population. Residents: Police have 'a power trip problem' Many African-Americans said that they often found themselves subject to racial profiling -- such as being pulled over for no obvious reason besides, they presumed, ""DWB,"" or driving while black. Some white residents complained police have acted in a heavy-handed fashion. Chief Tom Jackson has said the claim that officers are more likely to stop blacks is more perception than reality. Other cases, though, went well beyond that. The family of Jason Moore recently filed a lawsuit accusing police of excessive force, saying he died of cardiac arrest on September 17, 2011, after police fired Tasers at him. The family says that Moore, who they say suffered a psychological disorder, was walking around naked and posed no threat to police. It's not clear which cases, specifically, the new federal investigation will examine. The probe will not focus on law enforcement's response to Brown-related protests, since that effort involved numerous agencies and Ferguson did not lead this multi-agency effort. $40 million lawsuit slams police actions during protests . Ferguson is be the latest of many local police and sheriff departments nationwide to be subject to such a federal investigation, which Toobin explains are launched ""when there are persistent allegations of misconduct."" This April, for instance, the Justice Department lambasted police in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for what it characterized as a longstanding history of police brutality and unnecessary deadly force, sometimes ""in an unconstitutional manner."" The report laid out several measures to address the problems, such as changing policies, training procedures and recruitment protocol. Report: Albuquerque police have 'pattern' of excessive, deadly force . Police departments in Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and elsewhere have agreed to Justice Department plans to address  controversial policies and patterns of alleged misconduct. But nowhere has the federal agency come down harder than on the New Orleans police department, which has been plagued for years by allegations of corruption, excessive use of force, illegal searches and widespread racial discrimination. In July 2012, Holder detailed a consent decree -- which he called the most wide-ranging such agreement in  U.S. history -- that includes more than 100 recommendations dealing with virtually every aspect of the department.

"It's time to go after ISIS in Iraq and Syria, President Barack Obama said Wednesday night in a nationally televised address intended to sell stepped-up military efforts to a war-weary public. Announcing a broad campaign against the Sunni jihadists who have rampaged from Syria across northern Iraq, Obama announced an escalated U.S. military role as part of a strategy that includes building an international coalition to support Iraqi ground forces and perhaps troops from other allies. U.S. airstrikes have been hitting the jihadists in Iraq. Those strikes will be expanded to ISIS targets in Syria, Obama said. ""I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,"" he said. ""That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven."" The declaration answered calls from a growing number of U.S. politicians for such a step, with increasing public support. ""This was a very difficult speech for him to give,"" CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said of a president who campaigned on ending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""He's inserted us into the middle of a Syrian civil war."" More U.S. forces to Iraq . Obama also announced another 475 American military advisers would go to Iraq, pushing the total figure to about 1,700. At the same time, he made clear the strategy differed from all-out war again in Iraq less than three years after he withdrew combat forces from the country. ""It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil,"" Obama said. His address from the White House also sought to convince allies and the nation of a firm U.S. commitment to lead an international coalition to fight the jihadists who rampaged across northern Iraq from Syria this year. They are known as ISIS, ISIL and Islamic State. Noting the formation of a new Iraqi government, which his administration has demanded, Obama announced that ""America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat."" Objective: ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" ISIS . ""Our objective is clear: We will degrade, and ultimately destroy, ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy,"" he said. Senior administration officials who briefed reporters before the speech on condition of not being identified said airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria would occur ""at a time and place of our choosing."" ""We're not going to telegraph our punches by being specific about the time and nature of the targets,"" one official said, adding that ""we will do that as necessary as we develop targets."" Also Wednesday, Obama shifted $25 million in military aid to Iraqi forces, including Kurdish fighters in the north combating the ISIS extremists. The aid could include ammunition, small arms and vehicles, as well as military education and training, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. U.S. diplomatic efforts this week seek to solidify the coalition. Secretary of State John Kerry left Tuesday to push Sunni leaders in Jordan and Saudi Arabia to join the United States and its allies in combating ISIS, while Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Lisa Monaco, the homeland security adviser, also will be in the region. Saudis part of coalition . ""The Saudis made very clear that they support this mission, they will join us in this mission,"" a senior administration official said. ""We are joined by very important Arab partners as well."" Obama has been criticized by conservatives and some Democrats for what they call a timid response so far to the threat by ISIS fighters. The recent beheading of two American journalists held captive by ISIS raised public awareness of the extremists and the threat they pose. ""We can't erase every trace of evil from the world, and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm. That was the case before 9/11, and that remains true today,"" Obama said. ISIS poses a threat to the Middle East, including the people of Iraq and Syria, he said, adding: ""If left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region, including the United States."" ""The next phase is offense"" Conservative Republicans who have railed against Obama's foreign policy sounded relieved by what they heard. ""The President's plan announced this evening is an encouraging step in the right direction,"" said GOP Rep. Mike Rogers, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee and has been a harsh Obama critic. ""Success will depend on the details of its implementation."" His Republican colleage, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, said: ""Tonight the President seemed to have faced reality."" Leading Democrats such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York praised the speech, as expected,  while Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey said the Foreign Relations Committee he chairs would begin drafting legislation to provide Obama with specific authority under the War Powers Resolution to continue to extend military operations against ISIS. Meanwhile, the anti-war liberal caucus in the House signaled possible opposition by calling for a vote on authorizing expanded military action. Congressional authority . Obama has insisted he has the authority to ratchet up airstrikes against ISIS under war powers granted more than a decade ago to fight al Qaeda. ISIS formed from some al Qaeda affiliates but is separate from the central leadership of the terrorist organization behind the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. This week, he asked Congress for additional authority to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels to fight the ISIS extremists, effectively shifting a covert operation by the CIA to a mission led by the Defense Department. Such authority comes under Title 10 of the U.S. code, which deals with military powers, and Congress could vote on granting it next week. Approval also would allow the United States to accept money from other countries for backing the Syrian opposition forces. Most voices in Congress back strong U.S. action against the ISIS fighters. However, any vote on military action can be risky, especially with congressional elections less than two months off. Fraught politics . The fraught politics of the issue were clear when House Republican leaders put off a vote on a government spending measure set for Wednesday after pressure emerged to add the Title 10 authorization to it. Obama initially rejected arming the Syrian opposition against President Bashar al-Assad more than two years ago to avoid getting mired in another Middle East conflict. U.S. officials also feared American weapons could end up in the hands of extremists, such as al Qaeda affiliates that eventually morphed into ISIS. As the tide has turned against Syria's opposition, which now finds itself fighting both government forces and ISIS, the United States began its covert aid to some rebel factions. ""Now we have a two-year track record of relationships with the Syrian opposition,"" a senior administration official said. ""We have far greater confidence in who we are dealing with."" Until now, the U.S. strategy against ISIS has included airstrikes on the extremists in Iraq to protect several hundred American military personnel there while helping the Iraqis and providing humanitarian support. Veteran diplomat: ISIS worse than al Qaeda . Calls for a  more forceful campaign against ISIS have increased in recent months. Former U.S. ambassador Ryan Crocker, who served in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, told CNN on Wednesday that ISIS presents a bigger threat to America than al Qaeda. ""They are more numerous, they are better armed, they are far better financed, they are better experienced, and perhaps most critically there are several thousand of them who hold Western passports, including American passports,"" Crocker said. ""They don't need to get a visa; they just need to get on a plane."" He added: ""If we don't think we're on their target list, we are delusional."" Obama to Congress: No vote needed on ISIS strategy . After his meeting with top congressional leaders at the White House on  Tuesday, Obama asked for their support to show the nation was united. He repeated that call in Wednesday's speech. Opinion: 5 questions Obama must answer .

"The NFL on Wednesday said it is looking into an Associated Press report that a league executive in April received from a law enforcement official a copy of the video in which Ray Rice punched his now-wife in the face. The law enforcement official had a short voice mail from April 9 in which someone calling from a number at an NFL office thanks the official, the AP reported. The caller says of the video, ""You're right. It's terrible,"" according to the AP. The league has denied that anyone in its office had seen the video before Monday, when it was posted online. When asked about the AP report, an NFL spokesman said the league will investigate the validity of the story. ""We have no knowledge of this. We are not aware of anyone in our office who possessed or saw the video before it was made public on Monday. We will look into it,"" Brian McCarthy said. The AP story said the law enforcement official requested anonymity because of an ongoing investigation and didn't name the NFL executive because that would make it easy to identify the AP's source. The source told AP he sent the video on a DVD to an NFL office. ""The person said he was unauthorized to release the video but shared it unsolicited, because he wanted the NFL to have it before deciding on Rice's punishment,"" the AP wrote. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CBS in an interview aired Wednesday that the league asked for the video on several occasions, but was denied access. ""I understand that there may be legal restrictions on them sharing that with us,"" he said. CNN's Rachel Nichols said the AP report, if true, is extremely damaging to the NFL's and Goodell's reputation. ""This is a huge problem, and not just for the public,"" she said. ""We now have NFL players coming out against this because Roger Goodell is either flat-out lying about having seen the video, or he is admitting to gross, gross negligence that this was in his office and he didn't see the video."" Late Wednesday, the NFL announced that former FBI Director Robert Mueller will lead an independent inquiry into the league's investigation and gathering of evidence in the case. Goodell said Mueller will have access to all NFL records, spokesman Greg Aiello said. Two NFL owners who are attorneys -- John Mara of the New York Giants and Art Rooney II of the Pittsburgh Steelers -- will oversee the independent probe. Mueller was director of the FBI from 2001 to 2013. The National Organization for Women called Mueller's appointment ""just window dressing,"" saying it doesn't go far enough. ""NOW continues to ask for Roger Goodell to resign, and for his successor to appoint an independent investigator with full authority to gather factual data about domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking within the entire NFL community - not just regarding the Ray Rice incident - and to recommend real and lasting reforms,"" said Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women. NFL says it tried to get footage . In a memo to NFL owners, the commissioner reiterated that position, saying the NFL asked for the videos in February and in May. New Jersey law prohibits their release while a police investigation is under way, Goodell wrote in the memo. The league didn't ask a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for the video, Goodell said. On February 15, Rice, released Monday by the Baltimore Ravens, and his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, got into an altercation on an elevator in the casino in Atlantic City. Rice floored Palmer with a punch to the head then dragged her -- face down -- out of the  elevator. The incident was captured on casino surveillance cameras. TMZ Sports obtained two videos from the footage taken that night. It posted the first one, which showed Rice dragging his then-fiancee out of the elevator, in February. The in-elevator video showing the violent punch was put online on Monday. 'We dropped the ball,' Ravens owner says . It was that second video that changed Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti's perception of the incident. Bisciotti, who told CNN affiliate WBAL that he never spoke with Rice, said he didn't realize the blow that knocked Janay Rice out was so forceful. ""The way it was described to us was that he had hit her with an open hand and that she had hit her head (as she fell),"" Bisciotti told WBAL. He told the station that the way he pictured it in his mind Janay Rice was ""wailing"" on her then-fiance when he slapped her and she was close to the wall and hit her head, knocking her out. ""So why did I conclude all of that? Because I wanted to, because I loved him, because he had a stellar record,"" Bisciotti said. He added his thinking was also shaped by the fact that police only arrested the couple for misdemeanors. Ray Rice's charge was later changed to a felony, and Janay's charge was dropped. Goodell sickened by Monday's video . Rice was suspended indefinitely by the league and is in a pretrial intervention program in the New Jersey legal system that will allow him to avoid jail time. Initially he had been suspended for two games of the 16-game season, a decision by Goodell that was widely criticized. Many commentators have argued the first video TMZ Sports posted was evidence enough for a harsher penalty. And NFL investigators should have had access to the complaint summons from the case. The Baltimore Sun posted part of the document February 19. The complaint says Ray Rice was charged with assault by attempting to cause bodily harm, ""specifically by striking her with his hand, rendering her unconscious."" Goodell told CBS  that he was sickened by what he saw on the newly released video and that it was the first time he had seen the full scope of the February incident. He also deflected criticism of his handling of Rice's case and his initial lenient penalty for the domestic violence incident. ""What we saw in the first videotape was troubling to us in and of itself,"" Goodell said, referring to another video that surfaced in February after the incident, showing Rice dragging his then-fiancee out of the elevator. ""But what we saw yesterday was extremely clear. It was extremely graphic and it was sickening."" A timeline of key events .

"The first thing you notice about New York's Ellis Island hospital is its sheer scale. Twenty-two buildings are perched proudly on the island's south side, their original vocations ranging from maternity ward, to psychiatric unit, to the contagious disease wing. The Ellis Island hospital complex, used between 1902 and 1930, was where immigrants were checked before being allowed onshore. Here, within view of the Statue of Liberty, babies were born, people died, and a constant stream of patients with new illnesses arrived. It was the biggest public health initiative the U.S. had ever attempted and now, it is open to the public for the first time in 60 years. The hospital's record is impressive. No epidemic on the U.S. mainland was ever attributed to an immigrant that came through its checking system. ""There were fears of epidemics"" the museum historian Barry Moreno told me. Cholera had broken out in New York in the 1890s, and ""there were fears of smallpox...and typhus. But there was no epidemic that ever stemmed from here."" The hospital, he added, ""played a very big role in screening immigrants."" The second thing that hits you is the hospital complex's authenticity. It looks like the dust has settled on a fire drill, from which no one returned. Single stools are left overturned. Buckets are left on top of closets, and bed frames lie rusty but intact in corners. The complex has survived extreme elements. Two years ago hurricane Sandy crippled the north side of the Island, closing the immigration museum there for a year. But the hospital stood firm, testament to a time when buildings were built ""very sturdily,"" Moreno says. One of the volunteer tour guides at the hospital, Tony Mrozinski, takes me into the morgue, where raked concrete benches tower over the area where autopsy tables once stood. ""People always ask me,"" he says, ""when the concrete was restored. I tell them: 'it wasn't.'"" The third thing you notice is what makes this place so addictive to the curious visitor. It's the blend of adversity and opportunity. Patients were subject to suffering and humiliation, but they received top-class treatment and the opportunity of a new life. Ellis Island has been described as an island of hope, an island of tears -- and the two fit in the same breath. This is not only a halfway house between origin and destination, but between captivity and free will, sickness and health. As part of its opening, the hospital French artist JR has created an installation inside its brick maze. JR has taken original photographs of the patients and doctors that walked its corridors, enlarging them to life-size and pasting them on the crumbling walls, windows and doors. Janis Calella, president of the government-funded Save Ellis Island group, says the use of historic photographs and their placement through the hospital ""evoke some sort of an emotion,"" making it easier to support the work. Permanent exhibitions are not permitted by the National Parks Service, which runs Ellis Island, and the images can be peeled off if required. However, there are no plans to do so, Calella says. The exhibition ""will last here for as long as it lasts."" she says.","New York's Ellis Island hospital complex is now open to the public for tours .

"The atrocious murder of David Haines puts the United Kingdom and in particular Prime Minister David Cameron front and center in the evolving battle against ISIS. It's not as though he is short of work, with a referendum in Scotland this week and a problematic relationship with the European Union among current elections next year dominating a crowded schedule. But the PM must now mobilize the British public for another campaign in Iraq, mindful that the last one was widely opposed. Revulsion at the beheading of three hostages will likely provide a bedrock of support. There are a wide variety of options including: surveillance and support operations, limited airstrikes against ISIS positions in Iraq, extending those airstrikes to ISIS targets in Syria or even inserting Special Forces in support of the Syrian resistance, Iraqi Kurds or the Iraqi military. Cameron has been forthright about his government's determination to take down ISIS, saying at the weekend: ""Step by step we will drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy ISIL [also used as an acronym for the group] and what it stands for. We will do so in a calm, deliberate way but with an iron determination."" He added: ""We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes."" ""Ultimately"" and ""However long it takes"" imply an indefinite campaign. Implying the UK would join in air strikes, British Defense Minister Michael Fallon has told Royal Air Force personnel involved in surveillance flights: ""There may well now be in the next few weeks and months other ways that we may need to help save life and protect people."" And that's just one element of this strategy. Cameron has been expansive about prodding the Iraqi government toward being more inclusive, saying it ""badly needs to get itself together so it can represent all of the country."" He is in favor of arming the Kurds, which in itself may be at odds with the aim of a unified Iraq, about mobilizing Arab states as part of a broad coalition to squeeze ISIS and about revitalizing moderate rebel groups in Syria. The means and the goals of this multi-faceted campaign are yet to be fleshed out. In the words of his spokesman last week, ""In terms of specific decisions about participation in further action, we are not at the stage of taking those decisions."" For example, Cameron has been cautious about whether air strikes might be extended to Syria. Cameron maintains that ""President [Bashar al-]Assad has committed war crimes on his own people and is therefore illegitimate."" But other parties in Britain are wary of air strikes in Syria, regarding them as dubious in international law. And many commentators believe some sort of understanding or accommodation with the Assad regime is an essential condition of effective action against ISIS strongholds in Raqqa and Idlib provinces. Even Britain's Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, was out of step with Downing Street last week. ""Let me be clear, Britain will not be taking part in air strikes in Syria,"" he told a news conference in Berlin. Hours later the PM's office said nothing had been ruled out. One Conservative MP, John Baron, who is a member of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs committee, cautioned: ""Air strikes into Syria are fraught with risks. The legal, technical and military differences between strikes in Iraq and Syria are marked. The UK should be advising caution."" But on Sunday came the first hint that the U.S. would be looking to allies for the Syrian part of the campaign. Secretary of State John Kerry told CBS Face The Nation: ""We are going to do what they [the Syrians] haven't done, what they had plenty of opportunity to do, which is to take on ISIL and to degrade it and eliminate it as a threat."" ""We will do that with allies,"" he added. But Britain's military is already stretched. Units are still deployed in Afghanistan and the armed forces are hurting from a squeeze on defense spending. The Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank on military issues, concluded in a report this month that ""on current spending plans and growth projections....UK defense spending is set to fall below the NATO 2 per cent target for the first time next financial year, to an estimated 1.88 per cent of GDP in 2015/16."" British planes would probably have to operate from Cyprus, flying a long circuitous route over Turkey to targets in northern Iraq. NATO flew 14,000 sorties in Libya to degrade the Gadhafi regime. Destroying ISIS may not be such a protracted effort, but it would be more than a commitment of a few weeks. And over Syria, planes would face the risk of encountering the Syrian air force and air defenses. A British pilot falling into the hands of ISIS or the Syrian regime is the stuff of nightmares. There is the additional dilemma that any military action may hasten more beheadings of hostages, with another British citizen possibly the next victim. And the coalition being mobilized is -- at best -- disparate, including 10 members of NATO and Middle Eastern states, including Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The division of labor among these states is yet to be worked out, though American officials are suggesting Arab states may provide air power and Kerry pronounced himself ""extremely encouraged"" by the response from governments on his latest tour of the region. Some British politicians are more skeptical. The veteran Liberal Democrat MP, Menzies Campbell, warned last month that ""a unified approach will be essential with no room for dissent or compromise between countries. The jihadists of IS [the Islamic State, as it calls itself] will most certainly test political resolve as well as security challenges."" Public support . Even before the murder of David Haines, opinion in Britain was moving toward air strikes. A ComRes poll for the Independent newspaper at the end of August found that 35% backing, with 50% opposed. A week later that support had nearly doubled, according to a poll by Opinium Research for the Daily Telegraph. And 27% said they would support Special Forces on the ground. Cameron enjoys broad support for the domestic part of his anti-ISIS platform, which may include legislation to prevent suspected British extremists from traveling to Iraq and Syria and stopping those already there from coming home. Polls suggest public support higher than 80% for such moves. But identifying and tracking such people is a tall order -- and British military action could incite some of the several hundred British citizens thought to be fighting in Syria and Iraq to bring terror home. A successful campaign over several months that squeezed ISIS into insignificance could bring political rewards at home. Cameron may be able to claim his decisive leadership was instrumental in facing down the world's most dangerous terror group, incidentally deflecting attention from thorny issues like immigration and Europe, where his Conservative Party is under pressure from the insurgent UK Independence Party. But with a general election due by May next year, taking on ISIS is fraught with peril for the British PM.","PM mobilizing British public for new campaign in Iraq, mindful last one was widely opposed .

"(CNN) -- All eyes shifted toward the beginning of the runway when a dark-haired model strutted out in a star-spangled red bikini to a fusillade of flashbulbs at Tommy Hilfiger's New York Fashion Week show on Monday. She fit right in at nearly 5'11"" tall with a svelte frame. But despite adhering to the anonymous runway model aesthetic, Kendall Jenner tends to stand out. She's on a first-name basis with millions. Just look at her stats: On Facebook, she has almost 7 million followers; on Twitter, 8.75 million; and on Instagram, a whopping 13.3 million. The teen, who appears alongside her paparazzi-favorite family in ""Keeping Up with Kardashians,"" is trying to find her own footing in the high-fashion world without her polarizing siblings and parents. ""You just don't know how (casting directors) are going to react to it. It could be like 'Oh, just another reality TV star coming in, trying to be something,' "" Jenner said. ""This is what I want to do. ... This is my career. This is what I wanted to be."" During this New York Fashion Week, which ends Thursday, Jenner has made enviable strides by modeling for Donna Karan, Tommy Hilfiger and Diane von Furstenberg. In von Furstenberg's show, she walked behind legendary supermodel Naomi Campbell and Victoria's Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel, both of whom Jenner says she looks up to. The 18-year-old is on the cover of the September issue of Teen Vogue and appears in the fashion-heavy September issue of its high-end counterpart, Vogue. This year, she walked for high-fashion brands overseas like Chanel, Giles and Givenchy. ""When I started, I had no idea how this was going to turn out,"" she said. ""It's still so surreal that I've walked in shows like Givenchy and Chanel. It's ridiculous."" Like anything Kardashian-related, Jenner's presence in this world has not come without controversy: Where models are dodging street style photographers, she's dodging paparazzi and hit pieces in the media about the distraction her presence brings. Compared with some of her high-fashion counterparts who can walk upwards of 20 runways during the weeklong event before heading to London, Paris and Milan, Jenner is still a fledgling in her second season, with three shows thus far. Despite it all, her name does garner press. See all of CNN Living's New York Fashion Week coverage . Before Fashion Week started, she decided to omit her last name from her casting card, which is sent out to runway suitors from her agency, The Society Management. ""I just felt like I didn't want a last name to help me in any way,"" Jenner said, making it clear that the decision is not a slight to her family. ""Whenever I went into a casting, I didn't need any special treatment."" But, to play the devil-in-Prada's advocate, she also credits growing up in front of a lens with helping her improve her modeling skills. Her mother, Kris Jenner, is a business manager and executive producer for her family's show, and her father is Olympic decathlete Bruce Jenner. ""Whether it was a big TV camera or a little picture camera, I feel like I've always been in front of a camera,"" Jenner said. Modeling is an easy transition, she says, and something she's wanted to do since she was a young girl. In her Fashion Week debut in February, she made a splash with a chest-baring look for Marc Jacobs, which Jenner describes as a "" 'hello world' kind of moment."" It's a far cry from the shy child she used to be. ""When I was a kid, I couldn't have a slumber party for one night without crying myself to sleep and telling my dad to pick me up at 10 o'clock at night,"" Jenner said. Given her exposure, it's easy to forget she's a California girl, straight out of high school. ""I was so terrified to get in a cab the first time I was here,"" Jenner admitted. As for what's coming up for the ingenue, Jenner shares two words familiar to any TV watcher: ""Stay tuned.""","Kendall Jenner has been dubbed a model to watch in the fashion world .

"""I am the shooter."" Maj. Nidal Hasan made that blunt declaration Tuesday at the outset of his court-martial in the 2009 massacre at Fort Hood. The Army psychiatrist is charged with killing 13 and wounding 32 at a processing center for soldiers heading into combat zones overseas. ""The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter,"" Hasan told the panel of 13 senior officers who will decide his fate. ""The evidence presented with this trial will show one side. The evidence will also show that I was on the wrong side. I then switched sides."" But the declaration wasn't exactly news to now-retired Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford, who was shot seven times that November day. Lunsford, the first of several survivors scheduled to testify against Hasan, recounted how the now-admitted gunman rose from a chair in the processing center, pulled out a pistol and began shooting. ""It was a state of panic,"" Lunsford said. A civilian doctor, Michael Cahill, tried to hit Hasan with a chair to stop the shooting; Hasan shot him dead. Soldiers tried to flee or take cover inside the processing center as Hasan fired dozens of shots. As Lunsford was checking behind him, ""Major Hasan is turning the weapon on me,"" he said. ""He has a laser on his weapon and it goes across my line of sight and I blink. In that time, he discharges his weapon. The first round, I'm hit in the head."" A second shot caught Lunsford in the back. He decided to play dead for a while before changing his mind and deciding to run for the door. He made it out of the building but was shot five more times outside, he testified. Hasan continued shooting at Lunsford even as he was receiving first aid outside the processing center, before police arrived. Officers shot and wounded Hasan, ending the rampage and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. What is a court-martial? A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, Hasan had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings. Prosecutors hope to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a ""progressive radicalization,"" giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime. Hasan did not want to deploy to fight against other Muslims and believed ""that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,"" said Col. Michael Mulligan, the lead prosecutor in the case. Investigators found 146 spent shell casings in the room where the attack began, Mulligan said. Hasan carried two laser-sighted pistols and 420 rounds of ammunition, his pockets lined with paper towels to muffle the sounds of the magazines banging together, he said. Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions . At the outset of his assault, Hasan cried out ""Allahu Akbar ... and starts shooting at the soldiers sitting defenseless in chairs,"" Mulligan said. Internet searches on Hasan's computer used keywords like ""terrorist killing,"" ""innocent,"" ""Quran,"" ""fatwas"" and ""suicide bombings,"" Mulligan said. Hasan is representing himself in his court-martial and could be sentenced to death if found guilty. As his own attorney, he'll be cross-examining witnesses -- perhaps including some of those he has now admitted shooting. He did not cross-examine Lunsford, however. He told the panel in his opening statement, ""We mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion."" But, he added, ""I apologize for the mistakes I made in this endeavor."" Hasan told his family he had been taunted after the al Qaeda attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American radical cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011. The case was first set to begin in March 2012, but it has been delayed repeatedly -- notably over a previous judge's unsuccessful demand that the beard Hasan has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved. Other soldier on soldier attacks . Among others scheduled to testify include Chief Warrant Officer Christopher Royal, who survived the shootings with two bullet wounds to his back.

"Most people might know modern India for its rising billionaire class, its Bangalore-based information technology hub and its Bollywood celebrity culture. But beneath the outward signs of prosperity, India is still one of the most malnourished nations on the planet. According to the 2012 Global Hunger Index from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), India -- despite being one of the world's largest producers of food -- ranks as low 65 on a list of 79 countries on the index. The Indian government this week launched an ambitious fight back against food distribution problems that -- alongside countries like Bangladesh and Timor-Leste -- have put it near the top of the list for underweight children under the age of five. Even by the Indian government's own measure, nearly half of India's children suffer from malnutrition of some sort. The $22 billion-a-year welfare scheme aims to sell subsidized wheat and rice to 67% of its 1.2 billion people. The scheme will massively expand an existing program that provides food to 218 million people. Under the National Food Security Bill, 75% of rural dwellers and 50% of the urban population would get five kilograms of grain per month at the subsidized prices of 3 rupees (US5 cents) for rice and 2 rupees per kilo for wheat and 1 rupee per kilo for coarse grains to be fixed for a period of three years. The existing Antyodaya Ann Yojana (AAY), which targets the poorest of the poor, would continue to distribute 35 kilograms of grain per month to those households. Pregnant women and lactating mothers would get a maternity benefit payment of 6,000 rupees (US$99), while children aged six months to 14 years would get take-home rations or be provided with hot cooked food. Subsidies would also extend to Indian states and territories that run low on grain and there would be central government assistance towards the cost of intra-state transportation and handling of grains. Critics, however, say that targeting the subsidized grain is likely to be one of the ambitious bill's biggest headaches. Distribution through the India's infamously corrupt state-owned ration shops could see much of the subsidized grain siphoned off to be sold for market prices elsewhere. Others say the sheer scale of the subsidy will strain government finances. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, part of the Ministry of Agriculture, said in a report that the cost of India's food program is likely to balloon to 6.82 trillion rupees ($126 billion) in its first three years, meaning the government would have to budget almost double its projected food subsidy each year. Much of this cost would be associated with scaling up infrastructure to improve the existing distribution system as well as warehousing and transportation. India has had bumper harvests in recent years, according to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, leading to the paradox of grain rotting in silos while large swathes of the population are still malnourished. Indian political and economic analyst Paranjoy Guha Thakurta said he believed the positive impact of the Food Bill would likely to outweigh its problems in the long term, saying that India would be forced to address problems with its distribution system. ""You are talking about a system which is bad and that's the public distribution system. You are looking at strengthening the system and that, in itself, should not be such a bad thing,"" he told CNN. ""Nobody is saying there's no corruption, and nobody is saying that there is no inefficiency, but if by spending this money you improve the system, then that has to be a good thing."" He added that even free distribution of grain had support among some sectors of Indian society, with double-digit food inflation over the past eight years imposing a greater burden on the poor than it did on India's growing middle classes. ""Indian society has always been an unequal society historically. The food inflation that this country has witnessed in the recent past has made an already unequal society even more unequal,"" he said. ""Simply put, the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on food."" Critics have also charged that the subsidy is the centerpiece of the ruling Congress party's bid to win a third term in elections due in May, 2014, and represents a populist policy cynically aimed at winning votes. ""Of course there are politics behind it, but everything has politics behind it,"" Thakurta said. ""Whether the poor will vote for Congress is a separate story -- only time will tell. The fact is that in a country like ours with 1.2 billion people, of which anywhere between 200-400 million people are incredibly poor, to have a scheme of cheap food distribution is something that I as an Indian favor.""","India launches ambitious $22 billion a year food aid program .

"(CNN)Turns out, the rich really are getting richer. And they'll soon own more than the rest of us put together. So says a new report, which estimates that the richest 1% will have as much wealth as the other 99% combined by next year. ""The richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014,"" Oxfam says in a report Monday. At that rate, the wealthiest will own more than 50%  by next year, according to the report. ""Do we really want to live in a world where the 1% own more than the rest of us combined?"" asked Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the international aid agency. Byanyima will co-chair the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week. She plans to use the platform at Davos to call for urgent action on the rising inequality. The 80 richest people on the planet have the same wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion people, the report says. ""The scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering; and despite the issues shooting up the global agenda, the gap between the richest and the rest is widening fast,"" she said. ""It is time our leaders took on the powerful vested interests that stand in the way of a fairer and more prosperous world."" While 1% of the population owns 48% of the world's wealth, a majority of the remainder follows the same trend. ""Of the remaining 52% of global wealth,  46%  is owned by the rest of the richest fifth of the world's population,"" the report says. The remainder of the population only possesses 5.5% of global wealth. Their wealth last year?  An average  $3,851 per adult, the report says. Meanwhile, the ""global elite"" members had an average wealth of $2.7 million each last year, it says. The report comes a day before President Barack Obama is expected to unveil proposals that close tax breaks on the wealthy. Obama will discuss his plans to help the middle class during his State of the Union Address on Tuesday.","Overall wealth of the richest 1% will outpace that of the other 99% by next year .

"Is a sunken shipwreck off Haiti the long-lost remains of the Santa Maria, Christopher Columbus' flagship from his first voyage to the Americas? Underwater explorer Barry Clifford, who led a team that found and investigated the wreck, says he's confident it is. ""Every single piece fits. Now, of course, we have to go through the whole archeological process, and we plan to do that within the next few months, but I feel very confident that we've discovered the site,"" he told CNN. ""This is the ship that changed the course of human history,"" Clifford said. If the claim is confirmed, it would go down as one of the most significant underwater archaeological discoveries ever. ""It is the Mount Everest of shipwrecks for me,"" said Clifford, 68. But it isn't a new find for him. Clifford's announcement involves a wreck he and his team investigated in 2003. A cannon was found as part of the wreck. But, Clifford told CNN, archaeologists at the time ""misdiagnosed"" the cannon. Two years ago, after having researched the type of cannon used in Columbus' time, ""I woke up in the middle of the night and said, 'Oh my God,' "" Clifford told CNN. He realized the 2003 find might have been the one. A couple of weeks ago, he returned to the wreck with a group of experts. The team measured and photographed the ship. But some items, including the cannon, had been looted from the ship in the intervening years, Clifford said. The ship ""still has attributes that warrant an excavation to determine the site's identity,"" archaeologist Charles Beeker of Indiana University said Tuesday. ""Barry may have finally discovered the 1492 Santa Maria."" The evidence, Beeker said, is ""very compelling."" The ship was found in the exact area where Columbus said the Santa Maria ran aground more than 500 years ago, Clifford said. The wreck is stuck on a reef off Haiti's northern coast, 10 to 15 feet beneath the water's surface. Clifford plans to go back to Haiti next month to meet with authorities and decide what steps to take next. Wrecked in 1492 . It was the flagship of Columbus' small fleet that set sail from Spain in August 1492 under the sponsorship of King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I. The voyage aimed to find a westward route to China, India and the gold and spice islands of the East. But the land the sailors set eyes on in October 1492 was an island in the Caribbean. Among the islands on which Columbus set foot was Hispaniola, which is divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Columbus established a fort in Haiti. That December, the Santa Maria accidentally ran aground off the island's coast. Some planks and provisions from the wrecked ship, which was about 117 feet (36 meters) long, were used by the garrison at the fort, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. Columbus set off back to Spain with the two remaining ships, the Nina and the Pinta, in January 1493. Archaeological study needed . Archaeologists will have to excavate and examine the ship found off Haiti in order to determine whether it is, in fact, the Santa Maria. Most of the ship is in shape and will be possible to excavate with the help of the Haitian government, said Clifford, who made a name for himself salvaging pirate ships off the coasts of Cape Cod and Madagascar. His team has used sophisticated metal detectors and sonar scans to study the remains. The ship is the right size, he said, and stones found at the site match the kind from the part of Spain where the ship was built. ""I don't think any of us should take for granted what has been written,"" Clifford said. ""This is a tremendous touchstone to that period in time. We don't know what secrets are going to be held on the ship."" Did Phoenicians beat Columbus by 2,000 years? After 125 years, ship rediscovered at bottom of San Francisco Bay .

"Hong Kong is at the threshold of a revolution. No, I am not referring to the movement colorfully dubbed the ""Umbrella Revolution"" by the international media. True, having faced police tear gas and efforts to dislodge them, students and the ""Occupy Central"" group have captured and are holding parts of Hong Kong -- main thoroughfares in Central, Causeway Bay and Mongkok. And it is escalating. They are also demanding the resignation of the territory's Chief Executive C.Y. Leung and a back-down from Beijing on their recently announced plans on political reform for 2017. Orderly fashion . The revolution I am referring to is that of the silent majority, the nondescript middle-aged and conservatives who prefer change in an orderly fashion -- the segment usually ignored by the media and the ""haves"" of the society as ""aging and not sexy."" You see, while as many as 70,000 students and ""Occupy Central"" group supporters occupy the streets now, only six weeks ago, 1.5 million Hong Kongers boldly came out from their cocoons to sign their names on a petition to demand peace and reject ""Occupy Central."" That's one in almost every five people in our city of seven million. The campaign was organized by ""The Alliance for Peace and Democracy"" of which ""Silent Majority for Hong Kong,"" a group I co-founded, is a member. So are all 1.5 million of us stooges of Beijing? Hardly likely. We are just as diverse and politically divided as any silent majority group in other cities. The only difference is we came out before things turned ugly. We want peace and democracy -- universal suffrage in 2017 -- but we abhor and reject ""Occupy Central"" for trying to hold Hong Kong hostage in the fight for its brand of democracy. We believe political reform should be negotiated and then the people can decide for themselves, conservatives and progressives alike. After all, the pan-democratic group, which is backing ""Occupy Central"" to the hilt, is holding the trump card -- it has enough votes to veto any reform packages they deem unacceptable in the Legislative Council. Unwilling pawns . We believe ""Occupy Central"" and its vow to paralyze our financial center by occupation and blockages are for real, and it will hurt the middle class and common folks more than the wealthy. We do not want to be held hostage and be unwilling pawns in a political game, and we do not want the same fate as tens of millions in other parts of the world who suffer financial losses, injuries and even deaths in turmoil brought about by the politically aggressive and adventurous. Now that ""Occupy Central"" has happened, we are feeling the effects of its strangulation. The stock market is down, shops are closed, people's daily lives are disrupted -- and this is just the beginning. Some say it is a small price to pay for ""true democracy"" — so why don't we accept it for the good someone else is chasing? Hostages are always told that and then left to suffer. But we are not hostages: 1.5 million people have said no already, and we won't sit and suffer. People are walking up to the occupiers and telling them to go home. The Alliance has openly asked for ""Occupy Central"" to desist from occupation of Mong Kok and Causeway Bay as a show of goodwill to the people. We are ignored. The silent majority's anger and demands are a trickle now, but may turn into a tidal wave. The question one must face in a civilized and democratic society like Hong Kong, where guns are near nonexistent, is: the will of the majority or the ruthlessness of the minority? We cannot foretell the outcome. Hong Kong is a divided society now. But the minority cannot hold the majority hostage, unless they surrender. Whatever happens, we hope it will be peaceful. A social revolution is brewing, and when it ends in success and peace, it may inspire a whole generation of the silent majorities in this world to think: what if we break our silence and control our fate.","Hong Kong's ""silent majority"" want protesters to go home, says Robert Chow .
1.5 million Hong Kongers signed a petition to demand peace and reject Occupy Central .
Protests will hurt economy, businesses and stock market, he adds .

"China is cracking down on the illegal ivory trade. Several tons of confiscated elephant tusks and carvings were crushed in a ceremony in the city of Guangzhou on Monday -- just two months after the United States destroyed its own ivory stockpile. Conservationists have welcomed the move as a monumental shift in the government's approach to the ivory trade, and a crucial first step for China -- the world's largest ivory market -- to tackle illicit wildlife trafficking. Some 6.15 tons of ivory were destroyed on Monday -- equivalent to one-sixth of the illegal ivory confiscated worldwide in 2012 -- according to May Mei, the Chinese chief representative of wildlife protection group, WildAid, who attended the ceremony. It's the first time China, which accounts for around 70% of global demand for ivory, has destroyed any of its stockpile. The fact that China is taking a public stance against the practice is an encouraging sign, says Jeff He, special assistant to the Asia Regional Director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). ""With the government taking such a symbolic action, it sends out a very strong message to the potential consumers that the government won't allow any illegal trade in ivory,"" he said. Ivory is known as ""white gold"" in China and tusks with intricate carvings can fetch almost $3,000 per kilogram on the black market. One of the biggest challenges remains dampening demand among consumers, say animal welfare campaigners. According to a 2013 WildAid report, many Chinese residents have little awareness of how ivory sales contribute to the poaching that has caused the world's elephant population to dwindle in recent years. ""This event in itself is not going to solve these issues,"" said Joe Waltson, Asia Program Director at the Wildlife Conservation Society, ""but that doesn't mean it doesn't have any value."" ""It needs to be welcomed, if only to embolden those within the Chinese government who are pushing for more substantive action on this issue,"" Waltson said. ""It could really have an impact on the conservation of African and Asian elephants."" A report released by the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species last year found that the global illegal ivory trade has tripled in the last decade, in spite of 1989-ban on the international trade of the product. According to the IFAW's Jeff He, a rise in demand from Asia, and especially China, in recent years has fueled the black market and put increasing pressure on African elephants in the wild. The elephant population in Africa has now shrunk to around half a million, from 1.2 million in 1980. Nearly one hundred African elephants are killed for their tusks every day, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. To help wipe out the demand for ivory, conservation groups have called on governments to destroy confiscated ivory stockpiles, which often require substantial resources to keep secure. On November 15, the U.S. destroyed its entire 6-ton stockpile of ivory ""to send a clear message that the United States will not tolerate ivory trafficking and the toll it is taking on elephant populations, particularly in Africa."" Similar events have taken place in the Philippines, Gabon, and Kenya in the last three years.","China crushed 6.15 tons from its stockpile of confiscated elephant ivory .

"(CNN) -- FIFA has moved quickly to deny claims its president, Sepp Blatter, suggested Qatar is unfit to host the 2022 World Cup -- despite his admission that it was ""a mistake"" to schedule a summer tournament in the Gulf State. Blatter, who oversees the game's global governing body, appeared to cast doubt over Qatar's right to welcome the football world, following an interview with a Swiss television station Friday. When asked by RTS if it was an error to award Qatar the World Cup, Blatter said: ""Of course, it was a mistake. You know, one makes a lot of mistakes in life. ""The technical report indicated clearly that it was too hot in summer, but despite that the executive committee decided, with quite a big majority, that the tournament would be in Qatar."" In October 2013, Blatter set up an executive committee taskforce to examine whether the World Cup in Qatar should be switched to winter because of extreme summer temperatures. A decision is expected to be made following the conclusion of the upcoming World Cup in Brazil. Blatter's comments sparked a frenzy on social media and led to criticism of the 78-year-old and the organization's decision to award the tournament to Qatar. But speaking to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said: ""The comment by the FIFA President concerning the organization of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar to Swiss TV station RTS is in line with previous comments on this matter. "" As explained in his answer to the journalist, the president reiterated that the decision to organize the World Cup in summer was an 'error' based on the technical assessment report of the bid, which had highlighted the extremely hot temperatures in summer in Qatar. ""At no stage did he question Qatar as the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup."" Harold Mayne-Nicholls led the FIFA inspection team which examined each of the bidding countries for the 2022 World Cup before delivering his report in October 2010. Mayne-Nicholls concluded that Qatar was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. ""In June and July you cannot play,"" Mayne-Nicholls told CNN last November when asked about the conditions in Qatar. ""It's not for the players. The players will be OK with the cooling system but what about the fans? ""You'll have 50,000 fans walking three, four, even six blocks or more like in South Africa where I walked 10 blocks. ""They will be walking in 40 degrees and it's too much. One or two crucial cases will damage the entire image of the World Cup and we must be careful."" If the World Cup was to be held between November and January, it would probably create a logistical headache for many major European leagues -- such as the English Premier League -- and for the prestigious Champions League, organized by the continent's UEFA confederation. American broadcaster Fox, which paid $425 million for the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, has expressed concern that a ""winter"" World Cup could clash with the National Football League's regular season and the Super Bowl. The decision to award Qatar football's showpiece event has drawn widespread condemnation and focused attention on workers' rights in the state. A report released by Amnesty International last November alleged that the abuse of migrant workers was rife within Qatar's construction sector, while British newspaper The Guardian likened the conditions for such workers to ""modern-day slavery."" The furor which surrounded ""stranded"" footballer Zahir Belounis also raised questions regarding Qatar's Kafala law. Blatter himself described the conditions for migrant workers in Qatar as ""unacceptable,"" but has so far refused to entertain the idea of moving the 2022 competition to another location. In response to Amnesty's allegations, the director of the Human Rights Department at Qatar's Foreign Ministry said laws are in place to protect workers from mistreatment.","FIFA denies Sepp Blatter said Qatar unfit to hold World Cup .

"Police clashed with activists at the main Hong Kong pro-democracy protest site Monday morning after a violent nighttime standoff when protesters surrounded government headquarters in the city's Admiralty district. Authorities removed some tents and barricades at the main protest site before withdrawing. The site is currently calm. Protesters, following student leaders' calls to escalate their civil disobedience movement, surrounded the government complex Sunday night and charged onto Lung Wo Road, a major east-west route next to the headquarters. Police used batons and pepper spray to push back demonstrators. Police and protesters were seen injured in the clashes, with protesters seen receiving first aid treatment from fellow activists, and police carried away on gurneys. The standoff continued Monday morning as police moved in on the main Hong Kong pro-democracy protest site, cutting down banners on a pedestrian overpass above thousands of tents inside the ""democracy village"" in Hong Kong's Admiralty district. Before dawn Monday, at least 40 arrests had been made in Admiralty, according to the Hong Kong Police. A further 12 people were also arrested in Mong Kok. The Central Government Office was closed on Monday morning but later re-opened. The government said it condemned ""violent radicals,"" saying they had  ""provoked and verbally abused police officers"" and encouraged others to charge police lines. ""We do not have any plan"" The current police operation is the boldest move authorities have made on the main protest site in nearly two months. Protesters seemed at a loss for how to respond, with arguments breaking out between student leaders and protesters even as police moved in. Winnie Ng, a demonstrator, told CNN ""We do not have any plan."" This morning, a tweet from student leader group Hong Kong Federation of Students read ""We need your support in Admiralty right now."" The tense standoff came at the end of a dramatic week in which Hong Kong authorities moved to dismantle protest camps in the city's working-class Mong Kok district, arresting dozens and drawing accusations of brutality in the process. Protesters want their occupations to pressure the Chinese government into giving Hong Kong open elections for its next leader in 2017. So far, officials have shown no willingness to give into protesters' demands. The protests have drawn widespread international attention, although the Chinese government has rebutted any efforts by outside countries to ""interfere."" On Sunday Sir Richard Ottoway, who chairs the British parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, said he and other lawmakers had been barred by China from making a planned trip to Hong Kong to assess the political situation. ""The Chinese government are acting in an overtly confrontational manner in refusing us access to do our job,"" he said.","Police and protesters face off again in tense scene in Hong Kong's Admiralty district .

"Hong Kong says it will destroy most of its huge stockpile of contraband ivory in a move hailed by conservationists as a significant step in combating the illegal trade in elephant tusks. Some 28 tons of ivory will be incinerated in the next one to two years, with the first batch slated to be disposed of by the end of June, the city's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said on Thursday. The department said the huge stockpile, held in undisclosed locations around the city, had become a ""management burden"" and a ""security risk."" The city had previously opted not to destroy the stash -- most of which is seized en route to mainland China -- but had come under pressure following similar moves by its neighbor and the United States. Earlier this month, six tons of ivory were crushed in the southern city of Guangzhou, the first time China -- which accounts for 70% of global demand for ivory -- had destroyed any of its confiscated ivory. In November, the U.S. destroyed its entire six-ton pile of ivory ""to send a clear message that the United States will not tolerate ivory trafficking and the toll it is taking on elephant populations, particularly in Africa."" China is the world's largest ivory market accounting for an estimated 70% of global consumption, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Alex Hofford, program director at the campaign group Hong Kong for Elephants and a consultant for WildAid, said the move would send a strong message that would deter would-be buyers of what is sometimes called ""white gold."" He said that Hong Kong had previously been unwilling to destroy the seized tusks because of concerns it would create air pollution and fears that such a move would be wasteful. A Hong Kong department spokesman said the ivory would be burned in three ton batches and any ivory seized in the future would be disposed of in the same way. One ton of confiscated ivory would be retained for education purposes. In 2008,  a one-time sale of ivory seized in Africa to China was permitted by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) but the decision was subsequently criticized by wildlife protection advocates, who say the deal jump-started the ivory trade in China.","Hong Kong said it will destroy most of its stockpile of seized ivory .

"(CNN) -- Michael Schumacher, the most successful driver in Formula 1 history, is in critical condition after suffering severe head trauma in a skiing accident in the French Alps on Sunday, hospital officials said. The 44-year-old German, who retired from the elite motorsport for the second time in 2012, fell and hit his head on a rock, said the director of the Meribel resort where Schumacher was skiing. Schumacher was in a coma when he arrived at the University Hospital Center of Grenoble and required immediate brain surgery, hospital officials said in a written statement. But doctors haven't released details about his injuries or his prognosis. Resort director Christophe Gernignon-Lecomte said the incident happened while Schumacher was skiing off-piste (on unmarked slopes) Sunday morning in the mountains of Meribel resort between Georges Bauduis Piste and La Biche Piste. Gernignon-Lecomte told CNN the racing star was wearing a helmet when he hit his head. Rescuers reached him minutes later and airlifted him to a nearby hospital, he said. It's unclear what caused the accident, the resort director said. ""We have to wait for a police report,"" he said. ""There is an open investigation going on. We insist on the fact that Michael Schumacher was skiing off-piste and his fall is not linked to an avalanche."" Schumacher's spokesperson Sabine Kehm released a statement to the official F1 website, confirming the accident had happened on ""a private ski trip."" ""He was taken to hospital and is receiving professional medical care,"" she said. ""We ask for understanding that we cannot give continuous information about his health. He was wearing a helmet and was not alone. For his fall, no other person was involved."" A spokesman for the first-aid responders in Meribel -- who asked not to be named as a matter of protocol -- confirmed that Schumacher was wearing a helmet. He said Schumacher had been transferred from the Hospital of Moutiers to the Grenoble Hospital, where there is a trauma center. The spokesman added that the injury was ""not life-threatening"" and that Schumacher was conscious at the scene of the accident. Former French F1 driver Olivier Panis visited the hospital in Grenoble but was not able to see Schumacher, BFM reported. ""I will come back tomorrow. Yes I am worried,"" Panis told BFM. ""I know that his family has arrived. As I am here in Grenoble, I want to come to him and say hello, for old times' sake. He is a great champion and someone very loved in Formula 1."" Schumacher made his F1 debut in 1991 and had won a record seven world titles by the time of his first retirement in 2006 -- five of those with Ferrari. He returned to the track with the revived Mercedes team in 2010, but struggled to repeat his earlier glories. His best finish was third place at last year's European Grand Prix in Valencia, his only podium position in three seasons with the German manufacturer. Sunday's accident occurred at a popular ski resort in an area known for its challenging slopes. ""The great majority of it is above treeline. which basically means it's literally higher than where trees will grow. And the result is that if you are anything less than a really experienced skier, it's very easy to lose your bearings, because you don't see much in the way of vegetation around you or anything else,"" said Paul Hochman, a former contributing editor at SKI Magazine. ""It's just literally all white, all snow."" British journalist Kevin Garside told CNN that Schumacher is ""a very good skier"" but acknowledged that he is ""fearless"" -- like most F1 drivers. ""These people don't recognize fear like you and I do. There is no gene in their body that lets them go slow,"" Garside said. ""Schumacher wasn't a skier when he joined Ferrari (in 1996) but by the end he was excellent. Each year Ferrari used to have a media week in the Alps in Italy and they would always have a race -- and it was always Schumacher who won. He was a genuinely quick skier. ""But he was always very mindful of the danger around him. I approached him for an interview at the top of the slope and he said it would have to be quick as he wanted to check the piste. That meant he wanted to make sure he understood the slopes, the cambers, even though it was only a fun race.""

"Alex Torres will never forget the sound that echoed around Tropicana Field from the pitcher's mound on a Saturday afternoon last June. More than a year after the pitcher's then-Tampa Bay Rays teammate Alex Cobb was struck in the head by a concussing line drive, that sound of ball on skull still resonates. ""I came in after Alex Cobb was hit in the head,"" Torres told CNN on Sunday. ""That's really an impression to me, how his head sounded from the bullpen. That was really bad. I was shaking. 'Oh my God! Oh my God!' I'm glad he's alive."" Tampa Bay pitcher struck by line drive released from hospital . Until Saturday, the most notable thing about Torres' brief 74-game Major League Baseball career was that the reliever, traded from Tampa Bay to the San Diego Padres over the past year, had struck out more than a batter per inning.

When the 26-year-old Venezuelan strolled from the bullpen to the mound for the eighth inning of Saturday night's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he became the first pitcher to wear a protective cap that MLB approved in January for use by pitchers. ""It's a good idea they make this kind of hat to protect my head,"" Torres said. ""You want to protect life. I don't have a kid yet, but I want to see my kid grow up."" 4Licensing Corporation makes the new IsoBLOX Protective Caps, which its website describes as ""breakthrough technology to protect Major League Baseball pitchers from line drive come-backers."" The optional equipment was made available to pitchers at all levels during spring training, with interested players providing information so they could get fitted caps, MLB.com reported. Line drives back to the mound have caused several injuries to pitchers over the past few years, some very serious. Most recently, the Cincinnati Reds' star closer Aroldis Chapman sat out the first six weeks of this season after a line drive in spring training caused fractures to his nose and above his left eye. In the most life-threatening incident, Arizona Diamondback Brandon McCarthy, then pitching for the Oakland A's, took a batted ball to the head in September 2012, then needed brain surgery because of internal bleeding. The protective caps have padding imbedded inside the side and front. However, the portion of the head below the cap line, where MLB.com says many of the more seriously injured pitchers were struck, remains unprotected. ""The cap is fitted with uniquely-formulated protective plates that use a combination of dispersion and absorption techniques to diffuse energy upon impact with a high-velocity object,"" the IsoBLOX website says. ""Under rigorous testing simulating MLB line drives, the isoBLOX® cap demonstrated protection at speeds up to 90 mph in the front and front boss impact locations and 85 mph on the side impact location."" Dan Halem, MLB's executive vice president for labor relations, and Patrick Houlihan, MLB senior counsel for labor relations, told ESPN in January that to get approval, the cap had to provide protection at 83 miles per hour, below the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment standard severity index of 1,200. Severity indexes higher than 1,200 are considered high-risk for skull fractures and traumatic brain injuries. An MLB-commissioned study determined that 83 mph was the average speed of a line drive when it reaches the area of the pitching mound, ESPN reported. Player safety in sports has risen to the forefront in recent years, sparked by increased awareness of the repercussions of concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, as well as high-profile player lawsuits against the National Football League. First Major League Baseball player diagnosed with CTE . All four major U.S. pro sports leagues -- MLB, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League -- have updated their concussion protocols in recent years. Eighteen baseball players were placed on the disabled list after concussions in 2013. In 2012, 13 players were placed on the list after a concussion, and in 2011, the number was 11, according to MLB data. The padding adds 7 ounces to the weight of a cap, which currently weighs 3 to 4 ounces, according to MLB.com. Although the caps look bulky, ""the difference between a regular hat [and the new one] is not a big difference. It's a little bigger than the regular one,"" Torres said. Torres said the larger cap doesn't interfere with his pitching motion, and he practiced with the new cap on for three or four days over the past week before using it in the Dodgers game, to make sure it wouldn't bother him. While a lot of Internet response has been supportive, many people online have been making fun of Torres' sartorial choice. The Padres' lefty said even a former teammate, Rays' star David Price, was tweaking him on social media. But he doesn't care, possessing the confidence to choose safety over style. ""It looks unusual. It isn't quite as formfitting and as chic as the baseball cap,"" the Padres announcers said during the telecast. ""Obviously, the appearance has to change, because a lot of players these days, you can see, they want to look the part. They want to look really good, and that is not a good look."" While Torres doesn't think the protective caps should be mandatory for major leagues, he urges parents and children to consider them, because of a key difference between the majors and youth baseball. ""I think [children] should be using [the caps] because they use aluminum [bats], and the ball comes off the aluminum harder than the bat we are using,"" he said.","Padres pitcher Alex Torres is the first MLB player to wear a new protective cap in a game .

"When the Parr family started having serious health problems late in 2008, they had no idea it was associated with what they call ""a multitude"" of drilling operations that popped up near their 40-acre ranch in Decatur, 60 miles northwest of Dallas. At first, Lisa Parr dismissed her migraine headaches, nausea and dizziness as the flu, but when her symptoms persistently got worse, she knew something more serious was involved. ""By 2009, I was having a multitude of problems,"" Lisa Parr told CNN. ""My central nervous system was messed up. I couldn't hear, and my vision was messed up. My entire body would shake inside. I was vomiting white foam in the mornings."" In 2009, Lisa's husband, Robert, and their 11-year-old daughter, Emma, also became ill, suffering a laundry-list of symptoms. ""They had nosebleeds, vision problems, nausea, rashes, blood pressure issues. Being that the wells were not on our property, we had no idea that what they were doing on the property around us was affecting us,"" she said. 'Private nuisance' After a two-week trial that ended Tuesday -- Earth Day, coincidentally -- a Dallas jury awarded the Parr family $2.9 million for personal injury and property damages in the family's lawsuit against Plano-based Aruba Petroleum Inc. According to the lawsuit, Aruba Petroleum had 22 natural gas wells within a 2-mile radius of the Parrs' property, with three wells in close proximity to their Texas home. The closest was 791 feet away. As a result of poor management and lack of emission controls, Aruba Petroleum created a ""private nuisance"" to the Parr family by producing harmful air pollution and exposing them to harmful emissions of volatile organic compounds, toxic air pollutants and diesel exhaust, the lawsuit said. Op-ed: Make sure fracking is done right . Aruba Petroleum argued to the jury that it consistently met state regulatory standards for air emissions and that there was no evidence its fracking of the wells harmed the Parr family in any way. In a statement released after the verdict, Aruba said ""natural gas development has long been prevalent in Wise County,"" and dozens of companies operate hundreds of wells there. The company further said it complied with state air-quality limits and that its experts made strong cases countering the Parrs' claims in court. ""We contended the plaintiffs were neither harmed by the presence of our drilling operations nor was the value of their property diminished because of our natural gas development.  We presented thorough and expert testimony from recognized toxicologists and medical professionals, as well as local real estate professionals, to help the jury make an informed decision,"" Aruba's statement said. ""Unfortunately, they returned a verdict that we believe is counter to the evidence presented."" An important precedent? Fracking, which is short for hydraulic fracturing, is the process by which drillers pump large amounts of water mixed with sand and chemicals into a shale or rock formation. The wells can be deeper than 8,000 feet, and the process fractures the shale around the well, allowing the natural gas in the shale to flow freely. Interactive: How fracking works . Is energy independence a myth? Lisa Parr said that she knew by July 2010 that the ""loud operation"" next door to their ranch was toxic. ""One night, our whole house was vibrating and shaking. We lease that property for our cattle and so I went over there to make sure our cattle wasn't around there, and when I went over there my nose and throat started burning."" Parr called the state Commission on Environmental Quality. ""My doctor, an internal specialist, found 20 chemicals in my body and he said, 'Lisa you must move immediately. You will spend more time and money on hospitals, chemotherapy, and a mortician ... and you need to get an environmental health doctor immediately,' "" she said. The Parrs filed suit in March 2011, asking for $66 million in damages against nine companies that were originally thought to be involved in the drilling operations. Eventually, some of the energy companies were dismissed from the case, and some reached settlements before the trial. Their identities cannot be disclosed, according to the Parrs' Houston-based attorney, Brad Gilde. During discovery, Gilde said that ""substantial evidence"" showed that Aruba Petroleum was a factor in causing the Parrs' health problems. He said he believes the Parrs' court victory -- which he says is the first jury award for personal injury in a U.S. fracking case -- ""marks an important precedent for the future of natural gas production."" ""Because of their courage and determination for justice, the Parrs have successfully held Aruba Petroleum Inc. accountable for their careless and reckless behavior,"" he said. CNNMoney: Fracking has hot year in China . Aruba had a starkly different take on the verdict and left the door open to an appeal. ""We thank the jury for its service,"" the company said. ""The facts of the case and the law as applied to those facts do not support the verdict. ... Talk of an appeal is premature. Aruba has a number of arguments to be made in the trial court for why a judgment should be entered in its favor. "" 'Knee-jerk reaction'? Attorneys who represent the energy sector and are familiar with Parr v. Aruba Petroleum Inc. say they don't believe the case will set a precedent. Nor will it establish a blueprint for ""copycat"" cases, they say. Rather, they see this case as an anomaly due to the fact that it went to trial and addressed a rare nuisance allegation that evolved into a case revolving around personal injury from toxic exposure. Wendy May, a Dallas-based attorney who represented a prior defendant in the case before that company was dismissed from the lawsuit, says she doesn't think the Parrs' jury award will survive an appeal. ""The knee-jerk reaction by people not understanding the limitations of this verdict in this case may, in fact, cause others to believe there is an avenue for cases that there may not ultimately turn out to be,"" May said. ""I don't think it presents any precedents, certainly not from a legal perspective. I think the case is ripe for review by the appellate courts, and based on clear law that has been laid out by the Texas Supreme Court, a decision like this should not stand."" Oiling on Indian reservations . Gail Wurtzler, another environmental defense attorney, agrees with May that this is a one-off case because of the ""situational"" facts involved. ""Nuisance cases are very fact-specific, and because they are fact-specific, the results in one would not have implications for others,"" Wurtzler said. Regardless, the Parrs say they feel vindicated by the six-person jury's decision after what they describe as a six-year nightmare of nonstop health issues. They're now living at their ranch again and say that since Aruba has put units on their well sites to clean the air -- and the well closest to them has been shut down -- they are feeling better. ""With that being down, we're better about staying here. Now with this lawsuit being over, the curious question is whether they are going to shut this back on. That will determine if we have to move again. I don't trust this company,"" Lisa Parr said. Asked about the prospect of a drawn-out appeals process, she says they're ready for a fight and quotes one of her favorite musicians, Tom Petty: ""I stand my ground, and I won't back down."" ""I am very pleased with the verdict. This was justice that was served not only for us, but for every family in the world who has suffered from health effects and the negligence from this type of industry,"" she said. Perhaps surprisingly to some, Lisa Parr says she's not opposed to the work oil companies do. She simply wants them to do their business responsibly, she said. ""We are not anti-fracking or anti-drilling. My goodness, we live in Texas. Keep it in the pipes, and if you have a leak or spill, report it and be respectful to your neighbors. If you are going to put this stuff in close proximity to homes, be respectful and careful.""","Parr family suffered from nosebleeds, rashes, vision problems, ""vomiting white foam""

"U.S. and allied airstrikes in Iraq and Syria are changing the battlefield below. The Pentagon sees progress, even if it's a slog. But there may be unintended consequences of the air campaign -- in a way that will give the West yet another headache. The two most powerful Islamist groups in Syria -- the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra -- have spent much of the last year killing each other. But in an interview with CNN, a senior al-Nusra commander says the two groups now have a common enemy: the ""crusaders' coalition."" Abu Al-Muthana al-Ansari, an al-Nusra commander in Aleppo, said in a Skype interview: ""We can't fight on the crusaders' side against a Muslim. Allah said in the Koran that 'those who support them become one of them.'"" Two groups, whose bitter split was a windfall for other rebel groups and for the West, may be making up. Al-Nusra leader Abu Muhammad al-Julani -- in a rare public declaration -- has described the airstrikes as an assault on Islam, and warned the Western public: ""This is what will take the battle to the heart of your land, for the Muslims will not stand as spectators watching their sons bombed and killed in their lands, while you stay safe in your lands."" Were ISIS and al-Nusra to call a truce or even unite under one banner in the face of U.S. bombardment, the balance of power among rebel groups in Syria would change radically. A militant Islamist coalition would likely overwhelm more moderate rebel groups -- and pose a greater threat to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Against a background of mistrust and brutality, a formal ISIS-al-Nusra alliance does not seem on the table -- but if al-Ansari is correct, more ""local understandings"" against Syrian regime forces are likely. Asked about a recent statement by ISIS that it would soon extend its presence in southern Syria (the northern provinces of Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor are its strongholds), al-Ansari welcomed the declaration. ""We support any group that raises the flag of Allah and his Prophet and fights the infidel Alawites, and there is coordination in Al-Qalamoun [an area on the Syria-Lebanon border],"" he said. Qalamoun has seen heavy clashes between Islamist rebel groups and Syrian regime militia, supported by the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah. Reports from the area Sunday spoke of high casualties as al-Nusra and ISIS joined forces against Hezbollah. ""There is mutual understanding between us and the brothers in the Islamic State not to fight each other and fight the Infidel [al-Assad] regime,"" al-Ansari added. ISIS appears to have reciprocated. It says it has released from jails in Raqqa many of the al-Nusra commanders and fighters it captured during fighting between the groups. Anger over strikes on al-Nusra . U.S. officials said the targets in the first strikes on Syria last month included buildings west of Aleppo belonging to a group called Khorasan, an offshoot of al-Nusra focused on attacking the West. But at least one senior al-Nusra commander, Abu Yousuf al Turki, was reported killed in those strikes in the town of Kfar Deryan. Documents later found in the rubble by Jenan Moussa, a respected reporter for Dubai-based network Al Aan, suggest that an elite group inside al-Nusra known as the Wolf Unit had been hit.  Moussa posted photographs of documents with the names of 13 foreign fighters who belonged to the Wolf Unit, including al Turki. CNN cannot verify the documents. But al-Ansari suggested there was no difference between ""the brothers in Khorasan"" and al-Nusra, saying ""they are not a separate organization. Everyone in al-Nusra in Syria follows the al Qaeda organization."" Whatever debate there may be over the name of the unit targeted, and who was killed, the strikes appear to have hardened the resolve of al-Nusra. In his audio message, released five days after the U.S. strikes, al-Julani said: ""Do not let the West and America take advantage of the injustice of the Islamic State upon you ...Those who are unable to repulse the Islamic State or others, then let them do so without being a partner with the crusader alliance."" In other words: However bad ISIS are, don't take sides with the West. Al-Julani stopped short of holding out an olive branch to ISIS. The only way al-Nusra could formally join ISIS is by pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, thereby declaring its own extinction. Al-Nusra leaders will also be aware that if Western strikes severely degrade ISIS, al-Nusra could fill the void. The acid test will be what happens at local level. The Syrian Observatory of Human Rights reports that a few dozen al-Nusra fighters joined ISIS in the Aleppo area after U.S. airstrikes began. Further targeting of al-Nusra facilities by U.S. strikes might hasten that process. Also critical in coming weeks will be the relationship between al-Nusra and more moderate rebel groups. A recent analysis from the International Crisis Group (ICG) concluded that al-Nusra ""overcame initial unpopularity among mainstream activists and militants to earn broad acceptance as an authentic, Syrian component of the uprising."" In the words of one secular rebel, quoted by the ICG, ""Everyone cooperates with al-Nusra to some extent; sometimes you need them to come in and blow something up."" But al-Julani warned al-Nusra will fight any group that takes American cash and weapons, condemning ""the traitorous factions that were bought by the West with some money and ammunition so as to be a pawn in its hands ..."" according to a translation by SITE Intelligence. Al-Ansari, the al-Nusra commander in Aleppo, echoed that line, telling CNN: ""Those who seek glory without Allah's support will be humiliated.  And if it was proved that the brothers in the Free Syrian Army and other Mujahedeen have taken weapons form America, then we cannot work with them. America is the one who fought Islam and Muslims everywhere."" The problem is these groups need al-Nusra's help against both ISIS and the regime -- but they also need Washington's money, training and weapons to survive. Some are angry that U.S. bombs have fallen on al-Nusra rather than the bases and troops of the al-Assad regime; it just makes their job more difficult. The outcome may be some form of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" whereby some rebel groups will get U.S. help but continue to co-operate and even share resources with al-Nusra. That is not to suggest mutual trust; groups like the Syrian Revolutionaries' Front are wary of al-Nusra's goal of an Islamic state in Syria and of its more aggressive approach to other factions in recent months. But they are incapable of taking on al-Nusra, ISIS and the al-Assad regime; it would be tactical suicide. The anatomy of ISIS: How the 'Islamic State' is run . The view from head office . The evolving Syrian battle lines will be closely monitored by al-Zawahiri and al Qaeda's senior leadership in the Afghan-Pakistan border area. They will want al-Nusra to hold the line against ISIS, rather than ride to the rescue of a prodigal son. Al-Zawahiri was both humiliated and eclipsed by ISIS' defiance of al Qaeda, appalled by its nihilistic violence and outraged by al-Baghdadi's impudence in declaring himself 'Caliph.' Just two days before al-Julani's message was released, an al Qaeda spokesman reiterated the party line. In a 15-minute taped speech, Abu Dujana al-Basha managed to avoid mentioning ISIS, but the message was unmistakable. The ISIS caliphate, he said, was illegitimate. ""We call to restore the rightly-guided caliphate on the prophetic method, and not on the method of deviation, lying, breaking promises, and abrogating allegiances,"" al-Basha declared, according to a translation by SITE. And he condemned ""people of extremism, ignorance, and excessiveness, who infidel-brand the worshipers, kill the monotheists, sow corruption in jihad"" -- barely disguised code for ISIS. The theme is repeated; there will be no accommodation with ""those who helped ignite sedition."" So it would be a severe blow to al Qaeda if al-Nusra were to fold itself into ISIS. Counterterrorism analysts argue about whether the tail is wagging the dog: whether al-Zawahiri is trying breathlessly to keep up with myriad groups adopting the al Qaeda moniker, or actually shaping their activities. FBI Director James Comey said recently: ""There is not a highly capable, functioning AQSL [al Qaeda Senior Leadership]"" in the Afghanistan-Pakistan area.  Khorasan -- in his estimation -- was another example of the affiliates overshadowing the leadership thanks to ""refugees from Afghanistan and Pakistan."" The worst outcome for al-Zawahiri and al Qaeda's senior leadership would be for ISIS to survive and defy an extensive campaign to destroy it, and instead to hold or even take more territory. Its intent is to do just that, believing attack is the best form of defense. Within the past two weeks, it has captured scores of Kurdish villages in northeastern Syria, laid siege to the town of Kobani, stepped up the pressure in the Aleppo countryside and evicted the Iraqi army from several bases in Anbar province. ISIS' ability to withstand U.S. and allied strikes and to hold its ground will be decisive in shaping the attitudes of other rebel groups -- including al-Nusra -- as well as al Qaeda central and the al-Assad regime.","The two most powerful Islamist groups in Syria have spent months killing each other .

"Russia's Vladimir Putin again sought to downplay fears that gay visitors will be discriminated against as he paid a visit to the Sochi area Friday, exactly three weeks before the Winter Olympics get under way. Putin's remarks came as he met with volunteers for the games, the state-run Itar-Tass news agency reported. The President said Russia, unlike some other countries, does not criminalize homosexual relationships. ""We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone,"" Putin said. ""That's why you can feel safe and free here, but please leave our children in peace,"" he added. Russia has come under international pressure since its parliament passed a law last summer outlawing ""gay propaganda."" The legislation makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality. The law has been widely criticized by Western leaders who have called it archaic and discriminatory. Human rights activists say it proves Russia is unworthy of hosting the latest Winter Olympics. Putin's meeting with the Olympic volunteers came a day after he told foreign ambassadors in Moscow that the event would be held ""without any discrimination"" against athletes and visitors. ""The games will be held in complete compliance with the Olympic Charter, without any discrimination on the basis of any characteristic,"" Putin said Thursday, according to state media. The Olympic Charter states that: ""Any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement."" Police presence . Security has been stepped up in and around Sochi ahead of the Games. A twin bomb attack on public transit in the southern city of Volgograd at the end of December heightened concerns that Islamist terrorists may seek to strike in Sochi. There was a heavy police presence on the streets of the Black Sea resort Friday as Putin visited the area. Two security blimps also hovered in the skies above the Sochi Olympic Village, allowing long-range monitoring of activities on the ground. Meanwhile, last-minute construction work continues apace ahead of the expected influx of 6,000 athletes from 85 countries and thousands more visitors from around the world.

"(CNN)One of the biggest questions about ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" -- other than who would play the seductive Christian Grey -- was how the film would be rated. The movie is adapted from E.L. James' best-selling erotic novel of the same name, which is famous for its racy BDSM scenarios. Early on in the film's development, screenwriter Kelly Marcel suggested that she was aiming for a rating of NC-17. In reality, ""Fifty Shades"" won't be quite that steamy. According to Variety, the MPAA has deemed ""Fifty Shades"" worthy of an R rating, thanks to ""strong sexual content including dialogue, some unusual behavior and graphic nudity."" But for all the talk about sex, those involved in the project don't want moviegoers to forget that ""Fifty Shades"" is a love story at its heart. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson tells Details magazine in its February issue that she took on the project because she'd ""not seen a love story as complex, or with sex as complex. You feel you're in his world, then slowly it's revealed that you're in hers. To be able to flip this tale, without the woman becoming a victim, was something I felt strongly about."" The film stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele, an inexperienced young woman who falls for the rich and mysterious Mr. Grey, played by Irish actor/model Jamie Dornan.

"A little more than 400 years ago a king of England, James I, was informed by one of his judges, Edward Coke, that while the king was under no man, he was under God and the law.  This was one of the earliest and most powerful suggestions that our legal system (borrowed from the English) had, as its core principle, that there must be some restraint on arbitrary power. Ours is supposed to be a government, as John Adams wrote in the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, of laws and not of men. What the health care ruling means to you . In what will go down as one of the most important Supreme Court decisions of the 21st century, a majority of the justices have affirmed that most noble and important of Anglo-American legal maxims. But the court's opinion, in preserving the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, under Congress' taxing power, still gives a virtually unlimited sway to the power of the federal government. The court's opinion is a long one, and will be carefully parsed by legal scholars, but the bottom line is not difficult to discern. Chief Justice John Roberts has, whether he makes it clear in his opinion or not, chosen to leave the determination of the scope of Congress' powers to Congress itself, and to the American people, who place their representatives in Congress. How the Supreme Court voted, what they wrote . The argument against the Affordable Care Act was that the individual mandate, by requiring virtually all adult Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty, could not be justified under the commerce power, because instead of regulating commerce, the act was an attempt to compel participation in commerce.  The chief justice and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito all now concede that that argument was correct, and that there must be some limits to the power of the federal government when it seeks to regulate interstate commerce. This was the clear holding of prior Supreme Court cases as well. But with the chief justice's turning to the taxing power to justify the individual mandate, what his opinion takes away under the Commerce Clause, is, in effect, given back.  This is particularly disappointing, because the authors of the Affordable Care Act, and its defenders, such as President Barack Obama, repeatedly assured the American people that it was a measure that would reduce costs, not increase them, and that the act was not an attempt to raise taxes. Breaking down the court's decision . A tax measure is less politically palatable than an ""individual mandate,"" and had the penalty provisions of the individual mandate been frankly acknowledged to be a tax, it would have been more difficult to pass the act, perhaps even impossible, given the closeness of the margin by which it was enacted. Some court watchers repeatedly said that the chief justice did not want to render a decision which, by finding the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, would plunge the court once again into the political thicket it encountered in 2000 with Bush v. Gore.  What Roberts has done in this case seems to prove those observers correct. A health care victory that's only a start . The court has paid some lip service to the principle that ours is a government of laws, not of men, and that the Constitution exists to reign in arbitrary power. There are four Justices -- Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito -- who seem sincere in that belief.  I wish I could say that I believe Roberts is as well. What the court has failed to do in this case must be corrected by the American people themselves.  It is now for Congress, perhaps, to reconsider this unwise act, which unduly expands the reach of the central government, and unwisely restricts the liberty of the American people. Ruling plays into campaign narrative for both sides . The decision is also a reminder of the sad truth that our constitutional liberties hang by too slender a thread. There is now a new and potent issue to be considered in the upcoming election, and that is, which candidate will have an opportunity to shift the precarious balance of the justices on the court.  It is unconscionable for 5-4 majorities to alter the meaning of the Constitution, and to shift the basis Congress has given for legislation.  One can only hope that after this November the likelihood of this happening again will be less.","The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the health care law in 5-4 ruling .

"U.S. military and intelligence agencies pushed doctors working in military detention centers to violate medical ethics by taking part in the mistreatment of prisoners by interrogators, medical and legal experts conclude in a new report. A report issued Monday by Columbia University's Institute on Medicine as a Profession and the Open Society Foundations called on the Defense Department and CIA to follow international medical standards on the treatment of detainees. Though the worst violations cited in the report occurred before 2006, the ongoing force-feeding of hunger strikers at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay remains in conflict with those standards, said Dr. Gerald Thomson, one of the report's authors. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, when U.S. forces began to capture suspected operatives of the al Qaeda terrorist network, American military doctors were told ""this was an emergency situation, and national security as at stake,"" Thomson said. The result was that doctors ended up advising interrogators who were devising and implementing the degrading, inhumane treatment of those captives -- practices now widely seen as having crossed the line into torture -- in ""clear conflict"" with their professional principles, the report concludes. Court blocks release of CIA interrogation methods . ""The behaviors of the physicians and psychiatrists were dictated by changes in regulations and changes in the understanding of ethical principles that were transmitted by the Department of Defense,"" said Thomson, a Columbia medical professor emeritus. ""They undermined and distorted the physicians' understandings of the ethical principles in dealing with detainees."" More than 100 detainees died in U.S. custody between 2002 and 2005, with 43 of those deaths classified as homicides. The document, titled ""Ethics Abandoned: Medical Professionalism and Detainee Abuse in the War on Terror,""  was the product of three years of study of public records by a 20-member task force. It found the Pentagon excused ethical violations such as the use of medical information in interrogations and the participation of doctors -- sworn to do no harm -- who were characterized as ""safety officers."" The task force called for a full investigation of the post-9/11 practices, including medical examinations of detainees, reviews of interrogation logs and documents on the treatment and condition of inmates. Thomson said the number of physicians believed to have been involved was ""probably dozens, maybe less than that."" But to involve doctors in the abuse of prisoners violates ""a covenant, if you will, between the medical profession and society,"" he said. Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, a Pentagon spokesman, said Monday that the report's allegations aren't new, and the claims are unsupported. FBI agent's 'mental poker game' against al Qaeda . The allegations ""have been subject to numerous investigations over the years, and those investigations -- which had access to more information than the authors of this report -- have never substantiated these claims,"" Breasseale said. He said the health and well-being of Guantanamo detainees is the primary mission of prison camp's medical staff, ""and they take this duty as seriously as they take their duty to provide medical treatment to U.S. service members or any other patient in their care."" The practices employed at Guantanamo Bay -- sleep and sensory deprivation, the use of stress positions, the exploitation of phobias and noise exposure -- came to light after the 2004 scandal at Abu Ghraib, the Iraqi prison where American troops were found to have tortured detainees. The scandals led to multiple investigations and reforms by both Congress and the Bush administration, which defended the use of ""enhanced"" interrogation methods. The Obama administration repudiated the use of those techniques when it came into office in 2009. But Thomson said the guidelines that U.S. agencies follow today are believed to be looser than they were before 2001, though some details remain classified. The U.S. response to the wave of hunger strikes at Guantanamo Bay ""exposed some medically unethical practices"" as well, Thomson said. More than 100 detainees at the camp, located on a U.S. Navy base in Cuba, were refusing food over the summer, and about 30 were being fed through tubes shoved down their noses and into their stomachs. The Pentagon has said the feeding program is lawful and humane. But the practice has been condemned by human rights groups, the World Medical Association and the American Medical Association, which says every patient has the right to refuse even life-sustaining treatment. ""Those hunger strikes are current. They're not in the past,"" Thomson said. The camp's guidelines for doctors should be changed, he said, ""so physicians are not placed in a position where they're required to violate medical ethics."" Breasseale said the feeding program ""is focused solely on preserving the life and health of detainees in (Department of Defense) custody, and is in line with well-established U.S. law."" The feeding tube procedure ""is medically sound, and is based on procedures performed not only in U.S. prisons, but in hospitals and nursing homes worldwide,"" he said. As of Monday, 14 Guantanamo detainees refuse to eat regularly and are therefore approved for the feeding program, but they don't always require tube feeding because they frequently will ""drink the supplement or eat a meal out of sight of their peers,"" Breasseale said. ""We remain committed to President Obama's goal of closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, he added. ""It is wildly expensive, it is inefficient, and it operates outside America's best interests. However, until Congress changes the law, we will continue to humanely safeguard those held in our charge there.""

"A California company is recalling an unknown amount of boneless chicken sold in eight states over salmonella fears, federal officials said. Foster Farms, based in Fresno, produced the chicken on March 8, 10 and 11, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service. It said the company shipped the products to Costco, FoodMaxx, Kroger, Safeway and other stores. The chicken ended up in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada and Utah. ""The products are mostly likely no longer available for purchase, but may be in consumers' freezers,"" the federal agency said. Not safe to eat: Three foods to avoid . Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the food safety agency about the salmonella Heidelberg illness linked to the consumption of boneless skinless chicken. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said it determined a link between the illness and the boneless skinless chicken breast products from Foster Farms. ""One case-patient has been identified in California with an illness onset date of May 5, 2014,"" the agency said. One health safety advocate criticized the government, claiming there are more related illnesses and that the recall should go beyond a few days in March. ""We do not believe the current action taken to recall Foster Farms contaminated chicken goes far enough to protect the public's health,"" said Dr. Urvashi Rangan, the head of Consumer Reports Food Safety and Sustainability Center. ""Consumers deserve better."" Salmonella lives in the intestinal tracts of people, animals and birds. People become infected by eating foods contaminated with animal feces. Food safety: Take matters into your own hands . About 42,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States every year, according to the CDC. It estimates the number of cases is much higher -- about 1.2 million -- due to many cases not being diagnosed. About 400 to 450 people die each year with acute salmonellosis, the CDC says. Typical symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever. Most people experience symptoms within eight to 72 hours after contaminated food is ingested. Infections usually are resolved in three to seven days, and mild cases often do not require professional treatment. More severe cases require antibiotics. Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially for young children, pregnant women and their fetuses, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.

"If you've picked up fruit at Costco, Kroger or Walmart stores recently, keep reading. Wawona Packing Co. is voluntarily recalling peaches, nectarines, plums and pluots that were packed at its Cutler, California, warehouses between June 1 and July 12. Wawona believes the products may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Costco, Kroger and Walmart, which also operates Sam's Club stores, have all posted notices about the fruit recall on their websites. So have Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe's, Ralphs and Food 4 Less. The recall is nationwide, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Consumers should look for a sticker on their fruit that says ""SWEET 2 EAT,"" according to the recall warnings. Internal testing at Wawona revealed the potential listeria contamination, the company says. Listeria was found on on two nectarines and one peach. It is not yet clear how they became contaminated. The facility was shut down and sanitized, and subsequent tests have been negative for the bacteria. ""We are aware of no illnesses related to the consumption of these products,"" Wawona President Brent Smittcamp said in a statement. ""By taking the precautionary step of recalling product, we will minimize even the slightest risk to public health, and that is our priority."" How to protect yourself from food poisoning . Smittcamp is urging customers not to eat any of these stone fruits -- meaning fruits with large pits -- and to either destroy them or return them to a nearby store for a refund. Whole Foods is also recalling several of their ""made-in-store items such as cakes, tarts, salsas, and prepared salads"" that may contain the contaminated fruit. In addition, Wegmans has recalled several of its baked goods that contain fruit from Wawona Packing Co. This includes cakes, pies, tarts and other pastries. For a full list, see FDA.gov. Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that can cause listeriosis. The most common symptoms of listeriosis are gastrointestinal issues (such as diarrhea), fever and muscle aches. Pregnant women, infants, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk for a more serious infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If you have already eaten one of the recalled products and begin to feel ill, see your doctor and tell him or her about the recall. ""Your doctor will make a diagnosis and should report any positive test findings for Listeria monocytogenes to public health authorities, who will then report it to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"" Wawona states in an FAQ about the recall. The CDC estimates about 1,600 illnesses and 260 deaths are caused by listeriosis each year in the United States. Overall, outbreaks have been on the decline since 2001, but the largest in U.S. history occurred in 2011. Cantaloupes from a farm in Colorado sickened 147 people and killed nearly three dozen.

"Last week, Jason Collins wasn't even on an NBA team. In two weeks, he might not be on one. But for now, Collins -- the first openly gay, active player in the United States' four big sports leagues -- is, by jersey sales, the NBA's most popular player. NBA Senior Vice President Vicky Picca said Tuesday that Collins' No. 98 Brooklyn Nets uniform is the top-seller on NBA.com, besting the likes of LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin. The interest is coming from the fans Collins has earned since announcing last year, when he was still unemployed, that he was gay. ""Jason Collins' return to the league represents a historic moment, and fans continue to show their support by (buying) Jason's jersey,"" said Picca. Not bad for a player who, just last week, inked a 10-day contract with the Nets. And the Stanford graduate hardly dominated in his lone game back on the court, going scoreless while compiling two rebounds and five personal fouls in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers. In fact, Collins had never been a headline player. A journeyman with stops with New Jersey, Memphis, Minnesota, Atlanta, Boston and Washington, he's known more for his defensive prowess and rebounding than his offensive output, having averaged 3.6 points per game over his 12-year career. The warm reception he received during and after that game from his teammates, competitors like Kobe Bryant and league officials reflects more on Collins' reputation as a player and person around the league, as well as his historic announcement. ""I know everyone in the NBA family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment,"" said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver after Collins' signing last Sunday. Whether Collins stays around remains to be seen. At age 35, he's not bringing fresh legs to Brooklyn. And the team has no obligation to keep him on the roster. Still, whether or not he's a go-to player, Collins has very much become a symbol for the gay rights movement since disclosing his sexuality in an April column in Sports Illustrated magazine. ""I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation,"" he wrote. ""I wish I wasn't the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, 'I'm different.' If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I'm raising my hand."" There's no escaping the symbolism in his jersey number: He chose 98 in honor of Matthew Shepard, the gay University of Wyoming student beaten to death in 1998. The news that the Nets jersey was selling so well (despite the fact that Collins hasn't even worn it yet, having at first donned a No. 46 for the Lakers game) struck a chord online. Some on Twitter praised the development, like one who wrote, ""He's a piece of history, and this is really significant for a lot of people."" Many others, though, were less enthusiastic -- including some who used gay slurs and suggested Collins was profiting because he is gay. (In fact, NBA players don't get more or less money based on how many of their jerseys are sold.) Some questioned why Collins was being held out as an icon while, in their view, athletes who publicly profess their Christianity are criticized. A few people questioned the jersey sales not because of Collins' sexuality, but because of what they considered his sub-par play. ""Jason Collins' jersey was actually a top-seller?"" tweeted one. ""Wow...I mean I'm glad he came out and all but #CmonMan.""","NBA veteran Jason Collins announced last April that he was gay .

"(CNN) -- It was tense, nerve-shredding, prime-time viewing. No, not the new series of ""Boardwalk Empire,"" but a soccer match with 31 penalties. Tuesday's English League Cup match between Liverpool and second division Middlesbrough was a marathon encounter which finally came to a conclusion at 10:42pm local time -- almost three hours after it had kicked off. Level at 1-1 after 90 minutes at Liverpool's Anfield stadium and locked together at 2-2 after two hours of play, the two teams began a record-breaking penalty shootout. After all 11 players on both teams -- including the two goalkeepers -- had taken a spot kick, only two penalties had been missed. As a result, with the score in the shootout level at 10-10, the first penalty takers had to go again. The success both teams enjoyed from 12 yards made for a surreal spectacle, with Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli letting a wry smile slip when he converted for the second time in the shootout. But, as always in these heartbreaking football deciders, there has to be a fall guy. That was Middlesbrough's Albert Adomah, who sliced his penalty wide of the goal to give Liverpool the win. The final score in the shootout was 14-13, with both teams having taken 15 penalties each. When you include the penalty scored by Middlesbrough substitute Patrick Bamford to make the score 2-2 in the dying moments of extratime, there was a grand total of 31 spot kicks in an extraordinary match -- a competition record. ""I don't have words to explain my feelings now,"" Middlesbrough manager, and former Real Madrid No. 2, Aitor Karanka remarked after the match. ""I've never experienced anything like that before. We have played a Champions League team at Anfield and we've met them face to face. Everything was brilliant except the last penalty."" For Liverpool, it ended a run of back-to-back defeats in the Premier League. ""I was obviously pleased to get through and that experience, even though it was a long night for everyone, was great for our young players,"" said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, whose starting 11 included the 17-year-old Jordan Rossister. ""It's good to win, no matter how you win,"" added Rodgers. ""It was very difficult -- even the 'keepers scored. It was really good quality. You can see why Middlesbrough are up near the top of the Championship (England's second tier,) they are a good side and are organized.

"Human activity has caused at least half of climate change in the last half-century, hundreds of scientists say. They are 95% certain of this, the surest they've ever been, says a United Nations report published Friday. That activity? Driving cars, running power plants on coal and oil, torching swathes of forestland and debris; anything involving burning carbon-based fuels and emitting greenhouse gases. We are seeing the consequences already in extreme weather patterns, particularly drought and flood, and they will probably get worse this century, the report said. ""It should serve as yet another wake-up call our activities today have a profound impact on society, not only for us, but for many generations to come,"" Michel Jarraud, head of the World Meteorological Organization, said at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry echoed his words in an official statement. ""Those who deny the science or choose excuses over action are playing with fire,"" he said. ""Once again, the science grows clearer, the case grows more compelling, and the costs of inaction grow beyond anything that anyone with conscience or common sense should be willing to even contemplate."" Beneath Greenland's ice, a grand canyon . The assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the benchmark study on global warming published every few years.  Nearly 1,000 researchers from around the world work on the document, which then undergoes review by about as many scientists. The panel released a summary report Friday and plans to post the full version, roughly 2,500 pages, online on Monday. This year's report further strengthens the suspicions that scientists already have. In 2007, climate researchers were already 90% sure that people were behind a seemingly small rise in global average temperature of about half a degree Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) that has already notched up extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts and flooding. While 90% constitutes a ""very likely"" degree of certainty, Friday's report stating scientists are now 95% sure indicates an ""extremely likely"" degree of certainty, which is considered the gold standard when discussing probability. The effects humans are already causing are expected to increase for a century or more, the report reads. Weather catastrophes, previously called storms of the century, are on their way to striking every 20 years or even more frequently. Bloomberg: Why Sandy forced cities to take lead on climate change . This means, unfortunately, that we could see more EF5 tornadoes like the one that ground up Moore, Oklahoma; stronger and more floods like those that inundated Colorado towns; another Sandy or Katrina or two in our lifetimes; more crops wiped out by drought; and more forestland consumed by roaring wildfires. The Arctic ice cap could melt nearly completely in summer, and sea levels could continue to rise. In the Antarctic, the ice cap could continue to increase slightly. And if greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb as they have, the resulting temperature rise and its deadly effects would get even worse, the report says. Hundreds of experts weigh in . The 2013 assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change brings together the latest research from top scientists in the field. It contains a ""summary for policymakers"" aimed at guiding politicians and lawmakers worldwide on decisions regarding the environment over the next several years. The document released Friday explains the physical science behind climate change. The U.N. panel releases a report every five or six years. Friday's report is the culmination of work by more than 250 authors from 39 countries and was subject to an extensive review process involving more than 1,000 experts. More than 850 expert authors from 85 countries contributed research for the full report, which will be released in three stages through April. The first, on the physical science behind climate change, accompanies the summary for policymakers. The second, expected in March, will cover ""impacts and vulnerabilities"" of climate change; the third, on mitigation efforts, is set to go out in April. Climate change may increase violence, study shows . Critics of the report . Despite the breadth of the scientific expertise involved and the extensive review and approval process, the assessment reports spark quite a few criticisms, from both climate change believers and skeptics. Skeptics say the panel exists only to produce further evidence supporting the idea of man-made climate change while ignoring opposing research. But climate change activists, and many climate scientists, say the panel's consensus-seeking policy produces conclusions and estimates that are too conservative. Another often-cited critique of the report is that, due to its size and lengthy approval process, it is already outdated by the time it is released. Several important studies already have been published in the past year in the constantly evolving science of climate change that will not be included in this assessment. Despite the critics, this week's document will serve as a major measuring stick for the current state of the world's climate and what type of change is in store.

"(CNN) -- As the November 24 deadline for a deal over Iran's nuclear program approaches, Washington seems fixated on the technical details of what an agreement should look like: the types of centrifuges Iran might be able to keep, for example, or the level of low-enriched uranium it could stockpile. But as important as these discussions are, the focus on mechanics risks missing a bigger and arguably more important reality: that the negotiations are central to the future of Iran's political system. The failure to address this crucial question could come back to haunt us. If the United States is serious not just about placing significant (if imperfect) limits on Iran's nuclear program, but also encouraging a political dynamic that strengthens reform-minded Iranian leaders and fosters a more cooperative Iranian foreign policy abroad, then Washington should make every reasonable effort to seal a comprehensive nuclear deal and secure Congress' support for it. The alternative -- insisting on imposing onerous terms that would virtually assure Iran's quitting the negotiations -- would simply bolster Iran's hard-liners, while making it far easier for Tehran to pursue a nuclear program largely free of international supervision. To turn the popular Washington refrain on its head, no agreement is far worse than a mutually agreeable if imperfect agreement. The reality is that ultra-hard-liners in Iran have always feared that the narrowest of openings could eventually create a flood of political change. From the outset they tried to stir up trouble for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his allies, and have no doubt been preparing to escalate their efforts if and when Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei should signal that negotiations are fruitless. Indeed, Rouhani's opponents appear to want the talks to collapse in hopes of extinguishing hope the reformist movement will be able to make a comeback in the 2016 parliamentary elections. A consideration of such internal political struggles might surprise some commentators and lawmakers in Washington, where many have embraced the dubious notion that there is no fundamental difference of opinion between Tehran's hard-liners and those Iranian leaders now engaged in a potentially risky struggle to redefine the political and ideological leadership of the Islamic Republic. Should such calculations have any bearing on the positions of U.S. negotiators? Of course, their chief mission is to concentrate on the intricate technical issues that must still be sorted through to reach a deal. But policy makers should also not ignore the wider political questions that are at stake here. To insist on positions that might pacify the most zealous U.S. opponents of an agreement but which would discredit Rouhani and his domestic allies would do grave damage to long-term U.S. interests. What we should do instead is reach for an agreement that narrows the parameters of Iran's nuclear program while helping to create conditions favorable to broader political debate in Iran. Striving for this sweet spot may be difficult, but it is better than the alternatives. A collapse of negotiations might not produce an immediate political calamity for Rouhani. But in the medium and long term it will surely bolster Tehran's hard-liners, who will argue that Iran's only choice is to circle the wagons by strengthening the ""resistance"" economy, by working with Russia, China and other small and large autocracies seeking to counter U.S. ""hegemony,"" and by silencing any domestic voices that might oppose these hard-line policies. Moreover, failed negotiations would anyway give hard-liners a victory by making it impossible for the United States to secure long-term international monitoring of, and safeguards on, Iran's nuclear program -- Iranian leaders could declare that Tehran has permanently given up enriching 20% uranium, while assuring the international community that it will limit low-enriched uranium purely for purposes of domestic energy ""needs."" Such a Plan B could erode the international consensus over sanctions, leaving the United States with no good options and Iran's hard-liners sitting pretty. And what of the other alternatives? History clearly shows that sanctions can get Tehran to the negotiating table, but will not compel Iranian leaders to capitulate to demands they deem contrary to Iranian interests. As for military action, the consensus among U.S. military leaders and strategists seems to be that any effort to significantly damage or reverse Iran's nuclear program would require weeks or months of sustained bombing -- in effect another war, the outcome of which would be far from certain. And, with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria on the march, the last thing the United States should be thinking about doing is adding to the regional chaos. Given that the strategic and political price of failure has risen dramatically, what is most needed now from both Tehran and Washington is a readiness to secure compromises that could ultimately have a positive impact on reshaping the course of Iranian politics. If there was ever a time for bold and visionary leadership on both sides, that time is now.","November 24 is the deadline for reaching deal over Iran's nuclear program .

"(CNN) -- Young people are notorious for their political apathy, but activists hope a new online video will make them turn out to vote as much as they ""turn up"" on Friday nights. The 3Â½-minute video features celebrities like Lil Jon, Lena Dunham and Whoopi Goldberg, some of whom are dancing to ""Turn Out For What,"" a parody piggybacking off DJ Snake and Lil Jon's 2013 single, ""Turn Down For What."" The comedic video highlights issues often important to young people like LGBT rights, student debt and climate change. ""There are over 130 million people that watched the 'Turn Down For What' video on YouTube, and our goal is to make voting as popular as the song,"" said Rock The Vote spokeswoman Audrey Gelman, noting that the single had broad appeal, earning top spots on dance, hip hop and pop charts. ""We love the idea of turning a party anthem into an anthem for civic engagement,"" she said. Gelman acknowledged that voter turnout is ""always an uphill battle"" during midterm elections when there aren't presidential candidates on the ballot, but said that a downtick is to be expected for all voters, not just the youngest cohort. In the video, each celebrity shared what issues they care about in an attempt to inspire younger voters to latch on. ""My name is Lil Lena, and I'm turning out for reproductive rights,"" said Dunham, who is also seen chatting with Lil Jon inside a voting booth. Others featured in the video had a more humorous take. Lil Jon said he's ""turning out"" for marijuana legalization before taking a toke from what looked like a massive joint. ""I'm Fred and I'm turning out because I want to impress my friends. That's the only reason to ever do anything,"" said actor and comedian Fred Armisen. The video was organized by Rock The Vote, a nonpartisan activist organization founded in 1990 working to ""mobilize the millennial voting bloc,"" according to its website. Only 45% of young people age 18-29 cast a ballot in 2012, nearly 20 percentage points below the national average, according to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. That same year, voters under 30 chose President Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by a substantial 23-point margin.

"A man accused of beheading a woman in Oklahoma will be charged Monday, authorities said. Charges against Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, will include first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon, according to Jeremy Lewis, spokesman for the Moore, Oklahoma, police. Nolen, a recent convert to Islam, allegedly attacked a woman Thursday at a Vaughan Foods processing plant soon after he learned he'd lost his job there. Police said he walked into the front office and attacked one of the first people he encountered, Colleen Hufford, 54. He severed her head with a knife and then attacked Traci Johnson, 43. Johnson is in stable condition at a nearby hospital for treatment of ""numerous wounds,"" according to police. Mark Vaughan, the company CEO and a reserve deputy with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office, confronted and twice shot Nolen, authorities said. Nolen was interviewed by investigators on Friday. Police have not revealed what he said. Facebook page focused on Islam . Nolen's Facebook page uses the name Jah'Keem Yisrael. The cover photo appears to be of fighters holding weapons. The postings include all-caps messages about Islam and quotations from the Quran. There's no reference to job dissatisfaction, and no indication he planned an attack. Some postings are political, such as one that runs with an image of the Joker from ""Batman"" comics: ""AMERICA SO CALL HELPS IRAQ (WHICH NOT)- WELL WHY CANT U HELP THE GAZA CITIZENS AGAINST ISRAEL LOL..I UPLOAD THIS PIK BECAUSE AMERICA AND ISRAEL ARE WICKED. WAKE UP MUSLIMS!!!"" CNN confirmed with Moore police that the Facebook page and the images belong to Nolen. No terrorism link found . Nolen had tried to convert co-workers to Islam, officials said. U.S. law enforcement officials said there are no indications linking Thursday's attack to terrorism. In the Middle East, ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, has drawn world attention with videotaped beheadings. In a Facebook video posted by Megan Nolen, two women who say they are Nolen's mother and sister apologize for his actions. ""I want to apologize to both families, because this is not Alton,"" said the woman who calls Nolen ""my son.""  She says her son was a good kid. ""I know what they're saying what he did, but I'm gonna tell you this, that's not my son,"" she says. ""My heart's bleeding right now."" The woman who identifies herself as Nolen's sister said he's never been a violent person. ""For something like this to have happened, we're all still in shock right now,"" she says. ""We're praying for both of the victims' families, and I ask that everyone keep us in their prayers."" The Oklahoma Conference of Churches issued a statement Saturday urging ""all Oklahomans and people everywhere not to equate Mr. (Nolen's) actions with the beliefs and practices of the Islamic Community in Oklahoma."" ""The Islamic Community of Oklahoma has consistently condemned all violence -- most especially acts of violence ostensibly carried out in the name of Islam,"" the statement said. ""Along with our Muslim brothers and sisters we affirm that true Islam is, in fact, a religion of peace and that those inflicting violence in the name of Islam are perverting Islam for their own ends."" National Muslim organizations have made similar statements as ISIS' brutality has come to light. Officer: I 'would have killed him' Nolen was incarcerated until March 2013 for possession of a controlled substance, escaping confinement and resisting an officer. CNN affiliate KOKI-TV in Tulsa reported Nolen was arrested in 2006 when an officer saw him throw a bag of crack cocaine and a bag of marijuana out of a vehicle window as the officer pulled him over for traffic violations. Nolen was put on probation, KOKI reported. In 2010, a state trooper stopped Nolen for an expired tag and discovered he had outstanding warrants, KOKI reported. The trooper, Betsy Randolph, told CNN on Saturday that Nolen started struggling after she put a handcuff on one wrist. Nolen ran and was arrested after a 12-hour manhunt. ""He kept looking over his shoulder because he knew I wanted to shoot him, but obviously I couldn't shoot him in the back,"" Randolph told CNN. ""If there had been any way to know the things he is alleged to have done a few days ago, I would have killed him when I had a chance."" A spokesman for Gov. Mary Fallin, Alex Weintz, noted the governor had blocked Nolen from receiving parole in 2012. Weintz said Saturday: ""The suspect came up for parole in 2012 and the governor denied his parole. She reviewed his file and didn't think that he was a good candidate for early parole.""","Two women saying they're part of suspect's family apologize in Facebook video .

"Ben Bradlee, the former top editor of The Washington Post who oversaw the paper's coverage of the Watergate scandal, is in hospice care as his health has declined over the past six weeks, his wife said in a C-SPAN interview. Bradlee, 93, began end-of-life care at his home last week after suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia for several years. Bradlee was the executive editor of The Washington Post from 1968 to 1991 during which time the paper covered the downfall of President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal. ""He was diagnosed a while ago, but it became obvious that he had a serious problem about two years ago,"" his wife, Washington Post columnist Sally Quinn, said in the C-SPAN interview Sunday. Quinn said Bradlee still recognizes her and ""loves having me there."" In November, President Barack Obama awarded Bradlee the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor awarded to civilians. ""With Ben in charge, the Post published the Pentagon Papers, revealing the true history of America's involvement in Vietnam; exposed Watergate; unleashed a new era of investigative journalism, holding America's leaders accountable and reminding us that our freedom as a nation rests on our freedom of the press,"" Obama said at the ceremony. Quinn said she kept Bradlee's condition private for a while. ""Once you say the A-word, everybody's attitude changes toward you,"" she said. Bradlee went into the newspaper business after World War II, starting a paper in New Hampshire. In 1948, he moved to Washington to report for the Post.

"Two international crises are giving Republicans new reasons to break out a familiar rallying cry -- secure the border -- just weeks before the midterm elections. A Liberian man's death in Texas from Ebola is triggering worries that the disease could spread beyond West Africa, while efforts by ISIS to recruit Westerners is stoking fears that its influence could reach into the United States. The seemingly disparate issues are gelling into a single talking point for Republicans arguing that weak border security is leaving the United States vulnerable. The most direct link came from Rep. Duncan Hunter, who is sticking by his claim that at least 10 ISIS fighters were caught by border security officers trying to cross the United States' southern border. On Thursday, the California Republican's spokesman, Joe Kasper, pointed to the Sept. 10 arrest of four people in Texas who ""identified themselves, while in custody, as members of a specific, known-terrorist organization."" He cited Homeland Security information ""provided internally"" about those suspects' claimed affiliations, saying they ""met an individual in Mexico who spoke their own language and assisted in the smuggling attempt."" Kasper said the department's determination that those four aren't part of ISIS-linked groups is no surprise ""because foreign nationals with terrorists associations, captured on the border, doesn't really play well for an administration trying to convince the world that the border is secure."" However, a U.S. government official who has reviewed the detention records said Hunter's claims are false. The official said the four men are Turkish and identified themselves as members of the Kurdish Workers Party, also known as the PKK, whose affiliates are the chief Kurdish group fighting ISIS in Syria. The PKK is listed by the State Department as a terrorist group at the behest of Turkey's government, which has fought against a Kurdish insurgency for years. But the official said the men's links to terrorism were investigated and the Homeland Security Department concluded they don't pose a threat to U.S. national security. Substantiated or not -- and no cases of Ebola have yet been identified in Central America -- linking Ebola and ISIS to border security is a way for Republicans to raise an issue that President Barack Obama and Democrats had sought to keep off the table until after November's midterm elections. The president delayed his announcement on a long-awaited and politically-charged executive order dealing with illegal immigration until after the elections in an effort to keep from galvanizing the conservative base and handing Republican candidates a new club to whack endangered Senate Democrats. But the international crises dominating news cycles less than a month from the midterms are giving Republicans a way to push the issue anyway. Much of the criticism comes from Obama's most reliable opponents in Congress. But some Republican candidates -- including New Hampshire Senate hopeful Scott Brown -- are playing up their border security concerns on the campaign trail. ""If people are coming in from normal channels, can you imagine what they can do through our porous border?"" Brown, the Republican challenging Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, told New Hampshire radio station WGIR on Thursday. ""It's so critically important to really use every tool, shut off every mechanism, for them and that disease and other potential diseases to come into our country,"" he said, adding that Shaheen has voted against GOP-backed border security measures and he wants to ""call Sen. Shaheen out on that issue."" Thom Tillis, the Republican North Carolina House speaker who is challenging Sen. Kay Hagan, did just that during a debate Tuesday. ""Sen. Hagan has failed the people of North Carolina and the nation by not securing our border,"" he said. ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have an Ebola outbreak, we have bad actors who can come across the border. We need to seal the border and secure it. We need to make it very clear that blanket amnesty is not on the table and then we need to solve for the first time in decades the problem we have with immigration in this country."" Also linking Ebola and ISIS to border security on Thursday was GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas. He told Newsmax that Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry believe climate change is ""more deadly to this country than Ebola is climate change, more deadly than the Islamic State to Thomas Foley is climate change,"" in an apparent references to James Foley, a journalist who was beheaded by the group. He said the reason the United States hasn't yet closed its borders is that Democrats want ""everyone to feel included."" ""Countries that recognize that they have an obligation to protect their people regardless of whether or not its politically correct have done just that,"" Gohmert said. ""We used to have quarantines of serious diseases that would kill people. But this day in time, gee, we don't want anybody to feel like they're being left out,"" he said. ""So therefore some of my Democratic friends, including this president, they want everyone to feel included. So let's don't quarantine, let's don't close our borders.""","Republicans say the southern U.S. border is vulnerable to Ebola and ISIS fighters .

"There had been ""growing concern"" about former U.S. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson's leadership in the two weeks since a man with a knife managed to jump the White House fence and get into the East Room, a source tells CNN. But the ""final straw,"" the source said, was that she and the agency did not inform the president about a September 16 breach at the CDC in Atlanta -- in which a private contractor who had a concealed gun shared an elevator with President Barack Obama -- until just before the media reported it on Tuesday afternoon. ""The problems about the elevator breach were a) that it happened, b) that no one told the White House about it in the midst of two weeks of many discussions with them about security and then c) that the president didn't find out till just before the media was about to report it,"" the source said, agreeing that ""final straw"" would be an apt description of that event. Elaborate video shows entire security breach at White House . The source, who spoke to CNN anonymously so as to speak more candidly about sensitive events, said that there was every reason to believe Pierson and Secret Service leadership took the September 19 fence jumper incident ""very seriously,"" though White House officials were not pleased with how facts and details about that incident kept changing, both in public media accounts and to them privately. That, however, could be explained and understood, the source said, given the ""fog"" of conflicting accounts inherent in such an intense and adrenaline-filled event. There was no such understanding about why, two weeks after the September 16 elevator incident at the CDC, the President was not informed until just before the Washington Examiner and Washington Post were prepared to share details of that event with the world. There was no going back; she had lost Obama's confidence that she was the right person to run the agency. On Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said he had accepted Pierson's resignation and was appointing an independent panel to investigate the White House breach. Presidents are loath to publicly criticize the Secret Service for fear of straining any relations with the agents who keep them alive and protect their loved ones. So perhaps it was left to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who told reporters in Nevada on Wednesday, ""I am just so disappointed in what I've seen. I can't imagine being a father of two girls and seeing this happen in my home. I'll bet Michelle is just beside herself -- they are so protective of those two girls. So I can't be a cheerleader of the Secret Service today.""","Source: Concern had been growing about Secret Service director after East Room breach .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)On the bustling streets of Nairobi, hundreds of motorcyclists are weaving in and out of the already congested traffic. Without fear of incident, countless drivers put themselves at risk every day on these gridlocked roads. Up to 13,000 people die in traffic accidents on Kenyan roads annually, according to a report from the World Health Organisation. But two brothers, Charles and Joseph Muchene, are hoping to stem the number of fatalities with their wearable tech venture, CladLight. Launched last April, the sibling startup aims to make motorcycle riders more visible. Their first product is dubbed the ""Smart Jacket,"" a reflector vest fitted with LED lights, a rechargeable battery and transmitters. The jacket uses wireless technology to connect an on board transmitter mounted on the motorcycle. This allows it to detect and reflect in real time the rider's movements at traffic lights and turnings. ""We put lights on that vest and the lights are controlled remotely so they indicate clearly the intents to turn right, left or break when you are riding your motorcycle,"" says Charles Muchene. ""We are expecting to bring sanity onto our roads,"" he continues. ""And we are hopeful that we will have a reduction of accidents that are happening,"" adds Muchene. ""If measures are not taken, we are going to have even double the number [of fatalities on the roads]."" Reckless driving . Bright Oywaya, the executive director of the Association for Safe International Road Travel, says the main causes for the high number of accidents are speed, drink driving and law enforcement. ""Also, lack of infrastructure because the roads do not cater for the different users,"" continues Oywaya, whose passion for road safety began following a 1997 road accident that left her paraplegic. ""There are no crossroads anywhere and so actually 47% of the deaths are actually pedestrians, according to the last report I saw by the police."" Muchene agrees that drivers are the root of the problem. The young entrepreneur says it's a common tradition to gift high school graduates a motorcycle upon completion of their education -- but adds that that very few riders enroll in driving school to learn Kenya's road rules. ""There are so many motorcyclists that are everywhere,"" he says. ""It is very high risk. Most of them are reckless drivers."" Big dreams . Meanwhile, government authorities and local road safety bodies are also working to tackle the escalating problem. Since last year, officials have stepped up efforts to crack down on road rule-breakers, setting up checkpoints to ensure drivers have licenses and are wearing helmets and high-visibility jackets. With high-visibility jackets mandatory by law, the Muchene brothers are hoping to work with motorcycle manufacturers to infiltrate the marketplace with their product. ""We are sourcing partnerships with motorcycle assembly plants in the country so once you buy the motorcycle you are given the jacket for free,"" says Muchene. ""Once we see that there's a good number of guys having the jackets, and it's having the impact that we intended to have that is the reduction of motorcycle accidents due to poor visibility, we'll venture into other markets,"" he continues, revealing the startup's future plans to expand its operations beyond Kenya. ""As we go along,"" he continues, ""we will come up with better products and more innovative solutions to address challenges in our society through wearable technology.""

"U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has apologized to the United Arab Emirates and Turkey for comments he made last week that Middle Eastern allies are partly to blame for the strengthening of ISIS. The latest apology came in phone call from Biden to the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, representatives from both countries said Sunday. The vice president issued an apology to Turkey earlier during the weekend. The problem appears to have originated during an appearance last week at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University when Biden spoke about Turkey, the UAE, other Middle Eastern allies, and the threat posed by the so-called Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Biden told attendees that the militant Islamist group had been inadvertently strengthened by actions allies took to help opposition groups fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad. Except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra and al-Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world,"" Biden told students. ""We could not convince our colleagues to stop supplying them,"" he said. On Turkey's alleged role, Biden said, ""President (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan told me, he's an old friend, said, 'You were right. We let too many people (including foreign fighters) through.' Now they are trying to seal their border,"" he said, according to transcripts. Biden gets colorful on being a VP . Denial and consternation . Erdogan vehemently denied ever saying such a thing. Biden extended a mea culpa on Saturday to the Turkish President. The apology came hours after Erdogan expressed his anger over the comments to reporters in Istanbul, saying, ""Biden has to apologize for his statements."" Otherwise, he said, Biden will become ""history to me,"" according to published reports by the semi-official Anadolu news agency. The United Arab Emirates' foreign ministry hit Biden with a sharply formulated statement Saturday, expressing its ""astonishment"" at the vice president's remarks. They were ""far from the truth, especially with relation to the UAE's role in confronting extremism and terrorism and its clear and advanced position in recognizing the dangers, including the danger of financing terrorism and terrorist groups,"" said Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr. Anwar Mohammed Gargash. The apologies . The UAE on Sunday said that Biden apologized to the Crown Prince during their phone call ""for any implications in his recent statements"" that the Middle Eastern nation has backed the growth of terror groups. A statement from Biden's office avoided the word ""apology,"" but said he ""clarified that his recent remarks regarding the early stages of the conflict in Syria were not meant to imply that the UAE had facilitated or supported ISIL, Al Qaeda, or other extremist groups in Syria."" Biden thanked the UAE for its role in fighting ISIS and terrorism in the region, according to accounts from both nations. He made similar overtures to Turkey. ""The Vice President apologized for any implication that Turkey or other Allies and partners in the region had intentionally supplied or facilitated the growth of ISIL or other violent extremists in Syria,"" Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said. ""The Vice President made clear that the United States greatly values the commitments and sacrifices made by our Allies and partners from around the world to combat the scourge of ISIL, including Turkey."" During their telephone conversation, Biden and Erdogan reaffirmed the two countries' commitment to fight the terror group, Barkoff said. Erdogan's office and the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment regarding Biden's apology. The issue has arisen at a sensitive time, with Turkey's government authorizing the use of military force against terrorist organizations, including ISIS, as the militant group's fighters laid siege to towns just south of the Turkish border. The government also agreed to allow foreign troops to launch operations against ISIS from Turkey. Until now, Turkey has offered only tacit support to the coalition. While Biden is known for making blunt statements that sometimes embarrass the administration, Turkey is particularly sensitive to allegations of allowing terrorists to cross its border into Syria. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has accused Turkey of looking the other way and, in some cases, providing support to rebels embroiled in the country's civil war. Turkey, in turn, has accused Syria of fomenting the unrest that has led to ISIS taking hold in the region.","Vice President Joe Biden apologizes to the UAE .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for legal same-sex marriages in five more states. The court refused to hear cases from the states -- Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin -- seeking to keep their same-sex marriage bans in place. Couples in some of those states began applying for marriage licenses just hours after the Supreme Court's decision. CNN affiliate WVEC in Norfolk, Virginia, captured a same-sex couple who rushed to fill out their marriage license documents. Officials in Virginia began issuing same-sex marriage licenses at 1 p.m. Monday. Tony London and Tim Bostic, two plaintiffs in Norfolk, said they were ready to receive their marriage license Monday afternoon. ""It was a pleasure suing you,"" London joked when a clerk handed him the license, a WVEC reporter tweeted, capturing the two locked in a kiss. In Richmond, Lindsey Oliver and Nicole Pries left work and drove to the John Marshall Courthouse, where they were the first same-sex couple to be married. ""It's a great thing,"" Oliver told CNN affiliate WTVR. ""There's lot of things that need to be done in Virginia to still make gays equal. This is one step and we're glad to be a part of it."" Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said all of the state's 54 county clerks must start issuing same-sex marriage licenses. A similar order could be issued by day's end for Indiana and Wisconsin. ""Supreme Court"" trended on Twitter with dozens of people weighing in -- and trying to figure out exactly what the high court's move meant. Experts say its refusal to hear the cases from those five states also means that six more states -- Colorado, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kansas, West Virginia, and Wyoming -- could soon have to lift their bans on same-sex marriage, because they are covered by the same circuit appeals courts that initially struck down the prohibitions. Once that happens, the number of states permitting same-sex marriage would jump from 19 to 30. At issue is whether gay and lesbian couples in all 50 states have the same equal protection or due process right to marry that opposite-sex couples have. The Family Research Council, a conservative public policy and lobbying organization, said voters were having their rights infringed. ""Unfortunately, by failing to take up these marriage cases, the high court will allow rogue lower court judges who have ignored history and true legal precedent to silence the elected representatives of the people and the voice of the people themselves by overturning state provisions on marriage,"" Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said. In Utah, just hours after word from the high court came down, Gov. Gary Herbert said at a press conference that he felt ""surprised"" and ""disappointed"" that there was no ""finality"" on the issue of same-sex marriage. The state would comply with Monday's order, he said, and same-sex marriages would move forward. ""Regardless of your personal beliefs,"" he urged, ""... please treat each other with respect and with kindness as we transition through this new law."" The court's action does not mean there won't eventually be a final ruling on the constitutional questions -- many court observers fully expect a landmark decision in the next year or two -- but it does signal the justices are not ready to jump into the politically charged debate right now. The high court's move surprised many observers. Advocates on both sides of the issue had wanted the court to offer a definitive, binding ruling on key constitutional questions. ""The question of whether same-sex marriage bans are constitutional is a historic issue, under the Constitution and for the Roberts Court,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a respected Washington attorney. ""It's hard to imagine a situation where judges are going to have more power to define the social and family relationships of the country."" He's referring to Chief Justice John Roberts. Both sides passionate . Same-sex marriage is already legal in the District of Columbia and 19 U.S states: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. A Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage would essentially end a patchwork of state laws -- some that allow it, some that prohibit it, and a few that allow protections short of marriage, such as civil unions and domestic partnerships. Marriage equality supporters cheered the high court's Monday order. ""Today's decision by the Supreme Court leaves in force five favorable marriage rulings reached in three federal appellate courts, ensuring the freedom to marry for millions more Americans around the country,"" said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry. ""But we are one country, with one Constitution, and the court's delay in affirming the freedom to marry nationwide prolongs the patchwork of state-to-state discrimination and the harms and indignity that the denial of marriage still inflicts on too many couples in too many places."" The Supreme Court hurried to schedule the appeals from the five states for its closed-door conference, even before all the legal briefs had been filed. But the justices offered no explanation of why they are not ready to resolve the issue. Some conservative activists say the high court should stay out of same-sex marriage issues. ""When the court on such an issue -- where there are very strong opinions on both sides, and a huge issue of social change in our country -- steps in and makes it into a constitutional issue, it makes the justices look significantly more political in the eyes of the American people,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network. ""It would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the court ... by imposing one type of solution for the entire nation, instead of leaving it in the hands of the states to decide how they want to address this issue."" Many supporters of ""traditional"" marriage privately say preserving an inflexible one-man/one-woman definition of wedlock nationwide would not be realistic moving forward, and that a divided bloc of states upholding the status quo may be the best possible scenario. But all that hinges on what the Supreme Court does. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, the first state attorney general to argue successfully at the district and appeals level for a marriage ban to be struck down, said ""a new day has dawned, and the rights guaranteed by our Constitution are shining through."" Same-sex precedent . A federal appeals court in August took just nine days after intensive oral arguments to issue its sweeping conclusion that voter-approved same-sex marriage bans in Indiana and Wisconsin were unacceptably discriminatory. And state leaders then took just five days to formally ask the Supreme Court to intervene. Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently hinted that a ""Why wait?"" attitude may predominate. ""I think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation,"" she told The Associated Press in July, referring to interracial marriage, a ban on which was not struck down by the high court until 1967. ""If a case is properly before the court, they will take it."" It takes just four of the nine justices to put such petitions on the docket -- but five, of course, to ultimately prevail on the merits. State and federal judges in the past year have ruled 39 times in favor of the expanded marriage right, while two have upheld existing laws. All this follows what the Supreme Court in 2013 said peripherally on the issue. Fifteen months ago, the justices cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume after it ruled private parties did not have ""standing"" to defend a voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. More importantly, the high court also rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in its 5-4 ""Windsor"" decision, citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits, such as tax breaks. That federal question now morphs into the higher-stakes state jurisdiction, where marriage laws have traditionally been controlled, and where the equal protection issues will ultimately be resolved. By CNN's count, various individuals and gay rights groups have launched more than 80 pending marriage equality lawsuits in all 31 states with current bans. A Supreme Court review would put all that litigation on hold. However, the nine justices had complete discretion to stand on the sidelines for now and wait for a majority of these state battles to play out, or for a federal appeals court to uphold a ban. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this story.","NEW: One step toward making gays equal, new spouse says .

"Officials in Idaho and Nevada have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop same-sex marriage in those states, at least temporarily, by barring implementation of a federal appeals court ruling issued Tuesday. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals struck down current bans on same-sex marriage in the two states, and later ordered its ruling to go into effect immediately. Idaho officials then asked the high court to intervene on an emergency basis and block enforcement of that lower court mandate. Nevada then followed suit . Justice Anthony Kennedy earlier Wednesday temporarily granted Idaho's request, and is considering Nevada's similar application. Same-sex couples in both states who brought the original lawsuit will now have time to respond in writing, over whether a longer stay should remain in effect while the case is litigated. ""I'm pleased that Justice Kennedy has given us the opportunity to make our case in a way that helps avoid the confusion some other states have faced,"" said  Idaho Gov. C.L. ""Butch"" Otter in a statement. ""I intend to be faithful to my oath of office and keep working to protect the Idaho Constitution and the mandate of Idaho voters in support of traditional marriage."" The case is the latest in a series of rapidly evolving legal events this week on the controversial social issue. In a surprise move Monday, the justices refused to get involved now in the constitutional debate over same-sex marriage.  That decision allowed same-sex couples to wed legally in five states -- Virginia, Utah, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Wisconsin. Utah is among the states where marriage licenses were issued to same-sex couples for a brief period before stays were issued by the courts earlier this year, leaving a good deal of uncertainty over whether those marriages were valid. A three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals had concluded the bans in Idaho and Nevada violated the equal protection rights of homosexuals to legally marry. ""The lessons of our constitutional history are clear: inclusion strengthens, rather than weakens, our most important institutions,"" said the judges. ""When same-sex couples are married, just as when opposite sex couples are married, they serve as models of loving commitment to all."" Following what the Supreme Court did a day earlier, at least 32 states and perhaps three more could allow same-sex marriage in coming weeks, an increase of at least 13 states since the beginning of the month. Colorado and Utah announced Tuesday it would order county clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The decisions affecting Idaho and Nevada become the fourth such federal appeals court to strike down voter-approved bans since June.","A federal appeals court Tuesday struck down two states' ban on same-sex marriage .

"Matt Damon said it's hard not to see his three daughters in the eyes of the girls he helps on his visits to the poverty stricken villages in India. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta sat down with Damon and his water.org co-founder, Gary White, to talk about what their organization is hoping to achieve by providing clean water and sanitation to those who need it. ""Our daughters in that situation would be off looking for a water source and hauling water for the family and they would have no prospects for a life or a future,""  Damon said. On premises access to clean water is something only one in four people have in India, according to UNICEF. When Damon got into the water business, he worked with H20 Africa and says he learned a lot. ""I did what I think a lot of people do, which is they kind of get right into the direct impact, like well-digging and how many people can I help if I dig x number of wells,"" Damon said. But he said as his understanding of the issue grew, he realized that charity wasn't going to solve the problem. Together, we can solve the water crisis . He teamed with Gary White, co-founder of WaterPartners, in July 2009 and water.org was born. ""Had I stayed with just drilling wells, I'd have reached thousands of people at this point, but by the end of next year we'll hit 3 million people that we've reached this way,"" Damon said. Water.org is a nonprofit focused on giving access to clean water and sanitation to more of the developing world. What makes the organization different is its WaterCredit Initiative, which provides new financing options for poor people so they can pay for a toilet in their home or connect to an existing water supply. White said he met women in India who were paying 125% interest to loan sharks to get their own toilet or to connect to the public water utilities. They inspired him to create the WaterCredit initiative. Now, he said, these women can get a loan at a much lower rate and still get access to these services. ""So, basically we helped microfinance institutions really discover a new market among some of their existing clients and now we've had over 1.6 million people get access to water and sanitation not through charity but through a microloan. And they're being repaid at 99%,"" White said. In a lot of urban areas the infrastructure already exists. Water pumps right under the feet of people who just can't connect to it. ""It was the recognition that there was a market there for this, and that if we just stopped looking at people as beneficiaries, if we look at them as customers, then we can really unleash their power to solve their own problems,"" Damon said. Damon's passion about water is spilling into every aspect of his life. He's using his celebrity and sense of humor to help spread the word. When he took part in the ice bucket challenge, he did it with toilet water.  Before that he proclaimed a strike on toilets, saying ""Until everybody has access to clean water and sanitation, I will not go to the bathroom."" His goal to empower people is serious. He said by gaining access to water and toilets, women and girls gain their time and life back. For many, collecting and scavenging for water is a large part of their day. Freed from those duties they can find a job and earn money to help repay the loan. Desperate, disgusted but proud -- India's human waste removers . ""It is an income-enhancing loan because you're basically buying their time back, and they can work, right?"" Damon said. ""This is an incredible deal if you're the lender."" It also brings extra security to girls and women, who no longer have to leave their home to use the bathroom. ""I mean this news that came out of India this summer with the two girls who didn't have access to toilets in their home, so they had to wait until the cover of night because of the dignity of this issue, to go out and find a place to defecate. And while they were out they were raped and murdered,"" White said. ""That's just unbelievable that something so basic to humanity like access to sanitation should set up these situations."" Some 36% of the world's population, 2.5 billion people, lacks improved sanitation facilities, and 768 million people still use unsafe drinking water sources, according to the World Health Organization. The long-term health effects of not having access to water include malnutrition and diarrhea. According to UNICEF, diarrhea is the second largest cause of death in children under 5 globally and responsible for 600,000 children's deaths each year. It's also associated with a higher risk of stunting (low weight for age and developmental delay). Many other diseases, such as malaria and other parasitic diseases, could be prevented with an adequate water supply, sanitation facilities and proper hygiene, according to the World Health Organization. That's also why education is a key component of water.org's mission. It teaches people about proper hand washing with soap, and is helping people make the connection between hygiene and sickness. It teaches how to store water, avoid contaminating it with utensils and how to practice good hygiene by washing hands before preparing food and after changing a diaper. ""The practice of hand washing with soap in India is not widespread. A study showed that only 53% of the population wash hands with soap after defecation, 38% before eating, and 30% before preparing food,"" according to UNICEF. Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi share Nobel Peace Prize . ""It's an absolute, just white-knuckle crisis right now for three-quarters of a billion people,"" Damon said. ""It's killing a child every 20 seconds, which is unfathomable that these children are dying from things like diarrhea, which you know, if you have kids, your kid gets a stomach bug, maybe they miss a day of school. But, you know, it's hard for us in the West to even wrap our brains around this concept that a lack of access to clean water and sanitation is literally slaughtering children by the millions, just because none of them are dying here.""","Only 1 in 4 people in India have access to clean water .

I want you all to know that this isn't a sob story. I'm not here to make you feel bad for the poor sick kid. In fact, I hope to accomplish quite the opposite. I want to share a story about finding joy and beauty in places that others see pain and suffering. I am sick, yes. But I am so much more. My life is wonderful, not in spite of this illness but because of it. I'm writing to you from the hospital, a.k.a. my second home. When I was younger and obsessed with becoming an artist, the hospital was my New York loft apartment. I would move the furniture around to create space on the floor, throw down some sheets and indulge in any form of art that I could get my hands on. The people who would come and visit loved to tell me how sorry they were that I had to live this kind of life: sick and alone, trapped in hospital room after hospital room. I would argue with them, tirelessly. I'd try to show them that although this life may be different from their own, it was anything but miserable. Oftentimes, it was wasted effort. I still wonder why they could never see my time in the hospital the way I did: as a blank canvas waiting to be turned into something beautiful. As I got older, my life become a whirlwind of homework and responsibilities. The hospital became my retreat, a place to gather my thoughts and focus on my health. The nurses are my friends as well as my caretakers. The doctors are my parents as well as my physicians. Hospital life, like all of life, is filled with both pain and joy in equal measures. There are so many moments to share, so much life that has been lived in these hospital rooms -- from late-night room service orders with my friends to Harry Potter movie marathons to wake-me-up-at-2-in-the-morning blood draws that taught me patience. There were moments of total contentment, when I would look up from my homework and see the sun setting over the hospital courtyard, washing my room in an orange glow. Like all teenagers, I had the lonely nights, the sleepless nights and the stay-up-late-finishing-homework nights. I even threw three New Years Eve parties as a patient, complete with sparkling juice and beeping IVs. Sure, there were endless tests and procedures; doctors always finding something else that was wrong with my body. But there was also laughter, those moments when we could see how wrong the world had been: A short life CAN be as rich as a long one. Something that always surprises people to hear is that my health has very little to do with my happiness. Yeah, being sick can suck (big time), but nothing is one-sided. I can't let the pain block out the beauty. When I was 13, my parents and I started a foundation to support families like ours living with cystic fibrosis, called the Claire's Place Foundation. When I was 14, I became a public speaker, and now I am creating a video series called ""The Clairity Project."" Get it? Claire-ity. The videos shine a light on hospital life and break down the social barriers we have around people who are sick. The past four years have been a whirlwind of traveling, speaking, fundraising and experiencing life in ways I never imagined. Some things in life are ours to choose, while other things choose us. I never chose to live this crazy bizarre life with cystic fibrosis, and I didn't wake up from the coma with a plan to move my life down a totally different path. Yet that seems to be exactly what happened. And, of course, I wouldn't want it any other way.","Claire Wineland was born with cystic fibrosis .

"(CNN) -- Former Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill said in an interview with The Washington Post that he was the one who fired the final shot to kill Osama bin Laden in 2011. Two Special Operations sources confirmed to me that O'Neill was one of the shooters in bin Laden's room. But did he really kill bin Laden? And, ultimately, does it even really matter who shot bin Laden since the SEAL raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan was so clearly a team effort. O'Neill has told his story before in a lengthy profile in Esquire in 2013 in which O'Neill was described not with his real name but only as ""the Shooter."" In the Esquire piece, O'Neill/The Shooter was said to have encountered al Qaeda's leader face-to-face in the top-floor bedroom of the compound in Abbottabad where he'd been hiding for more than five years. The Shooter said the al Qaeda leader was standing up and had a gun ""within reach,"" and it was only then that the Shooter fired two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him. That account was in conflict with the narrative from another raid participant in a wildly successful book, ""No Easy Day."" Another member of the secretive SEAL Team 6, which executed the bin Laden raid, told CNN the story of the Shooter as presented in Esquire is false. According to this serving SEAL Team 6 operator, the story is ""complete BS."" Twenty-three SEALs and their interpreter launched the assault on the bin Laden compound just after midnight on the morning of May 2, 2011. They shot and killed bin Laden's two bodyguards, one of bin Laden's sons and the wife of one of the bodyguards. They also wounded two other women. The first three SEALs to make it to the top floor of the compound were ""the point man,"" ""the Shooter"" profiled by Esquire, and Matt Bissonnette, the SEAL who wrote ""No Easy Day"" under the pseudonym Mark Owen. What actually happened the night of the raid, according to the SEAL Team 6 operator who I interviewed, is that the ""point man"" ran up the stairs to the top floor and shot bin Laden in the head when he saw what looked like bin Laden poking his head out of his bedroom door. The shot gravely wounded al Qaeda's leader. Having taken down bin Laden, the point man proceeded to rush two women he found in the bedroom, gathering them in his arms to absorb the explosion in case they were wearing suicide vests, something that was a real concern of those who planned the raid. Two more SEALs then entered bin Laden's bedroom and, seeing that he was lying mortally wounded on the floor, finished him off with shots to the chest. This account of bin Laden's demise is considerably less heroic than the Shooter's version in Esquire, in which he says he shot bin Laden while he was standing up and only after he saw that the al Qaeda leader had a gun within reach. The SEAL Team 6 operator who spoke to me says there is no way the Shooter could have seen a gun in bin Laden's reach because the two guns that were found in the bedroom after the shooting were only discovered after a thorough search and were sitting on a high shelf above the frame of the door that opened to the room. The SEAL operator also points out there was a discussion before the raid in which the assault team was told ""don't shoot the guy (bin Laden) in the face unless you have to"" because the CIA would need to analyze good pictures of bin Laden's face for its facial recognition experts to work effectively. Yet the Shooter in the Esquire story says he shot bin Laden on purpose twice in the forehead. A U.S. official familiar with the details of the raid said the SEAL Team 6 operator's version is in line with what happened. That account ""has it right in my view,"" the official said. The SEAL Team 6 operator also tells CNN that the Shooter was ""thrown off"" the Red Squadron, the core of the SEAL Team 6 group that carried out the bin Laden raid, because he was bragging about his role in the raid in bars around Virginia Beach, Virginia, where SEAL Team 6 is based. In the Esquire article, the Shooter complains he is receiving no pension, since he left the military four years before the minimum 20 years required to be eligible. After the article appeared, CNN spoke with Phil Bronstein, the Esquire writer who says he passed along CNN's written questions about the Shooter's role in the raid to his story's main character. The Shooter did not respond to those questions. Stephanie Tuck, a spokeswoman for Esquire, said via email the magazine stood by its story. ""The Esquire article, 'The Shooter: The Man Who Killed Osama Bin Laden,' in the March 2013 issue, is based on information from numerous sources, including members of SEAL Team 6 and the Shooter himself, as well as detailed descriptions of mission debriefs."" According to present and former members of SEAL Team 6, the ""point man"" who fired the shot that likely mortally wounded bin Laden will never ""in a million years"" speak publicly about his role in the raid, and they lauded his courageous decision to throw himself on the two women in bin Laden's room. The new account of the bin Laden raid provided by the serving SEAL Team 6 operator is essentially the same as in Bissonnette's ""No Easy Day."" Bissonnette says he was one of the first to run into the bedroom and he saw that the point man's shots had mortally wounded bin Laden. Bissonnette says he then shot the dying al Qaeda leader as he lay on the floor. Present and former members of SEAL Team 6 say they regard Bissonnette as more credible than the Shooter. Balanced against that, according to a story filed by CNN's Barbara Starr last year after the publication of ""No Easy Day,"" the head of U.S. special operations, Adm. William McRaven, contacted members of the Navy SEAL team that killed bin Laden. According to Pentagon officials, the SEALs said bin Laden was standing in his bedroom when he was shot, and they believed that he posed a threat because there were weapons in the room. This account tends to bolster the story the Shooter told Esquire. In a previous CNN.com story about the Esquire profile, I noted that I was the only outside observer allowed to tour bin Laden's Abbottabad compound before it was demolished in late February 2012. During that tour, I looked around the bedroom where bin Laden was killed. The Pakistani military officers who were guiding me pointed out a patch of dark, dried blood on the low ceiling of bin Laden's bedroom. This patch of congealed blood seems to be consistent with the Shooter's story that he fired two shots at the forehead of a ""surprisingly tall terrorist"" while he was standing up. At the time, the precise location of bin Laden when he was shot was not a matter of dispute. But the blood patch could also be consistent with the account that it was the ""point man"" who first shot bin Laden. The point man is 5 feet 6 inches tall and was shooting upward at a tall man as he poked his head out of his bedroom. The compound is, of course, now gone, so it is no longer possible to reconstruct what happened the night of the raid based on forensic evidence. Finally, by all accounts, it was a confusing situation the night of the raid. One of the SEAL team's helicopters had crashed, and there was a firefight with one of bin Laden's bodyguards. All the electricity in the compound and the surrounding neighborhood was off on a moonless night and the SEALs were wearing night vision goggles, which only allowed them limited vision. What seems incontrovertible is that the point man, the Shooter and Bissonnette were the first three SEALs to assault bin Laden's bedroom. But to determine exactly which of them killed him might never be possible. What is certain is that it was a team effort. Five days after the bin Laden raid, members of the SEAL team who carried out the mission briefed President Barack Obama. According to those in the room, the SEAL team commander explained to the President, ""If you took one person out of the puzzle, we wouldn't have the competence to do the job we did; everybody's vital. It's not about the guy who pulled the trigger to kill bin Laden, it's about what we all did together.""","Three years after Osama bin Laden's death, Robert O'Neill says he was the one who killed him .

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)This is the new normal in Ferguson: Protests, day and night, for more than 70 days now. Sometimes it's hundreds of demonstrators, sometimes just a handful. But they're always outside the Ferguson Police Department, clamoring for the indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown. And with new details about the investigation leaked, tensions are escalating. On Monday night, two protestors were detained by St. Louis County police -- including Missouri State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed. She was detained as she blocked traffic in the middle of the street while protesting outside the Ferguson police department. Now, there are fears about what could happen next. ""Everybody is planning for whatever the grand jury decides,"" said Amy Hunter, racial justice director at the YWCA. ""Certainly there are lots of us that planning peaceful protests for should it not be indicted. Certainly there are other people that have other ideas at hand."" One protester put it succinctly: . ""If there is not an indictment, excuse my French, all hell is going to break loose."" New details revealed . Brown's blood was found on the officer's uniform and inside his police car, law enforcement sources told CNN. Those sources corroborated details first reported by The New York Times. ""That tends to support any testimony that there was some kind of scuffle in the police car,"" said CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos. ""And if so, that tends to support Officer Wilson's testimony and his justification for using deadly force."" At least one of the wounds Brown suffered is consistent with a struggle and appeared to be fired at close range, according to a different source with first-hand knowledge of the investigation. At least six shots . A private autopsy conducted for the Brown family showed that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. But Cevallos said the newly released details about Brown's blood in the officer's gun and on his uniform might only go so far in helping the officer's case. ""Ultimately, that officer will have to come up with justification not for firing his gun the first time, but for each and every bullet that came out of his firearm -- whether at the car or away from the car,"" he said. Brown's death is the subject of two inquires: one by a St. Louis County grand jury considering whether Wilson should be charged, and the other by federal investigators looking into whether any civil rights violations occurred. Timing of the leak . As anticipation mounts over the grand jury's decision, the new details leaked by a federal source to The New York Times could be strategic, a former FBI official told CNN. ""It could be really for,  in part, a beneficial purpose, to start leading those community leaders and those leading the protests to believe that there won't be an indictment,"" said Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI Criminal Division. ""It may be over time, that will have a beneficial effect of no riots, no battles in the streets again."" Sara Sidner reported from Ferguson; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Pamela Brown, Evan Perez, MaryLynn Ryan and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","Two people, including Missouri State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, are detained by police Monday night .

"Intense street fighting raged in the Syrian city of Kobani Monday as ISIS came closer to capturing a key area on the border with Turkey. ISIS fighters planted their flag on a hill on the eastern side of Kobani, then punched through defenses to open up the route for more troops, one witness inside the city told CNN. CNN crews on Monday also spotted what appeared to be the black flag of ISIS flying from a hilltop on the eastern side of the city. The flag was farther east into the city from one shown flying atop a building in video from Reuters and also seen by the CNN crews. Many Kurdish forces defending the city were wounded and killed, and many ISIS fighters were also killed as clashes spread from street to street, the witness said. The fall of the city would carry huge symbolic and strategic weight, giving ISIS sway over an uninterrupted swatch of land between the Turkish border and its self-declared capital in Raqqa, Syria, 100 kilometers (62 miles) away. The Turkish military, which has bulked up its defenses along the border in recent days as the fighting has flared, blocked people fleeing the embattled city from crossing the border. ""We want to go across!"" would-be refugees chanted as they pressed against a border fence. One witness inside Kobani told CNN he'd been waiting to leave the city with hundreds of others since Sunday night. ""We'll get killed if we stay,"" he said. As ISIS fighters attacked with tanks and heavy artillery, the city's defenders vowed to keep fighting. ""We are afraid of this. We are obliged to defend our home, our town,"" Kurdish Kobani official Idriss Nassan said. ""We didn't choose this war, but we are obliged to fight."" U.S. and allies strike again . ISIS managed to close in on Kobani despite airstrikes by the United States and allied forces over the weekend and on Monday. The most recent airstrikes took out two fighting positions near Kobani and two tanks near Raqqa, as well as two small ISIS units, two mortar positions and a building in Iraq, the U.S. military said Monday. Over the weekend, allied airstrikes destroyed two ISIS tanks, a bulldozer and another ISIS vehicle, U.S. Central Command said. Two airstrikes hit a large ISIS unit and destroyed six firing positions, the U.S. military said. A senior defense official said Monday to expect more airstrikes against ISIS targets in the Kobani area. But that's easier said than done. Another senior military official said many ISIS targets in Kobani are too close to the Turkish border or Kurdish forces to strike. And the Pentagon, the official said, believes there's a media outcry about the situation in Kobani because reporters are there. Many other towns have fallen to ISIS without TV crews present, the official said. No matter what role U.S. airstrikes play going forward, such attacks aren't enough, Nassan said. ""When I talk to people here in Kobani, they thank the international community, and the United States, they thank the countries who are striking the ISIS. But everyone believes it is not enough,"" he said. The ""international community cannot defeat ISIS by just hitting them from the sky. They have to help the people who are fighting -- the (Kurdish People's Protection Unit) YPG, the (rebel) Free Syrian Army who are here on the ground."" Meanwhile, about 270 kilometers (168 miles) to the east, in the northeastern Syrian city of Hasakah, ISIS suicide bombers drove trucks into checkpoints manned by Kurds, exploding them almost simultaneously, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group. Thirty Kurdish fighters died in the attack, the group said. Helicopters used in Iraq strikes . U.S. Army Apache gunships were used against ISIS targets in Iraq's Anbar province over the weekend, the senior defense official who spoke about the plans for more Kobani airstrikes told CNN. Fixed-wing aircraft also were on the mission, but because Iraqi forces were close to ISIS forces, the Apaches were used because they fly low and can strike with precision, the official said. The official described the area as ""very much contested, with ISIS continuing to make gains."" The low altitude used by Apaches poses a risk, but with ISIS forces in such a populated area, their precision was needed, the official said. U.S. officials don't see ISIS making a direct run for Baghdad, but concerns remain that ISIS elements are in the city and around the airport, the official said. In other developments: . Total cost of U.S. airstrikes so far? More than $62 million, Pentagon says . U.S. military airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria have cost more than $62 million so far, according to data provided by the U.S. Defense Department. The data, apparently sent out inadvertently Monday to the Pentagon's press contacts, lists the total number of airstrikes by U.S. Central Command in Iraq and Syria, details locations of targets and specifies the costs of munitions used. Militant leader's fate unknown . The United States is still unsure if an airstrike killed the leader of the Khorasan Group. U.S. officials are still assessing the strike on the first night of airstrikes in Syria, and whether it killed Muhsin al-Fadhli, the senior defense official told CNN. While he has not surfaced publicly or on social media, U.S. officials still have not seen sufficient corroborating intelligence, such as evidence of a funeral or martyrdom statements, the official said. ISIS gets Pakistan Taliban encouragement . Pakistan Taliban spokesman Shahidullah Shahid issued a statement expressing solidarity with ISIS and other fighters in Syria. ""In these times when the enemy is standing against you we ask that you forget internal strife and rivalries and stand up against the nonbeliever army,"" Shahid said in the statement. ""The Muslims of the world look to you with great expectation, and in this difficult time, we, your mujahidin brothers, are with you and will provide you with fighters and help,"" the statement said. U.S. vice president apologizes . U.S. Vice President Joe Biden apologized to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates for saying Middle Eastern allies are partly to blame for the strengthening of ISIS. At an appearance last week at Harvard University, he said the militant Islamist group had been inadvertently strengthened by actions allies took to help opposition groups fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad. Except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra and al Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world,"" Biden said. On Turkey's alleged role, he said, ""President (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan told me ... 'You were right. We let too many people (including foreign fighters) through.' Now they are trying to seal their border."" Erdogan vehemently denied ever saying such a thing. Marine may be the campaign's first U.S. casualty . A Marine lost at sea after bailing out of an MV-22 Osprey when it appeared it might crash in the Persian Gulf is believed to be the first American military casualty in support of U.S. operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Cpl. Jordan L. Spears, 21, was declared dead after search and rescue efforts didn't find him.","Military official: Many ISIS targets in Kobani are too close to border for airstrikes .

"A man charged at four New York police officers with a metal hatchet Thursday, hitting two of them at a time of high alert for authorities concerned they might be targeted in the United States and Canada. The man was hiding behind a bus shelter as if he was waiting to attack the officers, according to a law enforcement official, who said it almost appeared as if he was stalking them. The officers were posing for a photo when the man pounced, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said. He struck one officer in the right arm and another in the head, according to the commissioner. The two officers who weren't hit then shot at and killed the attacker. The law enforcement official identified the suspect as Zale H. Thompson, who had a criminal record in California and had been discharged from the Navy for misconduct, according to the source. The police officer who was struck in the head remains in critical but stable condition. The other officer, who is 24, was struck in the arm and was expected to be released soon. A 29-year-old bystander who was struck by a bullet in the lower back was also taken to a hospital. Her condition was not known. When asked if the unprovoked attack was tied to terrorism or to recent calls by radicals to attack military and police officers, Bratton said, ""there is nothing we know as of this time that would indicate that were the case,"" and a senior law enforcement official told CNN on Friday that investigators do not believe that Thompson, a Muslim convert, was driven by any radical Islamic views. Nevertheless, Bratton acknowledged concern because of recent attacks on uniformed officers. ""I think certainly the heightened concern is relative to that type of assault based on what just happened in Canada,"" he said. On Wednesday, Cpl. Nathan Cirillo was shot and killed as he stood guard at Canada's National War Memorial before shots erupted in the halls of the country's Parliament minutes later. The Ottawa gunman had ""connections"" to jihadists in Canada who shared a radical Islamist ideology, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria, multiple U.S. sources told CNN on Thursday. And on Monday, another Canadian soldier -- this one in Quebec -- was run over and killed by another man who the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Martine Fontaine said had been ""radicalized."" New York put its officers on alert after Thursday's attack, urging them to ""maintain a heightened level of awareness against random attacks,"" several law enforcement officials said. It's not the only city so affected. Washington's Metropolitan Police Department has also ""increased security levels and visibility, so the public should expect to see an enhanced presence"" of officers in light of the Canada and New York attacks, spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump told CNN.","There's no indication the attack is tied to radical Islam, official says .

"He has seemingly succeeded everywhere he's landed, but now, with the Ebola crisis on his hands, CDC Director Tom Frieden is being questioned at every turn. Despite his assurances, how did Ebola spread from one patient to another inside the United States? Are hospitals truly equipped to handle Ebola cases? Have the proper guidelines for treating patients been established? Freiden, who has been the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2009, attended top schools, fought infectious diseases and earned admirers along his rise. But faced with his biggest challenge -- the current Ebola outbreak -- some are questioning if his experience and leadership style are enough to stop the virus from spreading in the United States. His public statements are increasingly being second-guessed, not just by the usual pundits, but by health care workers. If anything, Frieden has been consistent since the epidemic broke out in West Africa, and then eventually spread to the United States. ""Ebola is scary. It's a deadly disease. But we know how to stop it,"" he said last week. Frieden has repeated this line many times: ""We know how to stop Ebola."" But then a Liberian national in Dallas was diagnosed with the virus. And last week, a nurse who cared for that man was confirmed to have Ebola. In his role, Frieden has to thread the needle: acknowledge fear, while appealing for calm. Frieden, described by friends as shy and hardworking, has had success virtually everywhere he's been. His track record reflects well on him, though he has faced criticism from conservative voices who viewed his efforts to ban smoking and trans fat from restaurants in New York as the creation of a ""nanny state."" The general distrust of government that the political right holds has been on display as the Ebola fight is on. ""Difficult taking anything (the CDC and) Frieden say seriously,"" conservative radio host Tammy Bruce said on Twitter, citing low confidence in what she sees as lies or guessing on the issue. After the news that a Dallas nurse had become the first person to contract Ebola inside the United States, the CDC director almost immediately said that a breach of protocol had occurred. The insinuation that maybe the nurse did something wrong brought new criticism against Frieden, this time without a political agenda. The group National Nurses United spoke to reporters after Frieden's remarks, some holding up signs that said, ""Stop blaming nurses. Stop Ebola."" Zenei Cortez, a nurse and vice president of the group, told CNN's Jake Tapper that in cases such as this, the nurses always get blamed unfairly. ""And in this particular case, they said it was a breach of protocol. But what was the protocol?"" she said. ""Was it enough that the nurse and the patient is protected?"" ""It's not enough that they put out guidelines. It has to be fully enforced,"" she added. Frieden on Monday said state and federal health officials are re-examining the protocols, including the removal of protective gear after contact with an Ebola patient and if it might be helpful to spray virus-killing solution on workers as they leave an isolation unit. Ebola: Five ways the CDC got it wrong . Focus on data . In Frieden's view, data is king. ""The real challenge is -- first and foremost -- basing decision-making on data,"" Frieden said. ""You know it sounds wonky and uninteresting, but when it comes down to it, that's what we want to do."" Reliance on data can ensure that plans work out as they were designed to, he said. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett, who worked with Frieden when he held that role, said she witnessed Frieden's faith in the numbers. Frieden began his career at the CDC by working on controlling tuberculosis, and then spent years stamping out the disease in India, as a CDC assignee to the World Health Organization. When Frieden arrived in New York as health commissioner, there were about a thousand cases of TB in the city, Bassett recalled. It was Frieden's specialty, but he went in a different direction with his resources. ""He didn't say, 'I'm going to halve the cases of TB,'"" Bassett said. ""He said, 'I'm going to drive down tobacco use.'"" That was a decision based on data, she said. ""Tobacco was and continues to be a leading preventable cause of death in New York and the country."" Ask Frieden what he considers the high point of his career, and he will refer to the time he spent in India, said Dr. Alfredo Morabia, an epidemiologist and historian who has followed Frieden's work. The impact of Frieden's work in India helped about half a million people, so ""that's not a strange answer from him because he's very interested in numbers. And he's going for the largest numbers for the larger impact."" What data has resulted in Frieden's confidence in the ability to stop Ebola? Will the recent cases change his calculus? A listener . Frieden has a blog on the CDC website, which mostly consists of news articles and thoughts from the director. The blog is hardly remarkable, but because it allows comments, it is ostensibly one way for the public to put their opinions in front of him. Many of the comments come from people who identify themselves as health care workers, and are not always kind. ""As a registered nurse, I'm here to tell you that I am losing confidence in your 'expertise'!"" one commenter wrote. Another person wrote, ""For a guy who is so sure about 'stopping Ebola in its tracks,' I see the disease spreading."" It's unlikely that the CDC director will see these comments, but what if he did? Could these voices of concern influence him? One thing that Bassett recalled about working with Frieden in New York is that he ""soaks up information from anybody."" ""So, it wouldn't matter to him how many letters you had behind your name (from) all of your degrees,"" Bassett said. ""If you had information that he felt was interesting, if you were driving a bus, sitting at a desk, entering data on a computer -- he wanted to talk to you and find out how that person might perceive things, what their advice might be."" If the director is interested in hearing suggestions, they are piling up from other health care professionals and members of the public interested enough about the Ebola outbreak to post a message on his blog. In his career, Frieden, a graduate of Oberlin and Columbia, has undoubtedly over-achieved and saved thousands of lives. His is a background that inspires confidence, and he has shown that in his messages on Ebola. But there is one caveat about being overly confident. It's risky.","Dr. Tom Frieden has found success nearly everywhere .
Now some are questioning his leadership on the Ebola crisis .
Those who know him say he is confident and data-driven .
Will the rising tide of criticism shift his views?"
"Former President Jimmy Carter said President Barack Obama ""waited too long"" to go after ISIS and criticized what he described as the president's changing foreign policy. ""First of all, we waited too long. We let the Islamic State build up its money, capability and strength and weapons while it was still in Syria,"" Carter told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in an interview published Tuesday. The 39th president was in Texas working on a Habitat for Humanity project. ""Then when [ISIS] moved into Iraq, the Sunni Muslims didn't object to their being there and about a third of the territory in Iraq was abandoned,"" he continued. The United States has so far led a coalition of countries in airstrike campaigns against ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. But the militant group has continued to operate, and it's expected to soon capture the key Syrian border city of Kobani. Carter also argued it would be strategic to have troops on the ground in Syria to help guide the air campaign. Obama, however, has pledged that the United States would not send troops into the country. ""You have to have somebody on the ground to direct our missiles and to be sure you have the right target,"" Carter said. ""Then you have to have somebody to move in and be willing to fight ISIS after the strikes."" How could Obama have 'underestimated' ISIS? More broadly, Carter criticized Obama's foreign policy, an approach that he says is lacking in ""positive action."" ""It changes from time to time,"" Carter said. ""I noticed that two of his secretaries of defense, after they got out of office, were very critical of the lack of positive action on the part of the president."" While it's rare for former presidents to critique the sitting president, Carter has been known to offer candid assessments of Democratic and Republican presidents and their administrations.","Jimmy Carter described President Obama's foreign policy as shifty .

"The International Olympic Committee is set to hold urgent talks over the future of the Winter Olympics following the Sochi Games' exorbitant cost. The 2014 event in Russia cost an estimated $50 billion and IOC members are concerned that candidates will be frightened off applying to host the Games.

Gian-Franco Kasper, president of the International Ski Federation (FIS) and an influential member of the IOC, says the entire bidding process and cost of the Games needs to be addressed when the governing body meets in Monaco next month. ""We'll have an extraordinary IOC session in December,"" Kasper told CNN, referring to the IOC meeting on December 8 and 9. ""We have to change a lot of things, the whole bidding process will be changed. ""The costs for organizers will change to a certain extent. The IOC will give them additional financial support."" Reflecting on Sochi's cost, Kasper admitted the 2014 Games had created a perception that hosting a major event was prohibitively expensive. ""Russia did what we did in our ski resorts in 150 years in five years, that of course costs money. ""And then they did it in the Russian way,  as big and as beautiful as possible. But more than 5$0 billion was just too much, there's no question."" There are currently just two cities vying to host the 2022 Games -- Beijing and Almaty, Kazakhstan. Earlier this month, Thomas Bach, president of the IOC, said there would be a proposal to ""change the philosophy of the bidding"" for future editions of the Games. Bach said the IOC wants to address the issue of reducing the cost of the Games. ""We see with the 2022 bids that we are living in a time of world crisis, financial crisis and that there are of course -- and that is legitimate -- more questions being asked by the people about the financing of the Games.""

"A man shot to death after running down and killing a Canadian soldier with his car was ""radicalized"" and classified as a ""potential important threat"" to the country, Canadian authorities said Tuesday at a press conference. Police arrested Martin Rouleau Couture, who reportedly converted to Islam about a year ago, last July and confiscated his passport, but lacked enough evidence to keep him in custody, said Martine Fontaine of the RCMP. ""When he was arrested, he was about to go to Turkey,"" Fontaine said. ""We stopped him as he was about to leave Canada for terrorist actions. He was questioned when he was arrested. We have not been able to determine any real threat at this time."" On Monday,  a man driving a car hit two members of the Canadian Armed Forces who were walking in a strip mall parking lot in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, said David Falls, spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. One soldier was killed . One soldier died and the other was injured. The suspect led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in the town, southeast of Montreal, Falls said. Police said the man exited the car before officers shot and killed him. Months ago, Couture's parents saw a change in their 25-year-old son's behavior and asked authorities for help, police said. ""He was identified as a potential important threat,"" Fontaine said. ""His Facebook profile showed that he was about to leave the country and that he was radicalized. We met him several times. We worked with the imam of the mosque he was going to."" Fontaine said police monitored his activities afterward. ""It is very difficult when a person prepares an act alone and uses a vehicle as a weapon,"" he said. Police said there are about 90 people in Canada classified as important threats. Bernard Lamotte of the RCMP said a unit formed in 2003 keeps an eye on potential terrorist activities. ""Each threat is taken seriously,"" he said. ""The threat that represents the Islamic State is taken very seriously."" 'Remain vigilant and suspicious' ""We are still investigating on the radicalization among Canadians,"" Fontaine said. ""We continue to promote a relationship of trust among Canadians so that they feel encouraged to share their concerns. ""We encourage families to remain vigilant and suspicious. The threat is real. We put everything in place to ensure national security."" The two soldiers were from the town's Saint-Jean Garrison. ""I want to express that the authorities can count on our full support in order to get to the bottom of this terrible act,"" Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Tuesday in a written statement. Neighbors told the CBC's French-language service that Couture converted to Islam about a year ago. The news comes as Canada gets more involved in the global fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Canada has pledged the use of fighter aircraft against the radical Sunni militant group taking over swaths of the Middle East.

"Investigators have been unable to find evidence of a second car in the accident that killed popular ""Fast & Furious"" actor Paul Walker on Saturday, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman said Monday. The probe now centers on the speed of the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, driven by Walker's racing team partner, the spokesman told CNN. Earlier, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Richard Cohen told CNN that authorities received a tip Sunday suggesting that another car was at the scene racing the  Porsche when it slammed into a light pole and burst into flames. But investigators have since ruled out the presence of a second vehicle and the theory that the Porsche was drag racing, a spokesman said Monday afternoon. Speed was a factor in the crash, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said.  A 45 mph speed limit sign was attached to the light pole knocked down by the Porsche. The car, which sold for $450,000 when new, is a notoriously difficult vehicle to handle, even for professional drivers, according to Autoweek magazine. A top driver called it ""scary,"" the magazine reported Sunday. It is powered by a V-10, 610-hp engine. Jim Torp, a car enthusiast who was at the charity event that Walker attended before the wreck, said Walker was smiling as he got into the Porsche minutes earlier. Torp thought he heard a blast in the distance before the car slammed into a light pole, he said.  ""What the first explosion was, I don't know if their tire blew up, because it sounded like a tire blew on the car,"" Torp told CNN Monday. Tire skid marks on the asphalt near the crash site, which indicate a car was doing doughnut spins, also are being looked at, Cohen said. It has not been concluded that they are related to the Walker wreck, he said. The street has a reputation for fast drivers, which spurred a crackdown by deputies two years ago, he said. Torp told CNN that he looked closely at the skid marks and concluded they were left by a car with smaller tires. Walker and Roger Rodas, who was believed to be driving, died in the wreck on Hercules Street, a wide business park road, in the community of Valencia inside the city of Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Hollywood, according to Walker's publicist and CNN affiliate KCAL. The autopsies on the remains taken from the wreckage are scheduled for Tuesday, according to Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County coroner's office. Investigators are still waiting for dental X-rays for each man to help in making the official identifications, Corral said. Walker and other stars who died during production . Stunned fans, a grieving father . Walker's family issued a written statement Monday expressing thanks for ""the outpouring of love and goodwill from his many fans and friends."" They asked that instead of flowers, people make donations to his charity Reach Out Worldwide. ""It's comforting for them to know that the son, brother, and father they love so much is equally adored, respected, and appreciated by so many,"" the statement said.  ""Paul founded the organization with the genuine desire to help others, and it's important to his family to keep his memory alive through ROWW."" No memorial service plans have been made, Walker's publicist said Monday. Stunned by Walker's untimely death, fans, friends and family remembered what he meant to them and what he did for them. His father remembered him as a loving son who wanted to take a hiatus from acting. A fellow actor said he had just celebrated Walker's 40th birthday. And a U.S. military veteran will forever be grateful for a touching act of generosity. Day and night since the crash, legions of fans gathered near the charred roadside where Walker died. Tyrese Gibson, Walker's co-star in several ""Fast & Furious"" movies, broke down as he laid a yellow flower at the site. ""My heart is hurting so bad no one can make me believe this is real,"" the singer and actor posted on Instagram. He also shared the duo's last text exchange. Paul Walker Sr. choked back tears as he remembered his son. ""His heart was so big,"" he told CNN affiliate KCAL. ""I was proud of him every day of his life."" The actor told his father that he wanted to take a hiatus from acting to spend more time with his 15-year-old daughter, Meadow, the elder Walker said. ""And then boom, he got another movie. He would say, 'I don't know what to do.'"" He said the actor's siblings are having an especially hard time grappling with the death. ""I'm just ... glad that every time I saw him, I told him I loved him,"" the father said. ""And he would say the same thing to me."" Remarkable generosity . Tales of Walker's philanthropy are not new. CNN confirmed one story from a decade ago when Walker noticed a young U.S. soldier shopping with his fiancee for a wedding ring in a Santa Barbara jewelry store. ""The groom was just back from duty in Iraq, and he was going to be deployed again soon and wanted to buy a wedding ring, but he said he just could not afford it,"" saleswoman Irene King told CNN. ""I don't think the soldier realized how expensive those rings are, about $10,000."" The couple apparently did not know who Walker was, King said. ""Walker called the manager over and said, 'Put that girl's ring on my tab,'"" she said. ""Walker left all his billing info, and it was a done deal. The couple was stunned. She was thrilled and could not believe someone did this."" King called it ""the most generous thing I have ever seen."" Future of franchise . At the time of his death, Walker was working on the seventh film of the franchise, due out next year. It's unclear how the film's production might proceed. When Oliver Reed died in the middle of the production of ""Gladiator,"" the rest of his scenes included a digitally produced image of his face on another actor's body, Tom O'Neil, editor of the show business website Goldderby.com, told CNN. In some cases, other actors have filled in for co-stars who have passed away. ""We don't know what they'll do here, or even if they'll just say, ""It may be tasteless to proceed at all because we can't be showing Paul Walker in a speeding car, defying death in a movie that ended up being the way he died,'"" O'Neil said. Questionable speed . The wreck took place about 3:30 p.m. Saturday just a few hundred yards from the shop owned by Rodas. Both men had attended a holiday toy drive for Walker's charity hosted at the shop that afternoon. Antonio Holmes told the Santa Clarita Valley Signal newspaper that he was at the charity event when Walker and Rodas left for a ride in the Porsche. ""We all heard from our location,"" Holmes told the Signal. ""It's a little difficult to know what it was. Someone called it in and said it was a vehicle fire. We all ran around and jumped in cars and grabbed fire extinguishers and immediately went to the vehicle. It was engulfed in flames. There was nothing. They were trapped. Employees, friends of the shop. We tried. We tried. We went through fire extinguishers."" 5 reasons the car Walker died in is different . A crowd of grieving fans, curious onlookers and media surrounded the crash site for hours, watching as investigators and firefighters worked to extract the bodies from the wreckage. Walker and Rodas had planned Saturday as a day to help survivors of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. The car shop website invited customers to a ""Charity Toy Drive & Automotive Social Gathering."" ""During the holiday season, many economically disadvantaged children from around the world are faced with the same dilemma year after year; the lacking of joy and cheer,"" the invitation read. ""Our goal here is to be able to provide aid to these less fortunate children in hopes of helping them grow up to become confident, responsible and productive young adults."" Walker's charity is described as ""a network of professionals with first responder skill-sets who augment local expertise when natural disasters strike in order to accelerate relief efforts."" Hollywood left stunned by Walker's death . Box office success . Walker's career began on the small screen, first with a commercial for Pampers when he was 2, and then with parts in shows such as ""Highway to Heaven"" and ""Touched by an Angel."" His first few movie roles were as supporting characters in teen flicks, most notably in ""Varsity Blues."" But his career really took off when he was cast as undercover cop Brian O'Conner infiltrating a street-racing gang in 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious."" The box-office success of the surprise summer hit yielded numerous sequels.  And along with Vin Diesel, Walker was one of the franchise stalwarts. The six ""Fast & Furious"" films sold a total of $2.6 billion in tickets worldwide, according to BoxOfficeMojo. Walker wasn't just a car enthusiast on the silver screen; off screen, the actor competed in the Redline Time Attack racing series. On his verified Twitter account, Walker described himself as an ""outdoorsman, ocean addict, adrenaline junkie ... and I do some acting on the side."" Walker also is the star of ""Hours,"" an independent film scheduled to be released December 13 about a father struggling to keep his newborn infant alive in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.

"When vulnerable Senate Democrats fled President Barack Obama this year, they left on the table a national midterm message that voters say is often the top issue for them: Their wallets. The national unemployment rate is at its lowest since 2008 and the stock market continues to break record highs -- not universal indicators of widespread wealth, but prominent signals that the economy is recovering from the Great Recession. And at a much more granular level, gas prices have hit their lowest level in nearly four years, the national average creeping below $3 a gallon and putting more money back into the pockets of nearly every voter with a car. But you don't see vulnerable Democrats trumpeting those economic gains in ads this fall as they try to keep Senate seats blue. Instead, vulnerable candidates have focused on women's issues (see Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado) and have spent most of their time trying to deflect attacks and set themselves apart from Washington and Obama. The lack of messaging on the improved economy is also because economic indicators don't always translate into voters' minds, Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said. ""People don't feel the recovery and they are still worried about the economy,"" Sabato said. ""A candidate who in essence says you haven't had it so good -- even if backed up by the facts -- seems out of touch."" Economic gains are also a hard sell for the president's party in a midterm election, he added. And in North Carolina while gas prices have even fallen below the national average, Sen. Kay Hagan is an example of vulnerable Democrats who have avoided talking up economic gains. Ben Ray, spokesman for the coordinated Democratic effort in North Carolina, said positive economic news has largely stayed off the campaign trail because ""a lot of Americans are still having a tough time."" ""I'm sure everyone appreciates being able to gas up their car for a little bit less this month, but there's still a lot of work that remains to be done on the economy,"" Ray said. But when there's bad news at the pump, it's almost always a campaign issue. Republicans wasted no time blaming Obama and Democrats when gas prices shot up to nearly $4 a gallon in 2011. ""If they were at a four year high I think you'd be hearing a lot more about them,"" Thomas Holbrook, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, said. ""I think Democrats have had a hard time wanting to run on these positive national indicators in part because the President is still relatively unpopular and if they try to nationalize the election in some way by focusing on these positive indicators, basically they would just be reminding people that the election is about Obama."" And that's exactly what Republicans did this cycle: turn the election into a mandate on Obama's presidency and weaving a narrative of what they see as the Obama administration incompetency. And that crisis of confidence has kept Democrats from touting the lowest unemployment rate in six years as well as low interest rates, increased consumer spending and GDP growth that have economists feeling glib. And from ISIS to Ebola, other issues have also overshadowed Democrats' attempts to keep on their key issue points of raising the minimum wage and fighting for equal pay. ""Ebola has sucked the oxygen out of the room,"" said Steven Roberts, a former New York Times White House correspondent and the Shapiro Professor of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University said. ""Other noise, other stories just dominated the news and made it difficult for any Democrat, including the President, to break through."" And the crises helped compound the Republican argument that the country is headed on the wrong track -- even a dangerous one -- and that the Obama administration and Democrats are responsible. Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, according to the latest NBC News/Marist poll. ""[Ebola and ISIS] have added a vague sense of menace, a vague sense of anxiety and unease,"" Roberts said. ""They add to a sense that things are out of control. That this administration is reacting -- following not leading."" And while Obama has consistently reminded the public that his ""policies are on the ballot"" -- chagrining Democratic operatives -- it seems his economic policies haven't made the cut.","Despite good economic news and record-low gas prices, Democrats have still struggled this cycle .
An unpopular president has kept Democrats from talking up economic gains .

"Sorry, ""bae."" The noun -- a "" term of endearment for one's romantic partner"" -- was shown no love by Oxford Dictionaries, which instead selected ""vape"" as the 2014 word of the year. ""Vape"" can be used as either a noun meaning ""an electronic cigarette or similar device"" or a verb in which one would ""inhale and exhale the vapour produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device."" According to a press release from Oxford, research showed the use of the word ""vape"" more than doubled in 2014 over the previous year. Couple that with the growth of electronic cigarettes into a multimillion dollar industry and the Oxford editors decided that the word's time had come. ""A gap emerged in the lexicon, as a word was needed to describe this activity, and distinguish it from 'smoking','"" the Oxford press release says. ""The word vape arose to fill this gap, and it has proliferated along with the habit."" Oxford's lexicographers grapple every year with a list of potential winners. Last year, ""selfie"" -- ""a photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website"" -- trumped ""bitcoin"" and ""twerk"" to take the honor. In addition to ""vape"" and ""bae,"" this year's shortlist included: . budtender, noun: . A person whose job is to serve customers in a cannabis dispensary or shop . contactless, adjective: . Relating to or involving technologies that allow a smart card, mobile phone etc. to contact wirelessly to an electronic reader, typically in order to make a payment . indyref, noun: .

"There has been a lot of debate about Florida's ""stand your ground"" law in recent days.  From my perspective, the George Zimmerman and Michael Dunn cases were not ""stand your ground"" cases, although I know reasonable people disagree about my stance on this. What I think most people can agree on is that the ""stand your ground"" law is confusing.  I know because I've tried to explain it a hundred times. And here is my 101st attempt, this time in the context of the hung jury on the murder charge in the Dunn trial. When you hear ""stand your ground,"" think ""no duty to retreat.""  For centuries, traditional self-defense implied a duty to retreat, meaning when someone finds himself in a threatening situation, he has a duty to exhaust all viable options to retreat before resorting to deadly force. The problem with the duty to retreat is that, in the cold light of day, jurors may have a better perspective on a person's options to retreat than the person had during his life-threatening encounter. Because of concern over this Monday morning quarterbacking -- and with the thought that we were sending people to jail who were otherwise justified in using deadly force -- legislatures in many states modified their justifiable use of force laws to say that people who have a reasonable fear of imminent great bodily harm or death very affirmatively DO NOT have a duty to retreat. In other words, they can ""stand their ground"" and meet force with force, including deadly force.  ""Stand your ground"" refers specifically to the removal of the duty to retreat. In a self-defense scenario where imminent harm is so immediate that retreat is not possible, there is no ""duty to retreat"" to waive, and therefore ""stand your ground"" does not apply. According to evidence presented at his trial, at which I represented him, George Zimmerman was on the ground, being beaten, when he pulled the trigger; he had no way to retreat, and it was not ""stand your ground."" Michael Dunn, if we are to believe his story, thought Jordan Davis had a shotgun; there is no retreating from a shotgun at short range, and therefore it was, arguably, not ""stand your ground."" If we repealed ""stand your ground"" laws tomorrow -- if we reinstated the duty to retreat -- George Zimmerman still gets an acquittal, and the Dunn jury still hangs. The underlying concern with the statute is that those who are aware of it may be emboldened by its protection, and place themselves in, or remain in, a circumstance that increases the likelihood of using force. A concern with the national focus on these two recent cases is that the concept of ""stand your ground"" has been misperceived by so many that there are now those who believe use of deadly force is more justified than it is, and there are those who believe that it is intentionally used to kill minorities. Even if unintended when enacted, ""stand your ground"" suffers from enormous misunderstanding and, consequently, mistrust. People who think I'm wrong and who argue that Zimmerman and Dunn are, in fact, ""stand your ground"" cases often point out that the ""stand your ground"" language from the statute appears in the jury instructions.  It does.  There's a lot of language from Florida's justifiable use of force statute that shows up in the jury instructions, and in any given self-defense case, much of it doesn't apply to the details presented in court.  I think this is why juries -- and not just Florida juries -- find deliberating self-defense cases so challenging. There is a simple solution: I think we should remove the instructions about ""no duty to retreat"" in any self-defense case where the facts don't support it. After defending the Zimmerman case, and after providing in-depth commentary on the Dunn trial, I've discovered that when people say they have a problem with the ""stand your ground"" law, it's not really the ""no duty to retreat"" aspect of our self-defense laws that gets them upset. What causes people to be upset is the concept of ""reasonable fear"" and how subjective it is. In effect, it is possible for someone to believe they are justified in killing another human being -- that they have reasonable fear -- even if that fear turns out to be unwarranted in the cold light of review. The standard is, and has to be this: Was that fear reasonable under the circumstances? This has been the standard for determining self-defense for centuries, and it has nothing to do with ""stand your ground."" Repealing the ""stand your ground"" provision won't change the fact that sometimes self-defense homicides will be ruled justified based upon a technically unwarranted, but otherwise reasonable, fear. The concerns that are voiced in this regard are more properly focused not on a law, (be it ""stand your ground"" or simple self-defense), but on the system that harbors subtle but undeniable biases toward certain demographics. Where the discussion about the strange nuances of our self-defense laws becomes most disturbing is when you introduce race into the equation. I think it is sufficiently established as a sociological fact that black men -- especially young black men -- are regarded by many people, of all races, as more suspicious and more threatening than men and women of other races.  It's heartbreaking to think this is true, but it's folly to deny it.  If young black men are regarded, in general, as more threatening, then some people may be more likely to manifest that fear -- however unwarranted in the individual case it may be -- and act on that fear, sometimes with deadly force. When this element is added, the job of the jury includes trying to wade through whether these subtle biases (or justifications) for fear are present, and what weight to give them. Now, we are asking our juries to see deep into the heart of the citizen accused -- maybe too deep. Is it fear, or disdain? And how much of each? It's outrageous that these tragedies occur, but repealing ""stand your ground"" laws will not stop them.  The problem is not in our legislation, it's in our collective hearts. We have a system that is still, without question, the best in the world, but it's far from perfect. It still, unfortunately, carries with it the inertia of more overt racial inequities from our recent past. As an example, while there are studies that support that the immunity afforded by ""stand your ground"" can produce racially disparate results, I contend the statute itself is race-neutral, and it is the inequitable application that evidences an inherent bias of the system. But our self-defense laws are not the only laws applied with racial inequity. Look at the incarceration statistics in the United States: Black men are disproportionately represented by an extraordinarily wide margin for virtually every type of crime,  from petty theft to drug charges to murder.  Repealing laws against these crimes won't fix the problem of racial inequity in our justice system, just as repealing the ""stand your ground"" provisions will not either. Rather, the solutions lie in a more system-wide or society-wide approach. We have a success in this area already. The recent changes to federal sentencing statutes to address the strong negative effect on blacks charged with certain crack cocaine charges shows that we can both acknowledge these disparities in application and change them. In addition, the systemic biases are not simple to explain. While it is admitted that there is bias in the system, this does not fully explain the numbers. The black community must look not only to the system, but also to itself for answers to how and why young black males find themselves in the system in wildly disproportionate numbers. There is no easy or quick solution. I am, however, encouraged for this reason: We, as a nation, have focused more energy, and have begun more discussion on these issues than I have ever witnessed.  At least not since the days of my childhood, when I was too young to offer a voice to the conversation about civil rights, a conversation started by men I respected, men who, unfortunately, died too young.  It takes courage, it turns out, to talk about race. I believe that we can fix the problem of racial inequity in our justice system, but first we have to admit that the problem exists, and then we have to have the courage to engage in an open, honest and thoughtful conversation about the true state of race relations in America.","Mark O'Mara: ""Stand your ground"" eliminates duty to retreat from a threatening situation .

"Accused of being a spy in the United States, Fernando Gonzalez can expect a hero's welcome when he returns to Cuba. The Cuban intelligence agent was released from a U.S. federal prison Thursday after serving 15 years for failing to register as a foreign agent and possessing forged documents. Gonzalez will be the second member of the ""Cuban Five"" to be released from prison. Cuban officials said they expected that he would return to the island after being transferred to the custody of immigration officials for deportation proceedings, which could take several days. The five were part of a network of agents in South Florida that the Cuban government said was gathering intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks against Cuba. U.S. federal prosecutors called the network a dangerous undercover spy cell. One of the exile groups that the intelligence agents targeted was Brothers to the Rescue, which searched for Cuban rafters on the Straits of Florida from small airplanes. In 1996, four members of Brothers to the Rescue were killed after they were shot down by Cuban fighter jets as the group's planes headed toward the island to drop anti-government leaflets. Federal prosecutors argued that information supplied by some of the ""Cuban Five"" agents assisted in the downing of the planes. Another seven agents cooperated with prosecutors. The five agents were convicted in 2001 and have since been the focus of an international campaign by the Cuban government to free them. Cuban officials have said they wish to discuss the case of the Cuban agents and that of jailed U.S. State Department contractor Alan Gross, who was sentenced in 2011 to 15 years in prison after being convicted of importing banned communications equipment to Cuba. But U.S. officials have rejected the idea of a swap, saying Gross did not engage in any intelligence-gathering in Cuba. Last year, ""Cuban Five"" member Rene Gonzalez returned to Cuba after completing his prison sentence. He has been treated as a hero by Cuba's state media and has led the media campaign to free the other intelligence agents. ""Of course, he will need a need to rest,"" Rene Gonzalez said last month of his fellow agent's impending release. ""Then I hope he will take up the fight for our three brothers.""","Fernando Gonzalez is a member of the network of Cuban agents .

"(CNN)ISIS has apparently taken a heavy hit over the past several days. The bodies of at least 70 fighters for the terror group have been dropped off over four days at a hospital in the Syrian town of Tal Abyad, a Syrian opposition group told CNN. Tal Abyad is on the Turkish border and about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Raqqa. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria took control of Raqqa last year. ISIS uses the once-liberal city as a kind of headquarters where it applies its hardline interpretation of Islamic law, terrorizing the population. Kurdish and Iraqi forces have been battling ISIS on the ground. With the help of airstrikes from an international coalition led by the United States, the foot soldiers are now focused on pushing ISIS back from its relentless attempt to take Kobani, a Kurdish town on the Syrian-Turkish border. It's unclear who dropped the bodies of the ISIS fighters off at the hospital, but it was likely other fighters from the militant group, because they control Tal Abyad. Sources who work in local medicine confirmed the events to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group that promotes ending the longstanding regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The group is based in London and first formed when violence broke out in Syria in 2011, much of it geared toward ousting al-Assad. Kobani now is the scene of an unrelenting battle. On Sunday, the brief moments of calm were punctuated by sounds of firing from both sides. ISIS has shelled the city at least 16 times, sources say, while coalition planes fly low overhead. The strategy against ISIS is working, said U.S. Central Command Gen. Lloyd Austin on Friday. He also said that Kobani could fall. U.S. warplanes struck only twice Friday and Saturday in the city, Central Command said, both times targeting ISIS fighting positions. That's far fewer strikes than days before. U.S. jets flew at least 14 missions near Kobani on Thursday and Friday, the military reported. It will take ""strategic patience"" to beat ISIS, Austin said.

"(CNN) Russia plans to send long-range bombers to the Gulf of Mexico in what appears to be Moscow's latest provocative maneuver in its increasingly frosty relations with the West. Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said Wednesday that ""we have to maintain (Russia's) military presence in the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific, as well as the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico"" -- including sending bombers ""as part of the drills."" It's an argument U.S. officials don't seem to be buying. ""We do not see the security environment as warranting such provocative and potentially destabilizing activity,"" a senior Obama administration official said Thursday. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki offered a similar response. ""We don't think there is a current situation in the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific or the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico that warrants additional flights in out-of-area territory,"" she told reporters. That's not all. Shoigu said that Russia will also boost its security in Crimea, the region it annexed from Ukraine earlier this year. ""In many respects, this is connected with the situation in Ukraine, with fomentation of anti-Russian moods on the part of NATO and reinforcement of foreign military presence next to our border,"" he said. The ceasefire in volatile eastern Ukraine is crumbling, with U.S. and allied officials accusing Moscow of sending fresh troops, tanks and other military equipment across the border in recent days -- something that Russian officials have strongly denied. But what does that have to do with the Gulf of Mexico, some 6,000 miles away? The Russians are clearly trying to make a point with their plan to send bombers toward the Gulf of Mexico, said Jeffrey Mankoff, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The message, he said, is ""connected to the tensions over Ukraine that have also affected the broader relationship."" ""It's kind of a reciprocity,"" Mankoff told CNN. ""They see us trying to muscle in on what they see as their sphere of influence. (Russia is likely thinking), 'If they can do it to us, we can do it them.'"" Shoigu also said Russia will expand its presence in the Arctic region, which could affect Alaska and northern Canada. This includes full radar coverage of that region by year's end, leaving Russia ready ""to meet unwanted guests"" both from the north and east by 2015, Shoigu said, according to a state-run TASS news agency report. That means Russia's new drills will fly near most of America's coastline, said Barry Pavel, an international security expert at the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank. ""We're talking about ringing the United States, with the exception of the Canadian border, where the Russian bombers don't need to go,"" Pavel said. It's not as though the United States doesn't have its own warplanes in places like Japan and Turkey, not to mention NATO air operations assisting Albania, Slovenia and Baltic nations. And Mankoff, who previously served as a U.S. State Department adviser on U.S.-Russia relations, notes that the U.S. military also sometimes flies not far from Russia -- also to send a message, as well as to test things like response times. ""It's not necessarily anything to be overly alarmed about as long as the patrols stay in international airspace,"" he said. And, as recently as June, U.S. fighter jets have intercepted Russian long-range bombers off Alaska and California. Those four Russian planes flew within an area 200 miles from the North American coast. Two peeled off and headed west, while the other two flew south and were intercepted by U.S. F-15s within 50 miles of the California coast. Capt. Jeff Davis, a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said at the time that this was the first time U.S. jets intercepted Russian military aircraft off California in about two years. But such incidents generally are not uncommon, with Davis estimating that Russian flights fly into the so-called air defense zone -- the area 200 miles from the U.S. coast but not within the 13.8 miles that international law would define as U.S. territory -- 10 times a year. Yet there are signs that Russia has stepped up its military provocations as of late, some of which the European Leadership Network documented earlier this week. Russian provocations on the rise: Is it a new Cold War? Last month, the Swedish military searched for a mystery underwater vessel after intercepting an emergency radio call in Russian and getting reports about a foreign vessel being spotted in the waters near Stockholm. Though no vessel was found, it was the largest submarine hunt in Swedish waters since the end of the Cold War. In September, the United States intercepted six Russian planes, including fighter jets and tankers, in airspace near Alaska, officials said. The same month, an Estonian official was abducted from a border post, taken to Moscow and accused of espionage, sparking dueling claims between the two nations. The uptick in incidents have raised concerns about safety -- and about military and geopolitical issues, Pavel said. ""Russia (is) flexing its military muscle, identifying the United States and NATO as the enemy. That feeling is not reciprocated, but we have a Russia that is starting to throw its military weight around, and in some ways, looking for provocations,"" he said. ""I think this could be very dangerous, and create a crisis, where one didn't need to exist."" And not only have the encounters escalated, so have the risks. In March, a covert Russian military plane nearly collided with a Swedish passenger aircraft carrying 132 people. The ""real danger"" of new Russian flights near the American coast is that an accident actually happens or things ""get a little bit out of hand."" Russian bombers fly near California . ""If there's a collision or if somebody overreacted,"" Mankoff said, that could inflame U.S.-Russia tensions even further. He recalled a 2001 incident, in which a U.S. spy plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet before making an emergency landing inside China. That episode shook up relations between Beijing and Washington. During the Cold War, Soviet warplanes were more frequent in areas around the United States. But Mankoff noted that changed with the fall of the Soviet Union, in part because of cost. Things slowly changed as Russia took shape, long before Ukraine became an issue. And there's also interest in Moscow in having close ties with its allies in the Americas, such as Venezuela. ""When I was in government four or five years ago, when there was definitely concern that this was becoming more frequent even then,"" Mankoff said of about Russian military provocations. ""This isn't happening out of the blue."" Still, there's no doubt that the Ukraine crisis is the driving wedge in U.S.-Russia relations at this point. A ceasefire deal reached in September has seemingly crumbled, with intensified fighting of late between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels. Those rebels have been joined by Russian troops, tanks, artillery and air defense systems that have recently crossed the border, according to U.S. Gen. Phillip Breedlove, NATO's commander for Europe. 'Unusual' Russian flights concern NATO . On Thursday, Ukrainian defense spokesman Andriy Lysenko said there's been ""constant movement of Russian military equipment with (separatist) marks to the dividing line."" Yet Russia, as it's done time and again, is knocking down any claims that it has troops inside Ukrainian territory. ""I am telling you very frankly and officially as well: There are no military forces or any military movement across the border, and moreover there is no presence of our troops in the territory of (southeast) Ukraine,"" foreign ministry spokesman Alexander Lukhashevich said. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Jennifer Rizzo, Kevin Liptak, Brian Todd, Dugald McConnell and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","U.S. official: Plan is ""provocative and potentially destabilizing""

"(CNN)It's a side of Iran the rest of the world doesn't normally get to see -- the kaleidoscopically brilliant interiors of the country's intricately designed mosques. With beautiful mosaics and stained glass framed by powerful architecture, the buildings are astounding. Their fine detail has been captured in a series of breathtaking photographs by Mohammad Reza Domiri Ganji, a 24-year-old physics student from Babol, a city in Iran's northern Mazandaran province. What's equally incredible is that Ganji's skills behind the lens are largely self-taught from watching internet tutorials. Add to that the difficulties of actually taking high quality photos in mosques, where using equipment such as tripods is heavily restricted. Ganji says his project to document mosque interiors and other Iranian landmarks began in 2008 after he was inspired by images taken inside Egypt's pyramids. Prohibited equipment . ""The photos had aesthetically documented those historical sites and made me highly amazed and inspired,"" he tells CNN. ""I wondered if I could take similar pictures of historical sites, and so through my trips all around Iran, I began to find old mosques suitable for taking interior pictures."" It wasn't an easy task. While tourists are permitted to take photos, using tripods and the professional equipment Ganji needed to capture his perfectly symmetrical shots in low light is usually forbidden. ""Most of the time I had to take care of lots of paperwork, spending several days to get official permission,"" he says. ""This process is even harder than it sounds, and I've had several unsuccessful efforts."" Ganji uses fisheye and other wide angle lenses and panoramic tripods to create his photos, sometimes digitally stitching several images to create composites. Often, his work involves an early start. Lack of appreciation . ""I prefer mornings, as the light is more appropriate and there are fewer people around,"" he says. ""In the afternoon, these places are usually crowded, and in the evenings, some of them are closed for praying rituals."" Ganji says he prefers capturing the interiors of mosques with symmetry, interior columns, good lighting and beautiful mosaics. ""I also like buildings that are well known, popular and important. Although there are many people and tourists taking pictures of those places, and there are numerous images on the internet, I enjoy showing them in my own way."" While his work has begun to attract international attention, Ganji says it's yet to stir significant interest in Iran. ""I've even sent it to national festivals. Not only was my work not been seen or selected, but I didn't even receive any appreciation or support from organizations or government. ""In spite of that, I'm sincerely happy that my work is now being seen worldwide and that I've been able to show Iran to others through my art."" Ganji says he's hoping to augment his image series by visiting more historic sites in Iran and also hopes to travel to photograph Jewish and Christian holy sites.","Mohammad Reza Domiri Ganji is a physics student from Iran who takes photos inside mosques .

"""Heroes"" lives: NBC helped kickstart the superhero TV trend in 2006 with ""Heroes,"" an X-Men-ish action-drama about a group of people with superhuman powers. Now the network is bringing back the show for a 13-episode event series to air in 2015. Original series creator Tim Kring is on board to run the show. Titled ""Heroes Reborn,"" the project is billed as a stand-alone story; the characters have not yet been announced. ""The enormous impact 'Heroes' had on the television landscape when it first launched in 2006 was eye-opening,"" said NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke. ""Shows with that kind of resonance don't come around often and we thought it was time for another installment. We're thrilled that visionary creator Tim Kring was as excited about jumping back into this show as we were and we look forward to all the new textures and layers Tim plans to add to his original concept. Until we get closer to air in 2015, the show will be appropriately shrouded in secrecy, but we won't rule out the possibility of some of the show's original cast members popping back in."" The news seems to echo Fox rebooting its action franchise ""24"" for a limited series to launch this May, though NBC has long been fond of recycling prior TV hits — there have been short-lived new version of ""Bionic Woman,"" ""American Gladiators,"" ""Knight Rider,"" and the network had also developed (but not aired) new editions of ""Wonder Woman"" and ""Murder She Wrote."" Reviving ""Heroes,"" which was canceled four years ago, might be met with some mixed feelings by the show's fans, however. The show got off to a strong start in both ratings and acclaim (averaging 14.5 million viewers its first season), then was widely considered to have creatively collapsed into a confused muddle and became a serialized TV cautionary tale. But with broadcast drama TV ratings on the decline, networks are increasingly turning to event series to grab attention, and brands that were cancelled years ago now seem like potential hits even if they only deliver a large percentage of their previous audience. Plus, ""Heroes"" performed well on DVD, having sold more than 10 million units. ""Heroes"" might be coming back onto a field with plenty of competition, depending on how many current superhero projects get renewed or greenlit. There's The CW's Arrow, its spinoff The Flash, Fox's Batman prequel in the pipeline Gotham and ABC's Marvel's Agents of SHIELD. What do you think of Heroes coming back?

"Voters in Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C. have voted to approve sweeping pro-marijuana legalization, according to a CNN projections. The three wins have pro-legalization activists enthused and many are already looking towards 2016, when ballot initiatives in states such as California, Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada and Arizona are likely to be put to voters. In Oregon, the law legalizes personal possession, manufacture and sale of marijuana for people 21 years of age and older. Mimicking similar plans in Washington State and Colorado, the Oregon law will also create a commercial regulatory system for the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. Alaska's law is similar to Oregon and would tax and regulate the production, sale and use of marijuana, making the use legal for people over 21 years old . Washington, D.C.'s proposal, while scaled back compared to the others, allows for a person over 21 years old to posses up to two ounces of marijuana for personal use and grow up to six cannabis plants in their home. It also allows people to transfer up to one ounce of marijuana to another person, but not sell it. The issue is not fully resolved for the District of Columbia, however. Because of its unique status as a district, not a state, Congress has the authority to overrule D.C. laws and some lawmakers have signaled that they would likely work to overrule the popular vote. Pro-marijuana activists heralded the victories as ""huge"" on Tuesday. 'I like weed, and I'm a good person': Pot smokers fight stereotypes . ""It's always an uphill battle to win a marijuana legalization initiative in a year like this, when young people are so much less likely to vote, which makes today's victory all the sweeter,"" said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance said about Oregon. ""The pace of reform is accelerating, other states are sure to follow, and even Congress is poised to wake from its slumber."" Wins in Washington, D.C. also have activists hoping for federal recognition. ""With marijuana legal in the federal government's backyard,"" said Tom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority, ""it's going to be increasingly difficult for national politicians to continue ignoring the growing majority of voters who want to end prohibition."" Not all news was positive, however, for marijuana activists on Tuesday, however. Voters in Florida gave the thumbs down to medical marijuana in the the Sunshine State earlier in the night, according to a CNN projection. The measure - which is one of many on ballots in 2014 - would have legalized the use of medical marijuana in Florida and would have tasked the state's Department of Health with regulating it. Because the measure would have altered Florida's constitution, supporters needed 60% for the question to pass. Only 57% of voters voted yes, compared to 43% who voted no with 91% of vote reporting. Marijuana has been a surging issue of late. In 2013, according to Gallup, more Americans supported legalization than those who opposed it. Just 14 years earlier, those who opposed it had over a 2-to-1 advantage. A 2014 Pew Research poll found that 54% of Americans supported making marijuana legal. Ever since voters in Colorado and Washington allowed the sale of legalized marijuana in 2014 (after voters decided to legalize years before), the push for more marijuana legalization has become a popular nationwide effort. The laws in Oregon and Alaska are similar to what Colorado and Washington State passed and would allow recreational sale and taxation of the drug. Both votes are expected to be close, with polls mixed on the results.","Voters in Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C. approved marijuana legalization on Tuesday .

"U.S. President Obama opened his appearance at the G20 summit of world leaders in Australia with a speech that had to make Beijing think. He also took a shot at Russian President Vladimir Putin in his speech and later, after a Sunday meeting, Obama and the leaders of Japan and Australia made a point of criticizing Russia's annexation of Crimea and called for the prosecution of those responsible for the downing of Flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine. The United States is a big part of the power balance in Asia and plans to throw more of its weight onto the scale, the president told a crowd at the University of Queensland in Brisbane on Saturday. ""We will continue to deepen our engagement using every element of American power -- diplomacy, military, economic, development, the power of our values and ideals,"" he said. And the United States will band together with nations in the region. It will work toward giving them more heft -- so that big nations do not ""bully the small,"" Obama said. That has been a common phrase used in reference to territorial disputes between China and other southeast Asian nations. China's relations with Vietnam and the Philippines have soured over maritime tensions. But China's bitterest dispute has been with Japan. Military boats and planes have hummed around small, uninhabited islands that both countries lay claim to, heating up rhetoric and defense posturing between Tokyo and Beijing. In many of the disputes, access to underwater oil has been at stake. Calling out China . ASEAN stands for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and it is made up of 10 smaller Southeast Asian nations, most of them developing economies. China, Japan and South Korea are not members. Obama singled out China, saying it would have to play by the same rules as its neighbors. ""We'll support ASEAN's effort to reach a code of conduct with China that reinforces international law in the South China Sea,"" he said. And the United States will reinforce its diplomacy with a balance of military might. ""By the end this decade, a majority of our navy and air force fleets will be based out of the Pacific, because the United States is and always will be a Pacific power,"" Obama said. Washington plans to share oceangoing prowess with other countries, to find common ground in military interests with Vietnam and beef up its maritime capabilities. And Obama would like to see another large nation in the region step up as well. ""We support a greater role in the Asia-Pacific for India, which is the world's largest democracy,"" he said. ""Together, we can improve maritime security, upholding the freedom of navigation, and encouraging territorial disputes are resolved peacefully."" He also pledged to help make partners economically competitive and avoid development laden with pollution. The president repeated that the United States was contributing $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund to help poorer nations meet climate goals. He also had a message for China. ""The United States welcomes the continued rise of a China that is peaceful and prosperous and stable and that plays a responsible role in world affairs,"" he said. Criticizing Russia . The metaphor of big nations bullying the small has also been applied to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its involvement in the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. As a result, the Group of Eight nations booted Russia from its ranks. Putin received a frosty reception when he touched down for the Group of Twenty summit, though he did interact with several Western leaders on the event's first full day. That includes meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, according to the Kremlin. This comes against the backdrop of Moscow's actions in Ukraine and elsewhere, responding to international criticism and sanctions not by backing down but instead by threatening to flex its military might. Case in point: Russia Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu's announcement Wednesday that his country plans to send long-range bombers to the Gulf of Mexico. That has raised Washington's hackles, which says no present security concerns warrant such maneuvers. Obama, who focused almost solely on Asia, also threw out a new line of criticism to Moscow in his speech, saying the United States was leading the efforts ""opposing Russia's aggression against Ukraine, which is a threat to the world, which we saw in the appalling shoot-down of MH17."" The joint press release issued Sunday after the Australia-Japan-United States Trilateral Leaders also took note of the Crimean annexation and MH17. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has taken Putin to task over the downing of the plane over Ukraine's pro-Russian breakaway region bordering on Russia, saying Moscow owns some of the responsibility. In the leadup to the G20, Moscow deployed four naval warships near Australia, semiofficial Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. One of the ships, the Varyag, was once named ""Red Ukraine."" The agency said it was not uncommon for Russian warships to accompany the country's leaders on foreign trips.","Obama and leaders of Japan, Australia criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin .

"The ""Weekend of Resistance"" protests have ended, the prosecutor didn't step aside and the world awaits word from a grand jury determining whether charges should be brought against a white police officer who fatally shot unarmed African-American teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Protesters demanded criminal charges against Officer Darren Wilson, who some witnesses said shot and killed Brown while he was surrendering with his hands up. But police said Wilson shot Brown after the 18-year-old attacked him and tried to take his service gun in August. Demonstrators also sought for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch to recuse himself from overseeing the case because, they allege, he can't be impartial after his police officer father was killed on the job by a black man in 1964. McCulloch rejected those demands. But he said he will not try the case if there is an indictment.  Meanwhile, two assistant prosecuting attorneys have been assigned to the case. Here are key five things you'll want to know as the legal system moves forward: . 1. What kinds of charges are the grand jury considering? It's not just one potential crime. The grand jury is deciding whether Wilson should be charged with any one of several possible crimes, including: first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter, said Ed Magee, spokesman for the prosecuting attorney's office. The grand jury can issue an indictment on any of those four charges, and it also has the option of adding a charge of armed criminal action, authorities said. At the same time, the grand jury will receive the Missouri statutes for self-defense and the police use of deadly force. 2. How many votes are needed on a grand jury to issue an indictment? There are 12 members on the Missouri grand jury (some other states have different numbers), and nine of the 12 must vote yes to indict someone. The grand jury proceedings are conducted in secret. The same goes for the grand jurors' race or ethnicity. 3. Does the grand jury have a deadline? Yes, the grand jury has until January 7 to make its decision. But the prosecutor's office says there could be a decision by mid-November. 4. How often does it meet? Normally a grand jury in St. Louis County meets every Wednesday. But the grand jury has been extended for the Brown case so jurors have extra time to hear from a number of witnesses and to focus solely on this case. In this scenario, the panel is allowed to meet on days when all 12 jurors can get together. Once agreed upon, the schedule is given to the prosecuting attorney's office. 5. Has the grand jury received all the evidence yet? No, according to the prosecutor's office. They have not heard from all the witnesses. Some witnesses are still reluctant to cooperate, the prosecutor's office said. Ultimately, witnesses can be compelled to appear to the grand jury by subpoena. In past statements, McCulloch has promised a fair and thorough investigation. ""We will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury. Every statement that a witness made, every witness, every photograph, every piece of physical evidence. Absolutely nothing will be left out so the grand jury is making their decision based upon absolutely everything and we'll go from there,"" McCulloch told KTRS in August.","The grand jury in Missouri is looking at several potential crimes, not just one .
The grand jury has been given permission to set its own schedule .
Grand jurors have until January to make a decision ."
"Venezuela's President severed diplomatic relations with Panama Wednesday, accusing the Central American nation of being a ""lackey"" for the United States in a conspiracy plot against his government. ""There are maneuvers by the U.S. government plotting with a lackey government that has a right-wing president who is leaving in the next few months, who is not worthy of his people, who has been working actively against Venezuela,"" President Nicolas Maduro said in televised remarks. He accused Panama of pushing for regional organizations to intervene in Venezuela. As a result, Maduro said he was cutting off diplomatic and political ties and freezing trade relations with Panama's current government ""in defense of the homeland's sovereignty."" Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli said in a Twitter post that he was surprised by Venezuela's decision. ""Panama only longs for its brother country to find peace and strengthen its democracy,"" he said. The latest bout of diplomatic wrangling comes after weeks of anti-government protests in Venezuela, which are the biggest threat Maduro has faced since his election last year. In a statement late Wednesday, Panama's government denied Maduro's accusations and said it had tried to encourage action by the Organization of American States to help promote dialogue, democracy and human rights in Venezuela. ""We reject as unacceptable the insults uttered by President Nicolas Maduro against our country and its highest authority. The foul language used is inappropriate for the president of a brother country,"" the statement said. Last month Maduro expelled three U.S. diplomats form Venezuela, accusing them of conspiring against his government. The United States expelled three Venezuelan diplomats last week in retaliation. The State Department has repeatedly denied Venezuela's accusations that it's funding opposition efforts to topple Maduro's government or involved in other conspiracy plots. ""Venezuela, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the United States, the government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people,"" U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters last month.","Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro cuts diplomatic, political ties with Panama .

"A food-delivery website is parting ways with Facebook in a snarky ""breakup"" letter. And Facebook, like spurned lovers through the ages, is telling the cheeky startup not to let the door hit it on the way out. Eat24, based in San Bruno, California, lets users enter their address to find restaurants that will deliver to them. They then select a restaurant and order online. The site has more than 70,000 ""likes"" on Facebook. But last week, it announced it just wasn't that into the social media giant anymore. ""Dear Facebook, Hey. It's Eat24. Look, we need to talk,"" read a post on the Eat24 blog. ""This isn't easy to say since we've been together so long, but we need to break up. We'd love to say 'It's not you, it's us' but it's totally you. Not to be rude, but you aren't the smart, funny social network we fell in love with several years back. You've changed. A lot."" The problem? Eat24 says Facebook's algorithm that decides which posts users see in their feeds is unfair and rewards page owners who pay to have their posts promoted. ""It makes us think all you care about is money,"" the letter reads. ""Why should we have to wade through a dozen promoted posts about how to lose belly fat (are you trying to tell us something?) and requests for Candy Crush (NO! Just no.) and suggesting we like our arch nemesis' page (seriously, WTF) before we can finally find the perfect Doge meme? It really seems like you've lost your way and have become nothing more than an ad platform."" The letter says Eat24 will delete its page at midnight Monday. In an uncharacteristically direct response, Brandon McCormick, Facebook's communications director, replied to the post in which the company shared the letter -- perhaps ironically -- on Facebook. ""I was bummed to read your letter,"" he wrote. ""The world is so much more complicated than when we first met -- it has changed. And we used to love your jokes about tacquitos and 420 but now they don't seem so funny."" The irreverent 5-year-old site, which has bragged about its decision to advertise on porn websites and joked about its TV ads that (allegedly accidentally) showed a bear's penis, mostly posted Web memes and pictures of food on its Facebook page. And the ""breakup letter"" included a joke about making a decision because ""it was 4:20 at the time."" That's a reference to a term that's become code for the best time to smoke marijuana. Facebook has defended its algorithm, which features some posts prominently while downplaying others. While many users say they want to see every post from their friends and all the pages they've liked, Facebook argues that would create an overwhelming flood of lower-quality content. In his response to Eat24, Facebook's McCormick didn't address the promoted-post issue but suggested users prefer to see news from friends over companies' marketing pitches. ""There is some serious stuff happening in the world and one of my best friends just had a baby and another one just took the best photo of his homemade cupcakes and what we have come to realize is people care about those things more than sushi porn,"" McCormick said. ""So we are sorry that we have to part this way because we think we could still be friends -- really we do. But we totally respect you if you need some space."" Facebook appears to have made a concerted effort to limit how much content users see from companies' pages. A recent study found that companies' posts reached 6% of their followers in February, down from 12% in October. ""Like many mediums, if businesses want to make sure that people see their content, the best strategy is, and always has been, paid advertising,"" a spokeswoman told Time. In its letter, Eat24, which is available exclusively in the United States, says it previously paid Facebook to promote some of its posts and saw its follower count swell with users from other countries. It said the company plans to continue its social media activities on other sites and apps. ""Not to hit below the belt, but we have a lot more fun when we hang out with Twitter and Instagram,"" the letter reads. ""They don't have weird algorithms, which means all of our besties get to see everything we post."" Instagram, of course, has been owned by Facebook since 2012. Ironically, Eat24's breakup letter appears to be, far and away, its most popular post on the site. As of Monday morning, it had more than 2,200 ""likes"" and  had been shared nearly 1,000 times. Its other most recent posts ranged in ""likes"" from a dozen or so up to about 180. Most of the comments were supportive, even when some fans sensed an ulterior motive. ""I know this is a PR stunt, but this is my favorite PR stunt,"" one user wrote. ""As always -- brilliant, guys.""

"""Enough, I'm tired,"" Mexico's top prosecutor said, cutting off reporters' questions. Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam had just revealed that authorities believe 43 missing students were kidnapped, executed and dumped in a river -- and he was ready to call it a day. His words spread like wildfire through an outraged nation. Mounting fury over government officials' response to -- and possible role in -- the students' disappearance has convulsed the country for weeks, posing a mounting challenge to Mexico's President amid  demonstrations where at times violence has flared. It's one of the most serious cases in the contemporary history of Mexico and Latin America, Human Rights Watch Americas Director José Miguel Vivanco told Mexico's El Economista newspaper. He compared it to a massacre of students during a Mexico City demonstration in 1968. ""At that time, these kinds of things happened: mass disappearances of people, where no one was held accountable,"" he told the newspaper. Yet in the 21st century, he said, Latin America ""has overcome these kinds of practices."" It's no wonder, he said, that ""an act of this magnitude"" unfolding ""in view of all Mexicans, the international community and the media"" has caught so much attention. Now Murillo's comments at a press conference last week have become a new rallying cry, used by fed-up protesters dishing out some of the sharpest criticism Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto's administration has faced since he took office in December 2012. #YaMeCansé -- Spanish for ""enough, I'm tired"" -- became a trending hashtag on Twitter and a topic of viral YouTube video posts as people in Mexico and around the world fired back. ""I am also tired that the government protects and colludes with organized crime,"" a young man says at the beginning of one online video. ""Hello. I'm Juan. And I've had enough,"" another man chimes in. ""I'm tired of so much injustice."" It's a rapidly unfolding political crisis for Peña Nieto, threatening his efforts to revamp Mexico's image abroad and convince citizens that drug-related violence is on the decline. Students' case sends shock waves . The case of the 43 missing students from a rural teachers' college in Mexico's Guerrero state quickly grabbed the national spotlight as word spread about their September 26 disappearance. And as details of the troubling case emerged, outrage only grew. Authorities say the students were abducted by police on order of a local mayor, then turned over to a gang that's believed to have killed them and burned their bodies before throwing some remains in a river. There's no indication any of the students had ties with organized crime, Murillo said. On Friday, protesters marching in Mexico City carried posters saying, ""Enough, I'm tired."" Others held signs saying, ""It was the state."" Demonstrators sprayed graffiti on the walls of Mexico's National Palace Saturday, trying to break down and set fire to a massive wooden door. ""These are the people that are screwing over the country,"" they chanted. Protesters clashed with police at Acapulco's airport on Monday, crippling the airport for hours and forcing the cancellation of several flights. Mexico's President has also said he's outraged about the students' case, but he's condemned the protest violence. And some have expressed skepticism that protesters are truly concerned about what happened to the students, accusing them of exploiting the situation for political reasons. Protesters condemn what they call inaction by the government. ""There is a national emergency. This is clear,""  José Alcaraz, a protest organizer, told CNN en Español Saturday. ""There is a decomposition of the Mexican state."" Pressure on the President . The students' parents have been highly critical of Peña Nieto for his administration's handling of the investigation. A cell phone video from a closed-door meeting with the President, released on YouTube, shows one family member saying Peña Nieto should resign if he can't deliver answers. It's not the first time the President, who represents the Institutional Revolutionary Party that once ruled Mexico for more than 70 years, has faced allegations of government corruption and accusations the government is too slow to fight crime. Even as he deals with the investigation into the missing students and its aftermath, an investigative report from Mexican news website Aristegui Noticias over the weekend alleged that Mexico's President and his wife have been living in a lavish $7 million mansion owned by a contractor that's won lucrative government projects. In response, the government said that first lady Angélica Rivera has been making payments on the house with money she's made from her acting career. But the report about the mansion has only further fueled critics who describe the President as out-of-touch. The protests over the missing students' case are part of a particularly ""explosive situation,"" John Ackerman, a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, told CNN last week. ""People in Mexico are taking to the streets yesterday, today and just about every day for the last month, demanding not only clearing up this particular crime, which is very particularly egregious and important, but really a change to the system,"" he said. ""Mexico's transition to democracy has not been very democratic. People are looking for a new system and a new way of thinking about government and the relationship between state and society."" Slain Mexican student's friends, family demand justice . Attorney general tells CNN affiliate: I would say it again . In an interview Monday, Murillo defended his comments from Friday's press conference in the controversial case. ""When I said, 'I am tired,' it's because I am tired of this: I am tired of brutal violence,"" the attorney general told CNN affiliate Televisa. It's a phrase he said he'd say again. ""Naturally, I have no reason to lie. I am as human as anyone else, and I also get tired. I have been sleeping for four hours a night for the past 30 days, and that day I had been awake for 40,"" he said. He said he had just spoken with the missing students' parents, and told them what he later told reporters -- that officials believe the students' remains were thrown in the river, but they don't yet have DNA proof. ""Really, when you hear them (the parents), you shudder at the powerlessness of not being able to give them an immediate answer,"" Murillo said. There's no doubt the case of the missing students will weigh on Mexico for years to come, Murillo said. ""This would impact any country, not a presidential term,"" he said. ""The impact of this kind of event lasts forever."" The question is, what will happen next? There's one thing protesters say they aren't tired of: making sure Mexico's most powerful leaders hear them.","Protesters are using comments from Mexico's top prosecutor as a rallying cry .

"The ""ship of the imagination"" is roaring ahead into its second voyage. ""Cosmos,"" the new, updated version of Carl Sagan's popular 1980 documentary series exploring the hows, whats and whys of the universe, premiered Sunday night on Fox, the National Geographic Channel and various corporate cousins. Its ""ship of the imagination"" -- a vehicle to take viewers through wonders large and small -- now has a new captain, astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson, but the reaction to the show's debut shows that entertaining, informative science never goes out of style. ""I'll be eagerly tuning in for future episodes,"" wrote the Los Angeles Times' Jennifer Ouellette, praising Tyson as ""affable"" and ""engaging"" and noting the debut episode's lively use of ideas -- such as the ""powers of 10"" -- that could turn to cliché in other hands. ""Tonally the show strikes just the right balance between education and inspiration,"" wrote The Verge's Bryan Bishop, though adding that he believed the premiere tried too hard. ""It feels like it's missing its own point: that the greatest wonders aren't CG (computer generated) spectacle, but our own marvelous universe,"" he wrote. Science fans -- and fans of the original series -- have been awaiting the new ""Cosmos"" for months. The show has the imprimatur of Sagan's widow, Ann Druyan, and is being produced by ""Family Guy"" mogul Seth MacFarlane, an avowed ""Cosmos"" geek. Through it all, Tyson has maintained his good humor as he's promoted the show. ""The universe is hilarious!"" he told GQ in a recent interview. ""Like, Venus is 900 degrees. I could tell you it melts lead. But that's not as fun as saying, 'You can cook a pizza on the windowsill in 9 seconds.' And next time my fans eat pizza, they're thinking of Venus!"" Tyson told CNN's Brian Stelter that one of the ideas behind ""Cosmos"" is to reignite ""that flame of curiosity in us all."" Neil deGrasse Tyson on ""Cosmos"" debut . ""One of our mission statements in 'Cosmos' is to present science with all of its glory and the majesty and the mystery and the wonder -- the things we all take for granted as children,"" Tyson said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" Tyson acknowledged that he's bothered about the debate between science and religion that's became a mainstay of political campaigns and op-ed pages. ""There was a time when science and religion kind of co-existed under the same roof,"" Tyson told Stelter. ""I find it odd that we live in a time where people who are strongly religious want to make everyone else the same kind of religious way they are, and break down the door of the science classroom to put their religious philosophies in there."" Though there was some tweaking of religion on social media -- ""SPOILER ALERT: apparently the earth is not 6000 years old... Who knew!?"" tweeted JaclynGlenn -- in general, people were impressed. ""That was the best commercial for science ever,"" tweeted Dan Treadway. And Wil Wheaton -- who knows a little something about TV, entertainment and science, having been an actor on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"" -- was positively effusive. ""Dear everyone involved in making #cosmos: Thank you. Thank you so much. I hope you inspire an entire generation to fall in love with science,"" he tweeted.

"President Obama talked openly last week about a candid conversation with a group of at-risk kids in Chicago, and many of us parents took notice. ""I explained to them when I was their age, I was a lot like them,"" the President said, referring to the African-American boys he met with at Chicago's Hyde Park Academy High School on the city's south side last year. ""I didn't have a dad in the house. And I was angry about it, even though I didn't necessarily realize it at the time. I made bad choices. I got high without always thinking about the harm that it could do."" Young men of color, share your advice . The President's honesty with teens about using drugs led many of us parents to ask: Would we do the same with our children? Would we tell them that we tried drugs or used them repeatedly? Is sharing that information a good idea, or could it backfire? My girls, ages 6 and 7, are still too young for this conversation, in my humble opinion. But I have wondered whether I'd one day tell them that yes, I did get high -- but just once! Thankfully, I never really used drugs, but alcohol is a whole different story. Would I tell my girls about how I drank way too much too many times to remember during my college years, all while I was under the legal drinking age? Coming from a family that has battled alcoholism -- and cognizant of how there can be a genetic predisposition to the disease -- I feel my husband and I most definitely need to have the conversation when our girls are old enough. Yolanda Machado, a Babble.com contributor and mom of a 6-year-old daughter, agrees. Her husband is a recovering drug addict. His addiction caused them to separate for a little more than a year. They have been back together since 2011. ""I met my husband when he was 19, and at that time he had only smoked weed once,"" said Machado, who is founder of the blog Sassy Mama in L.A. She said he then fell in with the ""wrong people at the wrong time."" ""He said it was like something in him just clicked when he started doing drugs. Had he been told about his family's predisposition, he may have made a different choice. But, we'll never know. In order to give our daughter the best shot of making the right choice, we want her to know."" Cecily Kellogg has already had the conversation with her daughter, who is 7. Sober for 18 years, Kellogg has told her daughter in very general terms that she's a recovering drug addict and alcoholic and that addiction is a family disease. ""That is why I'm honest about my addiction, and I also tell her that she's at risk and needs to make smart decisions. At her age, this likely goes over her head, but I tell her anyway,"" said Kellogg, who writes for Babble.com and hosts a blog at Uppercase Woman. TV host Miss Lori, a mother of three, says she has been very open with her kids about never having used drugs. That admission wasn't exactly helpful at first, she concedes. ""They regarded me as a total anomaly who might not understand the pressures kids are facing today concerning drugs,"" said the children's television host and social media specialist, who is also a Babble.com contributor. ""But when I talked with my kids in more detail about the pressure I experienced to 'party,' particularly in the entertainment industry, they came to recognize that I had an even greater understanding of what kids are going through."" Miss Lori, who regularly talks to her children about drugs (and sex, alcohol and money!), says the thinking that you, as a parent, can lie or hide your experiences from your kids without consequence ""is a fantasy."" ""If you want your children to be forthright with you, shouldn't you show them the same respect? Besides it's not about what you did or didn't do, it's about why you made the choices you did and what effect they had on your future, positive or negative."" The best lessons as parents, says Lyz Lenz, a writer and mom of two small children in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, don't come from our ""perfect"" moments but from when we admit mistakes and show our kids how we try to learn from them. With that philosophy in mind, Lenz, host of a blog in her own name, plans to tell her kids when they're older how she got drunk in college. ""How I let it happen,"" said Lenz, ""and some stories of what happened after."" ""Maybe not all the stories, but I will always do my best to answer questions as honestly as possible,"" said Lenz. ""It's not going to be pretty."" Jennifer Bosse, a mom of two and founder of the blog Defining My Happy, said her mother was very honest growing up, and she plans to be the same with her children once they get older. ""My mother was fairly open with my siblings and I about her past and the mistakes she made. She did this in hopes that we would learn from them,"" said Bosse. ""I really took what she shared to heart and was fairly straight-edge growing up. I was too scared by the stories she had shared."" Of course, a big question for parents is whether talking about past drug use will make our children more or less likely to try drugs when they're older. While Bosse says her mom's open approach did deter her from doing anything serious, she's seen plenty of other cases where candor didn't exactly have the desired effect. ""I have seen ... parents be completely open and their kids end up engaging in the same ways and amounts they did ... the whole, 'Well, you did it' argument,"" said Bosse. Sue Scheff, an author and parenting expert, calls this a tricky issue for parents, namely because drugs are a ""different animal"" today than when we were in school. ""Just getting high today is not what just getting high 20 or 30 years ago was,"" said Scheff. Marijuana is, on average, more potent than it was in the 1970s. Also, drugs like heroin are becoming more popular with teenagers, and even more deadly when laced with narcotics. Whether to talk to your children about your drug past depends on your individual situation, she says. If a child is using drugs to try and fit in, and the parent did the same thing, the parent can relate their story to let them know they understand how their child feels. ""Make it a learning experience,"" said Scheff, author of the book ""Wit's End: Advice and Resources for Saving Your Out-of-Control Teen."" ""It needs to be a situation that relates to the parent and teen."" On the other hand, if the children need rehab or detox, telling them you did drugs could become an excuse where they say, 'Mom did it, so why can't I?"""" said Scheff. LaTricia Woods, a public relations executive and motivational speaker who lives outside Phoenix, never experimented with drugs. Knowing her mom abandoned her as an infant because she was under the influence of drugs was one of the reasons, she said. She is part of a group of female professionals who speak to young, at-risk girls about the challenges of growing up. Often, a member of the group who has a history of drug use will share her experience with the young women. ""It gives the young ladies a chance to speak to someone who has been in their shoes (or similar shoes) and has gone on to become a successful adult."" You can't underestimate the power of seeing someone who has been in a place similar to where they are today and who has gone on create a successful life, said Woods. One of the students President Obama met with last year said as much. Last week, as the President shared what he told a group of teens about his past, he remembered the reaction. ""After I was finished, the guy sitting next to me said, 'Are you talking about you?' I said, 'Yes.'"" Would you talk to your kids about your past drug or alcohol use? Chime in below in the comments or tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","President Obama told a group of teens he got high when he was their age .

"The Senate Intelligence Committee voted Thursday for the public release of key parts of a report on the notorious CIA detention and interrogation program launched after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. A final decision on declassifying the information now rests with the White House, and it was unclear how long such a process would take. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said the panel she leads voted 11-3 in a closed-door session to declassify the 480-page executive summary and 20 findings and conclusions of the five-year study. Feinstein called the report's findings ""shocking,"" saying it ""exposes brutality that stands in stark contrast to our values as a nation."" ""A stain on our history"" ""It chronicles a stain on our history that must never again be allowed to happen,"" she said. ""This is not what Americans do."" The committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, said he voted to declassify the information in order to move past the politically volatile issue from the GOP administration of former President George W. Bush. ""This is a chapter in our past that should have already been closed,"" he said. Two other Republicans on the panel -- Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Jim Risch of Idaho -- said they voted against declassification of the report they labeled as ""one-sided"" and ""partisan,"" adding the public release of the information would fail to end the debate. Critics of the CIA detention and interrogation program, including President Barack Obama, have called the use of controversial techniques including waterboarding a violation of laws prohibiting torture. Obama banned the practices when he took office in 2009, after the CIA had already stopped using them. Defenders say the program started in response to the terror attacks yielded valuable intelligence that led to major victories in the fight against al Qaeda, including the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. Feinstein said her panel also was sending the full 6,200-page report to the White House for possible declassification sometime in the future. Usually one of the CIA's staunchest backers, Feinstein has recently lashed out at the agency in a dispute over the committee staff's preparation of the report, which has been complete since 2012. The CIA has asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Senate staffers violated the law by accessing classified internal information based on the same documents the agency turned over to the Senate for its review. Spying dispute . Feinstein accused the CIA of snooping on computers used by the Senate staffers, which were in a CIA facility designated for the committee's use. Her statement Thursday detailed harsh criticism of the CIA in the report, which said ""points to major problems with CIA's management of this program and its interactions with the White House, other parts of the executive branch and Congress."" ""The release of this summary and conclusions in the near future shows that this nation admits its errors, as painful as they may be, and seeks to learn from them,"" Feinstein said. ""It is now abundantly clear that, in an effort to prevent further terrorist attacks after 9/11 and bring those responsible to justice, the CIA made serious mistakes that haunt us to this day."" In a Senate floor speech last month, Feinstein outlined part of the reason to make the report public. FBI looks into dispute between CIA, Senate . ""The interrogations and the conditions of confinement at the CIA detention sites were far different and far more harsh than the way the CIA had described them to us,"" she said then. Current and former officials familiar with the findings say it portrays efforts by CIA officials to burnish internal reports of how effective the program was, even when it was clear that wasn't the case. The tactics used were approved by legal memos from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, though several of the memos were later withdrawn as erroneous. The Justice Department reviewed the conduct of some employees and contractors involved in the program, which the officials say showed excesses beyond those approved by the Justice Department, but declined to bring criminal prosecutions. Congress misled? One of those expected to come under criticism in the Senate report is John Rizzo, who was acting general counsel at the agency during the post-9/11 period. Rizzo, who recently published his memoir ""Company Man: Thirty Years of Controversy and Crisis in the CIA,"" supports declassifying and releasing the Senate report and the CIA's rebuttal ""and let people judge."" He disputes the idea that he or any other officials misled Congress, something he said he would have told congressional investigators if they asked for an interview. ""I believed the program yielded valuable intelligence and I continue to believe this. Now, could it have been gotten through other ways? I don't know; that is unknowable,"" Rizzo said in an interview. A dozen years later, he added, it was important to recall that CIA employees did the best they could in facing the threat at the time. The program began when Congress and then-President Bush were pushing the CIA and other security agencies to do everything to prevent another attack, which at the time was believed to be very likely. The CIA in the past has disputed some of the findings of the Senate committee report. Dean Boyd, a CIA spokesman, refrained from commenting on the report, saying the agency had yet to receive a final copy. Last month, Obama said he supported the declassification of the committee's report ""so that the American people can understand what happened in the past and that can help guide us as we move forward."" What are the CIA and Senate fighting about?","The panel voted 11-3 for declassification of some of  the report .

"A prominent supporter of President Barack Obama and co-founder of the Human Rights Campaign was arrested last week on charges of sodomy and sexual abuse related to what authorities said was an encounter with a juvenile male. Terrence Bean, 66, a major Democratic donor and a celebrated gay-rights activist, was indicted on two felony charges of sodomy and a misdemeanor count of sexual abuse by a grand jury and arrested in Oregon Wednesday, according to a statement from the Portland Police Bureau. Bean was released later that day on bail, pending a court hearing. Kiah Lawson, a 25-year-old identified by multiple news outlets as Bean's ex-boyfriend, was arrested on Thursday on related charges, Portland Police confirmed. He's also been released from jail,  and pleaded not guilty on Friday, according to The Oregonian newspaper. The charges relate to an alleged encounter the two had with a 15-year-old boy in Oregon last year, The Oregonian reported. Bean's attorney has denied the charges and said in a statement that Bean is the ""victim of an extortion ring."" CNN is not naming the alleged victim because the network does not identify minors or victims of sexual assaults. According to a release from the Portland Police Bureau, its Sex Crimes Unit detectives are investigating the case. Obama:  A ""great friend and supporter"" Bean, a real-estate developer and co-founder of the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund and the Human Rights Campaign, is a powerful figure in Democratic politics. The Oregonian reported that he helped raise more than half a million dollars for Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, and Federal Election Commission records show he's contributed thousands to Democrats, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and others. Obama's LGBT campaign contributors . Photos posted online show him with the Obamas, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and aboard Air Force One with the President. In remarks at a 2009 Human Rights Campaign dinner, President Obama thanked Bean, calling him a ""great friend and supporter."" Human Rights Campaign spokesman Fred Sainz told CNN on Saturday that Bean took a leave of absence from the organization the day of the arrest ""until his issues are resolved."" ""Terry Bean has taken a voluntary leave of absence from the HRC board until his issues are resolved. Bean is just one of 80 board members, none of whom have daily oversight or responsibility for any of our programs,"" Sainz said. He said the HRC ""does tremendous work to make America a more just and equal nation"" and called that work ""vital and is bigger than any one individual."" The Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund declined to comment on the development, but Bean has no current involvement with the organization besides contributing funds to its operations. Attorney:  Bean is the victim of an extortion ring . Bean's attorney, Kristen Winemiller, said the allegations against him should not be taken at ""face value."" ""Over the course of several months in 2013-2014 Terry was the victim of an extortion ring led by several men known to law enforcement,"" Winemiller said. ""This current arrest is connected to the ongoing investigation of that case in which Mr. Bean has fully cooperated."" Lawson's attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. Lawson's former attorney told The Oregonian that Lawson stumbled upon a camera Bean used to secretly record sexual encounters with him and other men, and took screenshots of some of the images, hoping to secure money from Bean in exchange for their return. While Lawson's attorney characterized the money as ""damages,"" Bean alleged extortion, and took his concerns to the district attorney. The investigation was eventually taken up by the Portland Police Department due to a conflict of interest with the DA and Lawson's former attorney, and that investigation led to Bean's indictment and arrest.","Terry Bean is a major Democratic donor and a celebrated gay-rights activist .

"Why in the world would Scott Brown, a former half-term Senator from Mitt Romney's Massachusetts, put himself in the mix for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination? The real question is: Why not? When Brown told the Des Moines Register over the weekend that he was heading to the Iowa State Fair ""to determine whether there's an interest in my brand of leadership and Republicanism,"" the news was met with some amusement by political insiders. After all, Brown has already floated bids for New Hampshire senator and Massachusetts governor, and he doesn't seem likely to pursue either. 2016 Watch: Scott Brown makes a stop in Iowa . Brown was thumped by Elizabeth Warren in his 2012 re-election bid, and he became something of a punch line earlier this year after he unleashed a volley of questionable late night tweets at some online critics. But so what? The truth is that in today's media environment, there's almost no downside for a long-shot ""candidate"" like Brown to tell people he's mulling a White House run. For someone with no real perch other than a paid gig at Fox News, it actually makes a lot of sense. Just by going to the Iowa State Fair, a must-do for any ambitious pol, Brown will be rewarded with the only currency that matters in modern campaign politics (other than hard fundraising dollars): Buzz. ""Funnel cake and free name ID. What's not to love?"" asked Will Ritter, a Boston-based GOP operative and former Mitt Romney adviser. ""How many stories got posted about Ed Markey's legislative agenda yesterday? It's fun. Senator Brown's a skilled retail politician and this gives him a platform to talk about a brand of Republicanism we could use more of."" For obsessive political watchers, Brown's shamelessness about the whole enterprise is kind of refreshing. ""I do admire the audacity to just go to the state fair and tweet about it,"" said Jeff Smith, a professor at the New School and regular contributor to the Washington Twitter conversation. Brown knows exactly what he's doing. Scott Brown stirs speculation with New Hampshire visit . It's the same reason Iowa Rep. Steve King and New York Rep. Peter King (no relation; not even close) are ""refusing to rule out"" a 2016 bid. Will either of them be taking the oath of office one day? Nope. But with so many news platforms to fill -- on television, on the web, on the radio -- a presidential trial balloon or a trip to Iowa is almost guaranteed to get you at least a crumb of media exposure, a boost in stature, and maybe even a few campaign contributions down the road. Just look at this month's Family Leadership Summit, a gathering of social conservatives in Iowa that drew potential 2016 presidential contenders Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum to the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Both men seem likely to run for the Republican nomination, and both will be returning to Iowa over and over and over again in the coming years. But even if they don't, the two conservatives proved how keeping one's name in the 2016 conversation is its own reward. In their speeches, Cruz and Santorum issued a series of anti-Obama bromides and boosted their profiles with the grassroots activists who attended the Iowa summit. Neither Republican did a single thing to advance the news cycle other than board an airplane to Des Moines. Yet there they were, trailed at every turn by reporters from the Washington Post, Des Moines Register, Associated Press, New York Times, Dallas Morning News, Wall Street Journal, NBC News, ABC News and Fox News. Another Cruz trip to Iowa stokes 2016 speculation . ""The focus on the 2016 presidential contest is completely ridiculous, and everybody knows it,"" wrote David Weigel of Slate after witnessing the cattle call. Well, not completely. In our atomized media ecosystem, there's certainly a market for niche political coverage, in the same way there's a market for micro-reporting on the status of Robert Griffin III's return from knee surgery. More importantly, the presidential cycle is starting earlier than it ever has, with advisers to likely candidates working behind the scenes to assemble campaign infrastructure and peddle dirt on their potential opponents. On the Republican side, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are driving national discussions about ideology and governance. Still, there's a difference between running for president and ""running"" for president, even though it's sometimes difficult to tell the difference. Running for president requires hard work, an ungodly amount of fundraising effort, a professional team of advisers, polling, a paid media strategy, a voter contact operation and ballot access. See: Romney, Mitt. ""Running"" for president means doing a lot of interviews and delivering some well-timed lines in debates. See: Cain, Herman. Which category does Scott Brown fall under? For the moment, it would seem the latter. Looking at the 2016 GOP field, Christie probably has the Northeastern Republican lane all to himself, a prospect that would make it difficult for Brown to raise money. Before his Iowa trip, Brown met privately with Christie at the Republican National Committee's summer conference in Boston, a meeting first reported by the New York Times. Christie raised money for Brown several times during his Senate tenure, and, according to one Christie insider, the two are ""very friendly."" Then there's the fact that Brown, who supports some abortion rights, isn't exactly a hardliner on social issues that matter to so many Republican caucus-goers in Iowa. Even some of his former advisers aren't sure what he's up to. Eric Fehrnstrom, the media strategist who crafted Brown's truck-driving, regular-guy image during his stunning 2010 Senate upset, is not currently advising him, Republican sources told CNN. Asked by text message if he's serious about a presidential bid, one Republican who talks to Brown often responded: ""Who knows. You should call him and ask."" ""He's acting on his own, as far as I can tell,"" another onetime adviser said in an e-mail. But what if Brown takes off? What if he gains a toehold in New Hampshire, rises to high single digits in the polls sometime in 2015, and gets invited to some Republican primary debates? What if he rattles off a few good lines, has his moment in the sun, and then fades? He will have lost absolutely nothing -- but gained a spot on some vice presidential short lists along with a hike in his post-campaign speaking fees. Another Republican who has spoken with Brown recently isn't surprised by the sudden interest in the presidential spotlight. Brown, this person said, is a relentlessly enthusiastic guy who still takes great pride in capturing Ted Kennedy's old Senate seat. ""The fact that he is in Iowa doesn't surprise me,"" the Republican told CNN. ""In '16, it's not a bad idea to put your name out there and see where it takes you. He was enthusiastic about getting back in the national conversation. I could definitely anticipate this.""","There's a difference between running for president and ""running"" for president .

It's often traded by the ton. Check out his new video on YouTube: ""Honey Badger Narrates: The Mysterious & Endangered Pangolin."" ""They really just wanna chill-chill,"" he says off the top. Randall agreed to edit the video in collaboration with CNN's Change the List project. You can read more about it at CNN.com/Change. I went to Vietnam and Indonesia in February to try to figure out how this illegal market for pangolin works and what might be done to save this loveable underdog. Some researchers think the pangolin may be the most-trafficked mammal in the world. You can see some of my footage in a CNN video called ""Inside the illegal animal trade"" and in Randall's YouTube video. We gave him access to the material in hopes he could help raise awareness. Randall has a unique knack for making an unknown creature popular. If any animal could use that help, it's the pangolin.","Creator of the viral video about honey badgers makes a new video, this time on pangolins .

"Hundreds of law enforcement officers searched Saturday for the suspect in the slaying of a Pennsylvania state trooper -- hours after authorities appeared to be closing in on the self-taught survivalist and bursts of gunfire were heard near the man's home in the Poconos Mountains. ""It is still a very active search,"" said Ralph Megliola, chairman of Barrett Township board of supervisors, adding that up to 400 law enforcement officers, including members of the U.S. Marshals Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the FBI. On Friday night, police had surrounded an area where suspect Eric Matthew Frein was believed to be hiding, Megliola said. There have been no credible sightings since last night. The area is not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis, in the Poconos. A police spokesman involved in the case would not say that Frein had been surrounded. Police exchanged gunfire in the area with an individual believed to be Frein, a government official told CNN Friday. State police asked had residents in the Price and Barrett townships of Monroe County to stay inside their homes due to the police activity. The public was asked to stay away from windows and not to travel to the area. On Saturday, residents were still being told to stay indoors and off the roads, Megliola said. Frein, 31, is being sought in the death of Cpl. Byron Dickson in a September 12 ambush outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove. He's also suspected of wounding another officer. CNN's Jason Carroll reported that Canadensis is 30-40 miles from the site where Dickson was shot. The FBI has placed Frein on its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list and is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Frein is a survivalist with an extensive shooting background and a grudge against law enforcement, officials said. Mohawk-style haircut . Frein apparently cut his hair into a mohawk style before the attack on police and was active in a military simulation unit that reenacted Cold War-era European conflicts, officials said. His FBI most-wanted poster describes him as a ""heavy smoker, a weapons enthusiast, and a survivalist. He claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa, and he has studied Russian and Serbian languages."" State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said Wednesday that investigators know Frein ""has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder."" ""He has very strong feelings about law enforcement and seems to be very angry with a lot of things that go on in our society."" Police official: 'We are coming for you' State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Frein has an apparent fascination with Eastern European armies, their history and attire. His simulation group -- which Bivens declined to name -- would stage reenactments using Airsoft guns. In this case, though, authorities say Frein is using live ammunition and shooting to kill. Bivens said Frein has ""his head shaved on the sides with long hair on top,"" wider than a ""mohawk"" haircut, apparently as part of his mental preparation for his attacks on the troopers. The hairstyle is ""completely different from what he had worn for years. In words directed at Frein, Bivens was blunt. ""If you are cowering in some cool damp place,"" Bivens said, ""We are coming for you. It is only a matter of time until we bring you to justice for committing these cowardly acts.""

"(CNN) -- Imagine you're the kind of person who worries about a future when robots become smart enough to threaten the very existence of the human race. For years, you've been dismissed as a crackpot, consigned to the same category of people who see Elvis lurking in their waffles. In 2014, you found yourself in good company. This year, arguably the world's greatest living scientific mind, Stephen Hawking, and its leading techno-industrialist, Elon Musk, voiced their fears about the potentially lethal rise of artificial intelligence. They were joined by philosophers, physicists and computer scientists, all of whom spoke out about the serious risks posed by the development of greater-than-human machine intelligence. In a widely cited op-ed co-written with MIT physicist Max Tegmark, Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek and computer scientist Stuart Russell, Hawking sounded the AI alarm. ""One can imagine (AI) outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand. Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all."" Musk was reportedly more emphatic, expanding on his tweeted warnings by calling AI humanity's biggest ""existential risk"" and likening it to ""summoning the demon."" The debate over AI was given a big boost this year by the publication of philosopher Nick Bostrom's ""Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies,"" which makes a close study of just why and how AI may be so catastrophically dangerous (2013's ""Our Final Invention"" by documentarian James Barrat makes a similar case). Bostrom: When machines outsmart humans . Bostrom is the director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford, one of several new institutions devoted to studying existential threats to the human race, of which AI figures centrally. In May, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology christened its own Future of Life Institute. In the academic community at least, AI anxiety is booming. They're right to be worried. The first and most immediate issue is the potential for AI to put large numbers of humans out of work. A study by Carl Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford's Program on the Impacts of Future Technology put the matter starkly. In their analysis of over 700 jobs, almost half could be done by a computer in the future. This wave of computerization could destroy not simply low-wage, low-skill jobs (though those are in acute danger) but some white-collar and service sector jobs previously thought to be immune as well. Technology is marching on both our manual and mental labor. As serious a threat as widespread job loss is, we've seen this movie before. During past technological upheavals, humans have cleverly created jobs and industries from the ashes of obsolete ones. We may be able to keep our collective heads above water even if AI encroaches on more creative and intellectual industries (heck, we may even start working less). What we should be more concerned about is humanity losing its perch as the Earth's foremost intelligence. For those anxious about AI, current efforts to develop self-correcting algorithms (""machine learning""), coupled with the relentless growth in computer power and the increasing ubiquity of sensors collecting all manner of intelligence and information around the world, will push AI to human and ultimately superhuman intelligence. It's an event that's been dubbed ""the intelligence explosion,"" a term invoked in 1965 by computer scientist Irving John Good in a paper outlining the development path for artificial intelligence. What makes an intelligence explosion so worrisome is that intelligence is not a tool or a technology. We may think of AI as something that we use, like a hammer or corkscrew, but that's fundamentally the wrong way to think about it. Sufficiently advanced intelligence, like ours, is a creative force. The more powerful it is, the more it can reshape the world around it. Artificial intelligence does not need to be malevolent to be catastrophically dangerous to humanity. When computer scientists talk about the possible threat to humanity from superintelligent AI, they don't mean the Terminator or Matrix. Instead, it's typically a more prosaic end: humanity wiped out because an AI tasked with a simple goal (say, creating paper clips, an example that is often used) requisitions all the energy and raw materials on Earth to relentlessly churn out paper clips, outsmarting and out-maneuvering all human attempts to stop it. In Hollywood's telling, there are always humans left to fight back, but such an outcome is implausible if humanity is faced with a truly superior intelligence. It would be like mice attempting to outwit a human (we're the mice). In that event, AI researchers like Keefe Roedersheimer see a less inspiring finale: ""All the people are dead."" Needless to say, not everyone shares this bleak forecast. In the AI optimist camp, futurist and Google director of engineering Ray Kurzweil also sees intelligent machines precipitating human extinction, of a sort, only in Kurzweil's telling, humanity is not exterminated but subsumed into a superintelligent machine. Kurzweil's human-machine symbiosis is not a techno-catastrophe but the ultimate liberation from humanity's biological frailties. Others are skeptical that AI will ever reach human levels of intelligence and cognition, let alone surpass it. Some, like New York University's Gary Marcus, are on the fence. ""I don't know of any proof that we should be worried,"" Marcus told me this year, ""but nor of any proof that we should not be worried."" Irving John Good famously described the development of an ultraintelligent machine as the ""last invention that man need ever make,"" for after that, humanity would cede innovation and technological development to its smarter progeny. Even if it's not a straight line from Siri to extinction, we humans should probably be watching our machines just a bit more closely.","Greg Scoblete: 2014 is the year notable concerns were raised about AI .

"An unmanned drone came within 200 feet of a commercial jet over New York, triggering an FBI appeal to the public for any information about the unusual and potentially dangerous incident. The crew of Alitalia Flight 608 approaching John F. Kennedy airport on Monday reported the sighting. ""We saw a drone, a drone aircraft,"" the pilot can be heard telling air traffic controllers on radio calls captured by the website LiveATC.net. CNN Explains: U.S. drones . The FAA said it was investigating the incident. The Alitalia aircraft did not take any evasive action and landed safely. The FBI expanded on the FAA report, saying in a statement that the Alitalia flight from Rome was roughly three miles from runway 31R when the incident occurred at an altitude of approximately 1,750 feet. The unmanned aircraft, described by the FBI as black and no more than three feet wide with four propellers, came within 200 feet of the Boeing jetliner. The FBI said it was looking to identify and locate the aircraft and its operator. A source with knowledge of the incident says investigators interviewed the pilot and others on the Alitalia plane. Dronestagram uses social media to highlight drone strikes . ""The FBI is asking anyone with information about the unmanned aircraft or the operator to contact us,"" said Special Agent in Charge John Giacalone. ""Our paramount concern is the safety of aircraft passengers and crew."" Air traffic controllers warned other planes approaching the JFK runway of the drone report, but at least two other pilots radioed they did not see it. A spokesman for the New York Police Department was not aware of the incident and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, referred CNN to the FAA. Unmanned aerial systems, sometimes called drones, and other remote-controlled planes could pose a risk to larger passenger aircraft if they collided or were sucked into an engine. For recreational hobbyists, flying remote-controlled planes is only allowed by the FAA up to 400 feet, and within sight of the operator. If they are going to fly within three miles of an airport, they have to let air traffic controllers know. Flying unmanned aerial vehicles is illegal for most business purposes; however, governments and public entities such as police departments can apply for permission to operate them. The FAA has been working to setup new rules and to safely integrate the use of unmanned aircraft into the national air space, and last year opened an ""unmanned aircraft systems integration"" office.","Drone came dangerously close to Alitalia jet landing in New York .

"The national fury over police brutality is thrusting the federal government into a role that dates back decades: ensuring the rights of African-Americans are protected in a nation with a long history of racial inequality. After local grand juries in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, declined to charge white officers who killed unarmed African-Americans with a crime, attention is shifting to Washington. The call for a federal response echoes key moments during the civil rights movement when it became clear that local prosecutors and state authorities would not act. After all, it took the federal government to convict seven men on conspiracy charges for the 1964 killing of civil rights activists James Chaney, who was black, and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, who were white. Now, the Justice Department is conducting two civil rights investigations of police in Ferguson after the killing 18-year-old Michael Brown at the hands of an officer. Attorney General Eric Holder is also formally launching a civil rights investigation into 43-year-old Eric Garner's death in Staten Island. The outrage that followed the grand jury decision in both cases highlights the deep mistrust between many in the black community and the police. ""Local governments have historically failed to provide justice, especially for African American communities,"" said Barbara R. Arnwine, the president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, an organization formed in 1963 at the request of President John. F. Kennedy to help combat racial discrimination. ""That's why people are able to breathe a sigh of relief, because they know there is a back door to hold these local governments accountable."" Of course, the federal government has also been involved in more recent cases. ""You don't have to go all the way back to the Civil Rights Movement to find an analogue,"" said Sherrilyn Ifill, a professor at University of Maryland School of Law and president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense fund, pointing to the Rodney King case. ""On the one hand, it's unfortunate. On the other hand, it's a really great thing that we have federal civil rights statutes."" In 1992, a jury in Simi Valley, California, acquitted four Los Angeles Police Department officers in the beating of Rodney King, but two of them were later convicted of violating his civil rights in a federal trial and served 32 months in prison. After Anthony Baez died by asphyxiation during an altercation with police in Bronx, New York, in 1994, the arresting officer, Francis Livoti, was acquitted on state charges, but later convicted in federal court of violating Baez's civil rights. As recently as April, the Justice Department found that the police department in Albuquerque, New Mexico, engaged in ""a pattern or practice of use of excessive force, including deadly force"" that violated people's civil rights. And on Thursday, Holder announced that a civil rights investigation had found that the Cleveland police department also engaged in unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. People may call on the federal government to step in on these cases because they place more trust in federal officials to deal with these matters. But when it comes to actually changing police tactics, there is still a long way to go, said Syracuse Professor Boyce Watkins. ""What's happened here in my opinion is yes, the federal government has gotten involved before with the police, but has that involvement led to meaningful progress?' asked Watkins, who pointed to continued allegations of corruption and unfair treatment by the LAPD years after the King case. ""I don't really know how effective the federal government has been in police reform."" Going beyond purely courtroom battles, it was President Harry S. Truman whose 1948 executive order integrated the armed forces. And the federal government's help was essential in many of the civil rights fights of the 1950s and 1960s. In 1957, it took federal troops ordered in by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to protect the nine black students trying to integrate Little Rock's Central High School. Still, federal involvement hasn't always provided meaningful protections or a change in the reality on the ground. Many of the federal civil rights statutes in use today have their roots in the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, Ifill said. That's when Congress enacted the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, at the urging of President Ulysses S. Grant. The law was meant to protect blacks from groups conspiring to deprive them of their constitutional rights, but it didn't stop decades of lynchings and other forms of violence perpetrated against blacks. But lasting change is Holder's goal. Arnwine said the activism of the Justice Department in recent years when it comes to civil rights has a lot to do with Holder himself. WATCH: Garner motionless after incident . She called him an attorney general with a level of commitment to racial justice that had not been seen since Nicholas Katzenbach, the nation's top law man under President Lyndon B. Johnson. While a deputy attorney general in 1963, Katzenbach confronted Alabama's staunch segregationist Gov. George C. Wallace on the steps of the University of Alabama so that two black students could register there. These latest investigations come at a time of change at the department, as Holder prepares to leave and the president's pick to replace him, Loretta Lynch, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, plans to take the helm and carry on Holder's work if she's confirmed by Congress early next year. In a statement released after the grand jury's decision in the Garner case was announced, Lynch said the federal investigation will be ""fair and through, and it will be conducted as expeditiously as possible.""","Focus in civil rights cases is turning to Washington .

"A senior staffer for a Republican congressman scolded President Obama's daughters for dressing like ""they deserve a spot at a bar"" and told them to ""try showing a little class"" in a Facebook post that has since gone viral, drawing her heavy criticism and prompting calls for her dismissal. Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Tennessee Rep. Steve Fincher and a former communications staffer for the Republican National Committee, wrote the screed against the First Daughters in a Facebook post on Thanksgiving. In it, she scolded them for their clothes and bored looks during Wednesday's turkey pardoning, and took aim at the President and First Lady for failing to ""respect their positions."" ""Dear Sasha and Malia: I get you're both in those awful teen years, but you're a part of the First Family, try showing a little class. At least respect the part you play,"" Lauten wrote in the post. ""Then again, your mother and father don't respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter,"" she added. ""So I'm guessing you're coming up a little short in the 'good role model' department."" While Sasha and Malia Obama, 13 and 16 years old, respectively, indeed both looked less than enthusiastic to accompany their father to the Turkey pardoning ceremony on Wednesday, their typically teenage glowers were met with amusement by multiple media outlets. Lauten, however, had some advice for the First Daughters, imploring them in the Facebook post to ""stretch yourself...rise to the occasion"" and ""act like being in the White House matters to you."" ""Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly don't make faces during televised, public events,"" she concluded. The post was tweeted out by a reporter for African-American media outlet The Root and quickly picked up traction across social media, prompting heavy criticism across the web. One Lauten detractor launched a petition on Change.org, a popular progressive organizing tool, calling for Lauten to be fired. Hours after the post went viral, Lauten returned to Facebook to publish an apology, admitting she ""quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager."" ""After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and re-reading my words online I can see more clearly just how hurtful my words were. Please know, those judgmental feelings truly have no place in my heart,"" she said. Lauten also pledged to ""learn and grow...from this experience."" Neither Lauten, her chief of staff Jessica Carter nor Fincher responded to requests for comment via email. The First Daughters, meanwhile, took an outing with their father to a local bookstore in Washington on Saturday, to highlight Small Business Saturday.","A Republican spokeswoman's comments about President Obama's daughters is causing a stir online.

"(CNN)I can't remember exactly how old I was when my mom went away for a night and left my older sister and me home alone. What I remember clearly though is the ""talking to"" I received when my mom returned and learned from our next-door neighbor that my sister and I had a party, which involved alcohol. ""I'm so disappointed in you,"" my mother would say over and over again, which were crushing words for a perfectionist straight-A student, who vowed never to let that happen again. And it didn't. But the story illustrates two challenges for parents: 1) What age is OK to leave your teens home alone overnight? and 2) What if something goes wrong when you do? Parents can't really rely on the law for answers, especially since only a few states set a minimum age that a child can be left home alone. Louise Sattler, a mom of two grown children in Los Angeles, said she never left her kids alone overnight until they were college age because of something that happened to a former colleague. That colleague left her high school son home alone and had the neighbors check up on him. ""Well, lo and behold, kids in the neighborhood found out there was a 'parent-free zone' and it all ended up in disaster,"" said Sattler, a psychologist, educational consultant and owner of a business providing sign language instruction. The night resulted in drunken teens, unruly arguments, even a pregnancy, according to Sattler. Some parents also considered suing the teen and his family, she added. So, to Sattler, the answer was saying no, until college, to any requests from her children to stay home alone overnight and even then, she said she begged them not to advertise their home as ""parent-free."" ""You may trust your kid, but in this digital age this is a recipe for chaos and trouble,"" she said. 'Trust and verify' Tricia Ferrara, a Philadelphia-area licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice for more than a decade, agrees. She said that even if you have done everything right to prepare your child, ""a predatory peer"" could well pounce on the opportunity to take advantage of you being away. Her advice is to ""trust and verify,"" she said. ""Kids with a solid track record of good, independent decisions should be given latitude and a long leash but not complete freedom,"" added Ferrara, author of the recently released ""Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now."" Some measure of adult oversight, such as neighbors or a family friend repeatedly checking in, is recommended, she said. Ferrara also stressed that every child is different in terms of when he or she can be alone, for how long and under what circumstances. Janis Brett Elspas said the maturity level of each of her kids is one of the main factors in deciding whether they can be left home alone. She said her oldest was 17 when he was left home alone while the rest of the family went on vacation in a foreign country. ""We really didn't worry that something would go wrong ... because he has proven how responsible he is,"" said Brett Elspas, founder of Mommy Blog Expert. ""Unfortunately, I can't say the same about our triplets, now 17, who we have deemed not to be mature enough to be left alone overnight, much less for a week while we travel abroad because they tend to be unintentionally careless."" Knowing your child can definitely help guide the decision on when it's OK to leave them alone for the weekend, said Julie Cole, a mother of six and a co-founder of Mabel's Labels, which provides labels for children's products and clothing. ""If your kid is a strong, independent older teen who does not get swayed by peers, chances are they are going to respect the family home, and it won't get destroyed in a house party,"" said Cole, who also blogs regularly about parenting. ""If your teenager has friends who are a bit on the cheeky side, and your child seems to be a bit of a follower, I would be reluctant to leave them alone."" 'He blew it in spades' Being home alone can be teenagers' first chance to experience what it feels like to be grown up, but if they make a misstep, it can hurt them for years to come. That is what Terry Greenwald, a divorced father of three in Alaska, said happened to his then-17-year-old son. Greenwald worked at a lodge and had an apartment below the lodge, and decided, after much discussion, that he could leave his son alone. ""I found out when I got home that before my plane even left the ground on my departure, he was sneaking his girlfriend through the trees and into the apartment,"" Greenwald said. ""To this day, it's something that comes up now and then as it was his first big chance to be grown up, and he blew it in spades."" Ferrara, the family therapist, said allowing children to stay home alone overnight is a process, not a decision. ""Good habits build a capable child,"" she said, so preparing them at younger ages by leaving them alone during short, planned outings or errands can help and watching how they respond to minor emergencies can give you a sense of their ability to handle a challenging situation of their own. Kelli Arena, a mom of three in Houston, has yet to leave her daughter, who just turned 17, alone for a night. Because she has younger kids also (a 13- and 14-year-old), she always felt that it would be too much to expect her daughter to take care of herself and her siblings if she and her husband went away. ""But with the college acceptances pouring on, reality has struck,"" said Arena, executive director of the Global Center for Journalism and Democracy at Sam Houston State University. ""We need to leave her on her own in a place she is comfortable to help ease the transition."" Arena said she's now looking at a time early in the new year she can leave her daughter alone for a weekend. ""We figure it's a good way for her to be on her own in a familiar environment. Of course, I'll make sure there is food!"" When do you think it's OK to leave teens home alone overnight or for a weekend?

"(CNN) -- In January 1999, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on live television that he was firing his defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai. The minister, Netanyahu argued, had colluded with his political rivals and was aiming to undermine the Prime Minister's authority. Mordechai would go on to lead a centrist party and play a pivotal role in the victory of Ehud Barak and the Labor Party over Netanyahu. Fifteen years later, and Netanyahu has again taken to the airwaves, announcing the firing of two senior Cabinet members. Is history set to repeat itself? On Tuesday, Netanyahu accused Finance Minister Yair Lapid and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, the main centrist leaders of his center-to-far-right coalition, of disloyalty and of undermining his authority, publicly criticizing his policies and conspiring to form an alternative coalition. As a result, Israel now heads to elections, tentatively scheduled for March. If you're scratching your head and wondering, ""Didn't Israel hold elections recently?"" then you're not alone. This Knesset, the 19th, will be one of the shortest serving parliaments in Israel's 66-year history. As a result, just two years after they last headed to the polls, Israeli voters and politicians are wondering aloud why these elections are necessary. But will the outcome of the elections resemble those of 1999, which prompted Netanyahu to take a hiatus from political life? Netanyahu is a leader with remarkably few confidants, and has never excelled at the art of personal politics. After three terms as prime minister, ""Netanyahu fatigue"" has set in across the political spectrum and even within his own party, and some have already suggested the election is effectively a referendum on the country's leader. And in some ways, Netanyahu really is vulnerable. Livni and Netanyahu had clashed over a ""basic law"" (akin to a constitutional amendment) to reaffirm Israel's status as the nation state of the Jewish people, a bill that attracted scathing critiques from, among others, President Ruvi Rivlin (of Netanyahu's own Likud party), and his predecessor Shimon Peres. Lapid and Netanyahu clashed over measures to deal with the politically explosive issue of the high cost of living and a growing wealth gap between Israelis. But perhaps most importantly, security issues -- especially the dramatic erosion of Israelis' sense of personal security over the past six months -- have undermined Netanyahu's position. After all, he has long prided himself on the relative calm during his years as Prime Minister. And, though hawkish, Netanyahu had been far more hesitant to go to war than some of his more dovish peers. Yet in the aftermath of the lengthy conflict in Gaza last summer, some Israelis were disappointed with Netanyahu's decision not to topple Hamas, which strengthened the political hand of right-wing leaders like Minister of the Economy Naftali Bennett of the Jewish Home party, a former aide of Netanyahu's who left the Prime Minister's office amid acrimony, and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, another former aide and ally of Netanyahu whose relations with the Prime Minister have seen several ups and downs. This has occurred against the backdrop of a wave of terrorist attacks against civilians, most notably a gruesome attack on a synagogue in Jerusalem, midprayer, which left five dead. A palpable sense of personal fear is apparent and, naturally, nothing motivates voters more. All this said, this is not 1999. When then-Defense Minister Mordechai left the Likud, he joined a cascade of respected, veteran leaders who had broken with the young, brash and inexperienced Prime Minister. Fast forward to today, and it is the veteran Netanyahu, a steady hand and a known commodity (for better or worse) who is firing a brash, inexperienced Lapid in the name of proper governance. The reality is that while public opinion currently holds Netanyahu at fault for the political crisis, it remains at a loss as to who might replace him. In general, in democracies, incumbents lose more than challengers win; when leaders are replaced it is usually because the voters are fed up with their reigning leaders. And yet, for a change of leadership, there must be a credible challenger there to pick up the pieces. Instead, today -- by attrition and political longevity -- Netanyahu has found himself seemingly alone as a major player in the political sphere. The challenge for the opposition is therefore formidable. The Israeli public has moved to the right and, with every terrorist attack, the hawkish camp solidifies its advantage. The most likely outcome, at present, would be a new Netanyahu government with a stronger right wing and religious base, including the ultra-Orthodox parties that were shunned from this coalition at Lapid's demand. Netanyahu may even bring weakened centrist figures back into the coalition, having lost their veto power in parliament. Indeed, even those dismissed this week by Netanyahu have so far refused to promise that they will not join another Netanyahu coalition. And yet, a Netanyahu defeat is not out of the question. He is the clear front-runner, but the campaign has barely begun, and party alignments are still unclear. Livni may well join forces with either Lapid or with Labor; a new party of former Likud minister Moshe Kahlon has yet to truly form but already shows considerable promise. In addition, several new entrants are expected in the political sphere as well, some of whom have impressive resumes in security, diplomacy and academia. It is by now a clichÃ© to call an Israeli election the most important ever. Instead, it is most likely that the outcome will be a continuation, or even accentuation, of current Israeli policy. But with the dramatic challenges Israel faces, domestically, regionally and internationally, expect the sense of malaise in Israeli politics to deepen. These elections may simply be a prelude to a deeper political crisis.","Natan Sachs: Benjamin Netanyahu more vulnerable than he seems .

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama will unveil his long-awaited immigration plan Thursday evening, changing rules governing deportations that could affect millions of undocumented immigrants and setting off an explosive battle with Republicans. Obama's prime-time address will be followed Friday by an event in Las Vegas, sources tell CNN. While exact details of his announcement aren't yet public, the basic outline of the plan, as relayed by people familiar with its planning, includes deferring deportation for the parents of U.S. citizens, a move that would affect up to 3.5 million people. ""Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken. Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for far too long,"" Obama said in a video posted on his Facebook page Wednesday. ""And so what I'm going to be laying out is the things that I can do with my lawful authority as President to make the system work better, even as I continue to work with Congress to encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem."" Obama invited congressional Democratic leaders to the White House for a dinner Wednesday night to discuss his plans for an executive order, a source told CNN. RELATED: 5 questions you should be asking about Obama and immigration . The President declared in June he wouldn't wait for Congress to pass a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system, initially saying he would announce changes by the end the summer. The decision was delayed until after the midterm elections, when the White House believed it wouldn't be caught up in campaign politics. But Republicans are expressing deep anger at the anticipated move, saying unilateral action on immigration would forestall any legislative action. Two House Republicans who would play a key role in crafting immigration legislation made a fresh call for Obama to hold off on his plans Wednesday -- and warned that if he goes ahead, they'll try to stop the White House from implementing his executive order. ""Instead of proceeding with ill-advised executive action, we implore you to work with Congress to enact legislation to address our broken immigration system,"" Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) and Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said in a letter to Obama. Related: 'Orange is the New Black' actress pushes Obama for immigration overhaul . ""We strongly urge you to respect the Constitution and abandon any unconstitutional, unilateral executive actions on immigration. Let's secure the border, enforce our immigration laws in the interior of the United States, and build a broad consensus for immigration reform,"" they wrote. ""Otherwise, as the chairmen of the committees with oversight over border security and our nation's immigration laws, we will be forced to use the tools afforded to Congress by the Constitution to stop your administration from successfully carrying out your plan."" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest chided the GOP during his briefing Wednesday, saying concerns about how Obama's immigration move could affect the government funding debate and presidential nominations in the weeks ahead are ""predicated on at least the premise that Republicans have been exceedingly cooperative with the president."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- the Nevada Democrat who will lose his post once Republicans take control of the chamber in January -- lauded Obama's move, saying the GOP forced his hand. ""Comprehensive immigration reform brings relief to families being torn apart by our broken system,"" he said. ""Comprehensive immigration reform is an economic issue and one we must address. That's why I have been so disappointed that Republicans have ducked, dodged and skirted taking up legislation this Congress forcing President Obama to act administratively."" The contours of Obama's announcement have been the subject of speculation among immigration activists for months, though the White House has yet to officially relay what Obama will announce when he speaks to the American people on Thursday night. Administration officials say a key part of the announcement will be allowing the parents of American citizens, who are undocumented immigrants themselves, to remain in the United States without the threat of deportation. That would include the parents of legal residents, but not the parents of children eligible for delayed deportation under a rule Obama enacted in 2012. Up to 3.6 million people would be affected by that change, according to an estimate from the Migration Policy Institute, though the figures are smaller if Obama's announcement includes a minimum number of years spent in the country. Mandating parents live in the U.S. for at least 5 years before becoming eligible would bring the number affected to 3.3 million; a 10-year minimum would bring it down further to an estimated 2.5 million people. Other potential areas of reform include extending the deportation deferment for immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Altering the age restrictions on that action could allow hundreds of thousands more people to remain in the United States. Officials also said the plan could include a stronger focus on deporting criminals who are undocumented immigrants and an expansion of worker visas in areas like technology. Lastly, the plan could include new resources to bolster security on the border. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the ""reforms will be comprehensive,"" and that border security measures will be included. Obama's position on immigration could be a popular one. Despite an overall wave of support for GOP candidates, 57% of this year's midterm election voters believe undocumented immigrants should have a chance to apply for legal status, while just 39% want them deported to the country they came from, CNN's exit polls found. Those exit polls found that 71% of U.S. midterm voters believe undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country legally if they meet certain requirements -- while 25% said those immigrants shouldn't be allowed to stay. A September CBS/New York Times poll found 51% saying Obama should use his executive powers to address immigration if Congress fails to act while 43% said he should not. A similar ABC/Washington Post survey earlier that month found 52% support for Obama acting on his own.

"Washington (CNN) -- Sunday marks the second anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre that killed twenty children and six teachers on December 14, 2012. And though Congress hasn't passed any gun reform laws in its wake, there's one senator who's made it his mission to persistently push for changes, even when no one's listening. For the past two years, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat, has been traveling to the Senate floor, month after month, to detail the growing numbers of people killed by gun violence. He calls these speeches, ""Voices of Victims."" Asked what drives him to continually make his plea, he said it's to keep ""the drum beat up on the Senate floor."" To him, telling victim's stories, identifying who they were, what they enjoyed, where they lived, personalizes the issue and hopefully makes it harder for his colleagues and state lawmakers to ignore. RELATED: Granderson: On guns, all we have is talk . ""There's no more personal issue than gun violence; every one of these stories is a life lost,"" he said. ""I'm hoping that over the long term, as I tell these stories, that it will help to open people's eyes."" ""It is beyond comprehension that Congress is watching this epidemic of school shootings and chooses to do nothing,"" Murphy added. Murphy's uphill battle for comprehensive gun control reform, however, is met with significant challenges. Since the shooting at Sandy Hook, and the many that followed, there's been no legislation on the issue. After a failed vote on a bill that would have broadened background checks for gun purchasers in April 2013, there's been no sign of any additional legislation. And with Republicans maintaining the House and winning the Senate as a result of the midterm election, Murphy's push for gun control legislation and background checks hasn't gotten any easier. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is a staunch supporter of the National Rifle Association and 90 percent of NRA-backed candidates won their seats during midterm elections. ""[The NRA] is absolutely pulling one over on their members,"" Murphy said. ""The NRA was for background checks a decade ago, and they changed their position, despite the fact that their members support background checks."" A new Pew survey released earlier this week indicates additional challenges for gun control advocates. According to the survey, the number of people supporting gun rights now offsets those who support gun control with 52 percent of Americans siding with gun rights, and 46 percent siding with gun control. On Wednesday, Murphy acknowledged the challenges for achieving gun control legislation with the Republican-led Congress during a Senate floor speech, but hinted he might be finding a new way to challenge the issue. ""I get it that we're not going to get a background checks bill passed through the Senate in the next two years, but why not work on mental health funding?"" he asked. Either way, Murphy is not giving up. He acknowledged that fighting for stricter gun laws is a lifelong campaign for the families affected by Sandy Hook. ""It gives me hope that if I stick with this, families will stick with this alongside me,"" he said.","The second anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre is Sunday .

"A military plan to retake the northern Iraqi city of Mosul from ISIS could begin as soon as January using Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces, a U.S. official confirmed to CNN. The current plan is to assemble about 1,000 troops, with Iraqi forces approaching Mosul from the south and Peshmerga forces from the west, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  But everything in the plan is ""conditions based,"" and the exact timing and size of the force to be used remains to be determined, the official said. It's unclear how long such an operation would take to be successful. The idea is for groups to enter Mosul and attempt to establish initial footholds. They would then seek to expand their areas of military control, pushing out the militant terror group that also refers to itself as Islamic State, according to the official. U.S. and coalition aircraft would provide support from the air. It is not expected that any U.S. troops would be on the ground to locate targets for aircraft to strike, but Iraqi and Peshmerga commanders could communicate targets to the coalition, the officials said. The U.S. military is planning to train 12 Iraqi and Peshmerga brigades and plans to start arming members of the Sunni Anbari tribe, according to a military officials. All of this will be a series of judgment calls and agreements with Iraqis as to how many troops are involved and when they're ready to go, the U. S. official said, and should not be thought of as set in stone. ISIS released a new video Friday titled ""A visit to Mosul"", which shows peaceful scenes in the city and claims that Christians and Yazidis there have now ""entered Islam.""  The video is in stark contrast to the violence usually shown in ISIS propaganda.","U.S. military official says there is a plan to retake Mosul from ISIS .

"I have always romanticized the family ski vacation -- that's before I actually started skiing with my own children. What no one warns you about is that skiing with young kids can suck the relaxation right out of you. I am the ski Sherpa, schlepping my kids' boots, skis and poles, as hand warmers and granola bars bulge from my pockets. By the time I get to the slopes, even in the midst of a Polar Vortex, I am sweating right through my Hot Chillys long underwear. Welcome to Vail and the Sachs family ski trip of 2014. My kids are pumped to be in Vail, home to several Olympic athletes, and the Sochi Games have just kicked off. The conditions are fabulous, with snow dumping at an exceptional rate. After a day of lessons, both of my kids are officially better skiers than I. And I am wiped. My thighs are aching from plowing through the 20 inches of fresh powder. It was glorious; I'm just pooped. If it weren't for my debilitating headache at 10,000 feet, a cocktail would be in order. But alas, it's Colorado and legalized weed has given après ski a new meaning -- so I start weighing my options. When you are traveling with precocious tween kids who are super judgy about any type of smoking and recoil from the stench of beer, how do you even broach the subject of marijuana? Mommy needs her glass of wine is now mommy needs her hit of weed? It feels wrong, but maybe that's why it's so exciting to even contemplate. Still, my kids are not sophisticated enough to understand the nuances or subtleties of life or why parents do what they do to relax and reinvigorate. There are some things they just don't need to know, and I decide this is one of them. At their age, it's probably best to keep it black and white. Drugs, drinking and sex are all bad -- very bad! I considered drawing others into my quest for the green stuff. We were staying at the gorgeous, new Solaris luxury residences in Vail. I was assigned a concierge named Ilse to do everything from stock my fridge to schedule my son's snowmobiling adventure. Could I also ask Ilse to hook me up with pot? I felt like I was 16 years old again, trying to score some wine coolers. It may be legal, but it still seemed illicit. I couldn't bring myself to ask Ilse, but I did check the weed situation with Bob Armour, my awesome ski instructor who also happens to be the former mayor of Vail. They wear many hats in this town. Bob confirmed that the Vail Resort is pot-free and smoking on their magnificent mountain is illegal. It's federal land and lighting up outside is a big no-no. They take it seriously in Vail -- I get it. No one wants stoned skiers near themselves or their kids. But I would argue that boozing boarders are just as scary and there's no shortage of alcohol at ski resorts in America. So while weed wasn't for sale anywhere in Eagle County, a quick Google search and a click on the Best Buds app turned up a half-dozen dispensaries within an hour's drive. In Colorado you can ski a bowl in Vail and smoke a bowl in Breckenridge, all in a few hours. The PR folks may scoff at that tagline, not wanting to sully the sophisticated image of Colorado skiing, but it could be a boon for the industry. Utah has Sundance; Colorado has Mary Jane. And after a day of hard skiing, you may just want to skip the Hot Toddy and relax with a tasty pot edible instead. With my husband's enthusiastic support, I went in search of the Cannabis Club in Breckenridge. It felt a little stealth as I told my kids that mommy needed to run a few errands before Valentine's Day. So I cranked up some tunes in my rental minivan and hit Interstate 70 to downtown Breckenridge, where the marijuana market is nestled along the picturesque main street across from a Starbucks. After consulting the Cannabis Club's petite, blonde, 20-something budtender -- that's what they call themselves - I bought a $25 chocolate chip cranberry ""Lucie in the Sky"" cookie and some THC-infused chocolate truffles in a shiny, silver package. I considered the gummies, but the chocolate seemed more festive. A couple of doors down, I found a fancy candy store for my kids. Mission accomplished. Chocolate-covered strawberries for my children, THC chocolate truffles for my man -- happy Valentine's Day! Even though it was all perfectly legit, I felt a little giddy. Old habits, I suppose. At night after the kids were asleep, my husband and I nibbled on the jumbo cookie and watched some Olympic slopestyle, waiting for Lucie to work her magic. She was to be my masseuse-by-pot-proxy, easing my tired and aching body into a blissful, peaceful state. After all, I never can break away to a spa on a family ski trip. It's too time consuming and it's tough to grab an alone moment when we are away. But Lucie, well, she's conveniently sitting on my nightstand waiting to be appreciated. We made sure to keep Lucie locked in our bedroom so as not to confuse her with my kids' cookies in the kitchen.  Earlier, my budtender warned me to only eat a quarter of the cookie, but I must have consumed more than was recommended because the next eight hours turned into a heart-racing, chest-thumping, head-spinning trip. The potency of edibles is apparently unreliable, and they can pack a punch. Who knew? The next morning after some strong coffee, I was back in the heated, Wi-Fi gondola, not only happy that I could finally stand, but psyched to squeeze in a few more hours of Vail powder before the trek back East. My THC cookie didn't give me the relaxing zen that I was hoping to have, but I didn't regret the experience. Next time I could do without the heart palpitations and pay closer attention to my budtender's recommendations. Perhaps the oatmeal raisin cookie would have been mellower. A week later, my kids were still talking about the 50,000-plus vertical feet they shredded as recorded on their handy EpicMix app. As for me and my chocolate truffles, it's illegal to transport any form of cannabis over state lines. Those weed amnesty drop boxes popping up at airports around the state are probably getting a lot of action, and not just from stoners. Colorado skiing has always been known for its Rocky Mountains and blue skies; now après ski gives the family ski trip a whole new high. Parents, weigh in below: While on a trip with the kids, would you use pot to relax -- the same way you might have a drink after the kids are asleep?","Wendy Sachs wanted to try using pot to relax during a family vacation in Colorado .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Another Bush? Another Clinton? In reporting on the 2016 presidential campaign, much of the media will likely echo the theme that Barbara Bush set forth during a C-SPAN interview in January, in which the former first lady said that -- while she believed that her son, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, was ""the best qualified person to run for president "" -- Americans should widen the pool of applicants. ""I think this is a great American country, great country, and if we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office, that's silly,"" she said. Many Americans would seem to agree. There is even a new online petition that was launched this week urging Americans to take a stand against ""hereditary family rule."" The organizer is a liberal online activism group called RootsAction.org, which notes that in seven presidential elections in a row, spanning from 1980 to 2004, there was a ""Bush"" or a ""Clinton"" on the presidential ticket of a major party. Organizers are worried that this trend is likely to start up again in 2016. You'll hear this sentiment a lot over the next year or so â€” that Jeb's biggest problem is ""Bush fatigue"" and that electing Hillary Clinton means reliving ""the Clinton years."" Supposedly, the biggest liability for these potential candidates is the burden of their last names. That's ridiculous. For these two likely presidential hopefuls, their names are the least of their worries. Here are the five more formidable obstacles that could keep Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush away from the White House: . -- The Elevator Pitch. Neither Hillary nor Jeb seems capable of explaining, clearly and succinctly, why she or he wants to be president. I don't think they could do it if they had all day, let alone, as the saying goes, in the time it takes to complete an elevator ride. The same problem plagued Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, in 1980, and it crippled his insurrectionary bid against the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter. In the case of Hillary and Jeb, the answer can't simply be: ""Well, this is a family tradition. And it's my turn."" We need to know why they want to be president, and why the country would be better off if they reached that goal. -- The ""EQ"" Factor. Hillary is no Bill Clinton, and Jeb is no George W. Bush. Both the 42nd president and the 43rd had a special gift of being able to relate to voters. They were likable, and both genuinely seemed to enjoy being around people. They were polarizing figures, but the half of America that liked them did so intensely. They connected emotionally with voters by sharing stories, memories and values. You either have that ability, or you don't. Neither Hillary nor Jeb has it. Either one would make a great president. But presidents are not appointed. They're elected. Americans elect people to whom they can relate. And we'll never know if we relate to you, if you don't open up. --The Happy Warrior. Americans want candidates who are sunny, optimistic and uplifting. Whether he is talking about immigration or economic development, Jeb Bush likes to use the word: ""aspirational."" He understands that Americans want a president who leads them not just forward, but also up. But he doesn't practice what he preaches. He rarely looks happy when talking about running for president. The same goes for Hillary Clinton, who seems weary when the subject comes up, as if she has been carrying around for the last decade the enormous weight of breaking what her supporters like to call the ""ultimate glass ceiling."" These two don't look ""aspirational."" They look anguished. -- The Fire. Running for president is a long and brutal journey and the folks who pull it off are the ones with a burning intensity inside of them. Excitement and confidence are contagious, and people respond to candidates who speak from the heart and have an emotional stake in the issues. Many Democrats are responding to the passion of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and they hope she runs for president. Many Republicans get excited by the likes of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, or Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The most valuable weapon a candidate has isn't charisma, or experience, or a war chest. It's passion. If you don't have it, don't bother running. It's not clear that Hillary and Jeb have it. -- The Chore of Reconciliation. Getting elected president is about getting your base to fall in line even if they haven't fallen in love. For Hillary, the challenge is bringing together the ""Warren-istas"" who like to go to war with the rich and the Wall Street business interests that get skittish when Democrats sing populist anthems. For Jeb, the heavy lift is uniting Tea Party radicals who have declared war against the GOP establishment with moderate voices that want a more inclusive party. It's been said that you can't serve two masters. But, as Hillary and Jeb may be about to learn, it's also true that you can't advance two narratives â€” especially when they are at odds. The 2016 election will not be about last names. It'll be about what elections are usually about: the candidates who are running and what kind of people they are. You can't spin that, or cover it up. It comes out in the end. And it goes a long way toward deciding who gets to the White House and who goes home empty-handed.","Ruben Navarrette: Aside from famous names, Bush, Clinton share a problem .
Neither Jeb nor Hillary can say succintly why they want to be president, he says .
They don't connect with people on an emotional level as Bill Clinton, George W. Bush did, he says ."
"The Secret Service is stretched ""beyond its limits"" and needs more training, more staff and a director from outside its ranks -- and the White House needs a better fence -- an independent review has found. An eight-page executive summary of the report, produced by a panel of four outside experts appointed by the Department of Homeland Security, was released Thursday. The report said the congressional budget process has left Secret Service directors guessing how much more they might be able to squeeze out of appropriators each year and building their plans around that -- without looking at ""how much the mission, done right, actually costs."" It said the Secret Service likely needs a funding bump, and that its handling of its budgetary process has led to fewer and fewer hours for training. The average special agent on the President's protective detail received just 42 hours of training in 2013, while its Uniformed Division officers got an average of just about 25 minutes of training each, the report said. ""Providing more time for training requires increased staffing, but the Secret Service needs more agents and officers even beyond the levels required to allow for in-service training,"" the report said. ""The President and other protectees cannot receive the best possible protection when agents and officers are deployed for longer and longer hours with fewer and fewer days off."" Interim Secret Service director testifies on agency's failures . The White House also needs a new fence, the panel said. It recommended that the 7.5-foot fence be at least four or five feet taller, without horizontal bars that make for easy hand and footholds and with its top curved outward. ""Any of these adjustments, the panel is certain, can be made without diminishing the aesthetic beauty or historic character of the White House grounds,"" the report said. More important, the panel said, is the Secret Service's leadership. It recommended that the director ""come from outside the service"" who is ""removed from organizational traditions and personal relationships"" can make the kind of top-to-bottom overhaul of the group that the panel said is necessary. Opinion: Do we want a fortress White House? The panel said it heard from both the 50 Secret Service members and 120 outside officials it interviewed that the service is too ""insular"" today. ""From agents to officers to supervisors, we heard a common desire: More resources would help, but what we really need is leadership,"" the report said. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson had tapped the panel to conduct a broad review of the Secret Service after a Sept. 19 incident in which a man climbed the fence, ran across the north lawn and ran into the White House before agents stopped him. The review was conducted by Tom Perrelli, a former associate attorney general; Mark Filip, a former deputy attorney general; Danielle Gray, a former cabinet affairs secretary; and Joseph Hagin, the former White House deputy chief of staff for operations. How the Secret Service could beef up White House security . Johnson called the panel's recommendations -- detailed in an executive summary made public on Thursday -- ""astute, thorough and fair."" ""It is now up to the leadership of the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that all the recommendations are carefully considered,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""In fact, some of the panel's recommendations are similar to others made in past agency reviews, many of which were never implemented,"" he said. ""This time must be different.""","An independent review of the Secret Service has found that it needs more training and more staff .

"NASA will have to wait at least one more day to see how its new Orion spacecraft flies. The space agency scrubbed Thursday morning's test launch in Florida after a series of delays, the last of which happened because some liquid-oxygen fuel and drain valves failed to open during the countdown, NASA said. The launch tentatively has been rescheduled for 7:05 a.m. ET Friday. The launch of Orion -- a craft designed to eventually explore deep space -- is to be one of NASA's biggest moments since the shuttle era ended in 2011. NASA spent most of Thursday morning's nearly 2½-hour launch window trying to work out various obstacles and kinks before scrubbing the launch around 9:40 a.m. ET. The first delay involved a boat that came too close to the launch area; more delays came because of wind gusts. When the countdown resumed, valves failed to open in the boosters, eventually leading to the scrubbing. A new beginning . NASA hopes Orion will usher in a new era: Eventual human exploration of deep space. ""We haven't had this feeling in awhile, since the end of the shuttle program,"" Mike Sarafin, Orion flight director at Johnson Space Center, said in a preflight briefing on Wednesday. Orion looks like a throwback to the Apollo era, but it is roomier and designed to go far beyond the moon: to an asteroid and eventually to Mars. ""It is, I think, consistent with those -- the beginning of shuttle and beginning of Apollo,"" said Mark Geyer, NASA Orion program manager. ""I think it's in the same category."" When it becomes fully operational, Orion's crew module will be able to carry four people on a 21-day mission into deep space or six astronauts for shorter missions. By comparison, the Apollo crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to 12 days. Orion's crew module is 16.5 feet in diameter and Apollo was 12.8 feet in diameter, NASA said. Orion is expected to take up its first crew in 2021. During this test flight, Orion will climb to an altitude of 3,600 miles (15 times higher than the International Space Station) and will orbit Earth twice. Four and half hours later, it will splash down in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Baja California. Two U.S. Navy ships, the amphibious transport dock ship USS Anchorage and the Military Sealift Command rescue and salvage ship USNS Salvor, will help NASA recover the capsule. Charles Bolden Op Ed: NASA's Mars milestone . Once in orbit, Orion should send back some amazing pictures of Earth, NASA said. If the weather cooperates, NASA said a drone will provide a live video feed of the splashdown. Though Orion's first flight won't have people on it, it won't go up empty. It will carry the names of more than a million people packed on a dime-sized microchip. ""Sesame Street"" is sending up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight, including Cookie Monster's cookie and Ernie's rubber ducky. Also going up: an oxygen hose from an Apollo 11 lunar spacesuit and a small sample of lunar soil.

"(CNN) -- In the wake of this month's Senate report graphically detailing acts of torture by the CIA at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere, the American Psychological Association announced it is actively investigating collusion of its members with the torture program at Guantanamo. Meanwhile, a decision last week by my own professional association, the American Institute of Architects, or AIA, suggests that impunity for all may be the order of the day. Despite years of advocacy and formal requests, the AIA -- which claims as its members a majority of the roughly 110,000 architects in the United States -- has officially declined to add specific language to its code of ethics that would prohibit the design of torture chambers in U.S. prisons and around the world. In doing so, it cites anti-trust concerns and the potential difficulty of enforcing the prohibition, but it ignores the claims of human rights. To be sure, the AIA's ethics code contains aspirational language that broadly states, ""Members should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors."" Contrast that, for example, with the code of the American Medical Association or the World Medical Association Tokyo Declaration on Torture, which reads, ""The physician shall not provide any premises, instruments, substances, or knowledge to facilitate the practice of torture."" That leaves providing the premises for torture up to us architects, and as far as the AIA is concerned, we are open for business. Yes, the prisons at Guantanamo had architects. The design of Camp 6 was based on the Lenawee County, Michigan, jail, according to its architect. Other camps were built with prefabricated steel prison cells, a popular jail-building technology that may well have been used to construct the CIA's ""black site"" prisons overseas. The only apparent justification for the additional expense and complexity of building on such remote sites with no access to local labor or building materials was that these were places where the legal system could not interfere with indefinite detention and ""enhanced interrogation techniques."" The AIA's decision not to prohibit design for torture is not just about a handful of egregious projects, however, despite the horrific and planned-for consequences for some of the occupants taken to those buildings. It's also about the design of spaces in more conventional prisons intended for prolonged solitary confinement: a practice roundly regarded as a form of torture by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture. These organizations are but some of the human rights advocates that wrote letters urging the AIA to enact a prohibition. Here in the United States, about 20,000 people are held in solitary confinement in one of 45 or so specially designed ""supermax"" prisons, and some 60,000 more are held in ""segregation wings"" and ""security housing units"" in state prisons and ""the hole"" in county jails. While architects cannot be held responsible for unintended uses of the spaces they design, the intention of most of these spaces is clear from the get-go. The use of remote-controlled doors, individualized cellular ""recreation yards"" and solid cell fronts with special pass-through slots are all architectural features that enable and deepen isolation, leading inexorably to psychological pain. Half of all prison suicides happen to the approximately 4% of people in solitary confinement. Architecture facilitates this suffering and these deaths. In the face of the Senate's torture report, citizens can by and large only watch the different branches of government contest what happened. But just as all Americans are stained and put at risk by our country's reputation for torture, all of us have opportunities within the multiple roles we play in life to reject torture and enact accountability. As citizens, it is our responsibility to vote out torturers and to demand prosecutions of perpetrators so that torture will never happen again. Likewise, all licensed professionals have a responsibility to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. And, for me and my fellow architects, we must further protect our values by changing building codes and industry standards as new challenges emerge (often after a major building disaster). The unwillingness of American's leading architectural association to prohibit the design of torture facilities is a shocking, shameful and deeply troubling statement. It refuses to place any limit on the potential role of design in human rights violations, even the most egregious. Accountability begins at home. Unless and until the AIA revisits the issue, American architects are represented by a professional association whose ethical boundaries include the facilitation of torture. So, back to business: How far apart should those ceiling shackles be? What dimensions did you want for that waterboard? And of course I think it all looks best in black.

"They were words heard around the world as investigators searched for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. Weeks ago, Malaysian authorities said the last message from the airplane cockpit was, ""All right, good night."" The sign-off to air traffic controllers, which investigators said was spoken by the plane's copilot, was among the few concrete details officials released in a mystery that's baffled investigators and drawn global attention since the Boeing 777 disappeared with 239 people aboard mid-flight on March 8. There's only one problem. It turns out, it wasn't true. On Monday, Malaysia's Transport Ministry said the final voice transmission from the cockpit of Flight 370 was actually ""Good night Malaysian three seven zero."" Malaysian authorities gave no explanation for the discrepancy between the two quotes. And authorities are still trying to determine whether it was the plane's pilot or copilot who said them. The new language is routine and is not a sign that anything untoward occurred aboard the flight, said CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo. But the change in wording weeks into the search for the missing plane raises questions about how Malaysian officials have handled the investigation. ""It speaks to credibility issues, unfortunately,"" Schiavo said. ""We haven't had a straight, clear word that we can have a lot of fidelity in,"" said Michael Goldfarb, former chief of staff at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. ""We have the tragedy of the crash, we have the tragedy of an investigation gone awry and then we have questions about where we go from here."" No matter what the pilots' last words were, it's hard to understand what they mean without more details from authorities about what they said and how they said it, CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien told ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Monday. ""Without the preceding information ... either the transcript or the recordings themselves, it's difficult to know what any of that really means,"" he said. ""And that's the problem with this investigation, which has been so opaque."" Malaysian authorities have defended their handling of the situation. Acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Monday that authorities were not hiding anything by declining to release some details of the missing flight. Some details are part of ongoing investigations into what happened to the plane, he said. ""We are not hiding anything,"" he said. ""We are just following the procedure that is being set."" Source: Plane's turn considered 'criminal act' A Malaysian government source told CNN Monday that the airliner's turn off course is being considered a ""criminal act,"" either by one of the pilots or someone else onboard the missing airliner. And in a background briefing given to CNN, Malaysian investigators said they believed the plane was ""flown by someone with good flying knowledge of the aircraft."" Several friends of Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah said they refuse to believe he could have been the ""criminal"" controlling the plane. Rallying to his defense, they showed CNN's Nic Robertson pictures of him at flight school. ""I think finally it will come to a stage where people think of him as a hero when things come out,"" friend Jason Lee said. ""I think he is a hero."" A senior Malaysian government official last week told CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes that authorities have found nothing in days of investigating the two pilots that leads them to any motive, be it political, suicidal or extremist. And an ongoing FBI review of the two pilots' hard drives, including one in a flight simulator Zaharie had built at his home, has not turned up a ""smoking gun,"" a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN last week. In a Facebook post, the captain's daughter lashed out at a British tabloid that claimed to quote her criticizing her father. ""You should consider making movies since you are so good at making up stories and scripts out of thin air,""  Aishah Zaharie wrote. ""May God have mercy on your souls."" Several leads dry up as search ramps up . Potential leads on the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 keep coming. So do the setbacks and frustrations. Ten military planes, a civilian jet and nine ships are part of Tuesday's Indian Ocean search, which spans a swath west of Perth that's 120,000 square kilometers (46,300 square miles), the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. Monday's search ended without finding anything significant, Australian officials said. Four orange objects spotted by search aircraft and earlier described as promising turned out be nothing more than old fishing gear, they said. Finding possible leads that turn out to be trash, fishing gear or jellyfish isn't easy for search teams, U.S. Navy Cmdr. William Marks told CNN's ""AC360."" ""You have that excitement, and then when it is garbage or seaweed or something like that, it's hard, it's hard to realize you didn't find anything,"" he said. ""But you just keep at it and you keep at it. And this is what we do. This is what we train for."" U.S. Navy officials loaded underwater locating gear aboard an Australian naval ship and set out to sea Monday evening, but won't be able to use the equipment until investigators narrow the search zone. The gear includes a pinger locator that's towed behind a ship and scans for the sound of the locator beacon attached to the plane's flight data recorder. Also onboard is an underwater drone that can scan the ocean floor for debris. It will take the ship, the Ocean Shield, three days just to get to the search zone, leaving precious little time to locate the plane's flight data recorders before the batteries on its locator beacon run out. The batteries are designed to last 30 days; the plane has been missing for 24 days. Under favorable sea conditions, the pingers can be heard 2 nautical miles away. But high seas, background noise, wreckage or silt can all make pingers harder to detect. In this case, searchers barely know where to look at all. ""We are searching a vast area of ocean, and we are working on quite limited information,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters Monday. ""Nevertheless, the best brains in the world are applying themselves to this task. ... If this mystery is solvable, we will solve it."" Late last week, the search area shifted more than 600 miles after what authorities described as ""a new credible lead."" But a Wall Street Journal report Monday night, citing anonymous people familiar with the matter, said before that crews had searched for three days in the wrong location due to ""lapses in coordination among countries and companies"" trying to find the missing jet. What happened? Andy Pasztor, one of the reporters who wrote the story, said it boiled down to poor coordination between two parts of the investigation: one dealing with satellite data, and the other one dealing with fuel consumption and aircraft performance. ""And so what we're left with is sort of a three-day gap where it's clear that folks were definitely looking in the wrong place,"" he said. Despite false leads and other setbacks that have plagued the search, officials have vowed to keep looking. ""The effort is ramping up, not winding down,"" Abbott told CNN on Monday. Malaysia will ask the United States about the possibility of deploying more military assets, Hishammuddin said Monday. U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Monday that he will consider any additional requests from Hishammuddin. ""I don't know what additional requests he will make of me,"" he said. ""I certainly will listen carefully to whatever those are. ... We're providing everything that we can provide, as are other countries."" Get up to speed . Relatives' demands . Family members of people onboard Flight 370 have accused Malaysian officials of giving them confusing, conflicting information since the plane vanished more than three weeks ago. On Monday, dozens of Chinese family members visited a Kuala Lumpur temple. They chanted, lit candles and meditated. ""Chinese are kindhearted people,"" said Jiang Hui, the families' designated representative. ""But we can clearly distinguish between the good and evil. We will never forgive for covering the truth from us and the criminal who delayed the rescue mission."" Jiang asked Malaysia to apologize for announcing March 24 that the plane had crashed, despite the lack of any ""direct evidence."" At the daily press briefing, Hishammuddin responded, saying Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak had not used the word ""crash"" or mentioned a lack of survivors in his announcement that the plane's flight had ""ended"" in the southern Indian Ocean. He described a meeting Saturday between Malaysian authorities and Flight 370 relatives as ""the most difficult meeting I've ever attended."" ""The families are heartbroken. For many, the strain of the past few weeks has been unbearable,"" he said. He said Malaysia will hold a high-level briefing for families where experts will explain some of the data and methodology used to guide the search. He also said authorities have discussed with the families what happens if they are unable to find debris from the missing plane. But he declined to discuss it with reporters Monday, saying ""to be fair to the families, that is something I would not want to share with the public at the moment."" Beijing has also publicly slammed Malaysia's efforts to find the Boeing 777. Of the 239 people aboard the jetliner, 154 were Chinese. But Malaysia says it's done its best with what it has. ""History will judge us as a country that has been very responsible,""  Hishammuddin said.

"Washington (CNN)Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said on Sunday he will release 250,000 emails from his two terms in office and write an eBook outlining his governing philosophy. The moves have set the political sphere atwitter with speculation he's closer than ever to deciding to run for president in 2016. In what appears to be a move of classic political procedure -- getting ahead of the opposition -- Bush told WPLG-TV that his intention is to promote transparency. ""Part of serving or running both of them is about transparency,"" he said. ""I'll let people make up their minds."" Further evidence a presidential run might be looming is a report in the Miami Herald that Bush recently lost 15 pounds, per an unnamed source. Bush also admitted it's been ""kind of fun"" to go back and look back at previous campaigns to remind himself that it's possible to ""move the needle"" if you run with big ideas. ""That's what you need right now in America,"" said the brother of former President George W. Bush and son of former President George H.W. Bush. By controlling the release of the emails and writing a book to accompany them, Bush has the opportunity to frame potential controversial subjects, like his support of the Common Core education policy and immigration reform. Well aware he holds some positions out of step with the conservative wing of his party, Bush admits, ""I am who I've been."" An eBook, too, is noteworthy for Bush, who hasn't run for office since 2002 -- before the invention of the iPhone. The release of a digital product might serve as a flag that the former governor is prepared to build a modernized, digital campaign. ""I was digital before digital was cool I guess,"" Bushed joked about emailing. ""Now it's commonplace."" The book comes as Bush's finances -- including overseas investment and his work for venture capital firms -- have come under scrutiny. The released emails could cast light on an already controversial narrative beginning to form or, more likely, serve as a timely distraction. Bush says he is going to make up his mind about running in ""short order,"" and he plans to release the emails ""sometime early next year.""","Jeb Bush said Sunday he will release 250,000 emails from his time as Florida governor .

"(CNN)Police on Friday arrested Dustin Diamond, better known as ""Screech"" in the early 1990s sitcom ""Saved by the Bell,""  in a stabbing incident at a bar in  Port Washington, Wisconsin. Diamond, 37, of Port Washington, was charged  with three misdemeanors: second-degree recklessly endangering safety; carrying a concealed weapon; and disorderly conduct, use of a dangerous weapon, according to a press release from the police. He was being held Friday in lieu of $10,000 bond. According to an arrest report released Friday afternoon, the stabbing took place late Thursday night during an argument in the Grand Avenue Saloon. Diamond said he and his girlfriend, Amanda Schutz, 27, were inside the bar when a group of intoxicated people started behaving in a rude and insulting manner, leading him to believe ""there was going to be a brawl,"" the report said. He said he turned to close his account and get their coats, but when he looked back, his girlfriend was bleeding and two men were holding her hair, the report said. Diamond said he moved toward his girlfriend when a man grabbed him, the report said. Diamond said he he might have stabbed the man with a pen used to sign a credit card receipt, but later conceded he was armed with the knife, the report said. ""Diamond stated that he did not intentionally stab the individual in the bar but that chaos broke out and people were grabbing at him and that he swung his arms to break free,"" the report stated. Diamond and Schutz drove away from the bar and were stopped by police, who said they found a ""stiletto folding knife with a 3.75-inch blade, which uses a thumb stud and assisted opening mechanism."" Police said the tip of the knife was moist. The man identified as the stabbing victim told police he didn't see a knife or initially feel being cut. Police said the wound was not life threatening. Other people in the bar said the fracas started when women started shoving each other, the police report said.. One witness told police a woman was upset because people were taking pictures of her and her boyfriend. Schutz was charged with disorderly conduct and released, police said. Port Washington is north of Milwaukee on Lake Michigan. Diamond appeared on ""Saved by the Bell"" as awkward nerd Samuel ""Screech"" Powers from 1989 to 1993 and later appeared in various spinoffs of the hit show. In September, Lifetime aired a movie about life on the set loosely based on a book written by Diamond. The book garnered negative criticism for Diamond from castmates, who said it was inaccurate.

"(CNN)Last weekend, a 17-year-old apparently committed suicide in Ohio. And because she was transgender, many assigned a political or social or religious narrative to her story before even fully recognizing her death. A disturbing trend when you consider the string of recent dramatic and, it must be said, senseless deaths that have crowded the nation's headlines. Looking through the agenda-driven prisms that helped define 2014, they all appear disconnected. But when we pause, we can see they are anything but. Consider what happened earlier this month, when Kathleen McCartney, president of Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, sent a campuswide email in support of students protesting grand jury decisions not to charge the police officers who killed Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in Staten Island. In it she said: ""We are united in our insistence that all lives matter."" Later, McCartney was forced to apologize. You see, because she didn't specifically say ""black lives matter,"" she was accused of minimizing the pain and experience that was specific to the black community. I would argue ""all lives matter"" is every bit as revolutionary of a rallying cry and should hardly be said in shame. I thought about her apology after a man who was reportedly mentally ill drove from Baltimore to Brooklyn and shot two police officers in the head while they were at work. And I'm thinking about her apology now as my heart aches over the suicide of Leelah Alcorn, the teenager who took apparently took her life on Sunday. ""The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights,"" she wrote on Tumblr hours before stepping in front of a tractor-trailer on Interstate 71. She also wrote: ""my death needs to mean something,"" obviously feeling her life did not. If you fail to see the connection between Alcorn, the fallen police officers, Brown and Garner, then you are missing something important about what binds a society. Laws and culture form sturdy beams, but the foundation of civilization is empathy. It is a slender but invaluable thread that allows us to communicate with those who speak a different language, explains why men double over at the sight of a male being struck in the groin, why our own eyes fill with tears at others' sorrow and loss and why laughter is contagious. Our innate ability to identify with the needs and experiences of others -- to have compassion, empathy -- is the very thing that makes us human. Thus, the less empathy we have for others -- the less ""all lives matter"" to us -- the less civilized we become. The less civilized we become, the less human we are. Of course, the notion that ""all lives matter"" does not speak directly to the implicit biases that have led to the criminal justice system's mistreatment of people of color. It does not highlight the sacrifices law enforcers make or the dangers they face each day. ""All lives matter"" does not note the discrimination and ostracization of transgender people that apparently led to the torment felt by Leelah Alcorn -- discrimination and ostracization that even occurs within the larger lesbian, gay and bisexual community. But it does remind us that before we are black, white, Christian, liberal or gay, we are human. Because in the end, the lapses in humanity that led to each of the high-profile deaths that have rocked our culture may be different in their particulars, but they are the same in the pain experienced by loved ones left behind. Over my 20-plus years as a journalist, I have covered numerous deaths. I can tell you about the agony in the eyes of the mother of Matthew Shepard, the 21-year-old gay man who was pistol-whipped, tied to a fence and eventually died back in 1998; it is similar to the pain in the eyes of Trayvon Martin's mother. The cries I heard at the memorial service for Michael Brown this past summer were as hard to hear as the cries I heard at a service for Wes Leonard, a 16-year-old who collapsed and died on his high school's basketball court three years ago. Again, the circumstances surrounding each death are vastly different from one another. But when a parent buries a child, the hurt is hard to differentiate. There is a time to dissect mitigating circumstances, but it should not come before experiencing humanity and learning something from how we feel. It is a constant struggle to hold on to what connects us. Especially when so many forces -- politics, media, religion -- flood in to demonize our differences, alienate one group of people from another, drown our compassion and leave our very humanity gasping for air. A 17-year-old transgender girl took her own life during the holiday season. Before we point fingers assigning blame, can we at least pause long enough to think about the meaning of a girl's lost life? To mourn? To feel? To be human?","LZ: Transgender teen killed self.

"South African prosecutors say Oscar Pistorius' sentence of five years in prison for shooting dead his girlfriend is nowhere near enough punishment. They want the double-amputee track star to be convicted of a more serious charge and to face a longer prison term. On Tuesday, a court in Pretoria began hearing arguments for and against an appeal of the original verdict in which Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide, or negligent killing, in the death of Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius didn't attend the hearing, which continues Wednesday. 'Shockingly light' In appeal documents filed previously, the prosecution called Pistorius' sentence ""shockingly light"" and inappropriate. They had originally sought conviction on a charge of murder. Prosecutors are arguing that Judge Thokozile Masipa misinterpreted a complex South African standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case, according to CNN Legal Analyst Kelly Phelps. As a result, prosecutors argue, he should not have been convicted on the culpable homicide charge chosen by the judge. In explaining her sentence, Masipa concluded that Pistorius did not intend to kill Steenkamp. But critics of the verdict have argued that Masipa didn't correctly apply the intent standard, which is broader in South African law than what it typically means in casual conversation, Phelps says. Harsher or lighter sentence? In their appeal of the sentence, prosecutors will have to prove the five years given by Masipa is inappropriate in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases, according to Phelps. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel called for a minimum sentence of 10 years. If Judge Masipa sides with the prosecution on Tuesday, the case will go to the Supreme Court of Appeals in Bloemfontein, which will then hear the appeal itself, opening the door to the possibility of a harsher sentence. If she sides with the defense, and the verdict is not overturned, it could lead to a more lenient sentence, according to Phelps. Under South African law, Pistorius has to serve at least one-sixth of his sentence -- 10 months, as things stand -- before asking to be placed under correctional supervision. Correctional supervision usually means house arrest. Pistorius, 28, made history when he became the first double-amputee to compete in the able-bodied Olympics in 2012. He was born without the fibulae in his legs, which were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old.","Prosecutors want Pistorius to be convicted of a more serious charge .

"(CNN)Imagine a blimp city floating 30 miles above the scorching surface of Venus -- a home for a team of astronauts studying one of the solar system's most inhospitable planets. NASA is currently doing just that; floating a concept that could one day see a 30-day manned mission to Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Eventually, the mission could involve a permanent human presence suspended above the planet. Deep heat . Also known as the morning star, and named after the goddess of love and beauty because it shone the brightest of the five planets known to ancient astronomers, Venus is a hot, sulphurous, hellish place whose surface has more volcanoes than any other planet in the solar system. With a mean temperature of 462 degrees Celsius (863 degrees Fahrenheit), an atmospheric pressure 92 times greater than Earth's and a cloud layer of sulphuric acid, even probes to Venus have lasted little more than two hours. Its surface is hot enough to melt lead and its atmospheric pressure is the equivalent of diving a mile underwater. But above this cauldron of carbon dioxide at an altitude of 50km (30 miles) scientists say the conditions are as close to Earth's as you'll find anywhere in the solar system. The gravity at this altitude is only slightly lower than that of Earth, its atmospheric pressure is similar and the aerospace provides enough protection from solar radiation to make it no more dangerous than taking a trip to Canada. Creating HAVOC . Known at NASA as HAVOC - High Altitude Venus Operational Concept -  engineers and scientists at the Systems Analysis and Concepts Directorate at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, have been working on a preliminary feasibility study on how robots and humans could make a Venus mission a reality. ""The atmosphere of Venus is an exciting destination for both further scientific study and future human exploration,"" said aerospace engineer Christopher A. Jones of the Space Mission Analysis Branch. ""One concept is a lighter-than-air vehicle that could carry either a host of instruments and probes, or a habitat and ascent vehicle for a crew of two astronauts to explore Venus for up to a month."" He said the study showed the mission would require less time to complete than crewed missions to other planets and could even be a practice run for a Mars mission. Closer to Earth . Venus has the advantage of being much closer to Earth. Its minimum distance to Earth is 38 million kilometers, compared with 54.6 million to Mars. ""The kind of multi-decade mission that we believe could succeed would be an evolutionary program for the exploration of Venus, with focus on the mission architecture and vehicle concept for a 30-day crewed mission into Venus's atmosphere,"" he said. At the heart of the concept is the logistically difficult task of sending a spacecraft into the atmosphere of Venus without landing it. The HAVOC model involves placing the astronauts inside an 'aeroshell' that would enter the atmosphere at 4,500 miles per hour. Decelerating during its descent to just 450 meters per second and then deploying a parachute, the shell would fall away to reveal a folded airship. Robotic arms would unfurl the blimp which would be inflated with helium to allow the airship to float 30 miles above the planet's fiery surface. Jones said the key technical challenges for the mission include performing the ""aerocapture"" maneuvers at Venus and Earth (the process of entering the orbit of both planets), inserting and inflating the airships, and protecting the solar panels and structure from the sulphuric acid in the atmosphere. ""With advances in technology and further refinement of the concept, missions to the Venusian atmosphere can expand humanity's future in space,"" he said. Permanent mission . Ultimately, NASA could seek a permanent manned presence in Venus's atmosphere. Suspended in a gondola beneath the airships, astronauts would not have to contend with the physical challenges of zero gravity, where weightlessness causes muscles to wither and bones to demineralize. And at a mere 167 degrees Fahrenheit (75 degrees Celsius) -- just 30 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth -- even current technology has the ability to contend with everything that Venus could throw at the mission. Even so, HAVOC is envisioned as a multi-phase campaign and robotic missions would have to be sent to test technologies and better understand the atmosphere. While NASA has no current plans to fund the concept, the Langley-based team continues its work with the hope the space agency could make the plan come to fruition within several decades. ""Eventually, a short duration human mission would allow us to gain experience having humans live at another world, with the hope that it would someday be possible to live in the atmosphere permanently,"" Jones said.

"Tucked inside the defense authorization bill that the Senate passed Friday was an unrelated public lands package that's set to bring the biggest expansion to the National Park Service in decades. Despite some conservative opposition—a chorus that skewered the legislation as a pork-barrel land grab—the measure also establishes thousands of acres of new wilderness areas. The bill designates seven sites as official national park units, many of which place a special emphasis on history, such as Manhattan Project work sites in New Mexico, Tennessee and Washington State. Grand Canyon, other national parks could cost more . Sites in New York related to Harriet Tubman's life will be added as a park unit, and parts of the Underground Railroad in Maryland will be formally named a part of the National Park Service. Tule Springs Fossil Beds outside of Las Vegas is set to become a national monument, preserving its thousands of fossils that show traces of Ice Age mammoths, bison, and American lions. ""This legislation clearly demonstrates that Congress and the administration are making national parks a national priority,"" said Clark Bunting, president of National Parks Conservation Association. Untamed wilderness in the Tetons . The legislation also expands nine national park sites—such as the Apostle Islands, Oregon Caves National Monument, and Gettysburg National Military Park—and extends funding for 15 national heritage areas. All told, roughly 120,000 acres will be newly managed by the park service, and the number of official park units will jump from 401 to 408. That many acres may not sound like a lot - Alaska's Denali National Park alone is six million acres - but it's the single largest package of park units approved since an omnibus parks bill in 1978 that authorized 14 new units. In addition to new park units, the bill also establishes 245,000 acres of new wilderness land, nearly half of which was already being managed by federal employees. Summer in the park: Great Smoky Mountains . While the bill passed with bipartisan support, it did not come without drama. Thirty-two Republicans voted against the defense authorization package in the House last week, in part because of its inclusion of park and wilderness provisions. On the Senate side, just hours before the final vote on Friday, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, took to the floor to call for the public lands provisions to be stripped from the defense bill, saying the expansion was a ""disastrous idea"" because any new funding needs to go towards improving the current parks system. ""Our parks are falling apart. There's $12 billion backlog on our most pristine, greatest national monuments and parks,"" he said, referring to the National Park Service's coffers. ""We should preserve what we've already invested in."" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, argued in a floor speech Wednesday that drafters of the legislation ""egregiously"" forced the public lands provisions in the package through a ""distorted legislative process."" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, called it an ""extreme"" land grab and urged the House and Senate not to pass it. ""With the military's shrinking budget, it is offensive that this bill would be used to fund congressional pork,"" he said in a statement last week. Kristen Brengel, senior director of legislation and policy, at the NPCA, argued that much of the parks land is already owned by the government and is merely changing management. Millions flocked to national parks last year, despite shutdown . The Bureau of Land Management, for example, oversees Tule Springs, but will soon be run by the National Park Service. The Department of Energy owns Manhattan Project sites. And the federal government owns Valles Caldera National Preserve but the location is currently managed by a special trust. The legislation also includes some concessions for Republicans, including 110,000 acres of federal land being released into private or state control through conveyances, exchanges or sales.","Congress passed major parks and wilderness legislation .

The Kepler Space Telescope made the discoveries, pushing the number of such exoplanets it has found to more than 1,000. The punch list, according to astronomers with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), sounds good. They are not too close or too far from their star so that they might have water instead of ice or steam. They are about the right size, and they get a decent amount of sunlight. And they also might have the kinds of surface that could bear life. ""Most of these planets have a good chance of being rocky, like Earth,"" lead author Guillermo Torres of the CfA said in a release. Which is a lot more hospitable that being a big ball of gasses. ""We don't know for sure whether any of the planets in our sample are truly habitable,"" second author David Kipping of the CfA said in a release. ""All we can say is that they're promising candidates."" Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b are the most similar to Earth of any known exoplanets to date. And even if there was confirmation, Christine Pulliam with the CfA said teams are ""still a couple of generations of telescope development away,"" from even seeing them, much less visiting. Kepler-438b is 470 light-years away and Kepler-442b is 1,100 light years away, according to CfA. ""That's a little far away,"" Caldwell said, ""We need to get to Mars first."" Still it's very exciting just to discover them and to be closer to identifying a ""second"" Earth. At a panel held last summer at NASA headquarters in Washington, astronomers said they were ""very close in terms of technology and science to actually finding the other Earth."" That's due in part to the Kepler telescope. The planet-hunting Kepler probe, launched in 2009, finds planets by looking for dips in the brightness of a star as a planet transits, or crosses, in front of that star. Pulliam said the team of scientists monitored data for more than 160,000 stars, which led them to the eight new planets. The couple most like Earth, Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, both orbit red dwarf stars, which are cooler and smaller than the Earth's sun. Kepler-438b's diameter is 12% bigger than Earth and has a 70% chance of being rocky, which means the surface of the planet appears to be like Earth's. Kepler-442b is about one-third larger than Earth with a 60% chance of being rocky.  Scientists give it a 97% chance of being in the habitable zone, but caution that the estimates aren't certain.

"(CNN)Palm Beach is just an aisle away. Retail giant Target announced Tuesday its latest designer partnership, with Lilly Pulitzer -- sorority-girl favorite and the queen of bold American resortwear. The 250-piece collection, which launches April 19, will feature apparel, accessories and shoes for women and girls, as well as home decor in 15 exclusive prints. ""This spring, we wanted to offer our guests a collection that embraced color, print and pattern in a bold, fresh way,"" Stacia Andersen, Target's senior vice president of apparel and accessories, said in a release. ""As we started to think about the perfect partner to collaborate with, Lilly Pulitzer was the clear choice given the brand's inspiring heritage, authority with print and pattern and resort-chic aesthetic."" Pulitzer herself died in 2013 at the age of 81, but the brand lives on. Her sleeveless, collarless shift dresses became a signature of  the Palm Beach, Florida, party set after she starting selling them from a juice stand in 1959. Lilly shifts for adults currently retail from about $188 to upwards of $288. Because of her socialite roots (her designs were a favorite of former schoolmate Jacqueline Kennedy), many Lilly lovers on social media weren't seeing the bright side of the design partnership. Target contends that the everyman appeal is the crux of such collaborations: to offer upscale labels at a more modest price point. The big box store has collaborated on capsule collections with design powerhouses like Phillip Lim, Zac Posen, Prabal Gurung, Jason Wu and Joseph Altuzarra. In 2011, Missoni for Target famously caused the retailer's website to crash several times and led to an uptick in utter fashionista hysteria for online marketplace eBay. ""The Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection marks a new chapter for our brand, and we're excited to give Lilly fans everywhere, including those who have loved the brand for years and those who will get to know it for the first time through this collaboration, a chance to experience this incredibly chic lifestyle collection,"" said Jane Schoenborn, Lilly Pulitzer's vice president of creative communications.","Lilly Pulitzer is the latest designer to collaborate with Target .

"Paris (CNN)One of the two main terrorists accused in this week's attacks in Paris had a long history of jihad and anti-Semitism, according to court documents that CNN obtained in conjunction with French newsmagazine L'Express. In a 400-page court record, Cherif Kouachi was described as wanting to travel to Iraq through Syria ""to go and combat the Americans."" On Friday, security forces surrounded and killed Kouachi, 32, and his older brother, Said, 34, in Dammartin-en-Goele, France, the town's mayor said. The Kouachi brothers were wanted in Wednesday's massacre at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris that left 12 people dead. In the 2007 French court documents, Cherif Kouachi stated in a deposition, ""I was ready to go and die in battle,"" and ""I got this idea when I saw the injustices shown by television on what was going on over there. I am speaking about the torture that the Americans have inflicted on the Iraqis."" The court documents -- dated December 2007 -- stem from a 2005 arrest. They say Cherif Kouachi was raised in orphanages and foster homes from a young age, and became involved in a group in Paris' 19th arrondissement. He was arrested with other young men from that part of Paris for a conspiracy to go to Iraq and fight as jihadists. In the documents, prosecutors outlined strong details of Kouachi's interest in jihad, interest in martyrdom and strong links to anti-Semitism, attacking and killing Jews. Kouachi stated he came to the idea of jihad through Farid Benyettou, a well-known spiritual leader who's been long associated in France with supporting jihad and terrorism, and is associated with a mosque in the 19th arrondissement. Through Benyettou, Kouachi was studying how to wield arms and use Kalashnikovs. Under a section titled ""Motivations of Influence"" describing Kouachi, court records said he stated ""the wise leaders in Islam told him and his friends that if they die as martyrs in jihad they would go to heaven"" and ""that martyrs would be greeted by more than 60 virgins in a big palace in heaven."" The documents also said, ""(F)or him any place on earth where there is such an injustice is justification for jihad; what was going on Iraq was in his eyes such an injustice."" The mosque, called La Mosquee de Stalingrad, has since been demolished and appears to be under construction. Court records show Kouachi said he didn't consider himself a good enough Muslim, and said he had only been to the mosque two or three times before he met Benyettou, and he had been smoking cannabis. Kouachi told investigators he committed himself to the idea of jihad during Ramadan in 2004. He told his friends he was going to Syria to fight. The documents say when police interviewed his accomplices they stated that Kouachi ""said he was ready to firebomb and to destroy Jewish shops in Paris."" When officials confronted Kouachi with that information, he told them ""that's not exactly what I said. ... I don't hide having proposed anti-Semitic ideas, but I would note that I never really would have done that.""","Court documents stemming from 2005 arrest show Cherif Kouachi's interest in jihad .

"Former President George H.W. Bush, who was taken to a Houston hospital after experiencing shortness of breath, will remain in the hospital for at least one more night, his spokesman said Friday evening. Bush is in ""high spirits and continues to make progress,"" Jim McGrath said, but will remain in the hospital another night. On Christmas Day, the former president received visits from his wife, Barbara, son Neil and daughter-in-law Maria Bush, McGrath said in a previous statement. McGrath said Bush ""asked that his sincere wishes for a very Merry Christmas be extended to one and all."" In a statement Wednesday, a day after the hospitalization, McGrath said Bush's prognosis ""remains very positive"" and he was remaining at the medical facility ""as a precaution."" Aides stressed this hospitalization is different from what the former president faced two years ago when he had to spend two months, including Christmas, hospitalized after suffering bronchitis and a persistent cough. ""The Bush family certainly appreciates all your prayers, love and concern. This is not two years ago. It's a hiccup. He should come home in a few days,"" Jean Becker, Bush's chief of staff, said in a statement in reaction to the outpouring of concern for him.

While suffering from a form of Parkinson's disease that causes him to use a wheelchair or a scooter, the elder Bush has been active recently. He jumped out of a helicopter to celebrate his 90th birthday in June and participated in the coin toss at a Houston Texans professional football game last month.

"(CNN)A new poll brings good news for Mitt Romney and his allies at a time when the 2012 GOP nominee faces vocal skepticism from the right about a potential third bid for president. According to a new CBS News survey, however, nearly six in 10 Republicans (59%) say they'd like to see Romney run for the White House in 2016, compared to 26% who disagree. Romney confirmed Friday night in a speech at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting that he's seriously thinking about jumping back into the fray, hinting that his campaign would focus on making the world safer and lifting people out of poverty. But critics and some of his potential opponents have expressed concern about backing a twice-railed presidential candidate, especially in what many consider an already strong field. The poll indicates that Romney is in stronger demand, or at least has higher name recognition, than former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who's wanted to run by 50% of Republicans, while 27% don't want him to run. Less than a third -- 29% -- say they'd like to see New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie jump in, while 44% think he shouldn't run for president. Such underwater numbers come as Christie struggles to find relevance among the donor and business class against heavyweight competition like Romney and Bush. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky also has an underwater rating, with 27% of Republicans wanting him to run, compared to 34% who wouldn't liked to see a Paul for president campaign. Thirty-eight percent say they don't know enough to say. Forty percent of Republicans, meanwhile, would like to see former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who ended his Fox News show earlier this month to more seriously consider a second presidential bid, to throw his hat into the ring, while 29% disagree. Slightly more than a quarter (26%) want Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida to run, while 21% say the same about Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. As for the remainder of the potential GOP field, Texas Gov. Rick Perry has interest at 21%, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is at 14%, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker gets 22%, renowned neurosurgeon Ben Carson is at 21%, and former Sen. Rick Santorum comes in at 19%. The poll, which was conducted by telephone January 9-12, surveyed 1,001 adults nationwide, with a sampling error of plus or minus six percent for the questions directed only at Republicans.","A new poll indicates that 59% of Republicans wants Mitt Romney to run for president in 2016 .

"(CNN)Physician Ben Carson on Thursday held up ISIS, a terrorist group that's beheaded multiple Americans, as an example for the United States during comments before the Republican National Committee. ""We've got ISIS. They've got the wrong philosophy, but they're willing to die for what they believe, while we are busily giving away every belief and every value for the sake of political correctness,"" he said during his speech at the RNC's winter meeting. ""We have to change that."" Carson acknowledged his comments were likely to spark controversy and gain headlines, but he preemptively dismissed the press attention. ""They are just so ridiculous,"" he said, to laughter from the crowd. The remarks are similar to ones he made previously, likening the United States government to Nazi Germany in that both, he argued, worked to silence their opponents. Carson stood by those comments when pressed in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. It's that very penchant — for frank and often controversial comments — that has made him so popular with the GOP base, and turned the retired neurosurgeon into a rising conservative star who just last month polled third in a CNN/ORC survey of the potential GOP presidential field. He's made no secret of his interest in the race, and recently said he ""feel[s] fingers"" from God to run. Many within the establishment wing of the party remain wary of him, however, because of his talent for the very remarks that make him so popular with the far right. He also started a firestorm of criticism over comments he made that Obamacare was the ""worst thing"" to happen to the U.S. since slavery. But his appearance at the RNC's winter meeting, alongside the likes of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, suggest that Carson's popularity on the right has earned him some notice from the establishment as the party charts its course heading into 2016.

"It was the computer classroom where I cracked. I'd managed to remain detached until then. I wanted to tell the story. Look, but don't internalize, was the mantra I was repeating inside my head. Tell the facts, explain what you are seeing and what happened. I focused. I don't think I've been somewhere with so much blood on the floor. Over the years, covering wars, I've seen more than my share. Sarajevo, the war in Bosnia as Yugoslavia tore itself apart, was an inoculation against my visceral fear of the red stuff. In that conflict, mortars ripped through crowds of civilians. I soon learned how head wounds bleed. It's different. You don't forget. Here it was again in the auditorium. Dark and heavy. Don't think, focus and do your job, I was reminding myself. But after a while I couldn't. These were children, innocents. Parents not far from here are suffering a harrowing pain none of us can imagine. Parents, whose job in the army is to protect their country, not able to save their own children. The army officer showed us the doors where the children had tried to break out of the auditorium to run away from the Taliban gunmen. The carpet is sticky and red. The floor tiles a mess of the worst of Sarajevo. The Taliban could not have been more callous and calculating. Where the children were most concentrated they turned their automatic weapons on them at point-blank range. Cold-blooded murder. The officer tells me close to 100 children were gunned down right here. Again, I'm telling myself to focus. Explain this brutal cowardly act. Leaving the dark, sad auditorium for the light of day I feel I can breathe better. I look up at the sky. It's the color of hope -- clear blue and not a cloud to be seen. I shouldn't have looked down again. I'm walking over to the classrooms at Army Public School and Degree College. Drops, smudges, pools of blood are everywhere. I'm becoming conscious that I'm trying not to step on them. It seems disrespectful somehow. How, I am thinking, could the Taliban be looking for even more bloodletting when they have already killed so many? But they are. That's when I get to the computer classroom, maybe 30 feet long by 15 feet across. Computers on rough benches down each side of the room. Space for maybe a dozen or so children to hone their computer skills. You didn't have to be rich to send your child to this school, and in Pakistan -- in Peshawar in particular -- on a global scale that implies your means might be quite humble indeed. Quite possibly some of these kids wouldn't have a computer at home. In our ever-interconnected world, lessons in this room could have been some of the most valuable to their futures. And that's it. I'm standing there realizing they have no futures now. The base horror that took place here is startlingly and immediately evident. Chairs still at computers, thick blood pooled underneath on the tile floor. The gunmen came in and before the children could escape opened fire. As I try to explain all this on camera, I can feel my voice cracking. It's not a conscious thing, its what the brain does, a self-defense maybe. Such a horrible waste of so many bright futures, so many parents in pain. It hurts, and there is no getting away from it.","CNN's Nic Robertson visits the Pakistan school where 132 children were killed .

"A 62-year-old evacuee from Fukushima Prefecture made a brief visit to his radiation-contaminated home, walked to his shuttered shop, and then hanged himself in a storage space. The death is yet another sad reminder how the March 11, 2011, disaster in Japan continues to claim victims. On that day, a magnitude-9 earthquake  triggered a tsunami which swamped the Fukushima Daiichi plant, knocking out power to cooling systems and leading to meltdowns in its three operating reactors. The earthquake and tsunami left more than 15,000 dead. While no deaths have been directly attributed to the nuclear disaster, the resulting release of radioactivity forced residents of several towns near the plant to flee their homes, and a 20-kilometer (12.5-mile) zone around the plant remains closed to the public. The man, who was not named by police, was one of tens of thousands who were evacuated from the area. He and his wife were briefly granted entry into the exclusion zone around the plant on Sunday, to visit their home and their small store, police said. After the wife reported him missing, officers and volunteer firefighters in the town of Namie organized a search, police said. The following day, firefighters found the man's body in his store's storage shed. Naka Shimizu, a local government spokesman and a friend of the victim, told CNN that when he heard the reports that the man was missing, he feared the man had killed himself. ""There are so many people (in my town) who have lost hope. This affects their health,"" he said. Shimizu, an evacuee himself, expressed frustration over the plight of the 70,000 evacuees of the nuclear disaster and the governmental paralysis in caring for the people of his town. Shimizu pointed the finger at the national government, saying Tokyo's leaders just want to get the town to accept radiation-contaminated debris on an interim basis, without offering any long-term plan to manage all the evacuees. The evacuees have yet to receive any sizable compensation or a timetable on when, or if, they'll ever be able to return to their homes, he said. ""The people of Namie are increasingly depressed about the future. We don't have a clear future or see any achievable targets,"" said Shimizu. He said he knew of four or five people in Namie who had committed suicide and more than 100 who had died of illness during the evacuation. Japanese media reported the man complained of insomnia from the stress of the evacuation and his inability to make a living.","Evacuee from Fukushima commits suicide after brief visit to contaminated home .

"Hong Kong is in the midst of a passionate debate about our constitutional development. It's a debate we must have. But it's a debate that must be tempered with reason. Raw emotion -- for or against the proposed political reform -- will get us nowhere. It must also be a discussion based on the constitutional framework that provides for a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) within China. Much discussion has centered around the recent decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) of China on the parameters for electing the chief executive (CE) by one-person, one-vote in 2017. Critics say the nominating framework is too restrictive and that only candidates favored by Beijing will eventually appear on the ballot. Such claims are unfounded as we have not even started to discuss the detailed but crucial aspects of the nominating process for potential chief executive candidates. This will be the subject of a public consultation to be launched soon and which will eventually lead to the enabling legislation on changes to the electoral method for the 2017 election. Election method . On the question of electing the chief executive, the Basic Law, Hong Kong's ""mini-constitution,"" provides that ""the ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures."" To change over to this new election method, the Basic Law requires the endorsement of a two-thirds majority of all (currently 70) members of the Legislative Council, the consent of the CE, and be reported to the NPCSC of China for approval. Basically, we have two choices: retain the current system by which the CE is elected by a 1,200-person election committee; or, adopt an enhanced system, the one recently announced by the NPCSC, that will see two to three candidates in a full-fledged election at which Hong Kong's five million eligible voters will exercise this right for the first time. Historic step . I sincerely hope that legislators will take the historic step forward to achieve universal suffrage for the election in 2017 as scheduled. So far the debate has focused on the system per se. But the chief executive's unique constitutional position within China also needs to be understood more clearly in order to fully appreciate the basis for the electoral process. Unlike other cities or provinces in China, or for that matter, those in other countries, the HKSAR enjoys a far higher degree of autonomy in many areas including our legal system, legislature, internal security, immigration, customs, economy, finances, trade, industry, commerce, shipping, aviation, education, sport, religion and external affairs. All these are enshrined in our Basic Law. These additional powers are devolved from the Central People's Government. This is why the central government has the power to appoint the chief executive as well as principal officials. This is also why the central government has a constitutional role in approving any changes to the electoral method for the chief executive. Hong Kong is society with a deep respect for the rule of law. It is the pillar of our success. Our common law system and an independent judiciary are protected by the Basic Law which I, as the chief executive, have pledged to uphold and protect. It is my fundamental and constitutional duty to work towards the goal of electing the chief executive by universal suffrage within that legal framework.","Hong Kong is in the midst of a passionate debate about its constitutional development .

"Al-Shabaab militants raided a quarry in Kenya, separating non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and executing them, a spokesman for the group said Tuesday. At least 36 bodies were found Tuesday dumped in the quarry in the village of Kormey, near the Somali border, the Kenyan Red Cross said. Al-Shabaab said the attack was retaliation for mosque raids that Kenyan security forces carried out last month to weed out extremists. Kormey is about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the border city of Mandera, in an area where the Somalia-based Al-Shabaab militants are known to operate. Last month, the Islamist militants ambushed a bus in Kenya and sprayed bullets on those who failed to recite Quran verses, killing at least 28 people, authorities said. The bus, which had 60 people aboard, was heading from Mandera to the capital of Nairobi. The group says the latest attacks are a response to the police raid on multiple mosques in the port city of Mombasa after explosives were found in one. ""Our Mujhahideen forces are always ready to launch frequent deadly cross-border attacks against Kenya as a revenge,"" group spokesman Sheikh Ali Dheere said in a statement read on a pro-Al-Shabaab radio station in Somalia. National police chief resigns . After news of the quarry attack surfaced, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said he accepted the resignation of the country's national police chief, David Kimaiyo. Kenyatta said the recent attacks constituted ""a war, and a war we must win."" Tuesday's attack was swiftly condemned, with Nairobi's Jamia Mosque, the largest in the country, calling it a ""beastly tactic."" ""This unfortunate and ugly incident should not be used to divide peace loving Kenyans who have lived harmoniously for centuries -- along religious or ethnic lines,"" the mosque said in a statement, ""but rather it should be taken to reflect on improving the security situation of the country."" Al-Shabaab, which has ties to al Qaeda, has launched a series of attacks in Kenya since Kenyan forces went into neighboring Somalia in 2011 to battle the extremists. Kenyan soldiers have targeted militants' hideouts across Somalia, prompting retaliatory attacks from the terror group. Last year, Al-Shabaab raided a Nairobi mall in a brazen attack that left 68 people dead and kept shoppers under siege for days. In addition to Kenya and Somalia, the terror group has struck in Uganda, where it killed more than 70 people gathered to watch a broadcast of the World Cup Final soccer match in Kampala in 2010. As the attacks get more daring, the international community has rallied to battle the militants. In September, a U.S. airstrike killed Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Godane. The terror group later replaced him and vowed to avenge his death.","Kenya's President accepts the national police chief's resignation .

The campaign evolved from a picture this week on ""Humans of New York,"" the massively popular photo series of everyday people Stanton meets on the street. The fundraising campaign's rapid success speaks in part to the reach of ""Humans of New York,"" which has a social media following of nearly 12 million on Facebook alone. It's also a testament to the ability of social media to breathe new life into a feel-good story. The inspirational post featured a picture of a Mott Hall student named Vidal in a housing project in Brownsville. He describes the most influential person in his life, principal Nadia Lopez. ""When we get in trouble, she doesn't suspend us. She calls us to her office and explains to us how society was built down around us. And she tells us that each time somebody fails out of school, a new jail cell gets built. And one time she made every student stand up, one at a time, and she told each one of us that we matter."" In a posting on the ""Humans of New York"" Facebook page, Lopez talked about the discouragement she felt before the campaign. ""Before all of this happened for our school, I felt broken,"" she said. ""And I think the world felt a little broken too, because a lot of bad things have been happening lately, especially between black people and white people. But all of you gave people a reason to feel a little less broken. "" The picture of Vidal has been widely shared and drew more than 1 million likes on the ""Humans of New York"" Facebook page, compelling Stanton to dig deeper. ""I ask people all the time about the most influential person in their life, and he was the first person who ever told me his principal,"" Stanton wrote in an email. ""Then when I met Ms. Lopez, I could not have been more impressed. She is a force of nature. When she let me sit in on a staff meeting, I got a front-row seat to the challenges that her school faces, and I wanted to be involved in the solution."" They discussed how the ""Humans of New York"" community could help further the school's vision, Stanton said in a Facebook post. They decided to create a fund to provide each incoming sixth-grade class a chance to get out of their neighborhood and visit Harvard University. ""This is a neighborhood that doesn't necessarily expect much from our children, so at Mott Hall Bridges Academy we set our expectations very high. We don't call the children 'students,' we call them 'scholars.' Our color is purple. Our scholars wear purple, and so do our staff,"" Lopez told Stanton, who featured her picture on ""Humans of New York."" ""Because purple is the color of royalty. I want my scholars to know that even if they live in a housing project, they are part of a royal lineage going back to great African kings and queens. They belong to a group of individuals who invented astronomy and math. And they belong to a group of individuals who have endured so much history and still overcome. When you tell people you're from Brownsville, their face cringes up. But there are children here that need to know that they are expected to succeed."" The campaign's scope has expanded as its pot has grown. Initially, it was intended to cover lodging and transportation costs for three Mott Hall classes to make the trip to the Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus. In an update Friday, Stanton said that funds raised beyond the initial goal would go toward summer programming for the school. ""Learning stops during the summer for my scholars. We have what is called a 'summer slide,' "" Lopez says on the fund-raising campaign page. ""They need a safe place where they can do activities and continue to grow their minds."" On Monday, Stanton posted that because of the campaign's success, ""We are starting a scholarship fund available to the graduates of Mott Hall Bridges Academy. A committee of MHBA educators and administrators will choose the recipients each year."" The scholarship fund will be named for Vidal, the student who started it all, who will be the fund's first recipient, Stanton announced.","""Humans of New York"" portrait inspires online fundraising campaign for school .

"(CNN)As a noted memoirist and New York Times columnist who writes often about race, Charles Blow has spoken about the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, deaths that sparked a national debate over how police treat African-American men. On Monday, Blow wrote about another young black man's encounter with police -- his son, who was allegedly held at gunpoint on the Yale University campus where he's a student. Blow took to Twitter on Sunday, writing that he was ""fuming"" after his son called to tell him what happened Saturday -- that he was walking out of the library when university police ""accosted"" him and drew their weapons. Blow tweeted that his son was detained because he ""fit the description"" of a suspect. Blow's son was released, and Yale has said that the real suspect was found and arrested later. The columnist's son was shaken. On Monday, Blow told CNN that his son is back in class and feeling better. ""He's a good kid, and just wants to go to school. But one thing that he told me was really astute and worth sharing: he doesn't want this story to only be about him,"" Blow said. ""He realizes that there are other young people who have fewer privileges, less access and endure even greater traumas, but whose stories go unreported until something truly tragic happens. He wants the focus to remain on them. I couldn't be prouder of him for having the wisdom to recognize that."" Sunday night, the columnist was incredibly angry after he says his son called him to explain what happened. ""#I can't breathe and #blacklives matter,"" Blow posted in a series of tweets. ""This is exactly why I have NO PATIENCE for ppl trying to convince me that the fear these young blk men feel isn't real #RacialBattleFatigue,"" the columnist wrote in tweets that were shared hundreds of thousands of times. Yale released a statement Monday that said Blow's son was detained in the vicinity of a reported crime, and that he closely matched the physical description of the suspect. ""Let us be clear: we have great faith in the Yale Police Department and admire the professionalism that its officers display on a daily basis to keep our campus safe. What happened ... is not a replay of what happened in Ferguson; Staten Island; Cleveland; or so many other places in our time and over time in the United States. The officer, who himself is African American, was responding to a specific description relayed by individuals who had reported a crime in progress,"" it read. The statement continued: ""Even though the officer's decision to stop and detain the student may have been reasonable, the fact that he drew his weapon during the stop requires a careful review."" The school promised to share the results of that investigation with the broader community. On Sunday, Yale spokeswoman Karen Peart wrote in email that Yale police responded to an emergency call from undergraduates in a residential community on campus, saying that someone had ""entered their rooms under false pretenses, pretending to be looking for someone."" Students in the same community had been burglarized that week, Peart explained, and the police were looking for someone who was ""a tall, African-American, college-aged student wearing a black jacket and a red and white hat."" The real suspect was later found on an adjacent residential community, was arrested and is expected to face felony burglary charges, according to Peart. Blow declined Sunday to talk to CNN about the incident, but he gave a detailed account in his Times column of what his son said happened. When his son was leaving the Yale library around 5:45 p.m. Saturday, he saw an officer ""jogging"" toward the entrance of another building across the grounds. Blow's son recounted to his father that he started walking back to his dorm when he noticed a police officer following him and then speaking into his radio, saying, ""I got him."" The officer shouted, ""Hey, turn around!"" according to Blow's recounting of his son's story. The officer raised his gun and told the college student to get on the ground. Blow's son, the columnist writes, dropped to his knees, raised his hand and laid down on his stomach. He was then asked for his name and where he went to school. The student answered, according to the columnist. Then the officer told him to get up, gave the student his name and told the student to call him the next day, according to the column's retelling. Then Blow's son said he got up and started to walk back to his dorm. According to Blow, his son told him: ""'I was scared. My legs were shaking slightly. After a few more paces, the officer, 'Hey, my man. Can you step off to the side?' "" The student did as he was told. Then one officer asked him to turn around to get a better view of the jacket the student was wearing. The officer asked for the student's name again and his ID. Blow's son complied, according to the columnist. Then the officer held him longer, asking more questions, Blow writes. ""Now, don't get me wrong: If indeed my son matched the description of a suspect, I would have had no problem with him being questioned appropriately,"" Blow wrote in the Times.""School is his community, his home away from home, and he would have appreciated reasonable efforts to keep it safe. The stop is not the problem; the method of the stop is the problem."" Blow wrote that the dean of Yale and the university police chief have apologized to him. But he wants answers. ""Why was a gun drawn first? Why was he not immediately told why he was being detained? Why not ask for ID first? What if my son had panicked under the stress, having never had a gun pointed at him before, and made what the officer considered a 'suspicious' movement? Had I come close to losing him? ""Triggers cannot be unpulled. Bullets cannot be called back,"" Blow wrote. ""This is the scenario I have always dreaded: my son at the wrong end of a gun barrel, face down on the concrete,"" he added. ""I had always dreaded the moment that we would share stories about encounters with the police in which our lives hung in the balance, intergenerational stories of joining the inglorious 'club.'

"When fishing in fiercely-contested territorial waters, a certain amount of risk must be assumed. For the crew of Vietnamese fishing boat Dna 90152 TS, the worst-case scenario happened early last week when their ship was capsized by what they insist was a Chinese military vessel. The ship's captain, Dang Van Nhan, told CNN via an interpreter that on May 26, he and his crew were sailing in Vietnamese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) waters, around 17 nautical miles (NM) from a Chinese oil rig near the Paracel Islands. The islands in the South China Sea have become the centerpiece in a territorial row between China and Vietnam. The crew was working their wooden fishing boat around 4 p.m. when they noticed a vessel steaming towards their ship. ""After this, we ran away. They crashed into our right side and then the left. Then our boat turned over. All ten crew members had to swim. After this, we were rescued by (sister ship) Dna 90508. We swam for around ten minutes."" The fishermen's report is at odds with the Chinese version of events. According to China's state-run Xinhua news agency, the Vietnamese vessel had been ""harassing"" a Chinese fishing boat in waters near the Paracel Islands, a largely uninhabited archipelago also known by the Chinese as the Xisha Islands. The Xinhua report said the ship overturned after it ""jostled"" a Chinese fishing boat. Lucky escape . Dang counts his blessings that the other Vietnamese fishing boat was nearby and able to rescue him and his crew. ""We are very lucky that the crash happened during the daytime. We were lucky that some friends could see us."" The incident, from first collision to the abandonment of the vessel took only four minutes, Dang says. The crew didn't even have time to don life jackets. Two of his crew suffered minor injuries including Ngyuen Huynh Ba Bian, who suffered abrasions on his leg, shoulder and chest, as well as a cut near his right eye. ""The Chinese ship(s) made no attempt to rescue our crew,"" Dang said. ""We saw a lot of Chinese ships -- only one was used to ram us, but there were lots around. Despite the sinking, none of the Chinese ships acted (to rescue the crew)."" The boat, which was valued at 5 billion Vietnamese Dong ($237,000), remains scuttled in the seas around the Paracel Islands. Because of superstition, the boat is unlikely to be salvaged and used again, says its owner, Huynh Thi Nhu Hoa. The boat had fished these waters for years before the recent controversy arose, Ngyuen said. He said that isolated incidents had occurred between ships from the two sides for several years, but since the oil rig had been installed, the number of attacks has escalated sharply. Shifting blame . The official Chinese line is that the sinking is entirely the fault of the Vietnamese crew. ""One Vietnamese fishing boat forcefully intruded into the caution area of China 981 drilling rig and ran into the left side of a Chinese fishing boat at the site and then capsized,"" Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Qing Gang said at a briefing the day after the incident. ""I want to stress that the direct cause for this incident is ... the Vietnamese side."" Dang and his crew deny this version of events. ""The Chinese statement is wrong,"" Dang said. ""The Chinese ship was six times larger (than our fishing boat). Our ship is wooden, that one was steel. It is nonsense that our boat would approach or try to ram a ship that size."" Government involvement? Dang says he suspects that the boat belonged to the Chinese Coast Guard and was disguised to look like a fishing vessel, because it contained a steel hull, rather than the traditional wood. He says it was also flying a Chinese flag, although in these waters, where national identity means everything, this doesn't necessarily indicate official involvement in the incident. However, he says experience tells them that it was a government vessel. Ngyuen chimes in: ""We only saw one person on the Chinese ship. He threw a glass bottle at our boat. Besides him, we didn't see anyone."" The Chinese government has not offered compensation, says Hyunh, the boat's owner.  They have not had any contact from the Chinese at all. They cannot afford to buy a new boat, she says. ""Now the crew are jobless,"" she says. ""We have to lay them off until we have the new ship. This incident has cost us 5 billion Dong ($237,000). Our family lives off the revenue of fishing and we haven't raised the money to buy a new one."" The local government has offered around 800 million Dong ($37,800) in compensation, and a government official tells CNN that the local authorities also cover the fishing fleet's insurance, which will pay out around half the cost of a new boat. Despite the real, present danger that fishing these waters has presented, the Vietnamese owner and crew are not willing to cede an inch of territory. ""Of course we have to return to the Paracel Islands,"" Hyunh says. ""It's the traditional area of Vietnamese fishing. They are the only good fishing areas for us.""","Last week's incident saw fishing boat scuttled near disputed islands .

"The Obama administration is preparing to publicly disclose for the first time a secret memo offering the legal justification for targeted drone strikes on U.S. citizens on foreign soil, multiple administration officials told CNN. Solicitor General Don Verrilli decided not to appeal the April 21 ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals mandating the disclosure of the memo, and Attorney General Eric Holder agreed with that decision. The White House was informed Tuesday of the Justice Department's decision. The memo won't be made public right away. It has to go through a redaction process that will need to be approved by a judge, according to the administration officials. A redacted version also means that some of the intelligence the administration used to justify the drone strikes will not be made public. The memo to be released publicly has already been offered to the Senate on a classified basis, a senior administration official said. The legal explanation for the drone strikes was also outlined by the Justice Department in the dismissal of a lawsuit filed by the father of suspected terrorist leader Anwar al-Awlaki. The administration said in that lawsuit that al-Awlaki posed an imminent threat. Anwar al-Awlaki was later killed in a U.S. drone attack in Yemen in 2011. The memo's author, former Justice Department official David Barron, has been nominated to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, based in Boston. Several U.S. senators from both parties had called upon the administration to release the memo to the public before Barron's confirmation. A procedural vote on Barron's nomination is expected Wednesday in the Senate. The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for the memo along with the New York Times, said it hopes the release ""signals a broader shift in the administration's approach to the official secrecy surrounding its targeted killing program."" ""The release of this memo will allow the public to better understand the scope of the authority that the government is claiming,"" ACLU Deputy Legal Director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement Tuesday.","The Obama administration will comply with a court ruling to release the memo .

"Keenan Steiner makes his way along Charlotte's secured streets, struggling to put on his tie and manage his monogrammed backpack at the same time. The 27-year-old is on a mission: He's looking for a party. Not just any party. He works with the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that advocates for greater government transparency. His goal at the Democratic National Convention, as it was at the Republicans' confab in Tampa: to crash as many parties as he can, then blog about them. Since 2008, his organization's Political Party Time website has been tracking exclusive, behind-the-scenes events where politicians and special interests meet, often out of the spotlight. The groups hosting these events, Steiner says, hope to influence the outcome of the November elections -- as well as lawmakers' votes in Congress and state capitols. By his count, there were at least 400 parties planned during the DNC and 200 during the Republican National Convention. ""All the big players are at the conventions at once,"" he says, ""so it is sort of like being in the Washington party circuit on steroids."" Tonight Steiner decides to stop by Planned Parenthood Political Action Fund's ""Sex, Politics, and Cocktails"" party first. The organization has been under recent attack from Republicans in Congress who have repeatedly tried to shut off federal funding for the organization's family planning efforts. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the group's political arm and official host of the party, has spent nearly $2 million during this year's election cycle -- most of it on negative ads against Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. While groups like Planned Parenthood Action Fund spend millions to elect Democrats, groups like Americans for Prosperity work to put Republicans in power. Steiner has an issue with the laws that regulate these types of groups, because they're not required to reveal the names of the donors who ultimately pay for those ads. ""There is a real transparency issue here,"" Steiner says. Steiner says he tried but failed to get into the Americans for Prosperity party in Tampa. Here in Charlotte he doesn't have a ticket, but he sees a friend outside the Planned Parenthood party who helps. He says he can usually talk his way into events. At his friend's urging, security waves Steiner and his Sunlight Foundation colleague Liz Bartolomeo through. They even let them use the velvet-lined VIP line to bypass the crowd. Inside, smartly dressed older women sit in a line on comfortable couches, checking their email on smartphones. A man wearing an Obama ball cap orders a drink called ""Safe Sex Champagne"" for his girlfriend. He's having the ""Obamatini."" A woman clutching one of the ""We love Michelle"" banners that had been handed out on the convention floor earlier in the evening keeps knocking it into people as she joyfully dances ""The Electric Slide."" The giveaways here are simple and, in some cases, intended to provoke a laugh. Condoms inside hot pink matchbook covers lay on low tables around the dance floor. The front of the package says ""Protect Yourself From Romney & Ryan in this Election."" It's an advertisement for Planned Parenthood's Women Are Watching website. ""This party seems like a way to drum up enthusiasm with the base,"" Steiner says, as he makes his way to the bar to talk with someone he knows. ""It's not a party where you will rub shoulders with governors, and people aren't necessarily sowing the seeds for laws that will be written next year here like we've seen at some of the super-elite parties, but it still is important,"" Steiner says. He pulls out a small Moleskine pad and takes notes as he talks to someone by the bar. The loud disco music suddenly fades away, and the emcee tells the excited crowd that two special guests have arrived. The floor goes wild as actress Ashley Judd stands in front of a hot pink ""Sex, Politics"" banner with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at her side. ""The Democrats have clearly decided their work for women is a winning issue for them, and Pelosi is a rock star among the Democratic base,"" Steiner says. ""Homocon"" during the conventions . Pelosi talks about the Democrats' support for women's issues -- among the convention themes earlier that evening -- then encourages the crowd to support the president. After Pelosi wraps up her speech, she does a little dance as the '70s hit ""Celebration"" plays her loudly off the stage. She poses for photos with Planned Parenthood Political Action Fund leaders and other VIPs. People start to dance again. Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who was in Charlotte to observe the convention, says parties such as this energize the base on particular issues. They are also mutually beneficial to the people who attend. ""Some will show up to these parties for nice swag or good food or to show their support for a particular political message, sure,"" Gillespie said. ""But it's also aimed at the fledging county commission candidate who shows up at the convention. ""The fact that Pelosi is there gives them a chance to take a picture with her and then tweet it out or put it on their Facebook page. It gives them a certain type of credibility. It makes them look important, and they'll remember an organization that made this happen."" Steiner says there were several splashy events at the RNC. Though fewer in number than at the DNC, the parties were equally high profile. At the Florida Aquarium, scantily clad women dressed as mermaids floated in a tank as guests at the Distilled Spirits Council party ordered drinks from multiple bars. In ""A Salute to the House and Senate Energy and Commerce Committees,"" attendees could shag balls and take batting practice at Tropicana Field for a charitable donation. A $15,000 donation got people into a private reception with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, courtesy of the Foundation for Florida's Future. It's midnight back in Charlotte before Steiner and Bartolomeo head out past streams of other party-hoppers and make their way to a swank hotel near the convention center. The lobby has a different feel than the Planned Parenthood party. Well-dressed guests sit at a tiny table by the bar with a couple bottles of expensive Veuve Clicquot champagne. Sen. John Kerry stands in the corner having a hushed but animated conversation with two equally tall men. And more people carrying ""We love Michelle"" signs, now somewhat crushed, make their way toward the elevator. On the hotel's second floor is ""Come Together: A Late Night Celebration"" honoring the National Black Caucus of State Legislators. Steiner doesn't have an invitation here either, but he blends into the crowd to make his way into the fancy ballroom. The event invitations advertise the party's sponsors. Steiner says he noticed their names on a giant screen next to the dance floor. Waste Management, Amerigroup, Maximus and VS2 were among the hosts. Gillespie says some people may be uncomfortable with the role corporations play behind the scenes at such events, but she thinks they are necessary. ""Taking corporate funding for them is a double-edged sword since you do need someone to pay for it,"" she says. ""You don't want to use public funds for a party. ""That type of corporate sponsorship may suggest they have more influence than others with politicians, and some may take issue with it, but groups don't have the money to do this on their own and they want to attract the right people to their events. ""People won't show up if the party is boring."" Men with lapel pins identifying them as state legislators or congressmen make their way into the party. Bartolomeo points out others wearing special pins she says are given to big Obama donors. Steiner ignores the live band playing James Brown's ""Sex Machine"" and forgoes the red, white and blue macaroons. Instead, he talks to people and takes notes. ""This is more a top-flight party than Planned Parenthood's, as the guest list is more exclusive and the food, drink and space itself is some of the most expensive I've seen,"" Steiner explains later. He speaks with a county commissioner running for Congress and her husband, a lawyer at McGuireWoods -- another of the evening's sponsors. The party, he says, ""is about building relationships with people in business and the government."" Craig Holman is a political ethics expert whose nonpartisan nonprofit, Public Citizen, has teamed up with Steiner's organization in the party monitoring enterprise at the convention. He worries these parties play an outsized role at conventions. ""These conventions are supposed to be merely ... events to rally for these candidates,"" Holman says. ""But the lobbyists and special interest groups are indulging in a real habit of turning these conventions instead into lobby-fests."" Gillespie has a different perspective. ""The conventions are really professional conferences,"" she said, ""and like most trade associations, networking is a big part of what you are doing here."" ""Yes, the delegates are here to nominate their candidate, but behind the scenes you have a lot of local candidates trying to make connections, meet potential fundraisers and backers. That may be more important to them than the activities you see on TV.  It's hard to develop a profile for yourself and a reputation if you don't know anyone."" It's past 1 a.m. when Steiner leaves the party and heads off to another. He hears the actor and hip-hop artist Common is performing at a party within driving distance. He'd prefer not to stay out too late if possible; he's learned that a certain Super PAC is hosting a brunch at an undisclosed location in the morning. It's supposed to be at a mansion, but he doesn't know which one. At least not yet.

"(CNN)From beneath his bed, an asylum seeker types messages on a phone smuggled into Manus Island detention center in Papua New Guinea, as two friends keep watch. ""No crime to seek asylum, we are in manus jail."" He's been there for 18 months and now finds himself witness to a mass hunger strike by as many as 700 fellow asylum seekers or transferees, as they're called. He said he hasn't joined them because he fears that the respect he has in the compound means he could be singled out as a troublemaker, and that if he was taken to the medical center, he wouldn't be allowed back. He has asked not to be named. Photos sent from the mobile phone he keeps hidden from guards show dozens of hunger strikers lying bare-chested on the concrete floor of the detention compound. ""Many people fall,"" he wrote, sending an image of man lying outside on the gravel with the message: ""no power in his body."" Asylum seekers in the Australian offshore processing center have been declining food for nine days. They're protesting against the Canberra government's plans to send around 50 confirmed refugees to another facility in Lorengau, the capital of Manus Province. The first of the transfers are due to start on Thursday. Both the PNG and the Australian governments have said that the move is only temporary, and it's part of a program that will see some refugees resettled elsewhere in Papua New Guinea. Still, the asylum seekers -- and government critics -- have expressed concerns. ""It's simply moving them to a different type of accommodation, an accommodation that asylum seekers are fearful is not going to keep them safe from resentment in the local community,"" said Australian Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, an outspoken critic of the government's policy. So fearful are they of moving, some asylum seekers have resorted to self-harm. The PNG government has confirmed some have sewn their lips together, or swallowed washing powder or metal filaments from disposable razors. Authorities have not revealed how many people have been treated by medical staff at the site, and information coming from advocates and those inside the prison is difficult to confirm. ""It's extremely challenging to verify the information that we're getting,"" said Amnesty International's Graeme McGregor, who said even under normal circumstances communication for the asylum seekers is ""very limited."" On Monday afternoon, security forces ended a standoff with transferees in the Delta compound, one of four compounds at the center. The transferees had barricaded the gates so that no one could enter or leave. PNG's Foreign Affairs Minister Rimbink Pato said the standoff was resolved peacefully with no serious injury. In contrast, advocates said the compound came under ""attack"" by security forces and transferees were seen being dragged away in handcuffs. Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton on Tuesday conceded a ""degree of force"" was involved, but said the PNG government deserved praise for its professionalism in handling the situation. Earlier he accused some advocates of aggravating the situation by spreading ""false and misleading claims,"" including reports the asylum seekers were being denied food and water. ""There are no false and misleading claims and the minister can't point to any,"" said Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition in Sydney. ""Yet again, the immigration department tends to point to some unspoken, unnamed minority when it's really the government's policy that are really the driving force of the protests."" Conditions in the detention center have been the subject of criticism and complaint since it re-opened in November 2012 as the primary site for the processing of offshore asylum claims for people who arrive in Australian waters by boat. The Australian government has said the center meets international obligations. Since then, the mental health of the transferees has suffered, according to rights advocates, and relations with the local community have been damaged to the point that the men fear for their lives outside the center's perimeter. ""They've had constant threats, just last week, that they will be killed, that (locals) will settle accounts with them outside the detention center,"" Rintoul said. The worst of the threats started 12 months ago, when a 23-year-old Iranian asylum seeker, Reza Berati, was killed after days of protests erupted into violence. Dozens were injured during clashes between asylum seekers, guards and locals who entered the facility. An independent report commissioned by the government into the riot found Berati ""suffered a severe brain injury caused by a brutal beating by several assailants and died a few hours later."" Last summer, two PNG nationals were arrested, including the alleged leader of the attack who had been employed at the center. The alleged involvement of locals -- and the fact that several alleged assailants may still be at large -- has raised fears inside the detention center that they'll be targeted if not protected. The government has said security is adequate and refugees can call on the police if needed. Senator Hanson-Young visited the island before the riot, in 2013, and said even then it was clear to her that the local feeling of animosity toward the asylum seekers was ""pretty severe."" ""The local community think they're criminals in a prison. They think they are people who must have done something wrong -- and they're being told that these people are going to be living in their community,"" she said. But she said a lot of the ill feeling relates to the huge pay disparity between the local and the expat employees. ""The locals get paid $4.50 and hour, versus the $45 per hour for expats. That has always an issue of contention that has led to a lot of resentment about the facility overall,"" she said. From his contraband phone, the transferee sends more images of signs, the words written neatly in capital letters on sheets hung in the compound. ""TO AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. STOP TORTURING US.

"Sunny, warm weather embraced London on Thursday amid last-minute preparations for the Summer Olympic Games, now less than 24 hours away. Crowds cheered on the Olympic torch as it wound its way past some of the capital's most famous landmarks. The torch began its journey in Britain on May 19 at Land's End, the most southwest point of England, and trekked through more than 1,000 cities, towns and villages in the United Kingdom. By the time it reaches the Olympic Stadium, 8,000 torchbearers -- both celebrities and residents alike -- will have carried it. Early Olympic football matches continued Thursday, with men's teams playing a day after the women's teams. Torch goes past palace, Big Ben . Runners carried the golden-colored Olympic torch past iconic London landmarks Thursday as the torch relay got ever closer to the Olympic Stadium for Friday's opening ceremony. Video: Secrets leaking about Olympic Games . After the torch passed by the 300-year-old St. Paul's Cathedral, wheelchair basketball player Ade Adepitan carried the flame across the Millennium Bridge over the River Thames. Crowds joined British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife as the torch reached the doorstep of their Downing Street home. Next, the torch went past the Big Ben clock tower, carried by 81-year-old native Londoner Florence Rowe, who says she fondly remembers the excitement of the 1948 London Olympics. The last major stop was Buckingham Palace, where Prince William, his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry greeted the torchbearers. U.S. lawmakers remember Munich killings . Sixteen members of the U.S. House of Representatives held a moment of silence Thursday to honor the 11 Israeli athletes killed at the 1972 Munich Olympics and urged Olympic leaders to hold a similar moment of silence at Friday's opening ceremony. American Jewish leaders and the widow of one of the Israeli athletes have made a similar plea. The International Olympic Committee says it will honor the slain athletes at a ceremony in September for the 40th anniversary, but so far there are no plans for an official remembrance Friday. The Israeli athletes were killed after eight Palestinian terrorists disguised in track suits broke into the Olympic Village in Munich, demanding the release of 200 Arab inmates from Israeli prisons. Men's football kicks off . While the Games will officially begin with the cauldron lighting at ceremony Friday at Olympic Stadium, some events have already begun. Thursday saw the start of the men's football competition, with global favorites Spain and Brazil playing, though not against each other. Spain, which won the European Championship this year and the last World Cup, suffered a surprising 1-0 defeat to Japan in one of eight games scheduled Thursday. Spain suffer shock defeat to Japan . Brazil -- which, like Spain, is considered a likely contender to win Olympic gold -- beat Egypt 3-2. Great Britain, playing football in the Olympics for the first time since 1960, scored a 1-1 draw in its match against Senegal. Two notable absences are Argentina and the United States, neither of which qualified. WEDNESDAY RECAP: . Border guards call off strike . British border guards called off a planned strike. A strike would have been disastrous at a time when more than 100,000 people a day are arriving at London's Heathrow Airport for the Games, and adequate security continues to be a concern. Read more: Is the Olympics worth more than Google? The union representing the guards said it backed off after the government agreed to create more than 1,000 jobs in response to its demands. The Home Office, which employs border staff, said it made no concessions. North Korea walks off . Wednesday was also  a day of women's football matches. North Korea's team walked off the pitch before its clash with Colombia after the flag of neighboring country -- and archrival -- South Korea was mistakenly shown on Hampden Park's big screen as it displayed player profiles. Organizers issued a hasty apology, and the team returned to start the game an hour later. It won 2-0. ""Clearly this is a mistake, we will apologize to the team and the national Olympic committee and steps will be taken to ensure this does not happen again,"" organizers said in a statement.

In other women's football matches, Team Great Britain gave the host nation a rousing start to the festivities with a 1-0 victory over New Zealand in front of 25,000 fans -- the biggest attendance for a women's international match in Britain. Defending champion Team USA beat France 4-2. Current FIFA Women's World Cup holder Japan won its opening match against Canada 2-1, while Brazil thumped Cameroon 5-0 and Sweden beat South Africa 4-1. Greek athlete sent off . In the day's other controversy, Greek athlete Paraskevi Papachristou was expelled from the country's Olympic team for posting an offensive comment about African immigrants on Twitter. ""With so many Africans in Greece, the mosquitoes from the West Nile will at least be eating some homemade food,"" she said on Twitter. The Hellenic Olympic Committee ruled Papachristou, a triple jumper, would be barred, saying, ""She made a mistake but it was serious. It was unforgivable.""

"Two weeks before a bloody shooting rampage that killed 12 people at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater, suspect James Holmes apparently visited the cinema and took photographs of hallways and doors, a police detective testified on Wednesday. Holmes returned nine days before the massacre, Sgt. Matthew Fyles testified at the the conclusion of a preliminary court hearing, and took pictures of exterior doors. The photographs were recovered from Holmes' cell phone and go along with months of sales records and descriptions of meticulously prepared booby traps at his home. It all helps illustrate what would appear to be a well-planned attack. ""He didn't care who he killed,"" prosecutor Karen Pearson told the judge at the conclusion of her case against Holmes, saying he chose his venue carefully to cage his victims. ""He intended to kill them all."" Read more: New details emerge at hearing . The former neuroscience graduate student is charged with 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and weapons violations in the July 20 shooting that killed 12 and wounded 58. Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester said he would rule on Friday whether authorities presented enough evidence during the three-day hearing to proceed to trial. Defense attorneys, who had been expected to call witnesses and argue a diminished capacity defense, changed their minds during the hearing, attorney Dan King said. ""We have had a change of position,"" he said. ""This is neither the proper venue nor the time to put on a show or present some truncated defense."" After the hearing, some of the victims' relatives asserted that Holmes was too calculating to be afflicted with diminished capacity. ""He's not crazy one bit,"" Tom Teves told reporters Wednesday. His son Alex, 24, was among those killed. ""He's very, very cold. He's very, very calculated,"" Teves said of Holmes. ""He has a brain set that no one here can understand, and we want to call him crazy because we want to make that feel better in our society. ""But we have to accept the fact there is evil people in our society that enjoy killing any type of living thing. That doesn't make him crazy,"" Teves said. Added Jessica Watts, cousin of Jonathan Blunk, also killed in the theater: ""It was complete planning. It was competency. It was everything on his part to make sure that this act was carried out from start to finish."" Before wrapping up, prosecutors asked Fyles to display other photos taken from Holmes' phone, including shots of improvised explosives under construction in his kitchen on July 16 and disturbing images of the suspect, his red hair curling out from beneath the black watch cap prosecutors say he wore to the theater. In one image, he is sticking out his tongue and wearing contact lenses that render his eyes utterly black. In another, he holds a firework that resembles the spherical bombs so prevalent in cartoons. He appears to be whistling in the photo. The pictures were taken July 19, the same day authorities say Holmes headed to the theater to begin his rampage shortly after midnight on July 20. Holmes could be seen smiling slightly as the photographs were displayed. According to hearing testimony, here is what is known about his alleged preparations: . Getting ready . Holmes began buying guns in May, supervisory agent Steve Beggs of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives testified on Tuesday. Beggs said he built an arsenal of two Glock handguns, an AR-15 rifle, a shotgun and 6,295 rounds of ammunition. Among other purchases, Beggs said Holmes bought two 6-ounce tear gas grenades over the Internet on May 10 and he went to a gun store on May 22 to buy one of his Glocks. A little more than a month later, on July 1, a video camera captured Holmes as he bought a scope, a mount and some inert ammunition at a Colorado gun store, Beggs said. In the video, Beggs said, Holmes' hair is dyed bright orange. Four days later -- July 5 -- Holmes apparently visited the theater and used his iPhone to take pictures of interior doorways, Fyles testified . On July 7, Holmes used an online ticketing service to buy a ticket for the midnight showing of the movie, according to Detective Craig Appel, the lead investigator in the case. He then returned to the theater two days later to take pictures of exterior doorways, Fyles testified. Read more: Remembering the victims . The apartment . Witnesses detailed preparations that prosecutors believe Holmes made before setting out for the theater to turn his sparsely decorated Aurora apartment into a deathtrap. At least some of the preparations were well under way by July 16, based on a photograph from Holmes' phone shown by prosecutors. In it, jars, wires, firework shells and other bomb-making materials are laid out in his kitchen. By the time Holmes left, the carpet in his apartment had been soaked in oil and gas, FBI bomb technician Garrett Gumbinner testified. A container of glycerin hung above a frying pan with a potassium mixture, attached to a trip wire that would tip the glycerin into the pan, Gumbinner testified. If triggered, Gumbinner said it would have set off an explosion and fire, igniting jars of homemade napalm spiked with bullets and thermite -- a metallic substance that burns so hot it is nearly impossible to extinguish. In a diabolical twist that seems ripped from the pages of a comic book, witnesses said Holmes also rigged his computer and a boom box placed outside to begin playing loud music after he set out for the theater -- apparently in hopes that the noise would prompt someone to investigate and trigger the explosives. Next to the boom box outside his apartment, Gumbinner testified, Holmes said he placed a toy car and a device that looked like it would control the car but would in fact set off the explosives. Authorities recovered the boom box, bearing Holmes' fingerprints. The remote-control car device was never found, Appel testified. A series of disturbing self-portraits displayed in court, apparently made sometime before Holmes allegedly left for the theater, according to data retrieved from his phone, show him in the eye-blackening contacts, his tongue stuck out in one, flashing a toothy grin and a handgun in another. The shooting . Video from the theater shows a man they say is Holmes -- wearing dark pants, a light-colored shirt and a dark stocking cap covering his orange hair -- entering the multiplex before the movie begins. The recordings show him going into Theater No. 9, a different theater from the one listed on his ticket. While witnesses have not detailed in this week's preliminary hearing what investigators believe Holmes did once inside the theater, sources have said they believe he propped open the theater's back door and went to his car to put on body armor and arm himself. Authorities believe Holmes then re-entered the theater, tossing gas canisters before opening fire about 18 minutes into the movie, according to sources. Witnesses who have spoken to CNN about the shooting have said the gunman roamed the theater, shooting people randomly as they tried to scramble away or cowered between seats. Aurora survivors: How they're doing . Among the 41 calls to 911, one stands out. In the 27-second call, the sounds of at least 30 shots ring out amid the chaos. At some point, according to Pearson, one of Holmes' weapons jammed. ""Had the AR-15 not jammed, he would have killed more people,"" she said. Investigators found 76 shell casings in the auditorium. Most of the spent rounds -- 65 -- were .223 caliber rifle rounds, six were shotgun shells and five were .40 caliber rounds from the Glocks, Appel said. Police also found one of the tear-gas canisters inside the theater, Appel said. Also located was a large drum magazine for the rifle that appeared to have jammed, Sgt. Gerald Jonsgaard testified Monday. The rifle cartridges were steel-core rounds, which are more likely to pass through a body intact and can cause multiple wounds, Fyles testified. The movie theater's video system didn't capture anything from inside the theater but did capture the aftermath -- streams of terrified patrons running from the theater. On Monday, police who were first to arrive described an eerie scene, stepping into a movie theater with ""Batman"" still blaring from the screen, blood from badly wounded victims flowing in the aisles and cell phones ringing over and over again, without answer. Outside, the first officer to encounter Holmes -- who was still dressed in body armor, a helmet and a gas mask as he stood near his car -- described him as unnaturally relaxed.  In fact, from Holmes' appearance, Officer Jason Oviatt thought he was a fellow police officer. A trail of blood led from the theater. The rifle that authorities believe Holmes used in the attack lay on the ground near the building. Holmes was just standing there, Oviatt testified Monday. ""He seemed very detached from it all,"" Oviatt said. Holmes, his pupils dilated, sweating and smelly, didn't struggle or even tense his muscles as he was dragged away to be searched, Oviatt said. Police would cut off the body armor he wore and learn from him about the explosive booby-trap at his home. The interrogation . Police described a strange scene in the interrogation room -- Holmes sitting in his underwear, T-shirt and white socks after police had had cut away his body armor -- making puppets of the paper bags officers had placed over his hands to preserve gunpowder evidence, according to Appel. Holmes played with his polystyrene drinking cup as if it were a piece in a game. Appel said. Then he removed a staple from the table and tried to stick it in an electrical outlet, the detective testified. Asked by a defense attorney whether he had ordered a blood test for Holmes, Appel said he had not. ""There were no indications that he was under the influence of anything,"" he said.

"The extremist Sunni militants sweeping across Iraq may have a singular goal, but there's a broad coalition of recruits from outside of the Middle East willing to help them achieve it. The so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, wants to establish an Islamic state stretching from northern Syria into Iraq. And as the brutal terror group racks up victory after victory on the battlefield, more foreign fighters are considering joining their ranks. Who are they? Three young men we spoke to have traveled to Syria to answer the call to jihad. They agreed to speak to us from the northwestern city of Idlib over Skype, provided we masked their identities and didn't use their real names. Abu Anwar, as he asked to be called, is 25 years old and from Britain. ""I'm from the south of England. I grew up in a middle class family,"" he told us. ""Life was easy back home. I had a life. I had a car. But the thing is: You cannot practice Islam back home. We see all around us evil. We see pedophiles. We see homosexuality. We see crime. We see rape."" SEE MAPS: Where ISIS has taken over in Iraq . We spoke with Abu and his friends as so many of these young men do: online. Their posts, many featuring photos of them posing with guns, attempt to make jihad sound cool. And this is a big draw to many youngsters who want to be part of this war, but have little or no combat experience. ISIS claims to be fighting for justice, but in reality their campaign is about brutality. The group has committed massacres and acts of terror so extreme -- including a recent boast about executing Iraqi soldiers in cold blood -- that even al Qaeda has disavowed them. I asked Abu if his family knows what he's doing in Syria. ""They are not happy with me being here. But when I give them Dawa (their interpretation of Islam), they see the reality, they hear the reality from me that they don't hear from the BBC,"" he replied, after a pause. There are thousands like Abu from all across Europe in Syria and Iraq, according to some estimates. The Soufan group, a security consulting firm, believes there are around 700 from France, 800 from Russia and almost 300 from Britain. But these figures relate to people analysts have been able to track, and the true numbers may be even higher. And as ISIS's onslaught in Iraq grows, there are fears even more foreigners will be drawn to fight. Last month, U.S. officials said Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, a 22-year-old American known as Abu Hurayra Al-Amriki, drove a truck full of explosives into a Syrian army position and detonated it, killing himself in the process. Abu says he was a friend of Abu Hurayra's, and that they ""clicked immediately"" after they met to discuss their shared ideology. ""He was the best person I have ever met in my life. He had the best character,"" Abu said. ""Abu Hurayra believed this would allow him to go in and kill many of the enemy, including himself. He wanted this more than a bullet. He told me, 'If I go on this martyrdom mission, don't go back to England. Ask Allah to keep you on this path.'"" We asked Abu Anwar what Abu Hurayra told him before he carried out the suicide attack. ""He told me to just pray that Allah accepts me as a martyr,"" Abu told us. ""He told me first that he wants this so much and we have many stories of this people who are in these kind of operations, where they've survived the explosion. And on the radio before he detonated the bomb he said, 'I see paradise and I can smell paradise.' This was seconds before he blew himself up."" Abu, inspired by his friend, said he too wants to carry out a suicide attack -- what he calls a martyrdom mission. But when asked if he would return to Britain to carry out an attack, he said no. ""If I come back home, it will be when the black flag of Islam is flying over Downing Street,"" he said. ""I know some people have the intention of come back to do attacks. But me personally, I only have the intention of coming back as a conqueror."" Abu said his family is not aware of his plan to carry out a ""martyr mission,"" but when his time comes to carry out the attack, he said he'll inform them. For now, Abu insisted that the immediate goal is to establish a caliphate in Syria and Iraq. When I asked if he would now take up arms with ISIS, he said he was considering it. For Abu and others like him, the call to jihad is seemingly too strong to resist. READ MORE: Will Kurds break free from Iraq? READ MORE: Why West must ignore Iraq's pleas .

"(CNN)Throngs of mourners gathered in Mecca early Friday just hours after Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al Saud died. He was 90. Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz was appointed as the new king, state television reported.​ . The announcement of Abdullah's death comes several weeks after the state-run Saudi Press Agency said he was suffering from pneumonia and had been admitted to the hospital. Services will be held Friday afternoon at the Imam Turki Bin Abdullah Grand Mosque in Riyadh, and many world leaders are likely to pay their respects. Jordan's King Abdullah cut short his visit to Davos, and is heading to Riyadh, according to a Jordanian government source. ""King Abdullah's life spanned from before the birth of modern Saudi Arabia through its emergence as a critical force within the global economy and a leader among Arab and Islamic nations,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement. He praised Abdullah's role in sponsoring the Arab Peace Initiative, which attempts to solve the long-simmering conflict between Israel and Palestine. ""This is a sad day. The United States has lost a friend, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and the world has lost a revered leader,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. ""He was so proud of the Kingdom's journey, a brave partner in fighting violent extremism who proved just as important as a proponent of peace."" King Abdullah became king of the oil-rich nation, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, in August 2005. But he had been running Saudi Arabia since 1996, after his half-brother King Fahd's stroke. In the context of the kingdom's conservative circles, Abdullah was seen as reformer and often came up against the more hard-line clerics. Since ascending to the throne, Abdullah took steps toward broader freedoms and invested some of the country's vast oil wealth in large-scale education and infrastructure projects. ""He was really quite (an) extraordinary figure. He was probably the most progressive and liberal minded king of Saudi Arabia since King Faisal, which is a long time ago, in the early 1970s,"" CNN's Fareed Zakaria said about Abdullah, who he described as ""much loved."" ""I had the opportunity to meet with him once and what you got a sense of was somebody who really was determined to move his country forward,"" Zakaria said. ""It's a conservative country and a conservative society -- and he kept emphasizing that to me -- but he was very clear in the direction he wanted to go."" However, resistance from conservative factions hindered some of his efforts, leaving many women in particular disappointed by a lack of progress toward greater independence. Under Abdullah's leadership, the country slowly squashed al Qaeda, capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom, forcing the remnants underground and sidelining radical preachers. It also took a more prominent role in international affairs. Last year, it became the lead Arab nation in a U.S.-led coalition to eradicate the ultraradical ISIS group in Iraq and Syria. Analysts are predicting a smooth political transition despite the many challenges facing Saudi Arabia, including Iran, the rise of ISIS, the crisis in Yemen, and the drop in oil prices. Saudi Arabia has 16% of the world's known oil reserves, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The country is widely seen as the leader of OPEC and has a large influence on energy prices and political stability in the Middle East. ""Remember, the last time the price of oil fell like this, the Soviet Union collapsed,"" said Zakaria. ""That said, the successor is a very competent man."" He added: ""I don't expect any major shift, but it marks a big change, and we'll have to see what the new king is like."" People we've lost in 2015 .

"Oregon will not defend the state's same-sex marriage ban in court because the law would not stand up to a federal constitutional challenge, the state's attorney general said Thursday. However, Ellen Rosenblum said in legal documents that  the state is legally obligated to enforce the state's ban on same-sex marriage while a federal lawsuit is litigated. Oregon filed the documents in response to the lawsuit challenging the ban. Oregon voters passed Measure 36 in 2004, which amended the state's Constitution to define marriage as between one man and a woman. In 2013, the state's chief operating officer directed state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages that were legally performed in other states. Thursday's response ended  by saying the state will not defend the Oregon ban on same-sex marriage because it ""cannot withstand a federal constitutional challenge under any standard of review."" Meanwhile, Rosenblum said officials are legally obligated to enforce the ban until the court makes a ruling.","Oregon won't fight for same-sex marriage ban in federal lawsuit .

"(CNN)Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight is facing a possible murder charge after allegedly running over two men, killing one, following an argument in Compton, California, according to authorities. ""So far, people we talked to said it looked like it was an intentional act. So we're handling it as a homicide,"" Los Angeles police Lt. John Corina said before the arrest. Knight, 49, turned himself in to Los Angeles Sheriff's Department investigators early Friday. He's being held in lieu of about a $2 million bond pending a court appearance, which isn't expected until at least Monday, according to Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. CNN affiliate KCAL-TV and the Los Angeles Times quoted Knight's attorney, James Blatt, as saying Knight feared for his life and was trying to flee when the incident happened. ""We feel strongly Mr. Knight did not do anything wrong in this matter. He was attacked by a number of individuals, that has already been corroborated by certain witnesses. He left the scene because he was in fear for his safety and life,"" he said. In a conversation with CNN before the arrest, Blatt declined to confirm to CNN whether Knight was driving. Blatt hasn't returned multiple calls from CNN seeking comment since the arrest. The Thursday incident allegedly began with an argument on the set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. It then spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers, where authorities say Knight tracked the men. ""It looks like he drove backward and struck the victims. And then went forward and struck them again as he left,"" Corina said. Officers later found Knight's Ford Raptor abandoned in Westwood. Knight turned himself in early Friday at the West Hollywood Sheriff's Station, accompanied by his attorney. After being questioned by detectives, Knight was booked and later transferred to the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles, according to jail records. The man who died has been identified as Terry Carter, 55. The second man's name is Cle Sloan, 51. Knight founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991. He signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (since then known as Snoop Dogg and Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur, raising the profile of West Coast rap in the process. Along with rapper, producer and future entrepreneur Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young, he rode the wave of the fame from albums such as Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"" in 1992. In 1993, Snoop Dogg's debut album, ""Doggystyle,"" broke new ground in a genre of music previously dominated by East Coast artists. Knight's signing of controversial rapper Tupac Shakur in the mid-'90s further increased the profiles of both Knight and his company in the hip-hop game. But with his imposing physique and reputation for not being averse to violence, Knight also found himself at the center of a feud between East Coast and West Coast rappers. The feud started as a war of words between rappers from each coast, but things quickly escalated in 1994 after Shakur accused producer Sean ""Puffy"" Combs and rapper Christopher ""Biggie Smalls"" Wallace of involvement in a 1994 shooting at a New York studio that left Shakur injured. Both Combs  -- who over the years has also been known as ""Puff Daddy,"" ""Diddy and ""P. Diddy"" -- and Wallace denied the accusations. The tensions intensified in 1995 after Knight gave a speech at the Source Awards, where he said, ""Any artist out there that want to be an artist and stay a star, and don't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos, all on the record, dancing ... come to Death Row!"" Many took the statement as a direct dig at Combs, who often appeared in his artists' music videos. Some have pointed to the feud as a contributing factor in the shooting deaths of both Shakur in 1996 and Wallace in 1997. Both slayings remain unsolved. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two others were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards. In October, he was busted along with comedian Micah ""Katt"" Williams for allegedly stealing a photographer's camera. Who is Suge Knight? Stories behind tough hip-hop legend .

Police say Knight drove over two men with his red pickup .
""We're handling it as a homicide,"" says Lt. John Corina ."
"The security camera footage broadcast by CNN shows a grisly scene: a black man in Jackson, Mississippi, being fatally run over by a pickup truck after he was viciously beaten in a motel parking lot on a Sunday morning in June. Prosecutors say a group of white teens chose the man at random. They say the alleged ringleader, an 18-year-old now charged with murder, laughed about it afterward and boasted in a phone conversation about how he ""ran that n----- over."" When we're confronted with such a shocking act of violence, we search for answers. We want to know what's in the hearts and minds of the attackers. We wonder what motivates someone to extinguish a life for no other reason than the color of the person's skin. And, in an odd way, some people take comfort in the fact that it happened in Mississippi, with its legacy of Jim Crow segregation and terrorism aimed at the African-American community. We want to see the crime as simply a reflection of a Deep South state still haunted by its racist past -- something that couldn't happen in other parts of this country. It's wishful thinking. In Patchogue, New York, Marcelo Lucero, a 37-year-old Ecuadorian immigrant, was stabbed to death in 2008 when he was attacked by a gang of  white teens who decided to hunt down and attack Latinos for sport -- or as they called it, ""beaner hopping."" In Huntington Beach, California, three men and a woman with white supremacist tattoos went into a predominantly Latino neighborhood on July 3, 2009, looking for a ""nonwhite"" to hurt. They attacked a Latino man in an alley. Yelling racial slurs, they reportedly stabbed him three times. In West Allis, Wisconsin, the opening night of the state fair this month turned to mayhem when dozens of black youths began attacking white people. A 16-year-old boy detained by police said he and others attacked white people because they were ""easy targets,"" according to The Christian Science Monitor. We can't pretend that what happened in Mississippi that June morning couldn't happen elsewhere. It already has, and it will again. The social fabric in our country is fragile, and the fault lines are often defined by race. Our communities and schools are increasingly segregated. Globalization and our economic woes are leaving many young people without hope for the future. And we're seeing a backlash against the nation's changing ethnic makeup. All of this provides fertile ground for bigotry and violence to take root and flourish. Meanwhile, our political system seems paralyzed, incapable of protecting the interests of working people, much less pulling us together. Messages of hate and bigotry can be found not only on the fringes of our society but virtually nonstop on television, talk radio and the Internet, where certain groups of people are demonized and held up as scapegoats for our problems. Too many of our politicians pour fuel on the fire by exploiting divisions in our society -- fostering an us-versus-them mentality and casting entire groups of people as ""the other."" Despite the promise of the Obama presidency, it's time to realize we're not living in a ""post-racial"" society. It's time to speak out against bigotry and to call out those in public life who encourage hate and violence with their words. And it's time to invest in the future of our nation and its youth -- to provide hope and opportunity to the next generation. Our future depends on it.

"Nearly 800,000 Hong Kongers have done something China's 1.3 billion people can only dream of: cast a ballot to demand a democratic government. In an unofficial referendum organized by pro-democracy activists and denounced by Chinese authorities, 787,767 people in the city of more than seven million have called for the right to directly elect their next leader. But Beijing has insisted Hong Kong politics stays in line with Chinese rule, paving the way for a showdown in the city. Who are the activists? Occupy Central is a pro-democracy group founded in 2013. Their goal is to allow the Hong Kong public to elect its next leader without strings attached. If the Hong Kong government doesn't eventually give the public more voting rights, Occupy Central has threatened to ""occupy"" Central district, the city's financial hub, with a sit-in that would disrupt businesses and block traffic. How is Hong Kong governed now? Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, with its own executive, legislature, and judiciary. A former British colony, the city was returned to Chinese control in 1997. But before the handover, China and the United Kingdom signed an agreement giving Hong Kong a ""high degree of autonomy"" for 50 years after its return to China. This enshrined a principle known as ""one country, two systems"" in a constitutional document called the Basic Law. A few weeks ago, the Chinese government released a strongly-worded white paper that said Hong Kong does not have ""full autonomy"" and asserted that ultimate power over the city lay with Beijing. But many pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong see this as a violation of ""one country, two systems."" Currently, Hong Kong's leader, known as the chief executive, is elected by a small committee. In 2012, this committee selected Leung Chun-ying, a staunch Beijing choice, who remains in power today. What's the referendum all about? The Hong Kong government has promised residents they will be able to vote for their own leader by 2017, but here's the catch: Beijing says it will only allow candidates who ""love China."" Occupy Central responded by organizing an unofficial city-wide referendum, which asked people to choose between three ways to reform Hong Kong's voting system. All three plans proposed that candidates be nominated publicly, regardless of whether the candidates have Beijing's blessing. To put it simply, anyone who voted in the referendum essentially said they wanted to have their own say in Hong Kong's political future. What were the results? The 10-day voting period began June 20 and asked voters to choose between one of three proposals to reform the city's election process. Organizers had expected only 100,000 votes for what was originally just a two-day voting period. The final tally of valid ballots cast came to 787,767, with 42% going towards a proposal from the Alliance for True Democracy that said candidates for Hong Kong's chief executive should be nominated by the public, and conditions such as requiring candidates to ""love China, love Hong Kong"" should not be allowed. Activists say the large overall turnout is a clear indicator of Hong Kong's discontent with Chinese government policies. ""Whatever Beijing may say in public now I think it can hardly afford to ignore the voices of 780,000 Hong Kong people,"" Anson Chan, former Chief Secretary of Hong Kong told CNN.

China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office declared the unofficial referendum to be ""unlawful."" In an editorial published June 23, the state-run Global Times called it an ""illegal farce."" The next day, another editorial accused activists of sowing ""hatred."" Hong Kong's Beijing-backed chief executive has said none of the proposals being voted are legal. However, he has also said that none of the voters will face criminal consequences. Meanwhile, China's censorship machine has been active on the issue. Internet searches for ""Occupy Central"" were completely blocked within mainland China, while searches for Hong Kong-related topics were among the most heavily censored, according to Chinese social media visualizer Weiboscope. As voting went underway, newscast signals from Hong Kong were also reportedly blacked out in China's neighboring Guangdong province, where Chinese residents normally enjoy access to Hong Kong TV. Organizers of the referendum also claim their website has been hit by significant cyberattacks, though it is unclear where the attacks may have originated from. What about the sit-in? If the Hong Kong government doesn't reform its electoral system in line with what Occupy Central is asking for, the group says it will marshal 10,000 people to sit and peacefully block traffic in downtown Hong Kong as a way to pressure Beijing into allowing Hong Kong to exercise ""genuine universal suffrage."" Given Beijing's uncompromising response to the referendum so far, it seems Occupy Central's activities are increasingly likely to occur. But nobody knows how much disruption the protest may cause. Hong Kong's security chief has warned the protest could turn violent, and ""things could get out of control."" Others have warned that Occupy Central could disrupt Hong Kong's typically stable economy. What else is going on? It's been a month of political activism in the city. A 25th anniversary vigil for the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown victims drew around 100,000 people, and the subsequent release of Beijing's white paper only riled up the city's politically-minded residents even further. On July 1, Hong Kongers will stage an annual pro-democracy protest march. The turnout is expected to be huge. We could be seeing tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people. Later, Occupy Central reportedly plans to organize a follow-up referendum, which will give voters a choice between the most popular reform solution, and the government's proposal.

"Mexico's government is trying to block the execution of a convicted cop killer in Texas this week, arguing that it would violate international law. The case of Mexican citizen Edgar Tamayo Arias is the latest battle in a dispute over the rights of the foreign-born on American death rows. And U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has said it could put Americans abroad at risk. Tamayo, 46, was convicted in the 1994 murder of a Houston police officer, whom he shot three times in the back of the head, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. His attorneys are scheduled to present oral arguments Tuesday, calling for a preliminary injunction to stop the state's governor and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles from considering Tamayo's clemency petition until the process is ""adequate and fair,"" read a statement from his team. Mexico's Foreign Ministry said Sunday that going ahead with Arias' execution by injection, scheduled for Wednesday, would violate international law because Tamayo wasn't advised of his right to receive consular assistance. This isn't the first time Mexico has stepped in to try to stop the execution of one of its citizens. Mexican officials made similar arguments -- unsuccessfully -- before executions in 2008 and 2011. ""The Mexican government is opposed to the death penalty and has decided to use the necessary resources to protect its citizens who are in danger of receiving this sentence,"" the ministry said. Kerry has also weighed in on Tamayo's case, arguing that setting an execution date is ""extremely detrimental to the interests of the United States."" ""I want to be clear: I have no reason to doubt the facts of Mr. Tamayo's conviction, and as a former prosecutor, I have no sympathy for anyone who would murder a police officer,"" Kerry wrote. ""This is a process issue I am raising because it could impact the way American citizens are treated in other countries."" In a response to Kerry, Texas Deputy Attorney General Don Clemmer said he would meet with representatives from the Justice Department and the State Department over the matter. The International Court of Justice ruled in 2004 that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the treaty that lays out rights of people detained in other nations, in the cases of dozens of Mexican nationals. The judges ordered the United States to provide ""review and reconsideration"" of the sentences and convictions of those Mexican prisoners as a result. Mexico's Foreign Ministry argues that hasn't happened in Tamayo's case. It's a case Tamayo's lawyer had made as well in attempts to stay his execution. ""The Mexican Foreign minister, the U.S. Secretary of State, evangelical and Latino leaders, former Texas Gov. Mark White and legal and international organizations have called on the The Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles and Gov. (Rick) Perry to halt the execution of Mr. Tamayo based on the violation of his consular rights, yet the Texas Board of Pardons has refused to even meet to discuss Mr. Tamayo's clemency petition,"" attorney Sandra Babcock said in a statement. ""Mr. Tamayo was never informed of his treaty rights at the time of his arrest, and no court has agreed to review that treaty violation and the consequences that it had for his conviction and sentence,"" she told CNN affiliate KTRK. Prosecutors have disputed that argument. ""Since 1994, this case has gone to all the courts that it can possibly go to -- the state courts, the federal courts,"" Roe Wilson, assistant district attorney in Harris County, Texas, told KTRK. ""It has been reviewed.""","Defense attorneys are expected to present oral arguments Tuesday .
